0,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Francis Collins comes across as such a nice guy! He's clearly a very good molecular biologist - he led the Human Genome Project to a successful conclusion, no mean feat - and he has strong Christian ideals that he's thought about a lot and tried hard to realize in practice. Here, he outlines his philosophy, a kind of theistic evolutionary creed which he calls BioLogos. It's intended to combine his scientific and religious beliefs into a harmonious whole; although it appears to work for him, I remain unimpressed, and I fear that both sides of the faith/science divide are going to see him as what Richard Dawkins memorably described as a ""compliant quisling"". But more about that shortly.The core message of BioLogos is that God created the universe in order for it to contain living beings with souls - us, and any other sentient creatures that may happen to exist - and cares deeply about His people. As you can see, for example, in Martin Rees's Just Six Numbers and Before the Beginning, the idea that the universe was designed is right now perfectly respectable, though I thought Collins's cosmological arguments were on the superficial side. In particular, he in no way gives proper consideration to the multiverse theory that Rees prefers; though the comparison with Dawkins's The God Delusion is amusing, Dawkins doing the exact opposite and dismissing the design theory in equally summary fashion. It would be nice to see a balanced presentation here some time. At any rate, the modern Argument from Design in terms of fine tuning of the universe's physical constants is one of the main planks of Collins's argument to the non-believers.The other key component is derived from C.S. Lewis (Collins is a huge admirer), and is based on universal ethical norms, altruism, and the human hunger for religion which, Collins claims, can be observed in all cultures. If God doesn't exist, why do we all feel a need for Him, and why do we all agree on the important issues about what constitutes the difference between right and wrong? Here, again, I felt that Collins was on shaky ground, and the reasoning did not convince me. Many people have tried to explain the emergence of altruistic behavior in humans using an evolutionary perspective, but these ideas are hardly discussed at all, and there is almost no comparison with other social species. Yes, it's probably relevant that ants and bees are haplodiploid, and humans aren't, so ""altruistic"" behavior of insects may be misleading; but naked mole rats, which are not mentioned, are also a social species, and they are not haplodiploid. So the first third of the book was disappointing, but it picked up again when Collins turned around and started explaining to the creationists and Intelligent Design people why their criticisms of evolutionary theory were misguided. This part was excellent, and if you want an authoritative dismantling of ID I have never seen it done better. Collins first explains the holes in the often-quoted ""flagellum"" argument, showing how the bacterial flagellum could indeed have been created by evolution; he then quotes St. Augustine and other luminaries of the Church on the dangers of Christianity making itself look ridiculous by trying to maintain logically untenable positions. He does his best to sweeten the pill, emphasizing that he respects the motives that have led people to believe in ID, but I can't think that many of them like it. Indeed, he describes talks he's given to American Christian audiences where he's tried to explain this stuff, and people often leave the room before he's got properly started. I can see why.At the end, he tries to wrap it all up in his vision of BioLogos. Christians, be reasonable and admit that evolution is a simple fact that reveals God's power and glory with even greater clarity! Scientists, look into your hearts and admit how much you want to feel His love! I fear very few people on either side are buying it. But, blessed are the peacemakers, and Dr. Collins is doing his damnedest to spread peace and understanding. Who knows, maybe it will do some good in the long run.__________________________________I just have to include this wonderfully snarky quote from Russell's Science and Religion. Despite being written several decades before Collins was born, it is a perfect comment on his book:Sir J. Arthur Thomson, as we saw, maintained that science is incomplete because it cannot answer the question why? Religion, he thought, can answer it. Why were stars formed? Why did the sun give birth to planets? Why did the earth cool, and at last give rise to life? Because, in the end, something admirable was going to result -- I am not quite sure what, but I believe it was scientific theologians and religiously-minded scientists."
1,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/612579-ellis,5,"This book was Fantastic. If it were up to me, this book would be required reading for every college freshman or senior in high school. I listened to Dr. Collins speak at last year’s scientific sessions of the American Diabetes Association. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to listen to the head of the international group responsible for sequencing the human genome. I was impressed with his clear forward-thinking mind. Probably because I'd heard Dr. Collins speak, knew his work, and had a very good impression of him, I was a little dismayed when I saw the title of his book. I thought maybe he was a little off track. Personally, science hasn't shown me anything that confirms, OR DENIES, the existence of God. I figured I had to read his book just to see what he had to say on the matter. Fortunately, I was more than pleasantly surprised to find what this book contained. This book isn't an attempt to use scientific knowledge and proofs to demonstrate that God exists, but it contains a very beautifully laid out reconciliation of religion and science. (Reconciliation is really a terrible term, because religion and science never have been at odds. Unfortunately, some religious people have attacked science because they felt threatened by its findings and chose to fear it rather than understand it. Likewise, some people thought that scientific theories, such as the Big Bang and the evolution of species, proved that God didn't exist. Anyway, some people have wrongly put science and religion at odds when, in fact, there was no need for the two to be mutually exclusive. All truth is good for man: whatever its source.) I was extremely surprised to find in this book the nearly exact conclusion I have come to after years of considering how the scientific theories on the origin of the universe, the origin of man, and of religion may fit together. I struggled over these issues for a long time, because I felt that it was my duty to not ignore two seemingly incompatible (big bang/evolution and man created by God in his image) things that I knew (as strongly as a scientist can ever claim to ""know"" that a theory actually represents reality) to be true. I knew that it wouldn't be right to reject either of these truths because it was inconvenient to have them together. This conundrum caused me to spend plenty of time thinking about this issue. Thus, I was very surprised to see that Collins had come up with basically the exact same conclusions that I had come to. (In fact, this is exactly the book I would have written on the subject if I just weren’t so lazy and had the ability.) Did this happen because the world-renowned scientist, Francis Collins, and I are on the same intellectual playing field? No, unfortunately no... I think that we came to the same conclusions because if one puts him/herself to thinking on the matter for long enough and uses the best material to aid in the process, then the conclusion comes very naturally and logically. I would suggest that everyone read this book. There is no contention between science and religion. Science and religion have no disagreement or incongruities on how man came to live on earth. Of course, the most important thing to remember is that it doesn't matter how man came to earth, but why man is on earth and what we do while here. However, understanding how this process occurred is extremely interesting and gives me so much more appreciation for the creation of mankind than the traditional ""poof theory"" that many cling to tightly with eyes and ears closed to avoid being tainted by scientific theory. (Oh yes, and thank you very much, Dr. Collins, for spending appropriate time on what it means for something to be a scientific theory.) This book is very stimulating and satisfying to the scientist because shows that religion need not be discarded because of scientific theory, and to the religious person because it shows that the greatest and most proven and unifying scientific theories need not be discarded to protect religious beliefs."
2,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/144067-heather,2,"Let me preface this review by saying that I read this book as part of a discussion with my intelligent and faithful (not to mention extremely good looking - its a genetic thing) family members, who are open-minded to both science and religion. I hope that I can be likewise. They asked me for my sincere opinion about this book, and here is the result of that request. If they write a review, I will provide a link to it.Collins seems like an intelligent, decent person with a sincere desire to help people overcome dissidence between two ways of understanding the world: science and religion. I admire his sentiments, and I appreciate any calm voice that enters the debate. He provides a nice summary of the evidence for evolution, and is obviously a highly qualified scientist (e.g. he was project manager for the human genome project). I rate it as only OK because I found his arguments unconvincing. Here's why: 1) Collins did not provide data supporting the existence of a universal moral law, a law which he felt deserves the title of law, just like the law of gravity. He instead assumed that we would all agree that there is an absolute moral law that persists across time and cultural boundaries. While I imagine there are consistent moral codes, I would like a better description of what those are, especially if one is going to use that as the main support for one's belief in God. He cites the attributes of fairness and altruism, but doesn't define those terms well, nor does he describe their distribution within and among cultures. Those data are out there. 2) So let's say there is a moral ""law"", and it is reliable and persistent as any real law should be (a huge assumption). How can it be explained? While he belittled a ""God-In-The-Gaps"" approach to the study of creation/evolution, Collins advocated that approach for the study of human behavior. He invoked the existence of a supernatural power to explain the existence of morality in humans. His argument seemed to be that since science couldn't explain it (an argument that wasn't very strong, in my opinion), God must have given humans morality. 3) His other arguments for God include a distinct beginning to the universe (the big bang), and a hefty set of universal constants, constants that he finds extremely improbable without an intelligent creator. The distinct beginning struck me as an idea consistent with his conception of God, but not really evidence for his conception of God. In the case of the universal constants, Collins is committing the same errors he accuses the proponents of intelligent design of using. Proponents of Intelligent Design claim that there are some parts of living things that are so complex that natural selection on random mutations (i.e. evolution) could not have made them. These parts (such as the complex eye and the bacterial flagellum) indicate an Intelligent Designer. Likewise, Collins says that the development of so many universal constants is so improbable, that they provide evidence for an intelligent designer. As he said about Intelligent Design, this is another ""God-In-The-Gaps"" argument, one that is in danger of being explained by science as our knowledge progresses. In short, Collins' use of the word evidence in the subtitle is premature. As the religions I am most familiar with would attest, belief in a supernatural being is ultimately a matter not of natural evidence, but of revelation. Therefore belief in that supernatural being comes down to a person's willingness to accept revelation, whether it be through scripture or prayer, as a valid way of understanding the world. Natural phenomena can be considered consistent with ones conception of the Almighty, but not the ultimate evidence for God."
3,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61001-anand-patel,2,"I have no doubt in the sincerity of Dr. Collins's beliefs, but I found this book insufferable. I picked it up at the store, hoping to catch a glimpse of how an established (and wildly successful) scientist reconciles his faith with the tradition of scientific rationalism. Instead, I found a lot of C.S. Lewis fan-dom mixed with a clumsy rehashing of pretty tired theological arguments hinging on a mysterious intrinsic ""Moral Law"". To be honest, it reads like Collins is trying to convince himself more than the reader. In retrospect, I think it'd been more worthwhile to have skipped this book and jump into ""Mere Christianity"" and whatever the latest Richard Dawkins/Christopher Hitchens book is. Reading (and suffering) through this book did make me wonder if it's at all possible to honestly be both a scientist and a spiritual person. Ironically, before I read this book I would've said maybe, but now I think I have to say no. A career as a scientist necessarily requires a dedication to rational observation, and most importantly, the flexibility to change models to incorporate new information. Religion (at least organized religion) requires a rigid flexibility to fixed beliefs. In other words, as Collins describes it, science is an inherently humbling study - somebody, someday will find a clever exception to your work, and these acts (with time) are the stuff of legend. There aren't ""paradigm shifts"" (it pains me to use that buzzword) in religion - I mean, how can ""eternal truth"" be mutable? Personally, for me, the most troubling part of religion is that at its core, it reads like an exercise in vanity - no matter what other people say, the key endpoint of religion is to stratify people - some people will get rewarded (whether that's enlightenment, heaven, ...) while other won't (reincarnation, hell). "
4,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651773-david,1,"This is a long review, so here’s the shorter version first. There are atheists who believe science is inconsistent with religious belief. There are religious people who don’t believe in science. There are religious people who do believe in science, compartmentalizing the two and judging them by different standards. Okay, fine. I don’t want group two allowed on any boards of education, but aside from that, fine. Collins is in group three, but the thing that really irritates me is that he won’t admit he’s in group three. He thinks he’s in group four, people who have completely and logically reconciled science and religion. This book is a very smart guy arguing for group four, and is completely embarrassing, because he can’t do it without getting tangled up in logical fallacies and misinterpretation of evidence. As far as I can tell, he never really thought about religion for a long time, and then the first time he read anything erudite and well-written on the subject (C.S. Lewis’ Mere Christianity), he said, that makes sense, and froze his brain there. New input is not fully processed anymore.I like that he, and people like him, like science. But I really wish they would just admit that their faith is irrational and not empirical, and then we could all get on with our lives. I would still disagree with their faith, but it would be philosophical and in terms of utility. It would no longer be in the realm of science and logic, and wouldn’t make me nearly so mad.I approached this book with some trepidation, as a lot of people I respect have looked at it and declared it all bollocks, but I wanted to give Collins a fair hearing.He did not make this easier by making an obvious arithmetic error literally on page 1.Then in the introduction he makes the inexplicable (though common) assertion that religion is needed because science can't answer questions like ""what is the meaning of human existence?"" and ""what happens after we die?"" He's assuming there's an answer to the first question - which is bizarre if you think about it. What is the meaning of the asteroid Pisarenko? What kind of question is that? You can ask ""what is the meaning of the president's last speech"" because you know there is an intentional being behind it. I know the president exists. However, asking the question ""what is the meaning of human existence"" assumes something gives it meaning - that would be assuming the existence of a god, unless you're a humanist who thinks people give it their own meaning. This is not a question you can ask if you're trying to establish the existence of God and argue for religion in the first case. Teleology went out the window when we stopped using Aristotle as the ultimate authority.Of course, science has answered the second question (what happens when we die), but Collins doesn't like the answer, so he ignores it.This is not a promising start to a book advertised as a rational look at faith and science.That Collins found (and still finds) the existence of human morality evidence for God appears due to the fact that he approached biochemistry from the chemistry side. He does not appear to have really listened to his biologist colleagues who are working on the question of why morality actually exists, and have indeed come up with some answers. I can't believe Collins has never heard of, e.g., mirror neurons, but he doesn't show any evidence he has. Most remarkably, at one point he says, ""for the evolutionary argument about group benefits of altruism to hold, it would seem to require an opposite response, namely, hostility to individuals outside the group."" And... that's never seen in humans, is it? He provides examples of two, count 'em, two people who were not hostile to some other group.Collins would explain the small number of greatly altruistic people by the fact that we're all imperfect, but some are better than others so there must be some ideal. Okay, but as far as I can tell, this means the ideal is for humans to not use oxygen in our metabolic processes. Sure, we're all imperfect, and use it, but Ed Viesturs can climb Everest without supplemental oxygen, so he's proof there's some airless ideal we all strive for.Now, I'm not arguing against morality. Marc Hauser, in Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong, convincingly argues that there is some sort of universal moral grammar in humans, although its realization is culture-dependent. (One merely has to look at, say, Muslim honor killings to see that Collins' detailed universal morality is bollocks.) However, this occurs in other animals as well - in certain situations, chimps will abstain from rewarding themselves if it means another, unrelated chimp will be punished. (This behavior is not observed in Wall Street firms - perhaps they should hire chimps.)The problem here seems to be that while Collins is intelligent, he's not broadly educated. He's not aware of even basic recent research in biological morality, or theoretical cosmology (he seems proud of making it through A Brief History of Time, which is nice, but limited and dated). This isn't a failing for most people, and Collins doesn't need to know this stuff to do his biochemistry research. However, if he's going to make these things the root of his argument about the entire nature of reality, he really does need to know what he's talking about, and he can't just parrot C.S. Lewis continually. Lewis may have been bright and articulate, but at the very least he lived before many of these scientific advances that really do undermine his arguments.It does feel weird lecturing someone smarter than I am, but good grief, Collins, on the subject of the anomalous compassion of Oskar Schindler and Mother Teresa, go look up ""outliers"" and ""regression to the mean"". And does he not understand evolutionary byproducts? Humans didn't evolve to see faces in trees and the Moon because it was useful - it's a byproduct of other things that are themselves useful. If in-group altruism is useful, evolution is not a scalpel that can cleanly separate that from out-group altruism. (An expert in DNA must understand this, so is he willfully blind?)And then Collins says that, ""This was a God who was holy and righteous. He would have to be the embodiment of goodness. He would have to hate evil."" Of course, if you say God is good judging from an independent rule (as Collins appears to), then God is not the source of that rule and your argument about needing God to explain morality is fail. If good is good because it's what God is and made... that's scary. Because God could decide tomorrow that it's good to kill your children, and it would be good, by your definition. (Hang on... according to the Bible, God did decide this sometimes.)That's not even addressing theodicies, which have never been satisfactorily resolved. And Collins thinks science has a hard time explaining morality?""The ultimate decision would have to be based on faith, not proof."" So he admits on page 30 that science does not in fact find God, then proceeds to explain how it does for another 253 pages?Collins (he thinks) turns the wishful-thinking argument on its head: ""why would such a universal and uniquely human hunger (for Something Greater - read, God) exist, if it were not connected to some opportunity for fulfillment?""Well, I'm glad you asked. Daniel Dennett wrote a cogent book on why (Breaking the Spell), but this is just a silly argument to begin with. Because lots of people would like to fly on their own power that means humans can fly? If humans universally don't want disease, does that mean disease doesn't actually exist? Apparently, Collins continues to ride the ""I just wrote down whatever was in my head without thinking about it"" train. (And if it’s a universal desire, how do you explain atheists? It’s not universal, but Collins happily goes on with his false consensus bias, just one in a host of cognitive errors.)""The prophet Muhammed never himself used violence in responding to persecutors."" What the hell, did Collins do any research for this book? (Come on, google, say, the Battle of Hunayn.) Or is this just legalese, because Mohammed waited until he had an army before slaughtering people who didn’t agree with him, so by that point they weren’t persecutors? I don’t think so, because Collins is arguing religions are fundamentally peaceful (only some imperfect followers are violent).Summary of page 46: ""Don't see rape as a bad thing, look at it as an opportunity!"" When you have to go through contortions that messed up to justify your belief in God, it's time to rethink that belief. (I know this is well intentioned and stoic, but step back from it and take a look... it’s fucked up!)And then Collins ties up and gags Bayes' theorem, and beats it with a stick until it says, ""miracles!"" It's really quite amazing what you can do when you assume priors of 1 (implicitly, of course - otherwise it would be obvious that you're pulling a sleight-of-hand). Especially when your prior of 1 is for the existence of God.""The Big Bang cries out for a divine explanation"", says Collins. This is the exact same argument used by Intelligent Design proponents. It's complex, it's intricate, we haven’t got a complete theory yet, therefore God. Collins bashes ID, but turns around and uses the same argument in physics. Again, how can someone so smart be so intellectually inconsistent?Now Collins is arguing that there might be a deterministic theory that underlies quantum mechanics, and therefore the randomness isn't random to God. (This is from someone who took QED from Willis Lamb - and after Bell's theorem, so he has no excuse.) But he was just arguing that QM overturned the deterministic universe of Laplace (which left no room for God), and now he wants determinism again? I'm confused... and so is Collins.Collins at various points argues against ""God of the gaps"" and what he calls the compartmentalization of Stephen Jay Gould's NOMA. (Note that in Gould’s conception, NOMA is not compartmentalization - there actually is no conflict between the religion and science. I agree this doesn’t work in practice, however, and would end up requiring compartmentalization.) Which I find astonishing, as his book is one long exercise in God of the gaps, and he clearly compartmentalizes things because he judges religious ideas by entirely different standards than scientific ideas. (I doubt he would fund a grant application whose methods section includes the phrase ""then we leap beyond the evidence and just believe our answers."") I understand he doesn't believe in NOMA. But he is a confused, confused man.I can't read any more. I'm on page 96, and we've gotten into intro biology lectures, which is boring. Collins has already utterly failed on philosophical and physical grounds, and I don't need a DNA 101 lesson.But I did skip ahead a bit to where Collins lashes out at Richard Dawkins. He uses the standard argument that Dawkins is attacking some straw man of God, and not God as Collins (and Augustine, C.S. Lewis, etc.) have seen him. Francis, old buddy, it's not a straw man. There are lots, and lots of religious people who are antirational, don't believe in evolution, take the Bible literally, etc. Dawkins did not make them up. They really exist, and probably make up half of the religious people in the US. They also dominate the political-religious discourse in this country, so it's not like we can ignore them. They are senators and governors, not straw men.Then Collins spirits God out of the world, so science can't look at it. This is a cop-out. If God is accessible to our senses and/or our mind - as Collins believes it is - then it's accessible to science. Special pleading about God, despite being a favorite past-time of many religious people (and a standard theodicy), is not convincing.This book includes one great quote of C.S. Lewis', though. ""Nonsense remains nonsense, even when we talk about God."" Yes, it does."
5,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/423656-linda,4,"While I am not usually a big fan of non-fiction (takes too long to read) this book really affected me. As a scientist I was ready to disagree with the ideas of this evangelical Christian, but his arguments were well, scientific. His rational arguments struck a chord with me and he convinced me that theistic evolution is a valid possibility as to where we came from."
6,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"I picked this book up because I thought it would be interesting to read about the religious views of the head of the Human Genome Project. What does someone who has his scientific credentials think about God and spirituality? Some of the reviews on GR attempt to attack perceived fallacies in his arguments and prove him “wrong,” but I was less interested in that than I was getting inside his head and listening to his personal story, whether I agreed with him or not. The Language of God is a well-written, easily-read rumination on the conflict between science and religion and why the author (along with many in the scientific community) feels this conflict doesn’t need to exist. Despite arguing from a believer’s point of view, Collins spends quite a bit of time shooting down creationism, Biblical literalism, and Intelligent Design. He advises against using God to “fill in the gaps” in current scientific knowledge and instead encourages believers to base their faith on something more stable. He points to history to illustrate that current arguments that require a literal reading of the Genesis are relatively new and that pre-Darwin religious thinkers didn’t hold the same views that current conservative religious folks do.The only downside from my point of view is that Collins is Christian; I feel like I've spent enough time reading about how people arrived at their faith in Jesus. I'd love to read something written from the perspective of someone who became just about anything else, just for the sake of hearing some different experiences. To Collins' credit, though, in the few times he discusses the Bible, he refers to the original Hebrew. He also acknowledges several times that although his exploration of his personal beliefs brought him to Christianity, that every person will find what is right for them. A strike against him, though, is his use of the phrase ""Judeo-Christian"" several times, especially in reference to religious texts. That phrase needs to be disposed of and never used by anyone ever again.The book ends with an appendix detailing some current bioethics concerns, and while it's interesting (especially since a bioethics class I took with Lori Andrews was one of my more interesting law school classes), I'm a little puzzled about its placement in this book."
7,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41500-dave,5,"It was very refreshing to hear a reasonable person discuss these issues without trying to overemphasize controversy. There are two portions of the book: Collins personal story of how he came to faith in God, and his views on a number of controversial issues in the overlapping worlds of science, ethics and faith. The first is particularly intriguing to scientists who are interested in faith. The second portion is more technical but valuable to anyone who wrestles with these issues. Dave"
8,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1178748-ibrahim,1,"Not impressed at all. In fact, he made me angry and stunned by his audacity. From the first page he talks about himself and who he knows. He knows President Bill Clinton, the president of the free world! Imagine that! And he sat right next to Clinton! And for the first time, the amazing script, this amazing script, he says, the script of DNA, was available to the world, the free as well as the non-free. Then, and as you seek to fast forward all this BS you get into chapter one. He talks about his parents as freethinkers. What were these freethinkers? A bunch farmers on a dirt farm in the Shenondoah Valley of Virginia. Apparently everyone who lived in that area was a free thinker by right. I like it when a book gives itself away right away from the start and we can give it back to the library and get back to our fun studies of French lessons. No more of this Francis Collins!"
9,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/305384-dan,4,"This book is now my recommended first read for anyone who is asking the question, ""Can a scientist be a Christian or even believe in God?"" Collins, best known for being director of the human genome project, has impeccable credentials in the scientific world. He began as an agnostic. Feeling that agnostics who have not really tried to find God have no basis to defend their position or criticize others, Collins endeavored to see whether belief in God is possible. He leads the reader through the process by which he has concluded that not only is belief in God possible, he believes it is the most likely explanation for his cumulative observations. He further goes on the conclude that for him Christianity has the most credibility of the religions.Collins addresses evolution, creationism, and intelligent design. He concludes that evidence for evolution, including the evolution of man from a common ancestor with the apes, is becoming more and more convincing as time goes on. He feels that seven twenty-four-hour days of divine creation is not the most likely explanation of the origin of the earth based on both scientific evidence and scripture. He feels that intelligent design makes a god who is too small, being reserved only for the gaps; he further feels that more and more of those gaps are being explained by already established scientific principles as we learn more.Collins adds an appendix in which he discusses several controversial topics involving ethics and genetic research. This appendix is a great source for discussion."
10,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/138600-sean,2,"Full disclosure: I didn't read this whole book, as I was principally interested in Collins's arguments against Intelligent Design, so that and his arguments against atheism were the only two sections I have read so far. I will therefore confine myself to addressing those two sections.Collins is a world-renowned scientist, a geneticist who headed the Human Genome Project, and as such his words carry a great deal of weight. In the cases where he gets it right, this is a good thing; where he gets it wrong, this is a terrible thing, especially since many of his readers will depend on him and his reasoning (instead of their own) to reach his conclusions. Where he gets it right is in the case of Intelligent Design: Collins argues that ID is simply not science, because it fails to solve any scientific problems, because it is unverifiable, because it fails to make any sort of useful prediction, and because it is ultimately a ""god of the gaps"" hypothesis. The fact that Collins is arguing this as an avowed theist who does not want to see faith fail because of a weak reed like ID does not undermine his arguments. Collins is a scientist, and—when he is not blinded by his own agenda and preconceptions—he can recognize science when he sees it.Unfortunately, his arguments against atheism are utterly specious. In fact, they fail to be arguments at all: he merely cites passages by Dawkins (an atheist) and Gould (an agnostic) and pits them against each other. Sadly, he misquotes and mischaracterizes Dawkins's position (ironically calling it a ""straw man""), and simply accepts Gould's (controversial, to say the least) position on ""nonoverlapping magisteria"" at face value.Collins apparently has traveled from atheist to evangelical Christian, a journey that I can only describe as irrational in the extreme. I don't deny that he has thought long and hard about his beliefs, but it seems perfectly ludicrous to me that a person starting from square one, blank slate, as it were, could possibly narrow down the religious field to a specific set of beliefs using any kind of logic. And, reading ahead in his book, I find that this is the case: in his chapter on ""Truth Seekers"" he talks about reasoning, but that peculiarly religious kind of reasoning that is based ultimately on feelings instead of on empirical evidence. This is the same kind of apologetic, feel-good nonsense that C.S. Lewis churned out by the pound, and it is irrational, unscientific claptrap unworthy of one of the greatest geneticists of our age.NOTE ON COMMENTING: Comments telling me to read the whole book will be deleted. Comments from people who clearly didn't read or understand my review will be deleted. Comments that annoy me for any other reason will be deleted.

11,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3193607-joey,1,"The Good: Collins at least encourages fellow evangelicals and other fundamentalist believers to leave behind the bronze age science of religion and cross over into the 19th century. As the head of the Human Genome Project, he dispels the myth that science is a godless, liberal conspiracy to destroy religion.The Bad: Collins' arguments for god are lacking. Human morality has a perfectly legitimate, natural explanation. Collins feels the desire to reach out and help that starving African child on the television because the genes and epigenes that built his brain evolved in hunter-gatherer societies without televison and where any suffering child that was witnessed was overwhelmingly likely to have shared genes. It's kin selection and reciprocal altruism. This guy was the head of the Human Genome Project and is now the head of NIH. Come on, Dr. Collins, don't insult our intelligence.The Ugly: Nearly everything. How someone as bright as Dr. Collins (theoretical physics in undergrad, medical school, genetics fellowship, Human Genome Project, etc.) can say that non-theism is the weakest possible philosophical position is anathema to reason. I read this book as an overture to my wife after she threated me with divorce for declaring my unbelief. I was literally nauseated by the ignorance and half-truths contained in its pages."
12,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142672-lynn-hay,1,"This book was a disappointment to me, i did not gleam any new insight from it. It was the old circular 'I believe because I believe' argument meets an ode to C.S. Lewis. This guy obviously LOVES C.S. Lewis! He quoted him so often it started to feel a bit plagiarised. "
13,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16092014-paul,3,"As someone with a deep skepticism for Christian apologetics, I wasn’t sure how much I would like Francis Collins’ apologeticy-sounding Language of God, though it came with high recommendations from people I trust. Thankfully, Collins spends much less time trying to convince his readers that God exists than in trying to convince his readers of the more modest argument that science and faith can coincide.To that end, Collins – director of the National Institutes of Health, head of the project that first mapped the human genome, and an evangelical Christian – is an ideal spokesperson both for the universally attested scientific facts of Big Bang cosmology and Darwinian evolution and for the rationality of faith in God while still accepting those facts.Most helpful, Collins has that rare gift of being able to translate complex scientific concepts – such as human genetics, evolutionary theory, Intelligent Design, bioethics – into layperson’s language. It’s unlikely that this book would convince a Ken Ham or a Richard Dawkins, but for those just beginning to think through these questions or who have begun to wonder whether the hostility they’ve been sold by both religious and atheistic fundamentalists can really be justified, this is an excellent introduction calling for a middle way that doesn’t get too dense or technical.It’s not a perfect book; the parts where he veers into apologetics, including the first chapter, are not great and rely much too heavily on C.S. Lewis, who has important things to say but is granted way too much authority in these matters by evangelical Christians who don’t seem to realize his arguments have become increasingly dated and increasingly unconvincing. I think Collins probably needed to spend more time unpacking exactly what he thinks the Moral Law is, and why he believes it couldn’t have arisen through undirected evolutionary processes (right now, it reads too much like a “God of the gaps” argument that he rightly decries when he picks apart Intelligent Design).But that aside, there’s much more good than bad here, and something well worth reading, especially for those Christians afraid they must choose between scientific findings and their religious beliefs."
14,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/433928-jennifer,4,This was a book I read for my seminary class on Science and the Christian Faith. I liked it enough that I would choose to read it again in the future when I'm not needing to speed through it for class. I think it is an important book in the conversation regarding Science and Christianity and how the two do not need to be at odds with one another.
15,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369741-dawn,4,"I highly recommend this book! Francis Collins is a well known, highly respected scientist. He is a medical doctor and also a research scientist. He was head of the Human Genome Project and is now the director of NIH. Collins tells the story of his conversion to Christianity as an adult. He is brilliant and he truly loves science. But he also finds vital meaning and, indeed, salvation in religion. The point of his book is to show that science and religion are not opposed to each other, as some people assume. Instead, they are complimentary. I find this to be true in my personal experience, as well. Faith explains the ""why"" and science explores the ""how"" of this wonderful universe we are part of. We need both.I agree with most of what Collins says, and he explains it so well. His personal story and insights come at the beginning and end of the book. The middle of the book is Collins' explanation of fascinating topics in modern science. His expertise is in genetics, so an important section of the book is devoted to evolution. He argues decisively that 1) evolution is real and 2) the reality of evolution need not threaten faith. The book also includes an a very good, thought provoking discussion of medical and scientific ethics in an appendix chapter, so don't miss it. If you are religious and distrust science, this book is for you. If you love science and dismiss faith, this book is also for you. Collins strongly makes the point that both sides need to come together in mutual respect for their different kinds of knowledge. Both viewpoints need to be valued at the table because we need to work together to find solutions to the pressing problems of our time. I find appreciating the blessings of both faith and science in my life to be very satisfying. To adhere only to one extreme or the other leaves important parts missing. This book requires thought, but it is designed to be accessible to the lay reader. I learned a lot from it. I was struck by Collin's palpable enthusiasm for science, and also by his humanity and caring. He likes C.S. Lewis and includes good quotes by him. My scientist husband read this book several years ago and it has been on our bookshelf since then. I'm so glad I finally got around to reading it! It is excellent."
16,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22306206-neil-r-coulter,3,"I love that one of the nation’s top scientists is a fellow Christian—and not only that, but he is willing to talk about his faith and connect it to his delight in science. Francis Collins is a great guy, and I was happy to finally read through this book, which had such a part in launching the organization BioLogos, along with many good discussions. Collins’s main point in the book is to encourage all readers, whether faithful or atheist, to stop the angry, vitriolic tone that so plagues discussions about science and faith. As he writes in the conclusion,It is time to call a truce in the escalating war between science and spirit. The war was never really necessary. Like so many earthly wars, this one has been initiated and intensified by extremists on both sides, sounding alarms that predict imminent ruin unless the other side is vanquished. Science is not threatened by God; it is enhanced. God is most certainly not threatened by science; He made it all possible. So let us together seek to reclaim the solid ground of an intellectually and spiritually satisfying synthesis of all great truths. (233–4)I wholeheartedly agree. I was raised in a Christian environment that cautioned against science, fearing that it was some kind of conspiracy against Christianity, or that to entertain the notion that God may have used evolution as part of his creation process is just a slippery slope toward total loss of faith. That perspective held me back from thoroughly enjoying science as I might have otherwise. In adulthood, I learned that there is no reason not to celebrate faithfulness to God and delight in science (including evolution)—and I feel in no danger whatsoever of losing my faith.In an excellent article in 
Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith
, Timothy Larsen showed how the science-vs.-faith conflict was manufactured in the nineteenth century, for reasons that have little to do with any actual conflict between science and faith. The wonder is that both sides bought into the conflict so wholeheartedly that it has continued to today, such that people assume this was always the way things have been. Collins concurs with Larsen, saying,Believers have led science at many times in the past. Yet all too often today, scientists are uneasy about admitting their spiritual views. To add to the problem, church leaders often seem to be out of step with new scientific findings, and run the risk of attacking scientific perspectives without fully understanding the facts. The consequence can bring ridicule on the church, driving sincere seekers away from God instead of into His arms. (230)I hope books like this one will continue to help people see the science-vs.-faith conflict as artificial and unnecessary, and that we can move ahead in more fruitful ways.My rating for Collins’s book is tempered by the fact that I don’t think he quite accomplishes the promise of the subtitle: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief. The book works best when it’s a memoir of Collins’s personal experience (and I hope that someday he’ll write a full-blown memoir, as I suspect he has a lot of great stories and can tell them well), but it’s less good as “evidence for belief.” Taking down the ridiculous arguments of people on extremes—Richard Dawkins as a representative of atheist perspectives, for example, or Ken Ham for young-earth creationism—is not difficult. Such arguments are full of holes in logic, even apart from the ugly, combative tone that people on the extremes tend to employ. And besides, people with the more extreme views are not likely to be interested in any kind of evidence from another perspective. But people in between are perhaps more open to learning though also more difficult to convince.Collins’s apologetics for faith rely heavily on C. S. Lewis. I love Lewis, and I’m glad he still speaks to clearly to people today. But I wonder if his kind of logical argument is really the most helpful for contemporary seekers. I’d like to see “evidence for belief” drawing on a broader set of source material. Other books on this topic have done better in this regard—I would recommend anything by John Walton, for example, as a very good way in to other ways of understanding Genesis, and thus dismantling the war between science and faith.Still, I appreciate Collins’s writing because he is at the very top of the game in science and he’s a good writer, willing to share his deepest, most personal feelings like this."

This book failed to match my expectancies, judging from the title and the cover, you expect some answers or explaination to the the question of: does science contracts Religion?

The second half of the book, However, did deliver some good and important informations about the Human Genome project, And the ethics related, Which was required, useful, And quite entertaining, Unlike the First half of the book.

But overall this book is a nice presentation of why one of the most intelligent men in our world is a Christian. His style of writing is engaging and this book is a very helpful resource for the right kind of person.
19,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,4,"A better title would be A Smart Guy Discusses Briefly a lot of Topics in Science and Religion. He makes and assesses several arguments for and against belief in God, but they make up less than half the book. Justifiably tired of religious fundamentalists and anti-theists polarizing discourse, Collins sets out to harmonize and inform on a range of topics. Two sections explain the Big Bang and basic genetics in some of the clearest expert-to-laymen descriptions I’ve come across. Another addresses the ethics of cloning, stem cells and invitro fertilization. He summarizes the careers of Darwin and Galileo, attempting to dispel untruths about their lives as well as illustrate the history of science. He also gives a cursory biography of what led him from childhood to agnosticism, from agnosticism to atheism, from atheism to Christianity, from chemist to biologist, from researcher to government employee, and from that position to his work in the Human Genome Project. The whole is so readable that I went through it in a couple of days.Collins is remarkably calm and conversational, which renders his great breadth of topics universally understandable. Selected chapters would make fine introductory reading for basic science and theology courses. He is also well-read and perhaps tries too hard to let you know it – two pages seldom pass without him quoting Sigmund Freud, St. Augustine, E.O. Wilson, Stephen Jay Gould or some other notable thinker. But his biggest flaw lies in that giant library for he has so many topics to address that he sprints through them. He reduces Michael Behe’s arguments for Intelligent Design and Richard Dawkins’s arguments for a connection between evolution and atheism into a few pages. As rubbish as those men can be, they won’t go away that quickly (which is why other authors dedicate entire books to picking them apart). No serious agnostic is going to be convinced by the couple of pages he devotes to arguing against it, and it would be a pleasure to get more detail from the man himself on the struggles of the Human Genome project.His favorite argument for belief in God is “The Moral Law,” that fundamental impulse towards good that he borrows from C.S. Lewis. Yet in discussing how evolution might not produce such complex altruism in its subjects, he ignores theories of reciprocal altruism and modern neuroscience. He seems to believe that its emergence speaks to a creative force that cares, but doesn’t clarify if this is mechanically similar to Intelligent Design, or if his God put it there physically, or if this a universal constant we evolved towards, or how his beliefs are affected by brain studies that show how habits start, form and are chemically reinforced. With its appendices his book is over three hundred pages, but you have the urge to slow him down and get him to expand. There is volatile complexity here that will not go away just because you breeze over it.The avoidance of neuroscience does not ring as dishonest, however. Collins is not blindly faithful. He advises healthy skepticism towards miracles, with a scientific emphasis on pragmatic explanations. Science is the only way to study the natural world, he declares (and rankles me, as an artist). He disarms the arguments for God by way of the second law of thermodynamics, rightly pointing out that the equation itself is open for increased order or complexity in a system (like our planet’s) if there is an increase in energy – and gives succinct examples, that if you exert yourself you can clean up the kitchen, and that with all the light we get from the sun, our system has the potential for increased order.He makes convincing pleas for the religious to remain open to science, and scientists to at least tolerate religion. It’s a book of strengths and weaknesses. When you are ignorant, he gets you up to speed quickly. When you agree, his speed is pleasant. When you disagree, you yell at him for selling somebody short. So if he planned to convert people with this book, Collins may have failed, but attempts to bring harmony to the discourse over modern science is still commendable."
20,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55184519-rachel-c,4,"Worth reading, if you're interested in hearing a fourth option of belief outside of Young Earth Creationism, Atheism and Intelligent design. Francis Collins introduces Theistic Evolution, or what he prefers to call, ""BioLogos"".BUT... I was hoping for more out of this book. I completely disagree with the subtitle, ""A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief"". I just finished the book, hoping for this, so-called, evidence to turn up. Still waiting. What the reader does get is a lot of regurgitated C.S. Lewis. So if you love Lewis enough to read through a commentary by the man who lead the Human Genome project, you will love this book. His other anecdotal ""evidence"" includes his experience of a beautiful waterfall...I must admit, Collins became a bit of my temporary hero during the middle of the book where he completely tears a strip off of Young Earth Creationists and Intelligent Design ""scientists"" (I'll throw in a few of my favourite quotes at the end). He also has a few minor criticisms on Atheism I found interesting, but they were not strong enough to convince any thoughtful atheists who have carefully studied their position. I must say though, that I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even though I disagree with the conclusion. Perhaps I owe it 5 stars for entertainment factor? Alas, I factor in other ingredients into my reviews, and Collins' non-sequiter experience of coming to faith from the sight of a waterfall was just not worthy of mention, let alone of being called ""Evidence"". But, if anyone is looking to add an intelligent voice to the religious position, Francis Collins is your guy!Here's some of my favourite quotes (below contains spoilers!)“One of the most cherished hopes of a scientist is to make an observation that shakes up a field of research. Scientists have a streak of closeted anarchism, hoping that someday they will turn up some unexpected fact that will force a disruption of the framework of the day. That’s what the Nobel Prizes are given for. In that regard, any assumption that a conspiracy could exist among scientists to keep a widely current theory alive when it actually contains serious flaws is completely antithetical to the restless mind-set of the profession.” (Collins 2006, p. 58 - Collins, a scientist who was the head of the Human Genome project. He also happens to be a Christian)“Faith that places God in the gaps of current understanding about the natural world may be headed for crisis if advances in science subsequently fill those gaps. Faced with incomplete understanding of the nature world, believers should be cautious about invoking the divine I areas of current mystery, lest they build an unnecessary theological argument that is doomed to later destruction. There are good reasons to believe in God, including the existence of mathematical principles and order in creation. They are positive reasons, based on knowledge, rather than default assumptions based on (a temporary) lack of knowledge.” (Collins 2006, p.93)“(…since we all have two genomes of 3 billion base pairs each, one from our mother and one from our father, we all have roughly sixty new mutations that were not present in either of our parents). The [mutations] that fall in the more vulnerable parts of the genome are generally harmful, and are thus rapidly culled out of the population because they reduce reproductive fitness. But on rare occasions, a mutation will arise by chance that offers a slight degree of selective advantage. That new DNA ‘spelling’ will have a slightly higher likelihood of being passed on to future offspring. Over the course of a very long period of time, such favourable rare events can become widespread in all members of the species, ultimately resulting in major changes in biological function.” (Collins 2006, p. 131)Collins gives excellent examples of evolution in pages 131-133“Despite twenty-five centuries of debate, it is fair to say that no human knows what the meaning of Genesis 1 and 2 was precisely intended to be. We should continue to explore that!But the idea that scientific revelations would represent an enemy in that pursuit is ill conceived. If God created the universe, and the laws that govern it, and if He endowed human beings with intellectual abilities to discern its workings, would He want us to disregard those abilities? Would He be diminished or threatened by what we are discovering about His creation?” (Collins 2006, p. 153)“Many believers in God have been drawn to Young Earth Creationism because they see scientific advances as threatening to God. But does he really need defending here? Is not God the author of the laws of the universe? Is He not the greatest scientist? The greatest physicist? The greatest biologist? Most important, is He homered or dishonoured by those who would demand that His people ignore rigorous scientific conclusions about His creation? Can faith in a loving God be built on a foundation of lies about nature?” (Collins 2006, p. 176)On the view that God made things look old, as a test of our faith- “…Young Earth Creationism has reached a point of intellectual bankruptcy, both in its science and in its theology. Its persistence is those one of the great puzzles and great tragedies of our time. By attacking the fundamentals of virtually every branch of science, it widens the chasm between the scientific and spiritual worldview, just at a time where a pathway toward harmony is desperately needed. By sending a message to young people that science is dangerous, and that pursuing science may well mean rejecting religious faith, Young Earth Creationism may be depriving science of some of its most promising future talents.But it is not science that suffers most here. Young Earth Creationism does even more damage to faith, by demanding that belief in God requires assent to fundamentally flawed claims about the natural world. Young people brought up in homes and churches that insist on Creationism sooner or later encounter the overwhelming scientific evidence in favour of an ancient universe and the relatedness of all living things through the process of evolution and natural selection. What a terrible and unnecessary choice they then face! To adhere to the faith of their childhood, they are required to reject a broad and rigorous body of scientific data, effectively committing intellectual suicide. Presented with no other alternative than [Young Earth] Creationism, is it any wonder that many of these young people turn away from faith, concluding that they simply cannot believe in a God who would ask them to reject what science has so compellingly taught us about the natural world?” (Collins 2006, p. 177)“On the surface, the objections to Darwinism put forward by the ID movement appear compelling, and it is not surprising that nonscientists, especially those looking for a role for God in the evolutionary process, have embraced these arguments warmly. But if the logic truly had merit on scientific grounds, one would expect that the rank and file of working biologist would also show interest in pursuing these ideas, especially since a significant number of biologists are also believers. This has not happened, however, and Intelligent Design remains a fringe activity with little credibility within the mainstream scientific community.’ (Collins, 2006 p.187)“Many cracks are beginning to appear, suggesting that ID proponents have made the mistake of confusing the unknown with the unknowable, or the unsolved with the unsolvable.” (Collins, 2006 p. 188)In response to the question: why would God use Evolution?-“The solution is actually readily at hand, one one ceases to apply human limitations to God. If God is outside of nature, then He is outside of space and time. In that context, God could in the moment of creation of the universe also know every detail of the future… In that context, evolution could appear to us to be driven by chance, but from God’s perspective the outcome would be entirely specified. Thus, God could be completely and intimately involved in the creation of all species, while from our perspective, limited as it is by the tyranny of linear time, this would appear a random and undirected process.” (Collins, 2006 p. 205)“I do not believe that the God who created all the universe, and who communes with His people through prayer and spiritual insight, would expect us to deny the obvious truths of the natural world that science has revealed to us, in order to prove our love for Him.” (Collins, 2006 p. 210)Collins, Francis S. 2006. The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief. New 		York: Free Press (Simon & Schuster)"
21,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/231361-kent,1,"Very easy read considering the science involved in the subject matter. Collins develops his view of theistic evolution and gives it the name, ""BioLogos."" Although Collins makes a very interesting history of the Human Genome Project, he is unconvincing in his argument against creation as presented in Genesis 1 and 2. I find it funny that Collins is certain that his perspective of how nature begins is something ""we know,"" but he can not seem to know what the Bible presents. Additionally, he ""knows"" that creation started ""approximately 10 to 12 billion years ago"" and that evolution produced humans approximately 100,000 years ago.Collins argues, very ineffectively, for the evolution of an eye. In response to simple organisms, the flatworm, and the chambered nautilus, the author states: ""It is not prohibitively difficult, given hundreds of millions of years, to contemplate how this system could have evolved into the modern mammalian eye, complete with light-sensing retina and light-focusing lens.If Collins is correct, we should worship evolution, not God. For the author, God is a highly ineffective creator who couldn't create the heavens and the earth, he could only create some type of substance that, given hundreds of millions of years, became the heavens and the earth. God couldn't create humans, he could only create substances that evolved into humans and eventually God gave the human a spirit and soul.Some reviewers of this work are pleased that Collins suggests you can believe in God and evolution at the same time. I wonder, can you believe Collins and the Bible at the same time? "
22,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11540969-angelo-marcos,5,"I thought this book was excellent.Francis Collins clearly explains how evolution and Christianity are not incompatible with each other. Coming as it does from such an esteemed scientist, this is a very well thought out and well argued position, although some of the very science-y stuff did make it necessary to reread certain parts!Collins is also right in that it's only really those who have extreme views on either side of this debate who get the attention. Looking at the scientific data and Genesis, you can see that there really is no conflict between evolution and Christianity, but there is a lot of rhetoric and straw men flung about by fundamentalists on either side.Hopefully this intelligent and well argued book will go some way to showing that science is not at war with religion, and in fact they can and do complement each other."
23,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1022330-davyhong07,5,"If you are a faithful Christian but find it hard to believe that evolution is a false theory and can't accept intelligent design or the Young Earth theory on the origin-of-earth, this book is the book for you. The book makes the case for BioLogos, belief that God did create this world, but that evolution and other scientific theories and natural laws were God's method of creation. To my fellow Christians...let's face facts here people, with the scientific knowledge we know now about life on earth we can safely say that evolution theory is a fact. Collins makes a strong argument that evolution theory should only enhance our love and amazement towards God and strengthen the faith of Christianity. "
24,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4106303-julie-reed,5,"Excellent book! I found myself cheering throughout. Every believer, unbeliever, and everyone in between should read this book. In a very eloquent, gentle way, he tells believers ""don't be so stupid and closed-minded about science"" and to the unbeliever he says ""don't be so closed-minded and think you are too smart for belief in God."" In other words, he puts both extremes in their place and shows us the error of our ways. I hope there are many more Francis Collinses in the future who continue to bridge the gap between both extremes of scienctific unbelievers and non-scientific believers. I also found this book deepened my faith as I learned the SCIENCE behind life on earth. "
25,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,0,"There is no evidence for belief, that's why it's ""faith"". I would guess that most US scientists also have faith, and no trouble reconciling their faith with their work. The only people who seem to have trouble reconciling the two are religious fundamentalists."
26,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10365969-jennifer,4,"My interest was captured from first pages of the introduction and my discovery that the origin of the book’s title came from a speech by President Clinton, ""Without a doubt, this is the most important, most wondrous map ever produced by humankind…Today, we are learning the language in which God created life. We are gaining ever more awe for the complexity, the beauty, and the wonder of God's most divine and sacred gift."" From politics to science to theology, from the oval office to the laboratory to the cathedral, “The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome…His creation is majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful - and it cannot be at war with itself. Only we imperfect humans can start such battles. And only we can end them.” “A real evaluation of the truth of faith depends upon looking at the clean, pure water, not at the rusty containers.” Both faith and science as necessary ingredients for the double helix of our DNA. I appreciated Collins' systematic, chapter by chapter, dissection and discussion of each of the current faith and science positions: atheism and agnosticism (when science trumps faith), creationism (when faith trumps science), intelligent design (when science needs divine help), and finally BioLogos (science and faith in harmony). As a child, I grew up a creationist, as a college student and young adult, I aligned with intelligent design theory, but Collins' introduction to theistic evolution caused me to reevaulate my position. Collins' summarizes, “The universe came into being out of nothingness, approximately 14 billion years ago. Despite massive improbabilities, the properties of the universe appear to have been precisely tuned for life. While the precise mechanism of the origin of life on earth remains unknown, once life arose, the process of evolution and natural selection permitted the development of biological diversity and complexity over very long periods of time. Once evolution got under way, no special supernatural intervention was required. Humans are part of this process, sharing a common ancestor with the great apes. But humans are also unique in ways that defy evolutionary explanation and point to our spiritual nature. This includes the existence of the Moral Law (the knowledge of right and wrong) and the search for God that characterizes all human cultures throughout history.” I was struck by Collins' reference to the illustration of the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, who has scaled the mountains of ignorance and as he pulls himself over the final rock to conquer the highest peak, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.As an auditory learner, I appreciated listening to the audio version of this book and hearing Collins sing his ditties to guitar! As a pro-life advocate, I was awed by the miracle of the fetal hemoglobin protein that helps extract oxygen from the mother’s blood to nourish the growing fetus and is gradually replaced by the adult form instead. How incredible that when a single, simple, invisible, and previously unknown phenomenon like this one is introduced in a case like sickle cell anemia, it can serve as a natural cure! “Nearly all of the atoms in your body were once cooked in the nuclear furnace of an ancient supernova—you are truly made of stardust.” From the bottom of my stardust heart to yours, I recommend the Language of God!"
27,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4851711-genni,3,"Obama nominated Collins for NIH director in 2009 where he has been ever since. Before that, he led the Human Genome Project. He has, no doubt, made many important contributions to science and medicine. The parts of the book that covered those areas were quite strong. Unfortunately, he also attempted some philosophical chapters that did not work as well. I think this was the biggest problem with the book. He tried to cover too much ground. An all-caps proclamation on the front of my cover says, “A SCIENTIST PRESENTS EVIDENCE FOR BELIEF”. He begins by addressing the big questions of life and his own experience with atheism, yet the main object of the book is not apologetics for the existence of God, it is apologetic for harmony between evolution and theism. Collins is not a philosopher and does little more than quote C.S. Lewis heavily in the philosophical sections.In the second half, he addresses YEC, ID, and TE. He spends a short amount of time with each view and shows how YEC and ID do not explain what we find in science. He then encourages believers to not be afraid of science and what it is revealing. Most of his explanations were centered around genetics, his particular area of expertise. I found all of this compelling, especially his assertion that YEC and ID are not able to predict and guide medicine the way an understanding of evolution does. However, I had SO many questions by the end of the book that he didn’t address. It wasn’t very comprehensive. So I will have to do more searching.In short, as a popular appeal it was decent, but if you are looking for something more rigorous, my humble suggestion is to give Alvin Plantinga’s Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism a go."
28,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36502262-eric,3,"3.5 StarsThe Language of God was a solid book that for the most part accomplished its goal of presenting a framework for reconciling strong belief in science with equally strong belief in God. Collins is direct and sincere in his presentation. There were a few parts that didn't resonate as strongly with me, though part of that is undoubtedly due to my own lack of scientific inclination. This book struck me as a sort of Mere Christianity specifically geared toward scientists. In other words, it's a book that explains why one doesn't have to give up reason to believe in God. In fact, Collins is open in his admiration for C.S. Lewis (I'm also a huge fan of Lewis) and references him frequently. One of my complaints actually is that many of the most striking points made, particularly on the spiritual side of things, are pulled almost directly from Lewis. I would strongly recommend anyone intrigued by what they read here to go read Lewis for themselves, especially Mere Christianity (my favorite work of his). One of the primary themes of the book is that science and faith aren't at odds, despite the frequent claims to the contrary by both sides. One of his points that I agree with the most is that strident voices on both sides (faith and science) are causing great damage to their respective causes by attacking each other. As a Christian I cringe at times when I see other believers defend their faith in such a way. Christians should never be ashamed of their beliefs, but neither should they treat those that disagree with the hostility that is at times shown. The Language of God is a solid and earnest attempt to bridge the seemingly widening gap between faith and science that will appeal most to those particularly interested in debates regarding evolution, intelligent design, and DNA.

29,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15437957-danielle-devane-wells,5,"I picked this book (from my hubby's library [haha!]) to see how the conclusion for a Higher Being was come to by an atheist, someone from the total opposite side of myself (raised in Christianity). And I was not disappointed with this book! From a personal opinion standpoint, I liked his conclusion: that a Higher Power was indeed the impetus to life. I also appreciated his detailed explanation (the whole book!) of how he came to this conclusion. While the author agrees that at some point, faith is involved because there can be no physical proof for God, he explains the events and discoveries in his own life (he was the head scientist on the Human Genome Project) that led him to believe that there is a God.Those events and discoveries that he details in this book are quite interesting, elaborate, precise explanations of how our bodies work. That part of the book can be difficult to get through because it's so ""heavy"" but it's worth it!He insists that science need not be threatened by God and vice versa....that they only enhance each other. He quotes a lot of C.S.Lewis. I think every one should read this - to expand your mind, learn a little bit about his story and enforce your faith. The writing style is easy to follow and he's not so smart that he can't explain elaborate, scientific ideas to the common man."
30,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32254765-kevin-stilley,3,"The following are discussion questions for ""The Language of God"" that I created for the monthly meeting of of the Atheist Christian Book Club. For information on the Atheist Christian Book Club you can go to the website at http://atheistchristianbookclub.com/ or seek us out on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/AtheistChris... .CHAPTER 1: FROM ATHEISM TO BELIEFCollins says that for him agnosticism was a place of retreat where he wouldn’t actually have to seriously consider the evidence for or against belief. That is obviously not true of those in this book group, but do you think it is generally true for most agnostics? Is agnosticism a position that is held in order to avoid the question of God’s existence altogether?Collins writes that the Moral Law was the primary thing that made him reconsider his atheism. What about those in our book group. Is there a “one thing” that creates cognitive dissonance and makes the atheists in the group pause to reconsider?CHAPTER 2: THE WAR OF THE WORLDVIEWSA similar question for the Christians; is there a question that makes you uncomfortable with your faith? Collins talks about four questions that he struggled with during the early days of his newfound belief. Is there a question like that that makes the Christians in the group sometimes doubt? If not currently, was there a question you struggled with at some time in your life?Collins lists four difficult questions that he struggled with as a new believer; (1) Isn’t the idea of God just wish-fulfillment?, (2) What about all the harm done in the name of religion?, (3) Why would a loving God allow suffering in the world?, and (4) How can a rational person believe in miracles? Were you satisfied with the answers Collins has arrived at and shares here?CHAPTER 3: THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSECollins writes, “Immanuel Kant wrote: ""Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the Moral Law within."" I have heard some former atheist/agnostics similarly indicate that these two things, nature and the moral law, seemed to be ever present in the back of their mind/heart as an indication that there had to be something more than just the material even when they were most intellectually opposed to the idea of God. I’m curious if those two concerns have any influence on the atheists/agnostics in our book group?Collins writes, “Based on these and other observations, physicists are in agreement that the universe began as an infinitely dense, dimensionless point of pure energy. The laws of physics breakdown in this circumstance, referred to as a ""singularity."" Is there the same kind of unanimity among the members of this book group as there seems to be among physicists? Collins seems to think that the question of origins hinges upon the question “What happened before the Big Bang?” Would the book club members agree?Collins' timeline (number of years) differs from some of the Christians in the room. For those who hold to a young earth theory of creation, how important do you think it is to adhere to a “thousands of years” formula instead of a “millions or billions of years” formula?The question of old earth vs. young earth is primarily a discussion held within the camp of Christianity. However, how does it affect those of you who are atheistic/agnostic?Collins writes of the Anthropic Principle, that “The existence of a universe as we know it rests upon a knife edge of improbability.” (page 73) This same fine-tuning argument also had an influence on the author of a previous book we read, Anthony Flew. The author gives three possibilities; (1) an infinite number of universes, (2) we are just very, very lucky, or (3) The precise tuning of all of the physical constants and physical laws to make intelligent life possible is not an accident, but reflects the action of the one who created the universe in the first place. What do you think?Collins quotes a number of famous scientists who believe that “""It would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun in just this way, except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us."" (pages 75ff). Do you think that Stephen Hawking, Freeman Dyson, Arno Penzias and other such scientists (such as Collins, himself) forfeit their scientific bona fides by taking such a position?The author claims that “there is nothing inherently in conflict between the idea of a creator God and what science has revealed.” Do you agree or disagree with him? Why? (page 81) The author further claims that “the opening words of Genesis (""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"") are entirely compatible with the Big Bang.” Do you agree or disagree with him? (pages 82-83)CHAPTER 4: LIFE ON EARTH – OF MICROBES AND MENCollins says that “no serious scientist would currently claim that a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life is at hand” but warns Christians not to result to a God of the gaps apologetic. He encourages them to adopt an approach using “positive reasons, based on knowledge, rather than default assumptions based on (a temporary) lack of knowledge.” However, for those of you who are atheists, does “the inability of modern science to develop a statistically probable mechanism” for the origin of life give you any intellectual pause? (pages 92-93)Collins writes, “No serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life. In fact, the relatedness of all species through the mechanism of evolution is such a profound foundation for the understanding of all biology that it is difficult to imagine how one would study life without it.” Is this true? Are there no serious biologists that doubt the theory of evolution? Is Collins being fair to those who disagree with him on this matter? (page 99)CHAPTER 5: DECIPHERING GOD’S INSTRUCTION BOOK – THE LESSONS OF THE HUMAN GENOMECollins asserts that the difference between macroevolution and microevolution is “increasingly seen to be artificial. But then to illustrate it is a distinction without a difference he uses the example of a stickleback fish with armor becoming a stickleback fish without armor. I think most critics of Darwinism would find this example not to be compelling. A fish becomes a fish. A virus becomes a slightly different virus. How is this evidence for the “tree of life”? Was his example sufficient for you to think that the distinction between macroevolution and microevolution is “arbitrary”? (pages 131-132)In reference to similarities between human and mouse genomes, Collins writes, “This evidence alone does not, of course, prove a common ancestor; from a creationist perspective, such similarities could simply demonstrate that God used successful design principles over and over again. As we shall see, however, and as was foreshadowed above by the discussion of ""silent"" mutations in protein-coding regions, the detailed study of genomes has rendered that interpretation virtually untenable—not only about all other living things, but also about ourselves.” Do you think that the evidence provided by Collins actually supports his claim that it is untenable to believe that God used successful design principles over and over again? (pages 133-137)Does Collins provide compelling evidence from genetic similarities to prove that humans and other life forms have a common ancestor? (pages 137- 142)CHAPTER 6: GENESIS, GALILEO, AND DARWINCollins writes about the emotional distance between Christian believers who are adherents of Darwinism and those who reject this biological theory. What do you think about this? Is it difficult for these to “sides” to coexist in theological harmony? (pages 145-147)CHAPTER 7: OPTION 1 – ATHEISM AND AGNOSTICISM (WHEN SCIENCE TRUMPS FAITH)Collins writes about the hostility between some believers and unbelievers. How common is this? Why do you think this is so? (pages 159ff)The author of our book quotes Dawkins as saying, “""It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus, 'mad cow' disease, and many others, but I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.” Do the atheists in our group believe that faith is evil? (page 163)Collins quotes Stephen Jay Gould as saying that since “Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny” the existence of God. Do you agree with Gould? (page 166)The author refers to four different groups:1. Strong Atheists = have a firm conviction that no deities exist.2. Weak Atheism = the absence of belief in the existence of a God or gods3. Strong Agnostics = believes there is no way that human kind will “ever” know if there is a God4. Weak Atheists = believes only that it is not possible to know “yet” whether or not there is a GodWhat is the composition of atheists/agnostics in our group in regard to these four descriptions?CHAPTER 8: OPTION 2 - CREATIONISM (WHEN FAITH TRUMPS SCIENCE)Does Collins accurately reflect the beliefs of most Young Earth Creationists when he claims that they believe in Microevolution, which he defines as small changes within a species, but do not believe in Macroevolution, which he describes as one species evolving into another species? Many of the young earth creationists that I know are much more flexible with the definition of Microevolution, and define it as changing from one genus, or one order, into another genus or order. (page 172) Does this matter, or is this a distinction without a difference?Is Collins being a bit hysterical when he declares that should YEC scientific claims be true then, “it would lead to a complete and irreversible collapse of the sciences of physics, chemistry, cosmology, geology, and biology.”? (page 174) He makes it sound down right apocalyptic; are YEC that dangerous?CHAPTER 9: OPTION 3 – INTELLIGENT DESIGN (WHEN SCIENCE NEEDS DIVINE HELP)Collins asserts that if the logic of Intelligent Design “truly had merit on scientific grounds, one would expect that the rank and file of working biologists would also show interest in pursuing these ideas, especially since a significant number of biologists are also believers.” (page 187) However, haven’t historians of science like Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) written that just the opposite is true? Does not history tell us that science that none of the revolutionary paradigmatic changes that science has undergone were quickly accepted on the basis of reason/evidence alone? Is head-counting an appropriate way to determine truth?Collins claims that ID is a God of the gaps theory and that science is busily filling in those gaps with things other than God, and thus the theory is collapsing. If so, what then happens with faith? (page 195)CHAPTER 10: BIOLOGOS (SCIENCE AND FAITH IN HARMONY)Within Christianity there is frequently contentious debates among believers about what is the right approach/beliefs regarding creation. How do those of you who are atheists react when you witness such debates?Collins points out that BioLogos is not a scientific theory? (page 204) Does that seem like a copout for a group of scientists to be organizing around a non-scientific theory?CHAPTER 11: TRUTH SEEKERSCollins tells his conversion story in the final chapter. We have on several occasions honestly discussed the question, “What would it take for you to become a person of faith?” and “What would it take for you to become a disbeliever?” Has this book modified your answers to these questions?One of the previous books we discussed was written by the world’s leading intellectual atheist and documented his conversion to theism. This book was written by the person who may be the world’s leading medical geneticist and why he is a Christian. Has the stature of these two authors provoked any intellectual movement from those of you who are atheists?DID ANYONE HAVE A CHANGE OF OPINION (ABOUT ANYTHING) AS A RESULT OF READING THIS BOOK? HAS ANYONE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE YEAR WE HAVE SPENT READING AND DISCUSSING TOGETHER?Supplementary note: Several of the atheistic authors we have read in our book group have indicated that all inerrantists believe in a young earth. This is not true. For a survey of the different viewpoints of inerrantists you can read the following short article: https://www.christianpost.com/news/do..."
31,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14348847-henry-stoltzfus,4,"I had a hard time deciding on a rating for this book.On the one hand, the author really fails to deliver on the promise in the subtitle. There is little ""evidence for belief"" here, and I think most people who have seriously engaged with the god question will have already encountered the main arguments elsewhere.That being said, it was an enjoyable read and I came away with renewed respect for Dr. Collins and his work. Even though his attempt at reconciling the scientific and religious worldviews was ultimately unconvincing for me, he comes across as one of the most intellectually honest and sincere Christian thinkers I've encountered on this topic."

33,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43496878-chris-woody,4,"When I was a student small group leader a few years ago, I had a group of abnormally inquisitive middle schoolers. One day, one of them asked about how we as Christians should look at ""cavemen,"" and, though I don't remember what all was said from there, I know that I mentioned it is okay for Christians to accept evolution. Of course, this didn't sit well with one of my other, well-meaning students, who had never been exposed to such an idea. Even when I said that C.S. Lewis might have accepted the possibility of evolution, his response was ""No, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure he was a Christian."" This all ended with me having to have a chat with the youth pastor to ensure that I wasn't saying anything heretical. All of this is to say that, as a Christian who sees the theory of evolution as compatible with belief, I've found myself in some trouble with my church over these views.This question has been one that I've been mulling over for years: How can Christians accept the evidence that we evolved over millions of years without also saying that we don't take the sanctity of Scripture seriously. I think that Francis Collins, a world-renowned geneticist and devout believer, does a pretty good job of this. He lays out a pretty good argument that science can actually enhance our ability to appreciate God's creation, not jeopardize it. He also does a good job of arguing against both atheism and strict creationism, both of which exist on the far ends of the spectrum when it comes to the ""science-faith"" debate. I think that a lot of believers would do well to read this book and find that it is okay to trust science and still believe in a loving God. Had I read this before, I would have been able to recommend it to my student, as I'm sure Collins can articulate things and explain complex scientific concepts far better than I can."
34,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121586-aaron-barnhart,3,"Our Sunday School class has been reading this clear, concise defense of Christian faith from an evangelical and one of the country's leading geneticists. Collins is controversial with his fellow evangelicals because he argues that evolution is an accepted scientific method, and he is controversial among atheists and skeptics because he asserts that God is both the loving creator of the universe and a being who exists beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. He is, essentially, C.S. Lewis brought into the 21st century — and I say that as someone who is well aware of Lewis's literary reputation. Collins is a highly readable author, and his informal, avuncular prose is arguably more accessible to Christians today than the somewhat outdated and dense argumentation of ""Mere Christianity.""That said, I find The Language of God unsatisfying because it is largely a guide to fellow evangelicals on how to defend their faith against the atheistic meanies of the scientific world like Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. Such people, and we can throw Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens in there while we're at it, are no threat to Christianity because they comprise such a small part of the population. (Harris's argument that Collins should not have been appointed the head of the National Institutes of Health because of his Christian views is a case in point. Collins has no controversial scientific views that I know of, and he is, like most taxpayers, a professed Christian.) Many, if not most, American Christians, however, are neither evangelicals of the Collins stripe nor fundamentalist six-day creationist types (the other group this book takes aim at). Many Christians are members of non-evangelical churches who take their values to their workplace and households without a lot of fanfare or ""God talk."" Another emerging group is Gen-Y evangelicals, who grew up in these churches but disdain their parents' conservative politics and are ready to rethink what it is to be a Christian in the secular society. To me, a major challenge facing Christianity is how to coax these two sets of believers back into the public square, where their moderating influence and quiet moral strength would really come in handy right about now. With his evangelical zeal and quick answers to every problem, Collins strikes me as too much like the nut cases he claims to oppose — people whose minds are made up and aren't interested in real discussion. The Language of God may appear to be at first on the side of such reasonable people, but in the end it offers them surprisingly little help, unless they happen to go to a church much like the one Collins attends."
35,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5292677-al-datum,5,"There are a few claims made by atheists on a regular basis. They include the following:- Only the uneducated become Christians. Truly educated people, especially scientists, would never accept such nonsense- The only reason people are Christians is that they were raised to believe as they doThis book is proof that these two claims are simply nonsense. Francis Collins was an atheist prior to his scientific work on the human genome project. His career has been stellar (he led the Human Genome Project and is currently the director of the National Institutes of Health). He is a leading scientist, and certainly qualifies as a truly educated person. He was also not a Christian his entire life.Collins became a Christian when he began to look at the complexity of the human genome. As he recounts in this book, he was simply unable to remain an atheist since his scientific findings led him to the inescapable conclusion of design and a transcendent designer (this same argument has persuaded many atheists, by the way...check out Antony Flew's conversion. Or Alister McGrath. Or John Polkinghorne. Or Frank Tipler...I could go on).In this book, Collins describes his journey and shows why he came to the conclusion that God exists. He makes the case that was persuasive to him, and also builds the case that evolution and Christianity are not mutually exclusive (in fact, as philosopher William Lane Craig has said, the existence of evolution in such a short span of time [speaking of the length of time our planet has existed] would itself be a miracle, and thus proof of God).Collins does a good job of showing that science and Christianity are not enemies, but partners in the quest for truth (Christianity is, after all, largely responsible for Western Science getting its start). He shows the reasonableness of being both a leading scientist and a believer. And he destroys the two claims I listed at the beginning of this review. Not only is it possible for highly educated scientists to be raised as non-believers only to be converted to Christianity when confronted with the evidence. But Dr. Collins is living proof of this fact.Pick this book up if you'd like to read Dr. Collins' story. It's a very interesting one. And if you're open to following the evidence where it leads, it provides a persuasive case that the evidence leads directly to the existence of an all-powerful creator and designer.One other thing...if you're looking for a good, quick overview of Bayes Theorem, this book has a nice treatment of it that anyone can understand.Simply put...atheism is wrong. The evidence is inescapable."
36,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1225279-clint,3,"3.0 - In this book Collins explains how he harmonizes his belief in God with his understanding of evolution and other scientific processes involved in the creation of our universe. While I don't agree with every conclusion that Collins reaches, his honest and reasonable approach make this a very interesting book. He does a good job of giving a broad-brush description of the major scientific theories involved (big bang and evolution) and evidence for them. His explanations of DNA, how it's used, and how it provides further evidence of evolutionary processes was particularly interesting. I felt his establishment of evolution as truth was a little lacking, as there were a few evolutionary question marks that weren't acknowledged, or weren't addressed as thoroughly as I'd have liked. His arguments in favor of God were based primarily on the philosophical ideas of Moral Law and universal longing for God as presented by C. S. Lewis. While he touched on some physical evidences of a Creator, such as the beautiful mathematical connection with nature and its laws, based on the title I was expecting more. Just as his establishment of evolution was lacking, I found his establishment of God also lacking. He proclaimed Moral Law as his most convincing evidence, yet failed to really establish any sort of spiritual-based evidence. I realize that spiritual evidence is subjective and it deals more on a personal level, but isn't that how it should be? Faith is a personal decision, salvation is a personal issue, our relationship with God is personal, so the spiritual evidence for him should be personal. The bottom line of the book though was that science and faith can and should happily coexist. Truth should be in harmony with truth. Science cannot prove nor disprove the existance and role of a Creator, all it can do is shed light on how the creations behave. "
37,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"Dr. Collins articulates the two sides of the argument (faith v. science) well - and then demonstrates how the argument really shouldn't exist at all as both faith and science are involved in the search for Truth, albeit with different tools and methods. Nothing spectacularly new, in fact he leans heavily on others' words, notably C.S. Lewis, but also many others from Copernicus to Augustine to generally good effect. Hard to judge how convincing he was since I already agreed with most of his premises and assertions.Brief, helpful review of biological reproduction of DNA was clearly explained without either condescending to the reader or assuming the reader remembered every detail from Biology 101.For more book reviews, visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."
38,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312471-karen-l,3,"I liked this book but I did not love it. Why? Well, I have to say that as other critics of this book have noted, he does quote Lewis a little too much. I love C. S. Lewis and agreed with the author on many points yet I would have rather had him quote a little more of a variety of influences.Still, I did find his stories interesting and his ability to make science accessible to the non science layman very helpful. The book contains a lot of good information and most definitely could boost the faith of someone who is a doubter."
39,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1647255-fire-kovarovic,1,"The reviews were so promising... I expected a philosophical treatise but received a shallow description of one man's career and how he came to assume a life of faith. While there might be a place for this sort of literature, it was not what I was looking for. I clearly was not a member of the target audience."
40,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,4,I saw this author one afternoon on the Beeb and checked out his book from the library. I have always been disgusted with the fundamentalist belief that it is either science or faith. This book is a wonderful statement for the idea that science is evidence of God in action. I really enjoyed this book. It even re-awakened a sense of faith that the Bush administration had nearly destroyed.
41,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29591849-elinor,3,"This was pretty great. Relied heavily on CS Lewis for the apologetics, but gave a lot of interesting insight on the biology/science side of things."
42,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62738513-richard-webb,2,"Devoted to reconciling Judeo-Christians and evolutionists. Misses many opportunities to do so. As a renowned geneticist and leader of the Human Genome Project, reputed to be the greatest achievement of our generation, Collins team completed the first-draft mapping of the 3 billion gene sequences in DNA in 2000, and now heads the National Institutes of Health.As a Christian, Collins proposes that faith in God and faith in science can coexist and be harmonious saying, ‘We have caught the first glimpse of our instruction book, previously known only to God”.Collins boldly challenges his Darwinian colleagues: “So those who choose to be atheists must find some other basis for taking that position, evolution won’t do.” (Pg 167), and “agnosticism also runs the risk of being a cop-out,” (Pg 168). Further, he notes that distinguished agnostics who took time to consider the evidence “unexpectedly converted themselves” (Pg 168). Perhaps he wrote this book to those folks. But instead of reconciling atheistic/agnostic science to God’s Word in the Bible, Collins attempts to push the Bible toward today’s tenuous tenets of science. He first tries to build bridges to atheists by recounting common misconceptions about the Salem Witch Trials, the Crusades, and the underlying beliefs of fundamentally violent Islam; leading him to unjustified self-criticisms of Christianity (Pg 41). However, unexpurgated history shows witch trials ended because two Christian preachers objected to the execution of 20 Salem witches, ending the murder of tens of thousands in Europe. The Crusades were a last-option response to Moslems terrorizing Europe – a resurrected scourge that we must again excise as our Founders did in the 1780’s.Outside His FieldAs a Biblical apologist, Collins writes outside his field of expertise, borrowing credibility from his reputation as an eminent scientist. His discussion of suffering (Pg 43) fails to understand that all good flows from God’s highest value - LOVE Mark 12:30-31, requiring totally free will, and the inseparable freedom to not love. Love cannot be compelled (logically, anything less than totally free-will regarding an all-powerful God could easily be coercion, which God sedulously avoids). Logically then, the failure to choose love begets all evil and suffering. Should God have restrained free-will in order to prevent evil behavior? Logically, He cannot.Additionally, Collins misunderstanding the concept of dominion from Psalm 115:16 and Psalm 8:6, and how Adam ceded to satan the dominion given to Adam in Genesis 1:28, hinders Collins analysis of suffering and evil. Satan now exercises that dominion. Luke 4:6 and 2Cor 4:4 But Jesus gave us, His followers, the power to defeat satan James 4:7, John 4:4, Matt 10:8 if we will “be transformed by the renewing of [our] mind” Rom 12:2 and use that power.Collins also misunderstands (Pg 44-45), that miracles are intended to routinely follow believers: “These signs will follow those who believe” Mark 16:17 and “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out demons.” Matt 10:8 “These things you have seen me do, you will also do, and greater works than these…” John 14:12-14, and “God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders…” Heb 2:4. Perhaps a more Pentecostal understanding of believer’s authority in Eph 1:19-20 and Mark 16:17 would be helpful to him.Big BangCollins assertion that Big Bang is “well described and unlikely to be revised” is hubristic and inconsistent with history. Collins’ Big-Bang endorsement (Pg 68) fails to mention serious doubts raised by observations of counter-rotating galaxies, stars moving toward us, and quantized red-shift. Dissenting scientists question why supposedly “old” supernova exploding stars have projected materials such short distances when an old universe theory would predict extremely long distances. His assumption of a 14 billion universe age (Pg 64) ignores Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy) and radically faster speed of light at creation that promises to someday fit paleontology within the Biblical framework. Collins warns against literal interpretation of the Bible (Pg 83), but science, as an attempt to know the mind of God, would proceed more rapidly if a Biblical view of Origin informed astronomy, physics, biology, etc. Instead, atheists waste billions of taxpayer-funded research dollars constructing fairy-tales to “prove” God does not exist. “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” Rom 1:22 In contrast to Sir Isaac Newton and William Maury who researched scripture to launch their scientific inquiry, Einstein, Hawking, and many others initially presupposed a naturalistic origin and as evidence mounted, got dragged into reluctant recognition of a Creator. Biogenesis Perhaps as a professional courtesy, but with absolutely no evidence, Collins PRESUMES (Pg 89) that dirt assembled ITSELF into DNA digital code, acquired the capability of information storage, and differentiated into multiple “kinds”. We’ve not seen such baseless backward extrapolation since Darwin, in his book of speculative conjecture published without corroborating data, presumed that adaptation explains origin. Science predicated itself on the foundational principle that there is God’s discoverable order in the universe - down to the structure of sub-atomic particles. Order sans intelligence is logically impossible! Yet scientists thrill at each new fairy-tale atheistic deception, and deem anything plausible when multiplied by millions of years. Possibly the Rosetta Stone was formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion (wink).  Collins draws no clear distinction between ADAPTATATION (micro-evolution) and ORIGIN (macro-evolution).Collins says random assembly of molecules may have occurred. He tries to torpedo the entropy argument against biogenesis (the fairy-tale that chemistry begat biology vs. the truth that everything degrades) with an analogy that ignores the essential element of purpose-driven order, plus sustainability, and replication (Pg. 92). Molecules bumping into molecules, like people in a crowd, does not infer or confer a relationship, or transfer properties, or create order. There is no reason for the new combination to persist, incorporate, amalgamate, congregate, consolidate, or replicate.He allows that God could have created the first DNA, but offers no rationale for why God would have stopped with one or a few samples, and thus enjoy the fun of creating diversity. He warns against a “God of the Gaps” (Pg 93) but fails to acknowledge the eventual overturning of nearly every contravening “scientific” presumption, hypothesis, and theory to date. Instead of asking, “How did God do this?” the world supports vain imaginations (hubristic fairy-tales) that eventually fail. Contrast this with the greatest physicist/mathmetician ever, Sir Isaac Newton’s 1704 manuscript describing his quest to extract scientific information from the Bible. Newton’s Laws of Motion and Gravity have withstood the test of time. Perhaps there is a correlation between seeking God and finding truth.Collins warns against betting on a literal Genesis occurrence, then he ventures into paleontology dogma (Pg 93), failing to include recent creationist evidence that disputes long-held scientific beliefs. Neither does he proffer any evidence for the claim that extinct ”kinds” are the missing transitional forms.Self-DevelopmentCollins introduces Darwin’s assertion (which he ultimately adopts) that God may have “created a few original forms capable of self-development” (Pg 98). Biologists mis-use anthropomorphic terms like “strategy” saying that bugs develop a strategy to overcome pesticides. Ridiculous! If self-development is possible, the most intelligent of all God’s creation would have, by now, a bigger penis! Kindly pardon this graphic illustration needed to dramatize my point.Emulating Darwin, Collins takes pains to point out possible harmonious interpretations, but instead of accepting the Bible as true, and reconciling the current nascent state of struggling science with it, Collins incorrectly proclaims that “no serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life” (Pg 99). He should visit Institute for Creation Research or Answers in Genesis or Creation.com to be enlightened by an ever-growing body of scientists whose compelling evidence refutes his assertion. My own feeble survey of the beauty and apparently gratuitous diversity of amazing fish (28,000 species) is sufficient to understand that God intended to give a glimpse of his power, magnificence, and divinity thru our observation of what He made. Romans 1:20.AdaptationCollins cites adaptations in stickleback fish, malaria, HIV, and flu as examples of evolution (Pg 132), but each degraded mutation is just a variant of itself, an adaptation. The flu virus is still a flu virus; it does not morph into an HIV virus or a new disease, or new “kind”. Even purposeful (with intelligence) attempts to modify fruitfly genes over thousands of generations only result in mutant fruitflies, some with wings sticking out of their heads.His refutation of Special Creation’s “Ex Nihilo Species” (Pg 137) is feeble in that he illogically ignores God’s prerogative to re-use successful patterns. Why should God start anew with each “kind” He created? The Bible repeatedly says“after his kind” (e.g. Gen 1:24 Webster’s version is the most grammatically correct) which reinforces that God created multiple kinds of plants and animals. One can only imagine how much fun God must have had with the variations.DNAIt appears that DNA is comprised of error-correcting code like a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). If a piece is lost or corrupted, the piece can be reconstructed by referencing the other pieces. The math and logic needed to accomplish this feat was developed in computers long before it was recognized in DNA. Neither happened without intelligent design!Normally I would avoid criticism tangential to this distinguished scientist’s area of expertise, but Collins makes a special point of calling caspace-12 a “nonfunctional gene” (Pg 139) to argue against Special Creation.Certainly, it is illogical to presume that God would design a gene with 45% flotsam and jetsam (Pg 136). Having been a computer programmer I visualize genes as analogous to a computer memory-dump in which data and instructions mix within the hexadecimal strings. I remember it was frequently easier to spot data (analogous to GAA and GAG recipe for glutamic acid) than to identify instructions within the memory dump. Doesn’t it make sense to pursue an inquiry into what Collins dismissively calls Ancient Repetitive Elements (AREs) as possible instructions governing the GAA and GAG? I could find nowhere that this cellular biology expert presents the fact that DNA requires 75 proteins to exist, but proteins require DNA for construction. Using this undeniable fact, he could have made a much stronger case for God.Young EarthCollins attacks Young Earth creationists (Pg 172-179) saying “Young Earth creationism has reached a point of intellectual bankruptcy, both in its science and in its theology”. He assumes processes like deuterium decay always functioned as now, assumes light had to travel from distant stars (Pg 176) as opposed to beams having been created simultaneous with, or BEFORE (Gen 1:3) the stars (Gen 1:14). He fails to cite these arguments for a young earth fitting a Bible timeline:•	Ocean salinity and sediment deposits at river mouths are consistent with a young earth.•	The number of exploding star (supernova) remnants (SNRs) in all three stages is consistent with a 7000 year-young universe.•	Evidence that God did not create an embryonic universe, but a fully functioning interactive SYSTEM, manifests in plants that require creatures for pollination.•	Due to Barry Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy, the physical manifestation of Planck’s constant) The speed of light and electrons has decreased asymptotically since Creation. Light appears to have 30% faster in Jesus day, 400 times faster in Abraham’s day, and ten million times faster prior to 3,000BC.•	Speed of light may be increasing as it encounters less ZPE at the outer edges of space. Just as light speeds up after it emerges from water, allow me to speculate that the nature of light may be such (otherwise, what is the energy source?) that it goes at a fixed speed except while ZPE, water, atmosphere, and space dust etc. hinders.•	Electrons bouncing erratically off ZPE as they negotiate the ZPE hurdles on their orbital track, probably explains the “Uncertainty Principle” of quantum physics. Electrons are moving slower too. Calculations of age based on atomic decay need extreme revision.•	We are simply peering thru a longer taillight beam as the once-close stars travel away. The light appears redder because the lower-energy photons were redder, not a Doppler effect as suggested by Hubbel’s red-shift. We cannot observe light from outside the beam because it always heads directly toward us. The speed is relative to our own speed.When people study the Bible’s supernatural truths, fulfilled prophesies, structure, its heptadic code (7’s), and gematria (Jewish numbering) sufficiently to know that the Bible is, beyond doubt, directly from God, then their worldview is firmly rooted in truth. God’s account of how He created the universe, and us, is not an allegory as Collins maintains. Successful (real, true) science, like Bible study, is an attempt to know the mind of God.Science hinders itself with materialistic terms of engagement that stifle investigation. Our physics is likely only a shadow of a larger reality hinted at by mathematical postulations of additional dimensions we cannot yet comprehend. We should think of our material universe as a subset of a larger (supernatural) reality. Science thwarts progress by clinging to foolish atheistic traditions designed to deny the existence of God. Beware of OrthodoxyEducator John Taylor Gatto (author of Dumbing Us Down) told me schooling trains people to act like fish (swim in unison). Joe Bobier, inventor of Single-Cycle Modulation said “If I had been an electrical engineer, they would have convinced me this is not possible.” The reason breakthrough ideas are coming from sophomore high schoolers (Jack Andraka’s cancer detector, Simon Tsaoussis, two-transistor ternary RAM) is that they are not overly encumbered by orthodoxy. Revolutionary, disruptive, correct ideas encounter establishment ridicule as Dr. Robert O. Becker describes in his journey The Body Electric. Collins incorrectly struggles to conform to atheist/agnostic orthodoxy instead of standing firmly on God’s Word. I strongly urge him to revise this book."
43,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,4,"Francis Collins is a renowned scientist -- the former director of the Human Genome Project -- and also a Christian. In a time when science and faith can seem so diametrically opposed, it was encouraging to read one person's view of how he balances the two perspectives, and sees them as complementary rather than hostile to each other. I don't know how well this book will speak to all the different perspectives it could potentially be speaking to. I don't know whether an atheist or agnostic reader will be convinced or touched by the arguments and ideas presented here, since I am neither of those. It does cover quite a few topics -- from Collins' path to faith from his initial atheism; to a discussion of both scientific and faith-based approaches to worldviews, covering atheism, agnosticism, intelligent design, young-earth creationism, as well as theistic evolution, which he terms ""BioLogos""; as well as an overview of human DNA and what the Human Genome Project was aiming to accomplish; and an appendix devoted to bioethics, there was a lot to take in here (though I found it a relatively quick read).I think I was able to get the scientific gist of most of what he was writing about, since this was written for a layperson, but obviously there's a lot beneath the surface. I found the bits about the human genome most interesting. Faith-wise, numerous C.S. Lewis quotes will always draw me in, though I'm sure I'm not from the same ""bent"" of Christianity as Collins (though the same could be said for Lewis). But I valued the discussions of the various intersections of faith and science in regards to worldview (with an emphasis on origins).I don't agree with all of Collins' views here (though I can appreciate that we can still hold the same faith despite differences), and in many cases I don't even understand enough yet to know whether I agree or disagree. But I'm still grateful for his perspective, because it has helped me to clarify my thinking on some things, which includes some errors and inconsistencies in perspectives that I have held or entertained. I also appreciate him incorporating other thinkers (both scientists and theologians) into his arguments, because many quotes he uses are also interesting and make me want to learn more.I especially appreciate his call to not view God's Word and his creation as being ""at war with itself,"" as expressed in this quote that I think sums up his views nicely:“Will we turn our backs on science because it is perceived as a threat to God, abandoning all the promise of advancing our understanding of nature and applying that to the alleviation of suffering and the betterment of humankind? Alternatively, will we turn our backs on faith, concluding that science has rendered the spiritual life no longer necessary, and that traditional religious symbols can now be replaced by engravings of the double helix on our altars?Both of these choices are profoundly dangerous. Both deny truth. Both will diminish the nobility of humankind. Both will be devastating to our future. And both are unnecessary. The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. He can be worshipped in the cathedral or in the laboratory. His creation is majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful - and it cannot be at war with itself. Only we imperfect humans can start such battles. And only we can end them.”"

His first objective was to sieve Darwinian Evolution from atheism, on which he sold me. His second was to defend Theistic Evolution, in which he thoroughly failed. On the first matter, he created the best starting apologetic for scientific atheists that I've read. Collins was once an atheist. He took apart Dawkins. He glossed over true differences between DE and theology for the sake of (a false) harmony, but believably estranged DE and materialism. He seems to be a real Christian, however it is of course always hard to reliably tell. He professed belief and a relationship, which sounded genuine, but he kept referring to the value of other faith traditions, never called Jesus the only Way, and otherwise generally retreated to what sounded vaguely like a ""it works for me"" stance.On defending TE, he hung his cap on Darwinian Evolution. He erected a caricature of Young Earth Creationism and proceeded to beat the straw out of it. He didn't just oppose YEC and Intelligent Design, he called them untenable and impossible. His evidences were quite dated for 2006. Such faulty data that he determined to irrefutably support DE included: the DNA similarity between humans, chimps and mice; the immutability of isotopic dating and isotope half-lives (despite no evidence of universe conditions past 100 years ago or so); Occam's Razor; and the proposed reducible complexity of blood clots, flagella and the human eye (the former two of which were plausible, but not irrefutable). He got right the fact that scientific truth and spiritual truth cannot contradict, but he promoted the DE argument as overwhelming instead of its true, overwhelming ambiguity. He resembled Ptolemy, accepting the noticeable errors in satellite epicycles rather than telling the world that the earth revolves around the Sun, all for the sake of a contrived peace. His views have been thoroughly and convincingly refuted by the publications of Answers in Genesis, and plausibly so by Gerald Schroeder's creation-physics model (which reconciles YEC and OEC) in his book, The Science of God."
45,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6422812-hawley,4,"Only took me a whole semester to finish this book, oops! Still though, I thought Collins’s argument for theistic evolution was compelling. As a scientist and a person of faith, I’ve never seen incompatibility between the two domains, but haven’t been able to clearly articulate my beliefs as theistic evolution. I am deeply compelled by the Moral Law argument and this book helped to strengthen my beliefs. I found myself coming back to this book and Collins’s arguments frequently over the course of the semester in my Philosophy of Religion class. We didn’t talk about theistic evolution directly, but The Language of God supplemented a lot of my coursework well. I was less compelled by Collins’s arguments for Christianity in particular toward the end of the book, but I appreciate his insistence that faith is a personal journey we must all come to for ourselves. Overall, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to understand more about science, faith, and the relationship between the two. "
46,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7287572-grace,2,"A manifesto for theistic evolution.Every time I read one of these books I feel smacked around and uneasy. I read Darwin's Black Box and felt compelled by Behe's explanations. I was similarly compelled by Collins's dismantling of Behe, though. What all of this comes down to is that I am a layman having to trust whoever writes these books to tell me what they wish, leave out & skip over what they wish, and interpret everything for me. The only solution is to go back to school for my own PhD in biology, I guess. Honestly, though, I would skip reading this book. If you want the good faith parts just read Mere Christianity or better yet C. S. Lewis's entire bibliography. If you want the good science parts, just read any mainstream college molecular biology textbook, or whatever the latest Richard Dawkins book is."
47,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57363039-emily-monroe,5,"For someone familiar with both Christianity and science, this is a great summary type of read that seeks to reconcile what many sources today tout as unreconcilable. Collins provides brief backgrounds on both apologetics (belief) and genetics (science). If a reader is not familiar with either of those topics, this book is not a good introduction. As a believer with a science and engineering background, I enjoyed learning his perspective. Collins is frank in stating that young earth creationism is a dangerous concept, and he gave language and examples to support it. He is also frank in saying that science does not and cannot explain everything about our existence and the meaning of life. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and took a lot away from it that I will use in conversations with both believers and non-believers."
48,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23188545-josh,4,"More and more,if you are willing to open your eyes, you will be confronted with those who have differing views and beliefs than your own. The temptation is great to simply dismiss any idea or worldview that seems contrary to the one you already hold. My brother characterizes, and to a degree caricatures, the typical Christian response to contrary ideas as that of a petulant child putting his fingers in his ears and repeating, “I CAN'T HEAR YOU” to drown out the sound of anything that might question what is held so dearly.As a Christian,who deals with many Christians, it is hard to not acquiesce to his diagnosis. So often, those who should be genuinely searching out truth wherever it lies (seeing as how all truth is God's truth) will allow ourselves to remain ignorant out of fear that our beliefs will come crashing down and our God with them. If this fear is not present,then the possibility of ever having to admit some degree of error in our interpretation of the Bible or of the world or of our self is more than our pride can stand.Labels abound. If you believe in health care for all or government based social services then you are a “communist”. If you believe that some of the Bible is not to be taken literally, you're a “liberal” who does not believe the Bible. If you preach grace you are “antinomian” and if you preach responsibility and fidelity, you are a “legalist”. The word “heretic” gets thrown around on anyone not conforming to “the Bible” which would be more accurately and honesty communicated as “my interpretation of the Bible”.All these labels do in most cases is perpetuate ignorance and division, making it more convenient and efficient for us as we sit in God's seat of judgment on any who might not submit themselves to what we “know” as truth. Enter Francis Collins. Talk about a guy getting it from all angles. Collins was the head of the Human Genome Project, the scientific research to map out the human genome. The work done under his leadership has led to us have a genetic map of human beings. The benefit of this in the war against disease and defect is incapable of being overstated. The work God has done through this man and his leadership is amazing.And therein lies the reason he receives such criticism. Collins, a biologist, stood in the Oval Office with then President Clinton and nodded approvingly when President Clinton remarked that we could now see the “language of God” used in creation. How a professional biologist could hold to an “inherently unscientific” belief in God and approve of such theistic speak offended many in the biological community. That a committed Christian could believed in the “inherently atheistic” doctrine of evolution, offended many in the Christian community.That is the backdrop for the book, The Language of God by Francis Collins. Collins work is one part biography, one part scientific treatise and one part apologetic. Collins spends time going over his life, and his own path from atheism, to agnosticism, and finally to his firm belief in the theism of Biblical Christianity. The biographical aspects of the book are all centered on how he has related his lifelong love of science with his lifelong struggle with faith,and it is quite engrossing. Even as the biographical aspects of the book focus on Collins' own personal path, the way he presents it is overtly apologetic. He constantly goes over how he was convinced of the truth of theism and eventually the Christian truth claim, not simply recounting the fact that he was convinced. The way the apologetic is intertwined with the biographical narrative reminds one of reading C.S. Lewis when he deals with the same subject. Based on the references to and quotes from Lewis, this may not have been intentional but certainly it is without shock that some of Lewis' writing style was adopted by Collins.The apologetic nature of the book is not limited solely to a defense of the Christian faith. The idea of this book is how to rectify a belief in current scientific trends and the Christian faith. In doing so, Collins argues that Darwinian Evolution is true and that it is NOT contrary to the Christian faith. With so much teaching for and evidence of evolution, Collins' devotes a chapter to each of the possible responses to evolution. These chapters are Atheism and Agnosticism (When Science Trumps Faith), Creationism (When Faith Trumps Science), Intelligent Design (When Science Needs Divine Help),and BioLogos (Faith and Science in Harmony). Collins is basically fair in his assessment of the opposing views, but throughout the chapters it is clear that he is building to what he holds as truth by dismantling what he holds as false(or even silly). Collins closes with pleas to believers to not abandon science and scientists to not abandon faith.As I read the book I had to remind myself that Collins is not a theologian, he is a biologist. His interpretation of some Christian doctrines is off what he seems to hold as essential is debated amongst Christians. Some of the history he cites is incorrect and the citations could have been more thorough, especially on some instances where no citation was given. Also, there were times where Collins began speaking exclusively to his peers, losing the reader with limited scientific knowledge in the process.While this book is far from perfect, it is a great read. It would benefit anyone involved in the evolution debate(that would be anyone who has any religious, secular or scientific interest....everyone) to read this book and consider the arguments made and data presented"
49,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58566782-shane-allen,5,"A must read for those who love science and Jesus Christ. Of course the author of science is compatible with the science He created. It’s hard to believe this is still or has ever been an issue. However, it’s definitely worth the read just to hear his perspective on evolution. I’m not quite sold on the science but he is very persuasive. I’ve been reading both sides of the theistic evolution-intelligent design debate for a while now and I’m not convinced humans have fully learned enough yet to die on any hill. One thing is for certain– Francis Collins truly loves Jesus and it grieves me when Christians attack each other over non-essential doctrines not explicit in the Bible. Remember, we are all bothers and sisters in Christ. "

This book details out the driving questioning skepticism of science, details some of the journey of the DNA discoveries, and some of the probable limits of 'designer DNA'. It raises questions, but importantly, it defines what science can and cannot discover and why faith and science are not in conflict. For me, it helped clarify issues surrounding stem cell research, some things regarding evolution, and other hotbed controversial issues without me feeling like I had to 'check my faith in God' at the door in order to engage in the things this scientist was saying.

For information on the Atheist Christian Book Club you can go to the website at http://atheistchristianbookclub.com/ or seek us out on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/AtheistChris... .CHAPTER 1: FROM ATHEISM TO BELIEFCollins says that for him agnosticism was a place of retreat where he wouldn’t actually have to seriously consider the evidence for or against belief. That is obviously not true of those in this book group, but do you think it is generally true for most agnostics? Is agnosticism a position that is held in order to avoid the question of God’s existence altogether?Collins writes that the Moral Law was the primary thing that made him reconsider his atheism. What about those in our book group. Is there a “one thing” that creates cognitive dissonance and makes the atheists in the group pause to reconsider?CHAPTER 2: THE WAR OF THE WORLDVIEWSA similar question for the Christians; is there a question that makes you uncomfortable with your faith? Collins talks about four questions that he struggled with during the early days of his newfound belief. Is there a question like that that makes the Christians in the group sometimes doubt? If not currently, was there a question you struggled with at some time in your life?Collins lists four difficult questions that he struggled with as a new believer; (1) Isn’t the idea of God just wish-fulfillment?, (2) What about all the harm done in the name of religion?, (3) Why would a loving God allow suffering in the world?, and (4) How can a rational person believe in miracles? Were you satisfied with the answers Collins has arrived at and shares here?CHAPTER 3: THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSECollins writes, “Immanuel Kant wrote: ""Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the Moral Law within."" I have heard some former atheist/agnostics similarly indicate that these two things, nature and the moral law, seemed to be ever present in the back of their mind/heart as an indication that there had to be something more than just the material even when they were most intellectually opposed to the idea of God. I’m curious if those two concerns have any influence on the atheists/agnostics in our book group?Collins writes, “Based on these and other observations, physicists are in agreement that the universe began as an infinitely dense, dimensionless point of pure energy. The laws of physics breakdown in this circumstance, referred to as a ""singularity."" Is there the same kind of unanimity among the members of this book group as there seems to be among physicists? Collins seems to think that the question of origins hinges upon the question “What happened before the Big Bang?” Would the book club members agree?Collins' timeline (number of years) differs from some of the Christians in the room. For those who hold to a young earth theory of creation, how important do you think it is to adhere to a “thousands of years” formula instead of a “millions or billions of years” formula?The question of old earth vs. young earth is primarily a discussion held within the camp of Christianity. However, how does it affect those of you who are atheistic/agnostic?Collins writes of the Anthropic Principle, that “The existence of a universe as we know it rests upon a knife edge of improbability.” (page 73) This same fine-tuning argument also had an influence on the author of a previous book we read, Anthony Flew. The author gives three possibilities; (1) an infinite number of universes, (2) we are just very, very lucky, or (3) The precise tuning of all of the physical constants and physical laws to make intelligent life possible is not an accident, but reflects the action of the one who created the universe in the first place. What do you think?Collins quotes a number of famous scientists who believe that “""It would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun in just this way, except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us."" (pages 75ff). Do you think that Stephen Hawking, Freeman Dyson, Arno Penzias and other such scientists (such as Collins, himself) forfeit their scientific bona fides by taking such a position?The author claims that “there is nothing inherently in conflict between the idea of a creator God and what science has revealed.” Do you agree or disagree with him? Why? (page 81) The author further claims that “the opening words of Genesis (""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"") are entirely compatible with the Big Bang.” Do you agree or disagree with him? (pages 82-83)CHAPTER 4: LIFE ON EARTH – OF MICROBES AND MENCollins says that “no serious scientist would currently claim that a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life is at hand” but warns Christians not to result to a God of the gaps apologetic. He encourages them to adopt an approach using “positive reasons, based on knowledge, rather than default assumptions based on (a temporary) lack of knowledge.” However, for those of you who are atheists, does “the inability of modern science to develop a statistically probable mechanism” for the origin of life give you any intellectual pause? (pages 92-93)Collins writes, “No serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life. In fact, the relatedness of all species through the mechanism of evolution is such a profound foundation for the understanding of all biology that it is difficult to imagine how one would study life without it.” Is this true? Are there no serious biologists that doubt the theory of evolution? Is Collins being fair to those who disagree with him on this matter? (page 99)CHAPTER 5: DECIPHERING GOD’S INSTRUCTION BOOK – THE LESSONS OF THE HUMAN GENOMECollins asserts that the difference between macroevolution and microevolution is “increasingly seen to be artificial. But then to illustrate it is a distinction without a difference he uses the example of a stickleback fish with armor becoming a stickleback fish without armor. I think most critics of Darwinism would find this example not to be compelling. A fish becomes a fish. A virus becomes a slightly different virus. How is this evidence for the “tree of life”? Was his example sufficient for you to think that the distinction between macroevolution and microevolution is “arbitrary”? (pages 131-132)In reference to similarities between human and mouse genomes, Collins writes, “This evidence alone does not, of course, prove a common ancestor; from a creationist perspective, such similarities could simply demonstrate that God used successful design principles over and over again. As we shall see, however, and as was foreshadowed above by the discussion of ""silent"" mutations in protein-coding regions, the detailed study of genomes has rendered that interpretation virtually untenable—not only about all other living things, but also about ourselves.” Do you think that the evidence provided by Collins actually supports his claim that it is untenable to believe that God used successful design principles over and over again? (pages 133-137)Does Collins provide compelling evidence from genetic similarities to prove that humans and other life forms have a common ancestor? (pages 137- 142)CHAPTER 6: GENESIS, GALILEO, AND DARWINCollins writes about the emotional distance between Christian believers who are adherents of Darwinism and those who reject this biological theory. What do you think about this? Is it difficult for these to “sides” to coexist in theological harmony? (pages 145-147)CHAPTER 7: OPTION 1 – ATHEISM AND AGNOSTICISM (WHEN SCIENCE TRUMPS FAITH)Collins writes about the hostility between some believers and unbelievers. How common is this? Why do you think this is so? (pages 159ff)The author of our book quotes Dawkins as saying, “""It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus, 'mad cow' disease, and many others, but I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.” Do the atheists in our group believe that faith is evil? (page 163)Collins quotes Stephen Jay Gould as saying that since “Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny” the existence of God. Do you agree with Gould? (page 166)The author refers to four different groups:1. Strong Atheists = have a firm conviction that no deities exist.2. Weak Atheism = the absence of belief in the existence of a God or gods3. Strong Agnostics = believes there is no way that human kind will “ever” know if there is a God4. Weak Atheists = believes only that it is not possible to know “yet” whether or not there is a GodWhat is the composition of atheists/agnostics in our group in regard to these four descriptions?CHAPTER 8: OPTION 2 - CREATIONISM (WHEN FAITH TRUMPS SCIENCE)Does Collins accurately reflect the beliefs of most Young Earth Creationists when he claims that they believe in Microevolution, which he defines as small changes within a species, but do not believe in Macroevolution, which he describes as one species evolving into another species? Many of the young earth creationists that I know are much more flexible with the definition of Microevolution, and define it as changing from one genus, or one order, into another genus or order. (page 172) Does this matter, or is this a distinction without a difference?Is Collins being a bit hysterical when he declares that should YEC scientific claims be true then, “it would lead to a complete and irreversible collapse of the sciences of physics, chemistry, cosmology, geology, and biology.”? (page 174) He makes it sound down right apocalyptic; are YEC that dangerous?CHAPTER 9: OPTION 3 – INTELLIGENT DESIGN (WHEN SCIENCE NEEDS DIVINE HELP)Collins asserts that if the logic of Intelligent Design “truly had merit on scientific grounds, one would expect that the rank and file of working biologists would also show interest in pursuing these ideas, especially since a significant number of biologists are also believers.” (page 187) However, haven’t historians of science like Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) written that just the opposite is true? Does not history tell us that science that none of the revolutionary paradigmatic changes that science has undergone were quickly accepted on the basis of reason/evidence alone? Is head-counting an appropriate way to determine truth?Collins claims that ID is a God of the gaps theory and that science is busily filling in those gaps with things other than God, and thus the theory is collapsing. If so, what then happens with faith? (page 195)CHAPTER 10: BIOLOGOS (SCIENCE AND FAITH IN HARMONY)Within Christianity there is frequently contentious debates among believers about what is the right approach/beliefs regarding creation. How do those of you who are atheists react when you witness such debates?Collins points out that BioLogos is not a scientific theory? (page 204) Does that seem like a copout for a group of scientists to be organizing around a non-scientific theory?CHAPTER 11: TRUTH SEEKERSCollins tells his conversion story in the final chapter. We have on several occasions honestly discussed the question, “What would it take for you to become a person of faith?” and “What would it take for you to become a disbeliever?” Has this book modified your answers to these questions?One of the previous books we discussed was written by the world’s leading intellectual atheist and documented his conversion to theism. This book was written by the person who may be the world’s leading medical geneticist and why he is a Christian. Has the stature of these two authors provoked any intellectual movement from those of you who are atheists?DID ANYONE HAVE A CHANGE OF OPINION (ABOUT ANYTHING) AS A RESULT OF READING THIS BOOK? HAS ANYONE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE YEAR WE HAVE SPENT READING AND DISCUSSING TOGETHER?Supplementary note: Several of the atheistic authors we have read in our book group have indicated that all inerrantists believe in a young earth. This is not true. For a survey of the different viewpoints of inerrantists you can read the following short article: https://www.christianpost.com/news/do..."

There is little ""evidence for belief"" here, and I think most people who have seriously engaged with the god question will have already encountered the main arguments elsewhere.That being said, it was an enjoyable read and I came away with renewed respect for Dr. Collins and his work. Even though his attempt at reconciling the scientific and religious worldviews was ultimately unconvincing for me, he comes across as one of the most intellectually honest and sincere Christian thinkers I've encountered on this topic."

63,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43496878-chris-woody,4,"When I was a student small group leader a few years ago, I had a group of abnormally inquisitive middle schoolers. One day, one of them asked about how we as Christians should look at ""cavemen,"" and, though I don't remember what all was said from there, I know that I mentioned it is okay for Christians to accept evolution. Of course, this didn't sit well with one of my other, well-meaning students, who had never been exposed to such an idea. Even when I said that C.S. Lewis might have accepted the possibility of evolution, his response was ""No, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure he was a Christian."" This all ended with me having to have a chat with the youth pastor to ensure that I wasn't saying anything heretical. All of this is to say that, as a Christian who sees the theory of evolution as compatible with belief, I've found myself in some trouble with my church over these views.This question has been one that I've been mulling over for years: How can Christians accept the evidence that we evolved over millions of years without also saying that we don't take the sanctity of Scripture seriously. I think that Francis Collins, a world-renowned geneticist and devout believer, does a pretty good job of this. He lays out a pretty good argument that science can actually enhance our ability to appreciate God's creation, not jeopardize it. He also does a good job of arguing against both atheism and strict creationism, both of which exist on the far ends of the spectrum when it comes to the ""science-faith"" debate. I think that a lot of believers would do well to read this book and find that it is okay to trust science and still believe in a loving God. Had I read this before, I would have been able to recommend it to my student, as I'm sure Collins can articulate things and explain complex scientific concepts far better than I can."
64,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121586-aaron-barnhart,3,"Our Sunday School class has been reading this clear, concise defense of Christian faith from an evangelical and one of the country's leading geneticists. Collins is controversial with his fellow evangelicals because he argues that evolution is an accepted scientific method, and he is controversial among atheists and skeptics because he asserts that God is both the loving creator of the universe and a being who exists beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. He is, essentially, C.S. Lewis brought into the 21st century — and I say that as someone who is well aware of Lewis's literary reputation. Collins is a highly readable author, and his informal, avuncular prose is arguably more accessible to Christians today than the somewhat outdated and dense argumentation of ""Mere Christianity.""That said, I find The Language of God unsatisfying because it is largely a guide to fellow evangelicals on how to defend their faith against the atheistic meanies of the scientific world like Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. Such people, and we can throw Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens in there while we're at it, are no threat to Christianity because they comprise such a small part of the population. (Harris's argument that Collins should not have been appointed the head of the National Institutes of Health because of his Christian views is a case in point. Collins has no controversial scientific views that I know of, and he is, like most taxpayers, a professed Christian.) Many, if not most, American Christians, however, are neither evangelicals of the Collins stripe nor fundamentalist six-day creationist types (the other group this book takes aim at). Many Christians are members of non-evangelical churches who take their values to their workplace and households without a lot of fanfare or ""God talk."" Another emerging group is Gen-Y evangelicals, who grew up in these churches but disdain their parents' conservative politics and are ready to rethink what it is to be a Christian in the secular society. To me, a major challenge facing Christianity is how to coax these two sets of believers back into the public square, where their moderating influence and quiet moral strength would really come in handy right about now. With his evangelical zeal and quick answers to every problem, Collins strikes me as too much like the nut cases he claims to oppose — people whose minds are made up and aren't interested in real discussion. The Language of God may appear to be at first on the side of such reasonable people, but in the end it offers them surprisingly little help, unless they happen to go to a church much like the one Collins attends."
65,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5292677-al-datum,5,"There are a few claims made by atheists on a regular basis. They include the following:- Only the uneducated become Christians. Truly educated people, especially scientists, would never accept such nonsense- The only reason people are Christians is that they were raised to believe as they doThis book is proof that these two claims are simply nonsense. Francis Collins was an atheist prior to his scientific work on the human genome project. His career has been stellar (he led the Human Genome Project and is currently the director of the National Institutes of Health). He is a leading scientist, and certainly qualifies as a truly educated person. He was also not a Christian his entire life.Collins became a Christian when he began to look at the complexity of the human genome. As he recounts in this book, he was simply unable to remain an atheist since his scientific findings led him to the inescapable conclusion of design and a transcendent designer (this same argument has persuaded many atheists, by the way...check out Antony Flew's conversion. Or Alister McGrath. Or John Polkinghorne. Or Frank Tipler...I could go on).In this book, Collins describes his journey and shows why he came to the conclusion that God exists. He makes the case that was persuasive to him, and also builds the case that evolution and Christianity are not mutually exclusive (in fact, as philosopher William Lane Craig has said, the existence of evolution in such a short span of time [speaking of the length of time our planet has existed] would itself be a miracle, and thus proof of God).Collins does a good job of showing that science and Christianity are not enemies, but partners in the quest for truth (Christianity is, after all, largely responsible for Western Science getting its start). He shows the reasonableness of being both a leading scientist and a believer. And he destroys the two claims I listed at the beginning of this review. Not only is it possible for highly educated scientists to be raised as non-believers only to be converted to Christianity when confronted with the evidence. But Dr. Collins is living proof of this fact.Pick this book up if you'd like to read Dr. Collins' story. It's a very interesting one. And if you're open to following the evidence where it leads, it provides a persuasive case that the evidence leads directly to the existence of an all-powerful creator and designer.One other thing...if you're looking for a good, quick overview of Bayes Theorem, this book has a nice treatment of it that anyone can understand.Simply put...atheism is wrong. The evidence is inescapable."
66,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1225279-clint,3,"3.0 - In this book Collins explains how he harmonizes his belief in God with his understanding of evolution and other scientific processes involved in the creation of our universe. While I don't agree with every conclusion that Collins reaches, his honest and reasonable approach make this a very interesting book. He does a good job of giving a broad-brush description of the major scientific theories involved (big bang and evolution) and evidence for them. His explanations of DNA, how it's used, and how it provides further evidence of evolutionary processes was particularly interesting. I felt his establishment of evolution as truth was a little lacking, as there were a few evolutionary question marks that weren't acknowledged, or weren't addressed as thoroughly as I'd have liked. His arguments in favor of God were based primarily on the philosophical ideas of Moral Law and universal longing for God as presented by C. S. Lewis. While he touched on some physical evidences of a Creator, such as the beautiful mathematical connection with nature and its laws, based on the title I was expecting more. Just as his establishment of evolution was lacking, I found his establishment of God also lacking. He proclaimed Moral Law as his most convincing evidence, yet failed to really establish any sort of spiritual-based evidence. I realize that spiritual evidence is subjective and it deals more on a personal level, but isn't that how it should be? Faith is a personal decision, salvation is a personal issue, our relationship with God is personal, so the spiritual evidence for him should be personal. The bottom line of the book though was that science and faith can and should happily coexist. Truth should be in harmony with truth. Science cannot prove nor disprove the existance and role of a Creator, all it can do is shed light on how the creations behave. "
67,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"Dr. Collins articulates the two sides of the argument (faith v. science) well - and then demonstrates how the argument really shouldn't exist at all as both faith and science are involved in the search for Truth, albeit with different tools and methods. Nothing spectacularly new, in fact he leans heavily on others' words, notably C.S. Lewis, but also many others from Copernicus to Augustine to generally good effect. Hard to judge how convincing he was since I already agreed with most of his premises and assertions.Brief, helpful review of biological reproduction of DNA was clearly explained without either condescending to the reader or assuming the reader remembered every detail from Biology 101.For more book reviews, visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."
68,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312471-karen-l,3,"I liked this book but I did not love it. Why? Well, I have to say that as other critics of this book have noted, he does quote Lewis a little too much. I love C. S. Lewis and agreed with the author on many points yet I would have rather had him quote a little more of a variety of influences.Still, I did find his stories interesting and his ability to make science accessible to the non science layman very helpful. The book contains a lot of good information and most definitely could boost the faith of someone who is a doubter."

I expected a philosophical treatise but received a shallow description of one man's career and how he came to assume a life of faith. While there might be a place for this sort of literature, it was not what I was looking for. I clearly was not a member of the target audience."
70,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,4,I saw this author one afternoon on the Beeb and checked out his book from the library. I have always been disgusted with the fundamentalist belief that it is either science or faith. This book is a wonderful statement for the idea that science is evidence of God in action. I really enjoyed this book. It even re-awakened a sense of faith that the Bush administration had nearly destroyed.
71,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29591849-elinor,3,"This was pretty great. Relied heavily on CS Lewis for the apologetics, but gave a lot of interesting insight on the biology/science side of things."
72,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62738513-richard-webb,2,"Devoted to reconciling Judeo-Christians and evolutionists. Misses many opportunities to do so. As a renowned geneticist and leader of the Human Genome Project, reputed to be the greatest achievement of our generation, Collins team completed the first-draft mapping of the 3 billion gene sequences in DNA in 2000, and now heads the National Institutes of Health.As a Christian, Collins proposes that faith in God and faith in science can coexist and be harmonious saying, ‘We have caught the first glimpse of our instruction book, previously known only to God”.Collins boldly challenges his Darwinian colleagues: “So those who choose to be atheists must find some other basis for taking that position, evolution won’t do.” (Pg 167), and “agnosticism also runs the risk of being a cop-out,” (Pg 168). Further, he notes that distinguished agnostics who took time to consider the evidence “unexpectedly converted themselves” (Pg 168). Perhaps he wrote this book to those folks. But instead of reconciling atheistic/agnostic science to God’s Word in the Bible, Collins attempts to push the Bible toward today’s tenuous tenets of science. He first tries to build bridges to atheists by recounting common misconceptions about the Salem Witch Trials, the Crusades, and the underlying beliefs of fundamentally violent Islam; leading him to unjustified self-criticisms of Christianity (Pg 41). However, unexpurgated history shows witch trials ended because two Christian preachers objected to the execution of 20 Salem witches, ending the murder of tens of thousands in Europe. The Crusades were a last-option response to Moslems terrorizing Europe – a resurrected scourge that we must again excise as our Founders did in the 1780’s.Outside His FieldAs a Biblical apologist, Collins writes outside his field of expertise, borrowing credibility from his reputation as an eminent scientist. His discussion of suffering (Pg 43) fails to understand that all good flows from God’s highest value - LOVE Mark 12:30-31, requiring totally free will, and the inseparable freedom to not love. Love cannot be compelled (logically, anything less than totally free-will regarding an all-powerful God could easily be coercion, which God sedulously avoids). Logically then, the failure to choose love begets all evil and suffering. Should God have restrained free-will in order to prevent evil behavior? Logically, He cannot.Additionally, Collins misunderstanding the concept of dominion from Psalm 115:16 and Psalm 8:6, and how Adam ceded to satan the dominion given to Adam in Genesis 1:28, hinders Collins analysis of suffering and evil. Satan now exercises that dominion. Luke 4:6 and 2Cor 4:4 But Jesus gave us, His followers, the power to defeat satan James 4:7, John 4:4, Matt 10:8 if we will “be transformed by the renewing of [our] mind” Rom 12:2 and use that power.Collins also misunderstands (Pg 44-45), that miracles are intended to routinely follow believers: “These signs will follow those who believe” Mark 16:17 and “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out demons.” Matt 10:8 “These things you have seen me do, you will also do, and greater works than these…” John 14:12-14, and “God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders…” Heb 2:4. Perhaps a more Pentecostal understanding of believer’s authority in Eph 1:19-20 and Mark 16:17 would be helpful to him.Big BangCollins assertion that Big Bang is “well described and unlikely to be revised” is hubristic and inconsistent with history. Collins’ Big-Bang endorsement (Pg 68) fails to mention serious doubts raised by observations of counter-rotating galaxies, stars moving toward us, and quantized red-shift. Dissenting scientists question why supposedly “old” supernova exploding stars have projected materials such short distances when an old universe theory would predict extremely long distances. His assumption of a 14 billion universe age (Pg 64) ignores Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy) and radically faster speed of light at creation that promises to someday fit paleontology within the Biblical framework. Collins warns against literal interpretation of the Bible (Pg 83), but science, as an attempt to know the mind of God, would proceed more rapidly if a Biblical view of Origin informed astronomy, physics, biology, etc. Instead, atheists waste billions of taxpayer-funded research dollars constructing fairy-tales to “prove” God does not exist. “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” Rom 1:22 In contrast to Sir Isaac Newton and William Maury who researched scripture to launch their scientific inquiry, Einstein, Hawking, and many others initially presupposed a naturalistic origin and as evidence mounted, got dragged into reluctant recognition of a Creator. Biogenesis Perhaps as a professional courtesy, but with absolutely no evidence, Collins PRESUMES (Pg 89) that dirt assembled ITSELF into DNA digital code, acquired the capability of information storage, and differentiated into multiple “kinds”. We’ve not seen such baseless backward extrapolation since Darwin, in his book of speculative conjecture published without corroborating data, presumed that adaptation explains origin. Science predicated itself on the foundational principle that there is God’s discoverable order in the universe - down to the structure of sub-atomic particles. Order sans intelligence is logically impossible! Yet scientists thrill at each new fairy-tale atheistic deception, and deem anything plausible when multiplied by millions of years. Possibly the Rosetta Stone was formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion (wink).  Collins draws no clear distinction between ADAPTATATION (micro-evolution) and ORIGIN (macro-evolution).Collins says random assembly of molecules may have occurred. He tries to torpedo the entropy argument against biogenesis (the fairy-tale that chemistry begat biology vs. the truth that everything degrades) with an analogy that ignores the essential element of purpose-driven order, plus sustainability, and replication (Pg. 92). Molecules bumping into molecules, like people in a crowd, does not infer or confer a relationship, or transfer properties, or create order. There is no reason for the new combination to persist, incorporate, amalgamate, congregate, consolidate, or replicate.He allows that God could have created the first DNA, but offers no rationale for why God would have stopped with one or a few samples, and thus enjoy the fun of creating diversity. He warns against a “God of the Gaps” (Pg 93) but fails to acknowledge the eventual overturning of nearly every contravening “scientific” presumption, hypothesis, and theory to date. Instead of asking, “How did God do this?” the world supports vain imaginations (hubristic fairy-tales) that eventually fail. Contrast this with the greatest physicist/mathmetician ever, Sir Isaac Newton’s 1704 manuscript describing his quest to extract scientific information from the Bible. Newton’s Laws of Motion and Gravity have withstood the test of time. Perhaps there is a correlation between seeking God and finding truth.Collins warns against betting on a literal Genesis occurrence, then he ventures into paleontology dogma (Pg 93), failing to include recent creationist evidence that disputes long-held scientific beliefs. Neither does he proffer any evidence for the claim that extinct ”kinds” are the missing transitional forms.Self-DevelopmentCollins introduces Darwin’s assertion (which he ultimately adopts) that God may have “created a few original forms capable of self-development” (Pg 98). Biologists mis-use anthropomorphic terms like “strategy” saying that bugs develop a strategy to overcome pesticides. Ridiculous! If self-development is possible, the most intelligent of all God’s creation would have, by now, a bigger penis! Kindly pardon this graphic illustration needed to dramatize my point.Emulating Darwin, Collins takes pains to point out possible harmonious interpretations, but instead of accepting the Bible as true, and reconciling the current nascent state of struggling science with it, Collins incorrectly proclaims that “no serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life” (Pg 99). He should visit Institute for Creation Research or Answers in Genesis or Creation.com to be enlightened by an ever-growing body of scientists whose compelling evidence refutes his assertion. My own feeble survey of the beauty and apparently gratuitous diversity of amazing fish (28,000 species) is sufficient to understand that God intended to give a glimpse of his power, magnificence, and divinity thru our observation of what He made. Romans 1:20.AdaptationCollins cites adaptations in stickleback fish, malaria, HIV, and flu as examples of evolution (Pg 132), but each degraded mutation is just a variant of itself, an adaptation. The flu virus is still a flu virus; it does not morph into an HIV virus or a new disease, or new “kind”. Even purposeful (with intelligence) attempts to modify fruitfly genes over thousands of generations only result in mutant fruitflies, some with wings sticking out of their heads.His refutation of Special Creation’s “Ex Nihilo Species” (Pg 137) is feeble in that he illogically ignores God’s prerogative to re-use successful patterns. Why should God start anew with each “kind” He created? The Bible repeatedly says“after his kind” (e.g. Gen 1:24 Webster’s version is the most grammatically correct) which reinforces that God created multiple kinds of plants and animals. One can only imagine how much fun God must have had with the variations.DNAIt appears that DNA is comprised of error-correcting code like a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). If a piece is lost or corrupted, the piece can be reconstructed by referencing the other pieces. The math and logic needed to accomplish this feat was developed in computers long before it was recognized in DNA. Neither happened without intelligent design!Normally I would avoid criticism tangential to this distinguished scientist’s area of expertise, but Collins makes a special point of calling caspace-12 a “nonfunctional gene” (Pg 139) to argue against Special Creation.Certainly, it is illogical to presume that God would design a gene with 45% flotsam and jetsam (Pg 136). Having been a computer programmer I visualize genes as analogous to a computer memory-dump in which data and instructions mix within the hexadecimal strings. I remember it was frequently easier to spot data (analogous to GAA and GAG recipe for glutamic acid) than to identify instructions within the memory dump. Doesn’t it make sense to pursue an inquiry into what Collins dismissively calls Ancient Repetitive Elements (AREs) as possible instructions governing the GAA and GAG? I could find nowhere that this cellular biology expert presents the fact that DNA requires 75 proteins to exist, but proteins require DNA for construction. Using this undeniable fact, he could have made a much stronger case for God.Young EarthCollins attacks Young Earth creationists (Pg 172-179) saying “Young Earth creationism has reached a point of intellectual bankruptcy, both in its science and in its theology”. He assumes processes like deuterium decay always functioned as now, assumes light had to travel from distant stars (Pg 176) as opposed to beams having been created simultaneous with, or BEFORE (Gen 1:3) the stars (Gen 1:14). He fails to cite these arguments for a young earth fitting a Bible timeline:•	Ocean salinity and sediment deposits at river mouths are consistent with a young earth.•	The number of exploding star (supernova) remnants (SNRs) in all three stages is consistent with a 7000 year-young universe.•	Evidence that God did not create an embryonic universe, but a fully functioning interactive SYSTEM, manifests in plants that require creatures for pollination.•	Due to Barry Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy, the physical manifestation of Planck’s constant) The speed of light and electrons has decreased asymptotically since Creation. Light appears to have 30% faster in Jesus day, 400 times faster in Abraham’s day, and ten million times faster prior to 3,000BC.•	Speed of light may be increasing as it encounters less ZPE at the outer edges of space. Just as light speeds up after it emerges from water, allow me to speculate that the nature of light may be such (otherwise, what is the energy source?) that it goes at a fixed speed except while ZPE, water, atmosphere, and space dust etc. hinders.•	Electrons bouncing erratically off ZPE as they negotiate the ZPE hurdles on their orbital track, probably explains the “Uncertainty Principle” of quantum physics. Electrons are moving slower too. Calculations of age based on atomic decay need extreme revision.•	We are simply peering thru a longer taillight beam as the once-close stars travel away. The light appears redder because the lower-energy photons were redder, not a Doppler effect as suggested by Hubbel’s red-shift. We cannot observe light from outside the beam because it always heads directly toward us. The speed is relative to our own speed.When people study the Bible’s supernatural truths, fulfilled prophesies, structure, its heptadic code (7’s), and gematria (Jewish numbering) sufficiently to know that the Bible is, beyond doubt, directly from God, then their worldview is firmly rooted in truth. God’s account of how He created the universe, and us, is not an allegory as Collins maintains. Successful (real, true) science, like Bible study, is an attempt to know the mind of God.Science hinders itself with materialistic terms of engagement that stifle investigation. Our physics is likely only a shadow of a larger reality hinted at by mathematical postulations of additional dimensions we cannot yet comprehend. We should think of our material universe as a subset of a larger (supernatural) reality. Science thwarts progress by clinging to foolish atheistic traditions designed to deny the existence of God. Beware of OrthodoxyEducator John Taylor Gatto (author of Dumbing Us Down) told me schooling trains people to act like fish (swim in unison). Joe Bobier, inventor of Single-Cycle Modulation said “If I had been an electrical engineer, they would have convinced me this is not possible.” The reason breakthrough ideas are coming from sophomore high schoolers (Jack Andraka’s cancer detector, Simon Tsaoussis, two-transistor ternary RAM) is that they are not overly encumbered by orthodoxy. Revolutionary, disruptive, correct ideas encounter establishment ridicule as Dr. Robert O. Becker describes in his journey The Body Electric. Collins incorrectly struggles to conform to atheist/agnostic orthodoxy instead of standing firmly on God’s Word. I strongly urge him to revise this book."
73,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,4,"Francis Collins is a renowned scientist -- the former director of the Human Genome Project -- and also a Christian. In a time when science and faith can seem so diametrically opposed, it was encouraging to read one person's view of how he balances the two perspectives, and sees them as complementary rather than hostile to each other. I don't know how well this book will speak to all the different perspectives it could potentially be speaking to. I don't know whether an atheist or agnostic reader will be convinced or touched by the arguments and ideas presented here, since I am neither of those. It does cover quite a few topics -- from Collins' path to faith from his initial atheism; to a discussion of both scientific and faith-based approaches to worldviews, covering atheism, agnosticism, intelligent design, young-earth creationism, as well as theistic evolution, which he terms ""BioLogos""; as well as an overview of human DNA and what the Human Genome Project was aiming to accomplish; and an appendix devoted to bioethics, there was a lot to take in here (though I found it a relatively quick read).I think I was able to get the scientific gist of most of what he was writing about, since this was written for a layperson, but obviously there's a lot beneath the surface. I found the bits about the human genome most interesting. Faith-wise, numerous C.S. Lewis quotes will always draw me in, though I'm sure I'm not from the same ""bent"" of Christianity as Collins (though the same could be said for Lewis). But I valued the discussions of the various intersections of faith and science in regards to worldview (with an emphasis on origins).I don't agree with all of Collins' views here (though I can appreciate that we can still hold the same faith despite differences), and in many cases I don't even understand enough yet to know whether I agree or disagree. But I'm still grateful for his perspective, because it has helped me to clarify my thinking on some things, which includes some errors and inconsistencies in perspectives that I have held or entertained. I also appreciate him incorporating other thinkers (both scientists and theologians) into his arguments, because many quotes he uses are also interesting and make me want to learn more.I especially appreciate his call to not view God's Word and his creation as being ""at war with itself,"" as expressed in this quote that I think sums up his views nicely:“Will we turn our backs on science because it is perceived as a threat to God, abandoning all the promise of advancing our understanding of nature and applying that to the alleviation of suffering and the betterment of humankind? Alternatively, will we turn our backs on faith, concluding that science has rendered the spiritual life no longer necessary, and that traditional religious symbols can now be replaced by engravings of the double helix on our altars?Both of these choices are profoundly dangerous. Both deny truth. Both will diminish the nobility of humankind. Both will be devastating to our future. And both are unnecessary. The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. He can be worshipped in the cathedral or in the laboratory. His creation is majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful - and it cannot be at war with itself. Only we imperfect humans can start such battles. And only we can end them.”"

His first objective was to sieve Darwinian Evolution from atheism, on which he sold me. His second was to defend Theistic Evolution, in which he thoroughly failed. On the first matter, he created the best starting apologetic for scientific atheists that I've read. Collins was once an atheist. He took apart Dawkins. He glossed over true differences between DE and theology for the sake of (a false) harmony, but believably estranged DE and materialism. He seems to be a real Christian, however it is of course always hard to reliably tell. He professed belief and a relationship, which sounded genuine, but he kept referring to the value of other faith traditions, never called Jesus the only Way, and otherwise generally retreated to what sounded vaguely like a ""it works for me"" stance.On defending TE, he hung his cap on Darwinian Evolution. He erected a caricature of Young Earth Creationism and proceeded to beat the straw out of it. He didn't just oppose YEC and Intelligent Design, he called them untenable and impossible. His evidences were quite dated for 2006. Such faulty data that he determined to irrefutably support DE included: the DNA similarity between humans, chimps and mice; the immutability of isotopic dating and isotope half-lives (despite no evidence of universe conditions past 100 years ago or so); Occam's Razor; and the proposed reducible complexity of blood clots, flagella and the human eye (the former two of which were plausible, but not irrefutable). He got right the fact that scientific truth and spiritual truth cannot contradict, but he promoted the DE argument as overwhelming instead of its true, overwhelming ambiguity. He resembled Ptolemy, accepting the noticeable errors in satellite epicycles rather than telling the world that the earth revolves around the Sun, all for the sake of a contrived peace. His views have been thoroughly and convincingly refuted by the publications of Answers in Genesis, and plausibly so by Gerald Schroeder's creation-physics model (which reconciles YEC and OEC) in his book, The Science of God."

Still though, I thought Collins’s argument for theistic evolution was compelling. As a scientist and a person of faith, I’ve never seen incompatibility between the two domains, but haven’t been able to clearly articulate my beliefs as theistic evolution. I am deeply compelled by the Moral Law argument and this book helped to strengthen my beliefs. I found myself coming back to this book and Collins’s arguments frequently over the course of the semester in my Philosophy of Religion class. We didn’t talk about theistic evolution directly, but The Language of God supplemented a lot of my coursework well. I was less compelled by Collins’s arguments for Christianity in particular toward the end of the book, but I appreciate his insistence that faith is a personal journey we must all come to for ourselves. Overall, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to understand more about science, faith, and the relationship between the two. "
76,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7287572-grace,2,"A manifesto for theistic evolution.Every time I read one of these books I feel smacked around and uneasy. I read Darwin's Black Box and felt compelled by Behe's explanations. I was similarly compelled by Collins's dismantling of Behe, though. What all of this comes down to is that I am a layman having to trust whoever writes these books to tell me what they wish, leave out & skip over what they wish, and interpret everything for me. The only solution is to go back to school for my own PhD in biology, I guess. Honestly, though, I would skip reading this book. If you want the good faith parts just read Mere Christianity or better yet C. S. Lewis's entire bibliography. If you want the good science parts, just read any mainstream college molecular biology textbook, or whatever the latest Richard Dawkins book is."
77,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57363039-emily-monroe,5,"For someone familiar with both Christianity and science, this is a great summary type of read that seeks to reconcile what many sources today tout as unreconcilable. Collins provides brief backgrounds on both apologetics (belief) and genetics (science). If a reader is not familiar with either of those topics, this book is not a good introduction. As a believer with a science and engineering background, I enjoyed learning his perspective. Collins is frank in stating that young earth creationism is a dangerous concept, and he gave language and examples to support it. He is also frank in saying that science does not and cannot explain everything about our existence and the meaning of life. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and took a lot away from it that I will use in conversations with both believers and non-believers."
78,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23188545-josh,4,"More and more,if you are willing to open your eyes, you will be confronted with those who have differing views and beliefs than your own. The temptation is great to simply dismiss any idea or worldview that seems contrary to the one you already hold. My brother characterizes, and to a degree caricatures, the typical Christian response to contrary ideas as that of a petulant child putting his fingers in his ears and repeating, “I CAN'T HEAR YOU” to drown out the sound of anything that might question what is held so dearly.As a Christian,who deals with many Christians, it is hard to not acquiesce to his diagnosis. So often, those who should be genuinely searching out truth wherever it lies (seeing as how all truth is God's truth) will allow ourselves to remain ignorant out of fear that our beliefs will come crashing down and our God with them. If this fear is not present,then the possibility of ever having to admit some degree of error in our interpretation of the Bible or of the world or of our self is more than our pride can stand.Labels abound. If you believe in health care for all or government based social services then you are a “communist”. If you believe that some of the Bible is not to be taken literally, you're a “liberal” who does not believe the Bible. If you preach grace you are “antinomian” and if you preach responsibility and fidelity, you are a “legalist”. The word “heretic” gets thrown around on anyone not conforming to “the Bible” which would be more accurately and honesty communicated as “my interpretation of the Bible”.All these labels do in most cases is perpetuate ignorance and division, making it more convenient and efficient for us as we sit in God's seat of judgment on any who might not submit themselves to what we “know” as truth. Enter Francis Collins. Talk about a guy getting it from all angles. Collins was the head of the Human Genome Project, the scientific research to map out the human genome. The work done under his leadership has led to us have a genetic map of human beings. The benefit of this in the war against disease and defect is incapable of being overstated. The work God has done through this man and his leadership is amazing.And therein lies the reason he receives such criticism. Collins, a biologist, stood in the Oval Office with then President Clinton and nodded approvingly when President Clinton remarked that we could now see the “language of God” used in creation. How a professional biologist could hold to an “inherently unscientific” belief in God and approve of such theistic speak offended many in the biological community. That a committed Christian could believed in the “inherently atheistic” doctrine of evolution, offended many in the Christian community.That is the backdrop for the book, The Language of God by Francis Collins. Collins work is one part biography, one part scientific treatise and one part apologetic. Collins spends time going over his life, and his own path from atheism, to agnosticism, and finally to his firm belief in the theism of Biblical Christianity. The biographical aspects of the book are all centered on how he has related his lifelong love of science with his lifelong struggle with faith,and it is quite engrossing. Even as the biographical aspects of the book focus on Collins' own personal path, the way he presents it is overtly apologetic. He constantly goes over how he was convinced of the truth of theism and eventually the Christian truth claim, not simply recounting the fact that he was convinced. The way the apologetic is intertwined with the biographical narrative reminds one of reading C.S. Lewis when he deals with the same subject. Based on the references to and quotes from Lewis, this may not have been intentional but certainly it is without shock that some of Lewis' writing style was adopted by Collins.The apologetic nature of the book is not limited solely to a defense of the Christian faith. The idea of this book is how to rectify a belief in current scientific trends and the Christian faith. In doing so, Collins argues that Darwinian Evolution is true and that it is NOT contrary to the Christian faith. With so much teaching for and evidence of evolution, Collins' devotes a chapter to each of the possible responses to evolution. These chapters are Atheism and Agnosticism (When Science Trumps Faith), Creationism (When Faith Trumps Science), Intelligent Design (When Science Needs Divine Help),and BioLogos (Faith and Science in Harmony). Collins is basically fair in his assessment of the opposing views, but throughout the chapters it is clear that he is building to what he holds as truth by dismantling what he holds as false(or even silly). Collins closes with pleas to believers to not abandon science and scientists to not abandon faith.As I read the book I had to remind myself that Collins is not a theologian, he is a biologist. His interpretation of some Christian doctrines is off what he seems to hold as essential is debated amongst Christians. Some of the history he cites is incorrect and the citations could have been more thorough, especially on some instances where no citation was given. Also, there were times where Collins began speaking exclusively to his peers, losing the reader with limited scientific knowledge in the process.While this book is far from perfect, it is a great read. It would benefit anyone involved in the evolution debate(that would be anyone who has any religious, secular or scientific interest....everyone) to read this book and consider the arguments made and data presented"
79,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58566782-shane-allen,5,"A must read for those who love science and Jesus Christ. Of course the author of science is compatible with the science He created. It’s hard to believe this is still or has ever been an issue. However, it’s definitely worth the read just to hear his perspective on evolution. I’m not quite sold on the science but he is very persuasive. I’ve been reading both sides of the theistic evolution-intelligent design debate for a while now and I’m not convinced humans have fully learned enough yet to die on any hill. One thing is for certain– Francis Collins truly loves Jesus and it grieves me when Christians attack each other over non-essential doctrines not explicit in the Bible. Remember, we are all bothers and sisters in Christ. "

I thank God for the influence that C.S. Lewis is still having on the honest skeptic.

This book details out the driving questioning skepticism of science, details some of the journey of the DNA discoveries, and some of the probable limits of 'designer DNA'. It raises questions, but importantly, it defines what science can and cannot discover and why faith and science are not in conflict. For me, it helped clarify issues surrounding stem cell research, some things regarding evolution, and other hotbed controversial issues without me feeling like I had to 'check my faith in God' at the door in order to engage in the things this scientist was saying. It was a breath of fresh air. "

90,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32254765-kevin-stilley,3,"The following are discussion questions for ""The Language of God"" that I created for the monthly meeting of of the Atheist Christian Book Club. For information on the Atheist Christian Book Club you can go to the website at http://atheistchristianbookclub.com/ or seek us out on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/AtheistChris... .CHAPTER 1: FROM ATHEISM TO BELIEFCollins says that for him agnosticism was a place of retreat where he wouldn’t actually have to seriously consider the evidence for or against belief. That is obviously not true of those in this book group, but do you think it is generally true for most agnostics? Is agnosticism a position that is held in order to avoid the question of God’s existence altogether?Collins writes that the Moral Law was the primary thing that made him reconsider his atheism. What about those in our book group. Is there a “one thing” that creates cognitive dissonance and makes the atheists in the group pause to reconsider?CHAPTER 2: THE WAR OF THE WORLDVIEWSA similar question for the Christians; is there a question that makes you uncomfortable with your faith? Collins talks about four questions that he struggled with during the early days of his newfound belief. Is there a question like that that makes the Christians in the group sometimes doubt? If not currently, was there a question you struggled with at some time in your life?Collins lists four difficult questions that he struggled with as a new believer; (1) Isn’t the idea of God just wish-fulfillment?, (2) What about all the harm done in the name of religion?, (3) Why would a loving God allow suffering in the world?, and (4) How can a rational person believe in miracles? Were you satisfied with the answers Collins has arrived at and shares here?CHAPTER 3: THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSECollins writes, “Immanuel Kant wrote: ""Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the Moral Law within."" I have heard some former atheist/agnostics similarly indicate that these two things, nature and the moral law, seemed to be ever present in the back of their mind/heart as an indication that there had to be something more than just the material even when they were most intellectually opposed to the idea of God. I’m curious if those two concerns have any influence on the atheists/agnostics in our book group?Collins writes, “Based on these and other observations, physicists are in agreement that the universe began as an infinitely dense, dimensionless point of pure energy. The laws of physics breakdown in this circumstance, referred to as a ""singularity."" Is there the same kind of unanimity among the members of this book group as there seems to be among physicists? Collins seems to think that the question of origins hinges upon the question “What happened before the Big Bang?” Would the book club members agree?Collins' timeline (number of years) differs from some of the Christians in the room. For those who hold to a young earth theory of creation, how important do you think it is to adhere to a “thousands of years” formula instead of a “millions or billions of years” formula?The question of old earth vs. young earth is primarily a discussion held within the camp of Christianity. However, how does it affect those of you who are atheistic/agnostic?Collins writes of the Anthropic Principle, that “The existence of a universe as we know it rests upon a knife edge of improbability.” (page 73) This same fine-tuning argument also had an influence on the author of a previous book we read, Anthony Flew. The author gives three possibilities; (1) an infinite number of universes, (2) we are just very, very lucky, or (3) The precise tuning of all of the physical constants and physical laws to make intelligent life possible is not an accident, but reflects the action of the one who created the universe in the first place. What do you think?Collins quotes a number of famous scientists who believe that “""It would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun in just this way, except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us."" (pages 75ff). Do you think that Stephen Hawking, Freeman Dyson, Arno Penzias and other such scientists (such as Collins, himself) forfeit their scientific bona fides by taking such a position?The author claims that “there is nothing inherently in conflict between the idea of a creator God and what science has revealed.” Do you agree or disagree with him? Why? (page 81) The author further claims that “the opening words of Genesis (""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"") are entirely compatible with the Big Bang.” Do you agree or disagree with him? (pages 82-83)CHAPTER 4: LIFE ON EARTH – OF MICROBES AND MENCollins says that “no serious scientist would currently claim that a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life is at hand” but warns Christians not to result to a God of the gaps apologetic. He encourages them to adopt an approach using “positive reasons, based on knowledge, rather than default assumptions based on (a temporary) lack of knowledge.” However, for those of you who are atheists, does “the inability of modern science to develop a statistically probable mechanism” for the origin of life give you any intellectual pause? (pages 92-93)Collins writes, “No serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life. In fact, the relatedness of all species through the mechanism of evolution is such a profound foundation for the understanding of all biology that it is difficult to imagine how one would study life without it.” Is this true? Are there no serious biologists that doubt the theory of evolution? Is Collins being fair to those who disagree with him on this matter? (page 99)CHAPTER 5: DECIPHERING GOD’S INSTRUCTION BOOK – THE LESSONS OF THE HUMAN GENOMECollins asserts that the difference between macroevolution and microevolution is “increasingly seen to be artificial. But then to illustrate it is a distinction without a difference he uses the example of a stickleback fish with armor becoming a stickleback fish without armor. I think most critics of Darwinism would find this example not to be compelling. A fish becomes a fish. A virus becomes a slightly different virus. How is this evidence for the “tree of life”? Was his example sufficient for you to think that the distinction between macroevolution and microevolution is “arbitrary”? (pages 131-132)In reference to similarities between human and mouse genomes, Collins writes, “This evidence alone does not, of course, prove a common ancestor; from a creationist perspective, such similarities could simply demonstrate that God used successful design principles over and over again. As we shall see, however, and as was foreshadowed above by the discussion of ""silent"" mutations in protein-coding regions, the detailed study of genomes has rendered that interpretation virtually untenable—not only about all other living things, but also about ourselves.” Do you think that the evidence provided by Collins actually supports his claim that it is untenable to believe that God used successful design principles over and over again? (pages 133-137)Does Collins provide compelling evidence from genetic similarities to prove that humans and other life forms have a common ancestor? (pages 137- 142)CHAPTER 6: GENESIS, GALILEO, AND DARWINCollins writes about the emotional distance between Christian believers who are adherents of Darwinism and those who reject this biological theory. What do you think about this? Is it difficult for these to “sides” to coexist in theological harmony? (pages 145-147)CHAPTER 7: OPTION 1 – ATHEISM AND AGNOSTICISM (WHEN SCIENCE TRUMPS FAITH)Collins writes about the hostility between some believers and unbelievers. How common is this? Why do you think this is so? (pages 159ff)The author of our book quotes Dawkins as saying, “""It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus, 'mad cow' disease, and many others, but I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.” Do the atheists in our group believe that faith is evil? (page 163)Collins quotes Stephen Jay Gould as saying that since “Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny” the existence of God. Do you agree with Gould? (page 166)The author refers to four different groups:1. Strong Atheists = have a firm conviction that no deities exist.2. Weak Atheism = the absence of belief in the existence of a God or gods3. Strong Agnostics = believes there is no way that human kind will “ever” know if there is a God4. Weak Atheists = believes only that it is not possible to know “yet” whether or not there is a GodWhat is the composition of atheists/agnostics in our group in regard to these four descriptions?CHAPTER 8: OPTION 2 - CREATIONISM (WHEN FAITH TRUMPS SCIENCE)Does Collins accurately reflect the beliefs of most Young Earth Creationists when he claims that they believe in Microevolution, which he defines as small changes within a species, but do not believe in Macroevolution, which he describes as one species evolving into another species? Many of the young earth creationists that I know are much more flexible with the definition of Microevolution, and define it as changing from one genus, or one order, into another genus or order. (page 172) Does this matter, or is this a distinction without a difference?Is Collins being a bit hysterical when he declares that should YEC scientific claims be true then, “it would lead to a complete and irreversible collapse of the sciences of physics, chemistry, cosmology, geology, and biology.”? (page 174) He makes it sound down right apocalyptic; are YEC that dangerous?CHAPTER 9: OPTION 3 – INTELLIGENT DESIGN (WHEN SCIENCE NEEDS DIVINE HELP)Collins asserts that if the logic of Intelligent Design “truly had merit on scientific grounds, one would expect that the rank and file of working biologists would also show interest in pursuing these ideas, especially since a significant number of biologists are also believers.” (page 187) However, haven’t historians of science like Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) written that just the opposite is true? Does not history tell us that science that none of the revolutionary paradigmatic changes that science has undergone were quickly accepted on the basis of reason/evidence alone? Is head-counting an appropriate way to determine truth?Collins claims that ID is a God of the gaps theory and that science is busily filling in those gaps with things other than God, and thus the theory is collapsing. If so, what then happens with faith? (page 195)CHAPTER 10: BIOLOGOS (SCIENCE AND FAITH IN HARMONY)Within Christianity there is frequently contentious debates among believers about what is the right approach/beliefs regarding creation. How do those of you who are atheists react when you witness such debates?Collins points out that BioLogos is not a scientific theory? (page 204) Does that seem like a copout for a group of scientists to be organizing around a non-scientific theory?CHAPTER 11: TRUTH SEEKERSCollins tells his conversion story in the final chapter. We have on several occasions honestly discussed the question, “What would it take for you to become a person of faith?” and “What would it take for you to become a disbeliever?” Has this book modified your answers to these questions?One of the previous books we discussed was written by the world’s leading intellectual atheist and documented his conversion to theism. This book was written by the person who may be the world’s leading medical geneticist and why he is a Christian. Has the stature of these two authors provoked any intellectual movement from those of you who are atheists?DID ANYONE HAVE A CHANGE OF OPINION (ABOUT ANYTHING) AS A RESULT OF READING THIS BOOK? HAS ANYONE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE YEAR WE HAVE SPENT READING AND DISCUSSING TOGETHER?Supplementary note: Several of the atheistic authors we have read in our book group have indicated that all inerrantists believe in a young earth. This is not true. For a survey of the different viewpoints of inerrantists you can read the following short article: https://www.christianpost.com/news/do..."

There is little ""evidence for belief"" here, and I think most people who have seriously engaged with the god question will have already encountered the main arguments elsewhere.That being said, it was an enjoyable read and I came away with renewed respect for Dr. Collins and his work. Even though his attempt at reconciling the scientific and religious worldviews was ultimately unconvincing for me, he comes across as one of the most intellectually honest and sincere Christian thinkers I've encountered on this topic."

93,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43496878-chris-woody,4,"When I was a student small group leader a few years ago, I had a group of abnormally inquisitive middle schoolers. One day, one of them asked about how we as Christians should look at ""cavemen,"" and, though I don't remember what all was said from there, I know that I mentioned it is okay for Christians to accept evolution. Of course, this didn't sit well with one of my other, well-meaning students, who had never been exposed to such an idea. Even when I said that C.S. Lewis might have accepted the possibility of evolution, his response was ""No, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure he was a Christian."" This all ended with me having to have a chat with the youth pastor to ensure that I wasn't saying anything heretical. All of this is to say that, as a Christian who sees the theory of evolution as compatible with belief, I've found myself in some trouble with my church over these views.This question has been one that I've been mulling over for years: How can Christians accept the evidence that we evolved over millions of years without also saying that we don't take the sanctity of Scripture seriously. I think that Francis Collins, a world-renowned geneticist and devout believer, does a pretty good job of this. He lays out a pretty good argument that science can actually enhance our ability to appreciate God's creation, not jeopardize it. He also does a good job of arguing against both atheism and strict creationism, both of which exist on the far ends of the spectrum when it comes to the ""science-faith"" debate. I think that a lot of believers would do well to read this book and find that it is okay to trust science and still believe in a loving God. Had I read this before, I would have been able to recommend it to my student, as I'm sure Collins can articulate things and explain complex scientific concepts far better than I can."
94,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121586-aaron-barnhart,3,"Our Sunday School class has been reading this clear, concise defense of Christian faith from an evangelical and one of the country's leading geneticists. Collins is controversial with his fellow evangelicals because he argues that evolution is an accepted scientific method, and he is controversial among atheists and skeptics because he asserts that God is both the loving creator of the universe and a being who exists beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. He is, essentially, C.S. Lewis brought into the 21st century — and I say that as someone who is well aware of Lewis's literary reputation. Collins is a highly readable author, and his informal, avuncular prose is arguably more accessible to Christians today than the somewhat outdated and dense argumentation of ""Mere Christianity.""That said, I find The Language of God unsatisfying because it is largely a guide to fellow evangelicals on how to defend their faith against the atheistic meanies of the scientific world like Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. Such people, and we can throw Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens in there while we're at it, are no threat to Christianity because they comprise such a small part of the population. (Harris's argument that Collins should not have been appointed the head of the National Institutes of Health because of his Christian views is a case in point. Collins has no controversial scientific views that I know of, and he is, like most taxpayers, a professed Christian.) Many, if not most, American Christians, however, are neither evangelicals of the Collins stripe nor fundamentalist six-day creationist types (the other group this book takes aim at). Many Christians are members of non-evangelical churches who take their values to their workplace and households without a lot of fanfare or ""God talk."" Another emerging group is Gen-Y evangelicals, who grew up in these churches but disdain their parents' conservative politics and are ready to rethink what it is to be a Christian in the secular society. To me, a major challenge facing Christianity is how to coax these two sets of believers back into the public square, where their moderating influence and quiet moral strength would really come in handy right about now. With his evangelical zeal and quick answers to every problem, Collins strikes me as too much like the nut cases he claims to oppose — people whose minds are made up and aren't interested in real discussion. The Language of God may appear to be at first on the side of such reasonable people, but in the end it offers them surprisingly little help, unless they happen to go to a church much like the one Collins attends."
95,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5292677-al-datum,5,"There are a few claims made by atheists on a regular basis. They include the following:- Only the uneducated become Christians. Truly educated people, especially scientists, would never accept such nonsense- The only reason people are Christians is that they were raised to believe as they doThis book is proof that these two claims are simply nonsense. Francis Collins was an atheist prior to his scientific work on the human genome project. His career has been stellar (he led the Human Genome Project and is currently the director of the National Institutes of Health). He is a leading scientist, and certainly qualifies as a truly educated person. He was also not a Christian his entire life.Collins became a Christian when he began to look at the complexity of the human genome. As he recounts in this book, he was simply unable to remain an atheist since his scientific findings led him to the inescapable conclusion of design and a transcendent designer (this same argument has persuaded many atheists, by the way...check out Antony Flew's conversion. Or Alister McGrath. Or John Polkinghorne. Or Frank Tipler...I could go on).In this book, Collins describes his journey and shows why he came to the conclusion that God exists. He makes the case that was persuasive to him, and also builds the case that evolution and Christianity are not mutually exclusive (in fact, as philosopher William Lane Craig has said, the existence of evolution in such a short span of time [speaking of the length of time our planet has existed] would itself be a miracle, and thus proof of God).Collins does a good job of showing that science and Christianity are not enemies, but partners in the quest for truth (Christianity is, after all, largely responsible for Western Science getting its start). He shows the reasonableness of being both a leading scientist and a believer. And he destroys the two claims I listed at the beginning of this review. Not only is it possible for highly educated scientists to be raised as non-believers only to be converted to Christianity when confronted with the evidence. But Dr. Collins is living proof of this fact.Pick this book up if you'd like to read Dr. Collins' story. It's a very interesting one. And if you're open to following the evidence where it leads, it provides a persuasive case that the evidence leads directly to the existence of an all-powerful creator and designer.One other thing...if you're looking for a good, quick overview of Bayes Theorem, this book has a nice treatment of it that anyone can understand.Simply put...atheism is wrong. The evidence is inescapable."
96,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1225279-clint,3,"3.0 - In this book Collins explains how he harmonizes his belief in God with his understanding of evolution and other scientific processes involved in the creation of our universe. While I don't agree with every conclusion that Collins reaches, his honest and reasonable approach make this a very interesting book. He does a good job of giving a broad-brush description of the major scientific theories involved (big bang and evolution) and evidence for them. His explanations of DNA, how it's used, and how it provides further evidence of evolutionary processes was particularly interesting. I felt his establishment of evolution as truth was a little lacking, as there were a few evolutionary question marks that weren't acknowledged, or weren't addressed as thoroughly as I'd have liked. His arguments in favor of God were based primarily on the philosophical ideas of Moral Law and universal longing for God as presented by C. S. Lewis. While he touched on some physical evidences of a Creator, such as the beautiful mathematical connection with nature and its laws, based on the title I was expecting more. Just as his establishment of evolution was lacking, I found his establishment of God also lacking. He proclaimed Moral Law as his most convincing evidence, yet failed to really establish any sort of spiritual-based evidence. I realize that spiritual evidence is subjective and it deals more on a personal level, but isn't that how it should be? Faith is a personal decision, salvation is a personal issue, our relationship with God is personal, so the spiritual evidence for him should be personal. The bottom line of the book though was that science and faith can and should happily coexist. Truth should be in harmony with truth. Science cannot prove nor disprove the existance and role of a Creator, all it can do is shed light on how the creations behave. "
97,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"Dr. Collins articulates the two sides of the argument (faith v. science) well - and then demonstrates how the argument really shouldn't exist at all as both faith and science are involved in the search for Truth, albeit with different tools and methods. Nothing spectacularly new, in fact he leans heavily on others' words, notably C.S. Lewis, but also many others from Copernicus to Augustine to generally good effect. Hard to judge how convincing he was since I already agreed with most of his premises and assertions.Brief, helpful review of biological reproduction of DNA was clearly explained without either condescending to the reader or assuming the reader remembered every detail from Biology 101.For more book reviews, visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."

Well, I have to say that as other critics of this book have noted, he does quote Lewis a little too much. I love C. S. Lewis and agreed with the author on many points yet I would have rather had him quote a little more of a variety of influences.Still, I did find his stories interesting and his ability to make science accessible to the non science layman very helpful. The book contains a lot of good information and most definitely could boost the faith of someone who is a doubter."

I expected a philosophical treatise but received a shallow description of one man's career and how he came to assume a life of faith. While there might be a place for this sort of literature, it was not what I was looking for. I clearly was not a member of the target audience."
100,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,4,I saw this author one afternoon on the Beeb and checked out his book from the library. I have always been disgusted with the fundamentalist belief that it is either science or faith. This book is a wonderful statement for the idea that science is evidence of God in action. I really enjoyed this book. It even re-awakened a sense of faith that the Bush administration had nearly destroyed.
101,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29591849-elinor,3,"This was pretty great. Relied heavily on CS Lewis for the apologetics, but gave a lot of interesting insight on the biology/science side of things."
102,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62738513-richard-webb,2,"Devoted to reconciling Judeo-Christians and evolutionists. Misses many opportunities to do so. As a renowned geneticist and leader of the Human Genome Project, reputed to be the greatest achievement of our generation, Collins team completed the first-draft mapping of the 3 billion gene sequences in DNA in 2000, and now heads the National Institutes of Health.As a Christian, Collins proposes that faith in God and faith in science can coexist and be harmonious saying, ‘We have caught the first glimpse of our instruction book, previously known only to God”.Collins boldly challenges his Darwinian colleagues: “So those who choose to be atheists must find some other basis for taking that position, evolution won’t do.” (Pg 167), and “agnosticism also runs the risk of being a cop-out,” (Pg 168). Further, he notes that distinguished agnostics who took time to consider the evidence “unexpectedly converted themselves” (Pg 168). Perhaps he wrote this book to those folks. But instead of reconciling atheistic/agnostic science to God’s Word in the Bible, Collins attempts to push the Bible toward today’s tenuous tenets of science. He first tries to build bridges to atheists by recounting common misconceptions about the Salem Witch Trials, the Crusades, and the underlying beliefs of fundamentally violent Islam; leading him to unjustified self-criticisms of Christianity (Pg 41). However, unexpurgated history shows witch trials ended because two Christian preachers objected to the execution of 20 Salem witches, ending the murder of tens of thousands in Europe. The Crusades were a last-option response to Moslems terrorizing Europe – a resurrected scourge that we must again excise as our Founders did in the 1780’s.Outside His FieldAs a Biblical apologist, Collins writes outside his field of expertise, borrowing credibility from his reputation as an eminent scientist. His discussion of suffering (Pg 43) fails to understand that all good flows from God’s highest value - LOVE Mark 12:30-31, requiring totally free will, and the inseparable freedom to not love. Love cannot be compelled (logically, anything less than totally free-will regarding an all-powerful God could easily be coercion, which God sedulously avoids). Logically then, the failure to choose love begets all evil and suffering. Should God have restrained free-will in order to prevent evil behavior? Logically, He cannot.Additionally, Collins misunderstanding the concept of dominion from Psalm 115:16 and Psalm 8:6, and how Adam ceded to satan the dominion given to Adam in Genesis 1:28, hinders Collins analysis of suffering and evil. Satan now exercises that dominion. Luke 4:6 and 2Cor 4:4 But Jesus gave us, His followers, the power to defeat satan James 4:7, John 4:4, Matt 10:8 if we will “be transformed by the renewing of [our] mind” Rom 12:2 and use that power.Collins also misunderstands (Pg 44-45), that miracles are intended to routinely follow believers: “These signs will follow those who believe” Mark 16:17 and “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out demons.” Matt 10:8 “These things you have seen me do, you will also do, and greater works than these…” John 14:12-14, and “God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders…” Heb 2:4. Perhaps a more Pentecostal understanding of believer’s authority in Eph 1:19-20 and Mark 16:17 would be helpful to him.Big BangCollins assertion that Big Bang is “well described and unlikely to be revised” is hubristic and inconsistent with history. Collins’ Big-Bang endorsement (Pg 68) fails to mention serious doubts raised by observations of counter-rotating galaxies, stars moving toward us, and quantized red-shift. Dissenting scientists question why supposedly “old” supernova exploding stars have projected materials such short distances when an old universe theory would predict extremely long distances. His assumption of a 14 billion universe age (Pg 64) ignores Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy) and radically faster speed of light at creation that promises to someday fit paleontology within the Biblical framework. Collins warns against literal interpretation of the Bible (Pg 83), but science, as an attempt to know the mind of God, would proceed more rapidly if a Biblical view of Origin informed astronomy, physics, biology, etc. Instead, atheists waste billions of taxpayer-funded research dollars constructing fairy-tales to “prove” God does not exist. “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” Rom 1:22 In contrast to Sir Isaac Newton and William Maury who researched scripture to launch their scientific inquiry, Einstein, Hawking, and many others initially presupposed a naturalistic origin and as evidence mounted, got dragged into reluctant recognition of a Creator. Biogenesis Perhaps as a professional courtesy, but with absolutely no evidence, Collins PRESUMES (Pg 89) that dirt assembled ITSELF into DNA digital code, acquired the capability of information storage, and differentiated into multiple “kinds”. We’ve not seen such baseless backward extrapolation since Darwin, in his book of speculative conjecture published without corroborating data, presumed that adaptation explains origin. Science predicated itself on the foundational principle that there is God’s discoverable order in the universe - down to the structure of sub-atomic particles. Order sans intelligence is logically impossible! Yet scientists thrill at each new fairy-tale atheistic deception, and deem anything plausible when multiplied by millions of years. Possibly the Rosetta Stone was formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion (wink).  Collins draws no clear distinction between ADAPTATATION (micro-evolution) and ORIGIN (macro-evolution).Collins says random assembly of molecules may have occurred. He tries to torpedo the entropy argument against biogenesis (the fairy-tale that chemistry begat biology vs. the truth that everything degrades) with an analogy that ignores the essential element of purpose-driven order, plus sustainability, and replication (Pg. 92). Molecules bumping into molecules, like people in a crowd, does not infer or confer a relationship, or transfer properties, or create order. There is no reason for the new combination to persist, incorporate, amalgamate, congregate, consolidate, or replicate.He allows that God could have created the first DNA, but offers no rationale for why God would have stopped with one or a few samples, and thus enjoy the fun of creating diversity. He warns against a “God of the Gaps” (Pg 93) but fails to acknowledge the eventual overturning of nearly every contravening “scientific” presumption, hypothesis, and theory to date. Instead of asking, “How did God do this?” the world supports vain imaginations (hubristic fairy-tales) that eventually fail. Contrast this with the greatest physicist/mathmetician ever, Sir Isaac Newton’s 1704 manuscript describing his quest to extract scientific information from the Bible. Newton’s Laws of Motion and Gravity have withstood the test of time. Perhaps there is a correlation between seeking God and finding truth.Collins warns against betting on a literal Genesis occurrence, then he ventures into paleontology dogma (Pg 93), failing to include recent creationist evidence that disputes long-held scientific beliefs. Neither does he proffer any evidence for the claim that extinct ”kinds” are the missing transitional forms.Self-DevelopmentCollins introduces Darwin’s assertion (which he ultimately adopts) that God may have “created a few original forms capable of self-development” (Pg 98). Biologists mis-use anthropomorphic terms like “strategy” saying that bugs develop a strategy to overcome pesticides. Ridiculous! If self-development is possible, the most intelligent of all God’s creation would have, by now, a bigger penis! Kindly pardon this graphic illustration needed to dramatize my point.Emulating Darwin, Collins takes pains to point out possible harmonious interpretations, but instead of accepting the Bible as true, and reconciling the current nascent state of struggling science with it, Collins incorrectly proclaims that “no serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life” (Pg 99). He should visit Institute for Creation Research or Answers in Genesis or Creation.com to be enlightened by an ever-growing body of scientists whose compelling evidence refutes his assertion. My own feeble survey of the beauty and apparently gratuitous diversity of amazing fish (28,000 species) is sufficient to understand that God intended to give a glimpse of his power, magnificence, and divinity thru our observation of what He made. Romans 1:20.AdaptationCollins cites adaptations in stickleback fish, malaria, HIV, and flu as examples of evolution (Pg 132), but each degraded mutation is just a variant of itself, an adaptation. The flu virus is still a flu virus; it does not morph into an HIV virus or a new disease, or new “kind”. Even purposeful (with intelligence) attempts to modify fruitfly genes over thousands of generations only result in mutant fruitflies, some with wings sticking out of their heads.His refutation of Special Creation’s “Ex Nihilo Species” (Pg 137) is feeble in that he illogically ignores God’s prerogative to re-use successful patterns. Why should God start anew with each “kind” He created? The Bible repeatedly says“after his kind” (e.g. Gen 1:24 Webster’s version is the most grammatically correct) which reinforces that God created multiple kinds of plants and animals. One can only imagine how much fun God must have had with the variations.DNAIt appears that DNA is comprised of error-correcting code like a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). If a piece is lost or corrupted, the piece can be reconstructed by referencing the other pieces. The math and logic needed to accomplish this feat was developed in computers long before it was recognized in DNA. Neither happened without intelligent design!Normally I would avoid criticism tangential to this distinguished scientist’s area of expertise, but Collins makes a special point of calling caspace-12 a “nonfunctional gene” (Pg 139) to argue against Special Creation.Certainly, it is illogical to presume that God would design a gene with 45% flotsam and jetsam (Pg 136). Having been a computer programmer I visualize genes as analogous to a computer memory-dump in which data and instructions mix within the hexadecimal strings. I remember it was frequently easier to spot data (analogous to GAA and GAG recipe for glutamic acid) than to identify instructions within the memory dump. Doesn’t it make sense to pursue an inquiry into what Collins dismissively calls Ancient Repetitive Elements (AREs) as possible instructions governing the GAA and GAG? I could find nowhere that this cellular biology expert presents the fact that DNA requires 75 proteins to exist, but proteins require DNA for construction. Using this undeniable fact, he could have made a much stronger case for God.Young EarthCollins attacks Young Earth creationists (Pg 172-179) saying “Young Earth creationism has reached a point of intellectual bankruptcy, both in its science and in its theology”. He assumes processes like deuterium decay always functioned as now, assumes light had to travel from distant stars (Pg 176) as opposed to beams having been created simultaneous with, or BEFORE (Gen 1:3) the stars (Gen 1:14). He fails to cite these arguments for a young earth fitting a Bible timeline:•	Ocean salinity and sediment deposits at river mouths are consistent with a young earth.•	The number of exploding star (supernova) remnants (SNRs) in all three stages is consistent with a 7000 year-young universe.•	Evidence that God did not create an embryonic universe, but a fully functioning interactive SYSTEM, manifests in plants that require creatures for pollination.•	Due to Barry Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy, the physical manifestation of Planck’s constant) The speed of light and electrons has decreased asymptotically since Creation. Light appears to have 30% faster in Jesus day, 400 times faster in Abraham’s day, and ten million times faster prior to 3,000BC.•	Speed of light may be increasing as it encounters less ZPE at the outer edges of space. Just as light speeds up after it emerges from water, allow me to speculate that the nature of light may be such (otherwise, what is the energy source?) that it goes at a fixed speed except while ZPE, water, atmosphere, and space dust etc. hinders.•	Electrons bouncing erratically off ZPE as they negotiate the ZPE hurdles on their orbital track, probably explains the “Uncertainty Principle” of quantum physics. Electrons are moving slower too. Calculations of age based on atomic decay need extreme revision.•	We are simply peering thru a longer taillight beam as the once-close stars travel away. The light appears redder because the lower-energy photons were redder, not a Doppler effect as suggested by Hubbel’s red-shift. We cannot observe light from outside the beam because it always heads directly toward us. The speed is relative to our own speed.When people study the Bible’s supernatural truths, fulfilled prophesies, structure, its heptadic code (7’s), and gematria (Jewish numbering) sufficiently to know that the Bible is, beyond doubt, directly from God, then their worldview is firmly rooted in truth. God’s account of how He created the universe, and us, is not an allegory as Collins maintains. Successful (real, true) science, like Bible study, is an attempt to know the mind of God.Science hinders itself with materialistic terms of engagement that stifle investigation. Our physics is likely only a shadow of a larger reality hinted at by mathematical postulations of additional dimensions we cannot yet comprehend. We should think of our material universe as a subset of a larger (supernatural) reality. Science thwarts progress by clinging to foolish atheistic traditions designed to deny the existence of God. Beware of OrthodoxyEducator John Taylor Gatto (author of Dumbing Us Down) told me schooling trains people to act like fish (swim in unison). Joe Bobier, inventor of Single-Cycle Modulation said “If I had been an electrical engineer, they would have convinced me this is not possible.” The reason breakthrough ideas are coming from sophomore high schoolers (Jack Andraka’s cancer detector, Simon Tsaoussis, two-transistor ternary RAM) is that they are not overly encumbered by orthodoxy. Revolutionary, disruptive, correct ideas encounter establishment ridicule as Dr. Robert O. Becker describes in his journey The Body Electric. Collins incorrectly struggles to conform to atheist/agnostic orthodoxy instead of standing firmly on God’s Word. I strongly urge him to revise this book."
103,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,4,"Francis Collins is a renowned scientist -- the former director of the Human Genome Project -- and also a Christian. In a time when science and faith can seem so diametrically opposed, it was encouraging to read one person's view of how he balances the two perspectives, and sees them as complementary rather than hostile to each other. I don't know how well this book will speak to all the different perspectives it could potentially be speaking to. I don't know whether an atheist or agnostic reader will be convinced or touched by the arguments and ideas presented here, since I am neither of those. It does cover quite a few topics -- from Collins' path to faith from his initial atheism; to a discussion of both scientific and faith-based approaches to worldviews, covering atheism, agnosticism, intelligent design, young-earth creationism, as well as theistic evolution, which he terms ""BioLogos""; as well as an overview of human DNA and what the Human Genome Project was aiming to accomplish; and an appendix devoted to bioethics, there was a lot to take in here (though I found it a relatively quick read).I think I was able to get the scientific gist of most of what he was writing about, since this was written for a layperson, but obviously there's a lot beneath the surface. I found the bits about the human genome most interesting. Faith-wise, numerous C.S. Lewis quotes will always draw me in, though I'm sure I'm not from the same ""bent"" of Christianity as Collins (though the same could be said for Lewis). But I valued the discussions of the various intersections of faith and science in regards to worldview (with an emphasis on origins).I don't agree with all of Collins' views here (though I can appreciate that we can still hold the same faith despite differences), and in many cases I don't even understand enough yet to know whether I agree or disagree. But I'm still grateful for his perspective, because it has helped me to clarify my thinking on some things, which includes some errors and inconsistencies in perspectives that I have held or entertained. I also appreciate him incorporating other thinkers (both scientists and theologians) into his arguments, because many quotes he uses are also interesting and make me want to learn more.I especially appreciate his call to not view God's Word and his creation as being ""at war with itself,"" as expressed in this quote that I think sums up his views nicely:“Will we turn our backs on science because it is perceived as a threat to God, abandoning all the promise of advancing our understanding of nature and applying that to the alleviation of suffering and the betterment of humankind? Alternatively, will we turn our backs on faith, concluding that science has rendered the spiritual life no longer necessary, and that traditional religious symbols can now be replaced by engravings of the double helix on our altars?Both of these choices are profoundly dangerous. Both deny truth. Both will diminish the nobility of humankind. Both will be devastating to our future. And both are unnecessary. The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. He can be worshipped in the cathedral or in the laboratory. His creation is majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful - and it cannot be at war with itself. Only we imperfect humans can start such battles. And only we can end them.”"

His first objective was to sieve Darwinian Evolution from atheism, on which he sold me. His second was to defend Theistic Evolution, in which he thoroughly failed. On the first matter, he created the best starting apologetic for scientific atheists that I've read. Collins was once an atheist. He took apart Dawkins. He glossed over true differences between DE and theology for the sake of (a false) harmony, but believably estranged DE and materialism. He seems to be a real Christian, however it is of course always hard to reliably tell. He professed belief and a relationship, which sounded genuine, but he kept referring to the value of other faith traditions, never called Jesus the only Way, and otherwise generally retreated to what sounded vaguely like a ""it works for me"" stance.On defending TE, he hung his cap on Darwinian Evolution. He erected a caricature of Young Earth Creationism and proceeded to beat the straw out of it. He didn't just oppose YEC and Intelligent Design, he called them untenable and impossible. His evidences were quite dated for 2006. Such faulty data that he determined to irrefutably support DE included: the DNA similarity between humans, chimps and mice; the immutability of isotopic dating and isotope half-lives (despite no evidence of universe conditions past 100 years ago or so); Occam's Razor; and the proposed reducible complexity of blood clots, flagella and the human eye (the former two of which were plausible, but not irrefutable). He got right the fact that scientific truth and spiritual truth cannot contradict, but he promoted the DE argument as overwhelming instead of its true, overwhelming ambiguity. He resembled Ptolemy, accepting the noticeable errors in satellite epicycles rather than telling the world that the earth revolves around the Sun, all for the sake of a contrived peace. His views have been thoroughly and convincingly refuted by the publications of Answers in Genesis, and plausibly so by Gerald Schroeder's creation-physics model (which reconciles YEC and OEC) in his book, The Science of God."

Still though, I thought Collins’s argument for theistic evolution was compelling. As a scientist and a person of faith, I’ve never seen incompatibility between the two domains, but haven’t been able to clearly articulate my beliefs as theistic evolution. I am deeply compelled by the Moral Law argument and this book helped to strengthen my beliefs. I found myself coming back to this book and Collins’s arguments frequently over the course of the semester in my Philosophy of Religion class. We didn’t talk about theistic evolution directly, but The Language of God supplemented a lot of my coursework well. I was less compelled by Collins’s arguments for Christianity in particular toward the end of the book, but I appreciate his insistence that faith is a personal journey we must all come to for ourselves. Overall, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to understand more about science, faith, and the relationship between the two. "

I read Darwin's Black Box and felt compelled by Behe's explanations. I was similarly compelled by Collins's dismantling of Behe, though. What all of this comes down to is that I am a layman having to trust whoever writes these books to tell me what they wish, leave out & skip over what they wish, and interpret everything for me. The only solution is to go back to school for my own PhD in biology, I guess. Honestly, though, I would skip reading this book. If you want the good faith parts just read Mere Christianity or better yet C. S. Lewis's entire bibliography. If you want the good science parts, just read any mainstream college molecular biology textbook, or whatever the latest Richard Dawkins book is."
107,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57363039-emily-monroe,5,"For someone familiar with both Christianity and science, this is a great summary type of read that seeks to reconcile what many sources today tout as unreconcilable. Collins provides brief backgrounds on both apologetics (belief) and genetics (science). If a reader is not familiar with either of those topics, this book is not a good introduction. As a believer with a science and engineering background, I enjoyed learning his perspective. Collins is frank in stating that young earth creationism is a dangerous concept, and he gave language and examples to support it. He is also frank in saying that science does not and cannot explain everything about our existence and the meaning of life. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and took a lot away from it that I will use in conversations with both believers and non-believers."
108,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23188545-josh,4,"More and more,if you are willing to open your eyes, you will be confronted with those who have differing views and beliefs than your own. The temptation is great to simply dismiss any idea or worldview that seems contrary to the one you already hold. My brother characterizes, and to a degree caricatures, the typical Christian response to contrary ideas as that of a petulant child putting his fingers in his ears and repeating, “I CAN'T HEAR YOU” to drown out the sound of anything that might question what is held so dearly.As a Christian,who deals with many Christians, it is hard to not acquiesce to his diagnosis. So often, those who should be genuinely searching out truth wherever it lies (seeing as how all truth is God's truth) will allow ourselves to remain ignorant out of fear that our beliefs will come crashing down and our God with them. If this fear is not present,then the possibility of ever having to admit some degree of error in our interpretation of the Bible or of the world or of our self is more than our pride can stand.Labels abound. If you believe in health care for all or government based social services then you are a “communist”. If you believe that some of the Bible is not to be taken literally, you're a “liberal” who does not believe the Bible. If you preach grace you are “antinomian” and if you preach responsibility and fidelity, you are a “legalist”. The word “heretic” gets thrown around on anyone not conforming to “the Bible” which would be more accurately and honesty communicated as “my interpretation of the Bible”.All these labels do in most cases is perpetuate ignorance and division, making it more convenient and efficient for us as we sit in God's seat of judgment on any who might not submit themselves to what we “know” as truth. Enter Francis Collins. Talk about a guy getting it from all angles. Collins was the head of the Human Genome Project, the scientific research to map out the human genome. The work done under his leadership has led to us have a genetic map of human beings. The benefit of this in the war against disease and defect is incapable of being overstated. The work God has done through this man and his leadership is amazing.And therein lies the reason he receives such criticism. Collins, a biologist, stood in the Oval Office with then President Clinton and nodded approvingly when President Clinton remarked that we could now see the “language of God” used in creation. How a professional biologist could hold to an “inherently unscientific” belief in God and approve of such theistic speak offended many in the biological community. That a committed Christian could believed in the “inherently atheistic” doctrine of evolution, offended many in the Christian community.That is the backdrop for the book, The Language of God by Francis Collins. Collins work is one part biography, one part scientific treatise and one part apologetic. Collins spends time going over his life, and his own path from atheism, to agnosticism, and finally to his firm belief in the theism of Biblical Christianity. The biographical aspects of the book are all centered on how he has related his lifelong love of science with his lifelong struggle with faith,and it is quite engrossing. Even as the biographical aspects of the book focus on Collins' own personal path, the way he presents it is overtly apologetic. He constantly goes over how he was convinced of the truth of theism and eventually the Christian truth claim, not simply recounting the fact that he was convinced. The way the apologetic is intertwined with the biographical narrative reminds one of reading C.S. Lewis when he deals with the same subject. Based on the references to and quotes from Lewis, this may not have been intentional but certainly it is without shock that some of Lewis' writing style was adopted by Collins.The apologetic nature of the book is not limited solely to a defense of the Christian faith. The idea of this book is how to rectify a belief in current scientific trends and the Christian faith. In doing so, Collins argues that Darwinian Evolution is true and that it is NOT contrary to the Christian faith. With so much teaching for and evidence of evolution, Collins' devotes a chapter to each of the possible responses to evolution. These chapters are Atheism and Agnosticism (When Science Trumps Faith), Creationism (When Faith Trumps Science), Intelligent Design (When Science Needs Divine Help),and BioLogos (Faith and Science in Harmony). Collins is basically fair in his assessment of the opposing views, but throughout the chapters it is clear that he is building to what he holds as truth by dismantling what he holds as false(or even silly). Collins closes with pleas to believers to not abandon science and scientists to not abandon faith.As I read the book I had to remind myself that Collins is not a theologian, he is a biologist. His interpretation of some Christian doctrines is off what he seems to hold as essential is debated amongst Christians. Some of the history he cites is incorrect and the citations could have been more thorough, especially on some instances where no citation was given. Also, there were times where Collins began speaking exclusively to his peers, losing the reader with limited scientific knowledge in the process.While this book is far from perfect, it is a great read. It would benefit anyone involved in the evolution debate(that would be anyone who has any religious, secular or scientific interest....everyone) to read this book and consider the arguments made and data presented"

Of course the author of science is compatible with the science He created. It’s hard to believe this is still or has ever been an issue. However, it’s definitely worth the read just to hear his perspective on evolution. I’m not quite sold on the science but he is very persuasive. I’ve been reading both sides of the theistic evolution-intelligent design debate for a while now and I’m not convinced humans have fully learned enough yet to die on any hill. One thing is for certain– Francis Collins truly loves Jesus and it grieves me when Christians attack each other over non-essential doctrines not explicit in the Bible. Remember, we are all bothers and sisters in Christ. "

For me, it helped clarify issues surrounding stem cell research, some things regarding evolution, and other hotbed controversial issues without me feeling like I had to 'check my faith in God' at the door in order to engage in the things this scientist was saying. It was a breath of fresh air. "

113,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93234321-lucas-mroz,5,"Such a great book that tackles the coexistence of science and faith. Highly recommend no matter where you fall on that continuum. Big take away: if God created everything, and science studies everything, then science helps us understand God more, not less."

120,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32254765-kevin-stilley,3,"The following are discussion questions for ""The Language of God"" that I created for the monthly meeting of of the Atheist Christian Book Club. For information on the Atheist Christian Book Club you can go to the website at http://atheistchristianbookclub.com/ or seek us out on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/AtheistChris... .CHAPTER 1: FROM ATHEISM TO BELIEFCollins says that for him agnosticism was a place of retreat where he wouldn’t actually have to seriously consider the evidence for or against belief. That is obviously not true of those in this book group, but do you think it is generally true for most agnostics? Is agnosticism a position that is held in order to avoid the question of God’s existence altogether?Collins writes that the Moral Law was the primary thing that made him reconsider his atheism. What about those in our book group. Is there a “one thing” that creates cognitive dissonance and makes the atheists in the group pause to reconsider?CHAPTER 2: THE WAR OF THE WORLDVIEWSA similar question for the Christians; is there a question that makes you uncomfortable with your faith? Collins talks about four questions that he struggled with during the early days of his newfound belief. Is there a question like that that makes the Christians in the group sometimes doubt? If not currently, was there a question you struggled with at some time in your life?Collins lists four difficult questions that he struggled with as a new believer; (1) Isn’t the idea of God just wish-fulfillment?, (2) What about all the harm done in the name of religion?, (3) Why would a loving God allow suffering in the world?, and (4) How can a rational person believe in miracles? Were you satisfied with the answers Collins has arrived at and shares here?CHAPTER 3: THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSECollins writes, “Immanuel Kant wrote: ""Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the Moral Law within."" I have heard some former atheist/agnostics similarly indicate that these two things, nature and the moral law, seemed to be ever present in the back of their mind/heart as an indication that there had to be something more than just the material even when they were most intellectually opposed to the idea of God. I’m curious if those two concerns have any influence on the atheists/agnostics in our book group?Collins writes, “Based on these and other observations, physicists are in agreement that the universe began as an infinitely dense, dimensionless point of pure energy. The laws of physics breakdown in this circumstance, referred to as a ""singularity."" Is there the same kind of unanimity among the members of this book group as there seems to be among physicists? Collins seems to think that the question of origins hinges upon the question “What happened before the Big Bang?” Would the book club members agree?Collins' timeline (number of years) differs from some of the Christians in the room. For those who hold to a young earth theory of creation, how important do you think it is to adhere to a “thousands of years” formula instead of a “millions or billions of years” formula?The question of old earth vs. young earth is primarily a discussion held within the camp of Christianity. However, how does it affect those of you who are atheistic/agnostic?Collins writes of the Anthropic Principle, that “The existence of a universe as we know it rests upon a knife edge of improbability.” (page 73) This same fine-tuning argument also had an influence on the author of a previous book we read, Anthony Flew. The author gives three possibilities; (1) an infinite number of universes, (2) we are just very, very lucky, or (3) The precise tuning of all of the physical constants and physical laws to make intelligent life possible is not an accident, but reflects the action of the one who created the universe in the first place. What do you think?Collins quotes a number of famous scientists who believe that “""It would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun in just this way, except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us."" (pages 75ff). Do you think that Stephen Hawking, Freeman Dyson, Arno Penzias and other such scientists (such as Collins, himself) forfeit their scientific bona fides by taking such a position?The author claims that “there is nothing inherently in conflict between the idea of a creator God and what science has revealed.” Do you agree or disagree with him? Why? (page 81) The author further claims that “the opening words of Genesis (""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"") are entirely compatible with the Big Bang.” Do you agree or disagree with him? (pages 82-83)CHAPTER 4: LIFE ON EARTH – OF MICROBES AND MENCollins says that “no serious scientist would currently claim that a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life is at hand” but warns Christians not to result to a God of the gaps apologetic. He encourages them to adopt an approach using “positive reasons, based on knowledge, rather than default assumptions based on (a temporary) lack of knowledge.” However, for those of you who are atheists, does “the inability of modern science to develop a statistically probable mechanism” for the origin of life give you any intellectual pause? (pages 92-93)Collins writes, “No serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life. In fact, the relatedness of all species through the mechanism of evolution is such a profound foundation for the understanding of all biology that it is difficult to imagine how one would study life without it.” Is this true? Are there no serious biologists that doubt the theory of evolution? Is Collins being fair to those who disagree with him on this matter? (page 99)CHAPTER 5: DECIPHERING GOD’S INSTRUCTION BOOK – THE LESSONS OF THE HUMAN GENOMECollins asserts that the difference between macroevolution and microevolution is “increasingly seen to be artificial. But then to illustrate it is a distinction without a difference he uses the example of a stickleback fish with armor becoming a stickleback fish without armor. I think most critics of Darwinism would find this example not to be compelling. A fish becomes a fish. A virus becomes a slightly different virus. How is this evidence for the “tree of life”? Was his example sufficient for you to think that the distinction between macroevolution and microevolution is “arbitrary”? (pages 131-132)In reference to similarities between human and mouse genomes, Collins writes, “This evidence alone does not, of course, prove a common ancestor; from a creationist perspective, such similarities could simply demonstrate that God used successful design principles over and over again. As we shall see, however, and as was foreshadowed above by the discussion of ""silent"" mutations in protein-coding regions, the detailed study of genomes has rendered that interpretation virtually untenable—not only about all other living things, but also about ourselves.” Do you think that the evidence provided by Collins actually supports his claim that it is untenable to believe that God used successful design principles over and over again? (pages 133-137)Does Collins provide compelling evidence from genetic similarities to prove that humans and other life forms have a common ancestor? (pages 137- 142)CHAPTER 6: GENESIS, GALILEO, AND DARWINCollins writes about the emotional distance between Christian believers who are adherents of Darwinism and those who reject this biological theory. What do you think about this? Is it difficult for these to “sides” to coexist in theological harmony? (pages 145-147)CHAPTER 7: OPTION 1 – ATHEISM AND AGNOSTICISM (WHEN SCIENCE TRUMPS FAITH)Collins writes about the hostility between some believers and unbelievers. How common is this? Why do you think this is so? (pages 159ff)The author of our book quotes Dawkins as saying, “""It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus, 'mad cow' disease, and many others, but I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.” Do the atheists in our group believe that faith is evil? (page 163)Collins quotes Stephen Jay Gould as saying that since “Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny” the existence of God. Do you agree with Gould? (page 166)The author refers to four different groups:1. Strong Atheists = have a firm conviction that no deities exist.2. Weak Atheism = the absence of belief in the existence of a God or gods3. Strong Agnostics = believes there is no way that human kind will “ever” know if there is a God4. Weak Atheists = believes only that it is not possible to know “yet” whether or not there is a GodWhat is the composition of atheists/agnostics in our group in regard to these four descriptions?CHAPTER 8: OPTION 2 - CREATIONISM (WHEN FAITH TRUMPS SCIENCE)Does Collins accurately reflect the beliefs of most Young Earth Creationists when he claims that they believe in Microevolution, which he defines as small changes within a species, but do not believe in Macroevolution, which he describes as one species evolving into another species? Many of the young earth creationists that I know are much more flexible with the definition of Microevolution, and define it as changing from one genus, or one order, into another genus or order. (page 172) Does this matter, or is this a distinction without a difference?Is Collins being a bit hysterical when he declares that should YEC scientific claims be true then, “it would lead to a complete and irreversible collapse of the sciences of physics, chemistry, cosmology, geology, and biology.”? (page 174) He makes it sound down right apocalyptic; are YEC that dangerous?CHAPTER 9: OPTION 3 – INTELLIGENT DESIGN (WHEN SCIENCE NEEDS DIVINE HELP)Collins asserts that if the logic of Intelligent Design “truly had merit on scientific grounds, one would expect that the rank and file of working biologists would also show interest in pursuing these ideas, especially since a significant number of biologists are also believers.” (page 187) However, haven’t historians of science like Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) written that just the opposite is true? Does not history tell us that science that none of the revolutionary paradigmatic changes that science has undergone were quickly accepted on the basis of reason/evidence alone? Is head-counting an appropriate way to determine truth?Collins claims that ID is a God of the gaps theory and that science is busily filling in those gaps with things other than God, and thus the theory is collapsing. If so, what then happens with faith? (page 195)CHAPTER 10: BIOLOGOS (SCIENCE AND FAITH IN HARMONY)Within Christianity there is frequently contentious debates among believers about what is the right approach/beliefs regarding creation. How do those of you who are atheists react when you witness such debates?Collins points out that BioLogos is not a scientific theory? (page 204) Does that seem like a copout for a group of scientists to be organizing around a non-scientific theory?CHAPTER 11: TRUTH SEEKERSCollins tells his conversion story in the final chapter. We have on several occasions honestly discussed the question, “What would it take for you to become a person of faith?” and “What would it take for you to become a disbeliever?” Has this book modified your answers to these questions?One of the previous books we discussed was written by the world’s leading intellectual atheist and documented his conversion to theism. This book was written by the person who may be the world’s leading medical geneticist and why he is a Christian. Has the stature of these two authors provoked any intellectual movement from those of you who are atheists?DID ANYONE HAVE A CHANGE OF OPINION (ABOUT ANYTHING) AS A RESULT OF READING THIS BOOK? HAS ANYONE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE YEAR WE HAVE SPENT READING AND DISCUSSING TOGETHER?Supplementary note: Several of the atheistic authors we have read in our book group have indicated that all inerrantists believe in a young earth. This is not true. For a survey of the different viewpoints of inerrantists you can read the following short article: https://www.christianpost.com/news/do..."
121,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14348847-henry-stoltzfus,4,"I had a hard time deciding on a rating for this book.On the one hand, the author really fails to deliver on the promise in the subtitle. There is little ""evidence for belief"" here, and I think most people who have seriously engaged with the god question will have already encountered the main arguments elsewhere.That being said, it was an enjoyable read and I came away with renewed respect for Dr. Collins and his work. Even though his attempt at reconciling the scientific and religious worldviews was ultimately unconvincing for me, he comes across as one of the most intellectually honest and sincere Christian thinkers I've encountered on this topic."

123,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43496878-chris-woody,4,"When I was a student small group leader a few years ago, I had a group of abnormally inquisitive middle schoolers. One day, one of them asked about how we as Christians should look at ""cavemen,"" and, though I don't remember what all was said from there, I know that I mentioned it is okay for Christians to accept evolution. Of course, this didn't sit well with one of my other, well-meaning students, who had never been exposed to such an idea. Even when I said that C.S. Lewis might have accepted the possibility of evolution, his response was ""No, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure he was a Christian."" This all ended with me having to have a chat with the youth pastor to ensure that I wasn't saying anything heretical. All of this is to say that, as a Christian who sees the theory of evolution as compatible with belief, I've found myself in some trouble with my church over these views.This question has been one that I've been mulling over for years: How can Christians accept the evidence that we evolved over millions of years without also saying that we don't take the sanctity of Scripture seriously. I think that Francis Collins, a world-renowned geneticist and devout believer, does a pretty good job of this. He lays out a pretty good argument that science can actually enhance our ability to appreciate God's creation, not jeopardize it. He also does a good job of arguing against both atheism and strict creationism, both of which exist on the far ends of the spectrum when it comes to the ""science-faith"" debate. I think that a lot of believers would do well to read this book and find that it is okay to trust science and still believe in a loving God. Had I read this before, I would have been able to recommend it to my student, as I'm sure Collins can articulate things and explain complex scientific concepts far better than I can."
124,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121586-aaron-barnhart,3,"Our Sunday School class has been reading this clear, concise defense of Christian faith from an evangelical and one of the country's leading geneticists. Collins is controversial with his fellow evangelicals because he argues that evolution is an accepted scientific method, and he is controversial among atheists and skeptics because he asserts that God is both the loving creator of the universe and a being who exists beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. He is, essentially, C.S. Lewis brought into the 21st century — and I say that as someone who is well aware of Lewis's literary reputation. Collins is a highly readable author, and his informal, avuncular prose is arguably more accessible to Christians today than the somewhat outdated and dense argumentation of ""Mere Christianity.""That said, I find The Language of God unsatisfying because it is largely a guide to fellow evangelicals on how to defend their faith against the atheistic meanies of the scientific world like Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. Such people, and we can throw Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens in there while we're at it, are no threat to Christianity because they comprise such a small part of the population. (Harris's argument that Collins should not have been appointed the head of the National Institutes of Health because of his Christian views is a case in point. Collins has no controversial scientific views that I know of, and he is, like most taxpayers, a professed Christian.) Many, if not most, American Christians, however, are neither evangelicals of the Collins stripe nor fundamentalist six-day creationist types (the other group this book takes aim at). Many Christians are members of non-evangelical churches who take their values to their workplace and households without a lot of fanfare or ""God talk."" Another emerging group is Gen-Y evangelicals, who grew up in these churches but disdain their parents' conservative politics and are ready to rethink what it is to be a Christian in the secular society. To me, a major challenge facing Christianity is how to coax these two sets of believers back into the public square, where their moderating influence and quiet moral strength would really come in handy right about now. With his evangelical zeal and quick answers to every problem, Collins strikes me as too much like the nut cases he claims to oppose — people whose minds are made up and aren't interested in real discussion. The Language of God may appear to be at first on the side of such reasonable people, but in the end it offers them surprisingly little help, unless they happen to go to a church much like the one Collins attends."
125,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5292677-al-datum,5,"There are a few claims made by atheists on a regular basis. They include the following:- Only the uneducated become Christians. Truly educated people, especially scientists, would never accept such nonsense- The only reason people are Christians is that they were raised to believe as they doThis book is proof that these two claims are simply nonsense. Francis Collins was an atheist prior to his scientific work on the human genome project. His career has been stellar (he led the Human Genome Project and is currently the director of the National Institutes of Health). He is a leading scientist, and certainly qualifies as a truly educated person. He was also not a Christian his entire life.Collins became a Christian when he began to look at the complexity of the human genome. As he recounts in this book, he was simply unable to remain an atheist since his scientific findings led him to the inescapable conclusion of design and a transcendent designer (this same argument has persuaded many atheists, by the way...check out Antony Flew's conversion. Or Alister McGrath. Or John Polkinghorne. Or Frank Tipler...I could go on).In this book, Collins describes his journey and shows why he came to the conclusion that God exists. He makes the case that was persuasive to him, and also builds the case that evolution and Christianity are not mutually exclusive (in fact, as philosopher William Lane Craig has said, the existence of evolution in such a short span of time [speaking of the length of time our planet has existed] would itself be a miracle, and thus proof of God).Collins does a good job of showing that science and Christianity are not enemies, but partners in the quest for truth (Christianity is, after all, largely responsible for Western Science getting its start). He shows the reasonableness of being both a leading scientist and a believer. And he destroys the two claims I listed at the beginning of this review. Not only is it possible for highly educated scientists to be raised as non-believers only to be converted to Christianity when confronted with the evidence. But Dr. Collins is living proof of this fact.Pick this book up if you'd like to read Dr. Collins' story. It's a very interesting one. And if you're open to following the evidence where it leads, it provides a persuasive case that the evidence leads directly to the existence of an all-powerful creator and designer.One other thing...if you're looking for a good, quick overview of Bayes Theorem, this book has a nice treatment of it that anyone can understand.Simply put...atheism is wrong. The evidence is inescapable."
126,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1225279-clint,3,"3.0 - In this book Collins explains how he harmonizes his belief in God with his understanding of evolution and other scientific processes involved in the creation of our universe. While I don't agree with every conclusion that Collins reaches, his honest and reasonable approach make this a very interesting book. He does a good job of giving a broad-brush description of the major scientific theories involved (big bang and evolution) and evidence for them. His explanations of DNA, how it's used, and how it provides further evidence of evolutionary processes was particularly interesting. I felt his establishment of evolution as truth was a little lacking, as there were a few evolutionary question marks that weren't acknowledged, or weren't addressed as thoroughly as I'd have liked. His arguments in favor of God were based primarily on the philosophical ideas of Moral Law and universal longing for God as presented by C. S. Lewis. While he touched on some physical evidences of a Creator, such as the beautiful mathematical connection with nature and its laws, based on the title I was expecting more. Just as his establishment of evolution was lacking, I found his establishment of God also lacking. He proclaimed Moral Law as his most convincing evidence, yet failed to really establish any sort of spiritual-based evidence. I realize that spiritual evidence is subjective and it deals more on a personal level, but isn't that how it should be? Faith is a personal decision, salvation is a personal issue, our relationship with God is personal, so the spiritual evidence for him should be personal. The bottom line of the book though was that science and faith can and should happily coexist. Truth should be in harmony with truth. Science cannot prove nor disprove the existance and role of a Creator, all it can do is shed light on how the creations behave. "
127,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"Dr. Collins articulates the two sides of the argument (faith v. science) well - and then demonstrates how the argument really shouldn't exist at all as both faith and science are involved in the search for Truth, albeit with different tools and methods. Nothing spectacularly new, in fact he leans heavily on others' words, notably C.S. Lewis, but also many others from Copernicus to Augustine to generally good effect. Hard to judge how convincing he was since I already agreed with most of his premises and assertions.Brief, helpful review of biological reproduction of DNA was clearly explained without either condescending to the reader or assuming the reader remembered every detail from Biology 101.For more book reviews, visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."
128,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312471-karen-l,3,"I liked this book but I did not love it. Why? Well, I have to say that as other critics of this book have noted, he does quote Lewis a little too much. I love C. S. Lewis and agreed with the author on many points yet I would have rather had him quote a little more of a variety of influences.Still, I did find his stories interesting and his ability to make science accessible to the non science layman very helpful. The book contains a lot of good information and most definitely could boost the faith of someone who is a doubter."
129,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1647255-fire-kovarovic,1,"The reviews were so promising... I expected a philosophical treatise but received a shallow description of one man's career and how he came to assume a life of faith. While there might be a place for this sort of literature, it was not what I was looking for. I clearly was not a member of the target audience."
130,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,4,I saw this author one afternoon on the Beeb and checked out his book from the library. I have always been disgusted with the fundamentalist belief that it is either science or faith. This book is a wonderful statement for the idea that science is evidence of God in action. I really enjoyed this book. It even re-awakened a sense of faith that the Bush administration had nearly destroyed.
131,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29591849-elinor,3,"This was pretty great. Relied heavily on CS Lewis for the apologetics, but gave a lot of interesting insight on the biology/science side of things."
132,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62738513-richard-webb,2,"Devoted to reconciling Judeo-Christians and evolutionists. Misses many opportunities to do so. As a renowned geneticist and leader of the Human Genome Project, reputed to be the greatest achievement of our generation, Collins team completed the first-draft mapping of the 3 billion gene sequences in DNA in 2000, and now heads the National Institutes of Health.As a Christian, Collins proposes that faith in God and faith in science can coexist and be harmonious saying, ‘We have caught the first glimpse of our instruction book, previously known only to God”.Collins boldly challenges his Darwinian colleagues: “So those who choose to be atheists must find some other basis for taking that position, evolution won’t do.” (Pg 167), and “agnosticism also runs the risk of being a cop-out,” (Pg 168). Further, he notes that distinguished agnostics who took time to consider the evidence “unexpectedly converted themselves” (Pg 168). Perhaps he wrote this book to those folks. But instead of reconciling atheistic/agnostic science to God’s Word in the Bible, Collins attempts to push the Bible toward today’s tenuous tenets of science. He first tries to build bridges to atheists by recounting common misconceptions about the Salem Witch Trials, the Crusades, and the underlying beliefs of fundamentally violent Islam; leading him to unjustified self-criticisms of Christianity (Pg 41). However, unexpurgated history shows witch trials ended because two Christian preachers objected to the execution of 20 Salem witches, ending the murder of tens of thousands in Europe. The Crusades were a last-option response to Moslems terrorizing Europe – a resurrected scourge that we must again excise as our Founders did in the 1780’s.Outside His FieldAs a Biblical apologist, Collins writes outside his field of expertise, borrowing credibility from his reputation as an eminent scientist. His discussion of suffering (Pg 43) fails to understand that all good flows from God’s highest value - LOVE Mark 12:30-31, requiring totally free will, and the inseparable freedom to not love. Love cannot be compelled (logically, anything less than totally free-will regarding an all-powerful God could easily be coercion, which God sedulously avoids). Logically then, the failure to choose love begets all evil and suffering. Should God have restrained free-will in order to prevent evil behavior? Logically, He cannot.Additionally, Collins misunderstanding the concept of dominion from Psalm 115:16 and Psalm 8:6, and how Adam ceded to satan the dominion given to Adam in Genesis 1:28, hinders Collins analysis of suffering and evil. Satan now exercises that dominion. Luke 4:6 and 2Cor 4:4 But Jesus gave us, His followers, the power to defeat satan James 4:7, John 4:4, Matt 10:8 if we will “be transformed by the renewing of [our] mind” Rom 12:2 and use that power.Collins also misunderstands (Pg 44-45), that miracles are intended to routinely follow believers: “These signs will follow those who believe” Mark 16:17 and “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out demons.” Matt 10:8 “These things you have seen me do, you will also do, and greater works than these…” John 14:12-14, and “God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders…” Heb 2:4. Perhaps a more Pentecostal understanding of believer’s authority in Eph 1:19-20 and Mark 16:17 would be helpful to him.Big BangCollins assertion that Big Bang is “well described and unlikely to be revised” is hubristic and inconsistent with history. Collins’ Big-Bang endorsement (Pg 68) fails to mention serious doubts raised by observations of counter-rotating galaxies, stars moving toward us, and quantized red-shift. Dissenting scientists question why supposedly “old” supernova exploding stars have projected materials such short distances when an old universe theory would predict extremely long distances. His assumption of a 14 billion universe age (Pg 64) ignores Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy) and radically faster speed of light at creation that promises to someday fit paleontology within the Biblical framework. Collins warns against literal interpretation of the Bible (Pg 83), but science, as an attempt to know the mind of God, would proceed more rapidly if a Biblical view of Origin informed astronomy, physics, biology, etc. Instead, atheists waste billions of taxpayer-funded research dollars constructing fairy-tales to “prove” God does not exist. “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” Rom 1:22 In contrast to Sir Isaac Newton and William Maury who researched scripture to launch their scientific inquiry, Einstein, Hawking, and many others initially presupposed a naturalistic origin and as evidence mounted, got dragged into reluctant recognition of a Creator. Biogenesis Perhaps as a professional courtesy, but with absolutely no evidence, Collins PRESUMES (Pg 89) that dirt assembled ITSELF into DNA digital code, acquired the capability of information storage, and differentiated into multiple “kinds”. We’ve not seen such baseless backward extrapolation since Darwin, in his book of speculative conjecture published without corroborating data, presumed that adaptation explains origin. Science predicated itself on the foundational principle that there is God’s discoverable order in the universe - down to the structure of sub-atomic particles. Order sans intelligence is logically impossible! Yet scientists thrill at each new fairy-tale atheistic deception, and deem anything plausible when multiplied by millions of years. Possibly the Rosetta Stone was formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion (wink).  Collins draws no clear distinction between ADAPTATATION (micro-evolution) and ORIGIN (macro-evolution).Collins says random assembly of molecules may have occurred. He tries to torpedo the entropy argument against biogenesis (the fairy-tale that chemistry begat biology vs. the truth that everything degrades) with an analogy that ignores the essential element of purpose-driven order, plus sustainability, and replication (Pg. 92). Molecules bumping into molecules, like people in a crowd, does not infer or confer a relationship, or transfer properties, or create order. There is no reason for the new combination to persist, incorporate, amalgamate, congregate, consolidate, or replicate.He allows that God could have created the first DNA, but offers no rationale for why God would have stopped with one or a few samples, and thus enjoy the fun of creating diversity. He warns against a “God of the Gaps” (Pg 93) but fails to acknowledge the eventual overturning of nearly every contravening “scientific” presumption, hypothesis, and theory to date. Instead of asking, “How did God do this?” the world supports vain imaginations (hubristic fairy-tales) that eventually fail. Contrast this with the greatest physicist/mathmetician ever, Sir Isaac Newton’s 1704 manuscript describing his quest to extract scientific information from the Bible. Newton’s Laws of Motion and Gravity have withstood the test of time. Perhaps there is a correlation between seeking God and finding truth.Collins warns against betting on a literal Genesis occurrence, then he ventures into paleontology dogma (Pg 93), failing to include recent creationist evidence that disputes long-held scientific beliefs. Neither does he proffer any evidence for the claim that extinct ”kinds” are the missing transitional forms.Self-DevelopmentCollins introduces Darwin’s assertion (which he ultimately adopts) that God may have “created a few original forms capable of self-development” (Pg 98). Biologists mis-use anthropomorphic terms like “strategy” saying that bugs develop a strategy to overcome pesticides. Ridiculous! If self-development is possible, the most intelligent of all God’s creation would have, by now, a bigger penis! Kindly pardon this graphic illustration needed to dramatize my point.Emulating Darwin, Collins takes pains to point out possible harmonious interpretations, but instead of accepting the Bible as true, and reconciling the current nascent state of struggling science with it, Collins incorrectly proclaims that “no serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life” (Pg 99). He should visit Institute for Creation Research or Answers in Genesis or Creation.com to be enlightened by an ever-growing body of scientists whose compelling evidence refutes his assertion. My own feeble survey of the beauty and apparently gratuitous diversity of amazing fish (28,000 species) is sufficient to understand that God intended to give a glimpse of his power, magnificence, and divinity thru our observation of what He made. Romans 1:20.AdaptationCollins cites adaptations in stickleback fish, malaria, HIV, and flu as examples of evolution (Pg 132), but each degraded mutation is just a variant of itself, an adaptation. The flu virus is still a flu virus; it does not morph into an HIV virus or a new disease, or new “kind”. Even purposeful (with intelligence) attempts to modify fruitfly genes over thousands of generations only result in mutant fruitflies, some with wings sticking out of their heads.His refutation of Special Creation’s “Ex Nihilo Species” (Pg 137) is feeble in that he illogically ignores God’s prerogative to re-use successful patterns. Why should God start anew with each “kind” He created? The Bible repeatedly says“after his kind” (e.g. Gen 1:24 Webster’s version is the most grammatically correct) which reinforces that God created multiple kinds of plants and animals. One can only imagine how much fun God must have had with the variations.DNAIt appears that DNA is comprised of error-correcting code like a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). If a piece is lost or corrupted, the piece can be reconstructed by referencing the other pieces. The math and logic needed to accomplish this feat was developed in computers long before it was recognized in DNA. Neither happened without intelligent design!Normally I would avoid criticism tangential to this distinguished scientist’s area of expertise, but Collins makes a special point of calling caspace-12 a “nonfunctional gene” (Pg 139) to argue against Special Creation.Certainly, it is illogical to presume that God would design a gene with 45% flotsam and jetsam (Pg 136). Having been a computer programmer I visualize genes as analogous to a computer memory-dump in which data and instructions mix within the hexadecimal strings. I remember it was frequently easier to spot data (analogous to GAA and GAG recipe for glutamic acid) than to identify instructions within the memory dump. Doesn’t it make sense to pursue an inquiry into what Collins dismissively calls Ancient Repetitive Elements (AREs) as possible instructions governing the GAA and GAG? I could find nowhere that this cellular biology expert presents the fact that DNA requires 75 proteins to exist, but proteins require DNA for construction. Using this undeniable fact, he could have made a much stronger case for God.Young EarthCollins attacks Young Earth creationists (Pg 172-179) saying “Young Earth creationism has reached a point of intellectual bankruptcy, both in its science and in its theology”. He assumes processes like deuterium decay always functioned as now, assumes light had to travel from distant stars (Pg 176) as opposed to beams having been created simultaneous with, or BEFORE (Gen 1:3) the stars (Gen 1:14). He fails to cite these arguments for a young earth fitting a Bible timeline:•	Ocean salinity and sediment deposits at river mouths are consistent with a young earth.•	The number of exploding star (supernova) remnants (SNRs) in all three stages is consistent with a 7000 year-young universe.•	Evidence that God did not create an embryonic universe, but a fully functioning interactive SYSTEM, manifests in plants that require creatures for pollination.•	Due to Barry Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy, the physical manifestation of Planck’s constant) The speed of light and electrons has decreased asymptotically since Creation. Light appears to have 30% faster in Jesus day, 400 times faster in Abraham’s day, and ten million times faster prior to 3,000BC.•	Speed of light may be increasing as it encounters less ZPE at the outer edges of space. Just as light speeds up after it emerges from water, allow me to speculate that the nature of light may be such (otherwise, what is the energy source?) that it goes at a fixed speed except while ZPE, water, atmosphere, and space dust etc. hinders.•	Electrons bouncing erratically off ZPE as they negotiate the ZPE hurdles on their orbital track, probably explains the “Uncertainty Principle” of quantum physics. Electrons are moving slower too. Calculations of age based on atomic decay need extreme revision.•	We are simply peering thru a longer taillight beam as the once-close stars travel away. The light appears redder because the lower-energy photons were redder, not a Doppler effect as suggested by Hubbel’s red-shift. We cannot observe light from outside the beam because it always heads directly toward us. The speed is relative to our own speed.When people study the Bible’s supernatural truths, fulfilled prophesies, structure, its heptadic code (7’s), and gematria (Jewish numbering) sufficiently to know that the Bible is, beyond doubt, directly from God, then their worldview is firmly rooted in truth. God’s account of how He created the universe, and us, is not an allegory as Collins maintains. Successful (real, true) science, like Bible study, is an attempt to know the mind of God.Science hinders itself with materialistic terms of engagement that stifle investigation. Our physics is likely only a shadow of a larger reality hinted at by mathematical postulations of additional dimensions we cannot yet comprehend. We should think of our material universe as a subset of a larger (supernatural) reality. Science thwarts progress by clinging to foolish atheistic traditions designed to deny the existence of God. Beware of OrthodoxyEducator John Taylor Gatto (author of Dumbing Us Down) told me schooling trains people to act like fish (swim in unison). Joe Bobier, inventor of Single-Cycle Modulation said “If I had been an electrical engineer, they would have convinced me this is not possible.” The reason breakthrough ideas are coming from sophomore high schoolers (Jack Andraka’s cancer detector, Simon Tsaoussis, two-transistor ternary RAM) is that they are not overly encumbered by orthodoxy. Revolutionary, disruptive, correct ideas encounter establishment ridicule as Dr. Robert O. Becker describes in his journey The Body Electric. Collins incorrectly struggles to conform to atheist/agnostic orthodoxy instead of standing firmly on God’s Word. I strongly urge him to revise this book."
133,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,4,"Francis Collins is a renowned scientist -- the former director of the Human Genome Project -- and also a Christian. In a time when science and faith can seem so diametrically opposed, it was encouraging to read one person's view of how he balances the two perspectives, and sees them as complementary rather than hostile to each other. I don't know how well this book will speak to all the different perspectives it could potentially be speaking to. I don't know whether an atheist or agnostic reader will be convinced or touched by the arguments and ideas presented here, since I am neither of those. It does cover quite a few topics -- from Collins' path to faith from his initial atheism; to a discussion of both scientific and faith-based approaches to worldviews, covering atheism, agnosticism, intelligent design, young-earth creationism, as well as theistic evolution, which he terms ""BioLogos""; as well as an overview of human DNA and what the Human Genome Project was aiming to accomplish; and an appendix devoted to bioethics, there was a lot to take in here (though I found it a relatively quick read).I think I was able to get the scientific gist of most of what he was writing about, since this was written for a layperson, but obviously there's a lot beneath the surface. I found the bits about the human genome most interesting. Faith-wise, numerous C.S. Lewis quotes will always draw me in, though I'm sure I'm not from the same ""bent"" of Christianity as Collins (though the same could be said for Lewis). But I valued the discussions of the various intersections of faith and science in regards to worldview (with an emphasis on origins).I don't agree with all of Collins' views here (though I can appreciate that we can still hold the same faith despite differences), and in many cases I don't even understand enough yet to know whether I agree or disagree. But I'm still grateful for his perspective, because it has helped me to clarify my thinking on some things, which includes some errors and inconsistencies in perspectives that I have held or entertained. I also appreciate him incorporating other thinkers (both scientists and theologians) into his arguments, because many quotes he uses are also interesting and make me want to learn more.I especially appreciate his call to not view God's Word and his creation as being ""at war with itself,"" as expressed in this quote that I think sums up his views nicely:“Will we turn our backs on science because it is perceived as a threat to God, abandoning all the promise of advancing our understanding of nature and applying that to the alleviation of suffering and the betterment of humankind? Alternatively, will we turn our backs on faith, concluding that science has rendered the spiritual life no longer necessary, and that traditional religious symbols can now be replaced by engravings of the double helix on our altars?Both of these choices are profoundly dangerous. Both deny truth. Both will diminish the nobility of humankind. Both will be devastating to our future. And both are unnecessary. The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. He can be worshipped in the cathedral or in the laboratory. His creation is majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful - and it cannot be at war with itself. Only we imperfect humans can start such battles. And only we can end them.”"
134,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66465627-adam-balshan,3,"3 stars [Humanism]Apologetics (vs. Atheism): 3.5. Science: 2 stars.Collins's book failed and succeeded. His first objective was to sieve Darwinian Evolution from atheism, on which he sold me. His second was to defend Theistic Evolution, in which he thoroughly failed. On the first matter, he created the best starting apologetic for scientific atheists that I've read. Collins was once an atheist. He took apart Dawkins. He glossed over true differences between DE and theology for the sake of (a false) harmony, but believably estranged DE and materialism. He seems to be a real Christian, however it is of course always hard to reliably tell. He professed belief and a relationship, which sounded genuine, but he kept referring to the value of other faith traditions, never called Jesus the only Way, and otherwise generally retreated to what sounded vaguely like a ""it works for me"" stance.On defending TE, he hung his cap on Darwinian Evolution. He erected a caricature of Young Earth Creationism and proceeded to beat the straw out of it. He didn't just oppose YEC and Intelligent Design, he called them untenable and impossible. His evidences were quite dated for 2006. Such faulty data that he determined to irrefutably support DE included: the DNA similarity between humans, chimps and mice; the immutability of isotopic dating and isotope half-lives (despite no evidence of universe conditions past 100 years ago or so); Occam's Razor; and the proposed reducible complexity of blood clots, flagella and the human eye (the former two of which were plausible, but not irrefutable). He got right the fact that scientific truth and spiritual truth cannot contradict, but he promoted the DE argument as overwhelming instead of its true, overwhelming ambiguity. He resembled Ptolemy, accepting the noticeable errors in satellite epicycles rather than telling the world that the earth revolves around the Sun, all for the sake of a contrived peace. His views have been thoroughly and convincingly refuted by the publications of Answers in Genesis, and plausibly so by Gerald Schroeder's creation-physics model (which reconciles YEC and OEC) in his book, The Science of God."
135,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6422812-hawley,4,"Only took me a whole semester to finish this book, oops! Still though, I thought Collins’s argument for theistic evolution was compelling. As a scientist and a person of faith, I’ve never seen incompatibility between the two domains, but haven’t been able to clearly articulate my beliefs as theistic evolution. I am deeply compelled by the Moral Law argument and this book helped to strengthen my beliefs. I found myself coming back to this book and Collins’s arguments frequently over the course of the semester in my Philosophy of Religion class. We didn’t talk about theistic evolution directly, but The Language of God supplemented a lot of my coursework well. I was less compelled by Collins’s arguments for Christianity in particular toward the end of the book, but I appreciate his insistence that faith is a personal journey we must all come to for ourselves. Overall, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to understand more about science, faith, and the relationship between the two. "
136,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7287572-grace,2,"A manifesto for theistic evolution.Every time I read one of these books I feel smacked around and uneasy. I read Darwin's Black Box and felt compelled by Behe's explanations. I was similarly compelled by Collins's dismantling of Behe, though. What all of this comes down to is that I am a layman having to trust whoever writes these books to tell me what they wish, leave out & skip over what they wish, and interpret everything for me. The only solution is to go back to school for my own PhD in biology, I guess. Honestly, though, I would skip reading this book. If you want the good faith parts just read Mere Christianity or better yet C. S. Lewis's entire bibliography. If you want the good science parts, just read any mainstream college molecular biology textbook, or whatever the latest Richard Dawkins book is."
137,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57363039-emily-monroe,5,"For someone familiar with both Christianity and science, this is a great summary type of read that seeks to reconcile what many sources today tout as unreconcilable. Collins provides brief backgrounds on both apologetics (belief) and genetics (science). If a reader is not familiar with either of those topics, this book is not a good introduction. As a believer with a science and engineering background, I enjoyed learning his perspective. Collins is frank in stating that young earth creationism is a dangerous concept, and he gave language and examples to support it. He is also frank in saying that science does not and cannot explain everything about our existence and the meaning of life. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and took a lot away from it that I will use in conversations with both believers and non-believers."
138,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23188545-josh,4,"More and more,if you are willing to open your eyes, you will be confronted with those who have differing views and beliefs than your own. The temptation is great to simply dismiss any idea or worldview that seems contrary to the one you already hold. My brother characterizes, and to a degree caricatures, the typical Christian response to contrary ideas as that of a petulant child putting his fingers in his ears and repeating, “I CAN'T HEAR YOU” to drown out the sound of anything that might question what is held so dearly.As a Christian,who deals with many Christians, it is hard to not acquiesce to his diagnosis. So often, those who should be genuinely searching out truth wherever it lies (seeing as how all truth is God's truth) will allow ourselves to remain ignorant out of fear that our beliefs will come crashing down and our God with them. If this fear is not present,then the possibility of ever having to admit some degree of error in our interpretation of the Bible or of the world or of our self is more than our pride can stand.Labels abound. If you believe in health care for all or government based social services then you are a “communist”. If you believe that some of the Bible is not to be taken literally, you're a “liberal” who does not believe the Bible. If you preach grace you are “antinomian” and if you preach responsibility and fidelity, you are a “legalist”. The word “heretic” gets thrown around on anyone not conforming to “the Bible” which would be more accurately and honesty communicated as “my interpretation of the Bible”.All these labels do in most cases is perpetuate ignorance and division, making it more convenient and efficient for us as we sit in God's seat of judgment on any who might not submit themselves to what we “know” as truth. Enter Francis Collins. Talk about a guy getting it from all angles. Collins was the head of the Human Genome Project, the scientific research to map out the human genome. The work done under his leadership has led to us have a genetic map of human beings. The benefit of this in the war against disease and defect is incapable of being overstated. The work God has done through this man and his leadership is amazing.And therein lies the reason he receives such criticism. Collins, a biologist, stood in the Oval Office with then President Clinton and nodded approvingly when President Clinton remarked that we could now see the “language of God” used in creation. How a professional biologist could hold to an “inherently unscientific” belief in God and approve of such theistic speak offended many in the biological community. That a committed Christian could believed in the “inherently atheistic” doctrine of evolution, offended many in the Christian community.That is the backdrop for the book, The Language of God by Francis Collins. Collins work is one part biography, one part scientific treatise and one part apologetic. Collins spends time going over his life, and his own path from atheism, to agnosticism, and finally to his firm belief in the theism of Biblical Christianity. The biographical aspects of the book are all centered on how he has related his lifelong love of science with his lifelong struggle with faith,and it is quite engrossing. Even as the biographical aspects of the book focus on Collins' own personal path, the way he presents it is overtly apologetic. He constantly goes over how he was convinced of the truth of theism and eventually the Christian truth claim, not simply recounting the fact that he was convinced. The way the apologetic is intertwined with the biographical narrative reminds one of reading C.S. Lewis when he deals with the same subject. Based on the references to and quotes from Lewis, this may not have been intentional but certainly it is without shock that some of Lewis' writing style was adopted by Collins.The apologetic nature of the book is not limited solely to a defense of the Christian faith. The idea of this book is how to rectify a belief in current scientific trends and the Christian faith. In doing so, Collins argues that Darwinian Evolution is true and that it is NOT contrary to the Christian faith. With so much teaching for and evidence of evolution, Collins' devotes a chapter to each of the possible responses to evolution. These chapters are Atheism and Agnosticism (When Science Trumps Faith), Creationism (When Faith Trumps Science), Intelligent Design (When Science Needs Divine Help),and BioLogos (Faith and Science in Harmony). Collins is basically fair in his assessment of the opposing views, but throughout the chapters it is clear that he is building to what he holds as truth by dismantling what he holds as false(or even silly). Collins closes with pleas to believers to not abandon science and scientists to not abandon faith.As I read the book I had to remind myself that Collins is not a theologian, he is a biologist. His interpretation of some Christian doctrines is off what he seems to hold as essential is debated amongst Christians. Some of the history he cites is incorrect and the citations could have been more thorough, especially on some instances where no citation was given. Also, there were times where Collins began speaking exclusively to his peers, losing the reader with limited scientific knowledge in the process.While this book is far from perfect, it is a great read. It would benefit anyone involved in the evolution debate(that would be anyone who has any religious, secular or scientific interest....everyone) to read this book and consider the arguments made and data presented"
139,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58566782-shane-allen,5,"A must read for those who love science and Jesus Christ. Of course the author of science is compatible with the science He created. It’s hard to believe this is still or has ever been an issue. However, it’s definitely worth the read just to hear his perspective on evolution. I’m not quite sold on the science but he is very persuasive. I’ve been reading both sides of the theistic evolution-intelligent design debate for a while now and I’m not convinced humans have fully learned enough yet to die on any hill. One thing is for certain– Francis Collins truly loves Jesus and it grieves me when Christians attack each other over non-essential doctrines not explicit in the Bible. Remember, we are all bothers and sisters in Christ. "

This book details out the driving questioning skepticism of science, details some of the journey of the DNA discoveries, and some of the probable limits of 'designer DNA'. It raises questions, but importantly, it defines what science can and cannot discover and why faith and science are not in conflict. For me, it helped clarify issues surrounding stem cell research, some things regarding evolution, and other hotbed controversial issues without me feeling like I had to 'check my faith in God' at the door in order to engage in the things this scientist was saying.

For information on the Atheist Christian Book Club you can go to the website at http://atheistchristianbookclub.com/ or seek us out on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/AtheistChris... .CHAPTER 1: FROM ATHEISM TO BELIEFCollins says that for him agnosticism was a place of retreat where he wouldn’t actually have to seriously consider the evidence for or against belief. That is obviously not true of those in this book group, but do you think it is generally true for most agnostics? Is agnosticism a position that is held in order to avoid the question of God’s existence altogether?Collins writes that the Moral Law was the primary thing that made him reconsider his atheism. What about those in our book group. Is there a “one thing” that creates cognitive dissonance and makes the atheists in the group pause to reconsider?CHAPTER 2: THE WAR OF THE WORLDVIEWSA similar question for the Christians; is there a question that makes you uncomfortable with your faith? Collins talks about four questions that he struggled with during the early days of his newfound belief. Is there a question like that that makes the Christians in the group sometimes doubt? If not currently, was there a question you struggled with at some time in your life?Collins lists four difficult questions that he struggled with as a new believer; (1) Isn’t the idea of God just wish-fulfillment?, (2) What about all the harm done in the name of religion?, (3) Why would a loving God allow suffering in the world?, and (4) How can a rational person believe in miracles? Were you satisfied with the answers Collins has arrived at and shares here?CHAPTER 3: THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSECollins writes, “Immanuel Kant wrote: ""Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the Moral Law within."" I have heard some former atheist/agnostics similarly indicate that these two things, nature and the moral law, seemed to be ever present in the back of their mind/heart as an indication that there had to be something more than just the material even when they were most intellectually opposed to the idea of God. I’m curious if those two concerns have any influence on the atheists/agnostics in our book group?Collins writes, “Based on these and other observations, physicists are in agreement that the universe began as an infinitely dense, dimensionless point of pure energy. The laws of physics breakdown in this circumstance, referred to as a ""singularity."" Is there the same kind of unanimity among the members of this book group as there seems to be among physicists? Collins seems to think that the question of origins hinges upon the question “What happened before the Big Bang?” Would the book club members agree?Collins' timeline (number of years) differs from some of the Christians in the room. For those who hold to a young earth theory of creation, how important do you think it is to adhere to a “thousands of years” formula instead of a “millions or billions of years” formula?The question of old earth vs. young earth is primarily a discussion held within the camp of Christianity. However, how does it affect those of you who are atheistic/agnostic?Collins writes of the Anthropic Principle, that “The existence of a universe as we know it rests upon a knife edge of improbability.” (page 73) This same fine-tuning argument also had an influence on the author of a previous book we read, Anthony Flew. The author gives three possibilities; (1) an infinite number of universes, (2) we are just very, very lucky, or (3) The precise tuning of all of the physical constants and physical laws to make intelligent life possible is not an accident, but reflects the action of the one who created the universe in the first place. What do you think?Collins quotes a number of famous scientists who believe that “""It would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun in just this way, except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us."" (pages 75ff). Do you think that Stephen Hawking, Freeman Dyson, Arno Penzias and other such scientists (such as Collins, himself) forfeit their scientific bona fides by taking such a position?The author claims that “there is nothing inherently in conflict between the idea of a creator God and what science has revealed.” Do you agree or disagree with him? Why? (page 81) The author further claims that “the opening words of Genesis (""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"") are entirely compatible with the Big Bang.” Do you agree or disagree with him? (pages 82-83)CHAPTER 4: LIFE ON EARTH – OF MICROBES AND MENCollins says that “no serious scientist would currently claim that a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life is at hand” but warns Christians not to result to a God of the gaps apologetic. He encourages them to adopt an approach using “positive reasons, based on knowledge, rather than default assumptions based on (a temporary) lack of knowledge.” However, for those of you who are atheists, does “the inability of modern science to develop a statistically probable mechanism” for the origin of life give you any intellectual pause? (pages 92-93)Collins writes, “No serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life. In fact, the relatedness of all species through the mechanism of evolution is such a profound foundation for the understanding of all biology that it is difficult to imagine how one would study life without it.” Is this true? Are there no serious biologists that doubt the theory of evolution? Is Collins being fair to those who disagree with him on this matter? (page 99)CHAPTER 5: DECIPHERING GOD’S INSTRUCTION BOOK – THE LESSONS OF THE HUMAN GENOMECollins asserts that the difference between macroevolution and microevolution is “increasingly seen to be artificial. But then to illustrate it is a distinction without a difference he uses the example of a stickleback fish with armor becoming a stickleback fish without armor. I think most critics of Darwinism would find this example not to be compelling. A fish becomes a fish. A virus becomes a slightly different virus. How is this evidence for the “tree of life”? Was his example sufficient for you to think that the distinction between macroevolution and microevolution is “arbitrary”? (pages 131-132)In reference to similarities between human and mouse genomes, Collins writes, “This evidence alone does not, of course, prove a common ancestor; from a creationist perspective, such similarities could simply demonstrate that God used successful design principles over and over again. As we shall see, however, and as was foreshadowed above by the discussion of ""silent"" mutations in protein-coding regions, the detailed study of genomes has rendered that interpretation virtually untenable—not only about all other living things, but also about ourselves.” Do you think that the evidence provided by Collins actually supports his claim that it is untenable to believe that God used successful design principles over and over again? (pages 133-137)Does Collins provide compelling evidence from genetic similarities to prove that humans and other life forms have a common ancestor? (pages 137- 142)CHAPTER 6: GENESIS, GALILEO, AND DARWINCollins writes about the emotional distance between Christian believers who are adherents of Darwinism and those who reject this biological theory. What do you think about this? Is it difficult for these to “sides” to coexist in theological harmony? (pages 145-147)CHAPTER 7: OPTION 1 – ATHEISM AND AGNOSTICISM (WHEN SCIENCE TRUMPS FAITH)Collins writes about the hostility between some believers and unbelievers. How common is this? Why do you think this is so? (pages 159ff)The author of our book quotes Dawkins as saying, “""It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus, 'mad cow' disease, and many others, but I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.” Do the atheists in our group believe that faith is evil? (page 163)Collins quotes Stephen Jay Gould as saying that since “Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny” the existence of God. Do you agree with Gould? (page 166)The author refers to four different groups:1. Strong Atheists = have a firm conviction that no deities exist.2. Weak Atheism = the absence of belief in the existence of a God or gods3. Strong Agnostics = believes there is no way that human kind will “ever” know if there is a God4. Weak Atheists = believes only that it is not possible to know “yet” whether or not there is a GodWhat is the composition of atheists/agnostics in our group in regard to these four descriptions?CHAPTER 8: OPTION 2 - CREATIONISM (WHEN FAITH TRUMPS SCIENCE)Does Collins accurately reflect the beliefs of most Young Earth Creationists when he claims that they believe in Microevolution, which he defines as small changes within a species, but do not believe in Macroevolution, which he describes as one species evolving into another species? Many of the young earth creationists that I know are much more flexible with the definition of Microevolution, and define it as changing from one genus, or one order, into another genus or order. (page 172) Does this matter, or is this a distinction without a difference?Is Collins being a bit hysterical when he declares that should YEC scientific claims be true then, “it would lead to a complete and irreversible collapse of the sciences of physics, chemistry, cosmology, geology, and biology.”? (page 174) He makes it sound down right apocalyptic; are YEC that dangerous?CHAPTER 9: OPTION 3 – INTELLIGENT DESIGN (WHEN SCIENCE NEEDS DIVINE HELP)Collins asserts that if the logic of Intelligent Design “truly had merit on scientific grounds, one would expect that the rank and file of working biologists would also show interest in pursuing these ideas, especially since a significant number of biologists are also believers.” (page 187) However, haven’t historians of science like Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) written that just the opposite is true? Does not history tell us that science that none of the revolutionary paradigmatic changes that science has undergone were quickly accepted on the basis of reason/evidence alone? Is head-counting an appropriate way to determine truth?Collins claims that ID is a God of the gaps theory and that science is busily filling in those gaps with things other than God, and thus the theory is collapsing. If so, what then happens with faith? (page 195)CHAPTER 10: BIOLOGOS (SCIENCE AND FAITH IN HARMONY)Within Christianity there is frequently contentious debates among believers about what is the right approach/beliefs regarding creation. How do those of you who are atheists react when you witness such debates?Collins points out that BioLogos is not a scientific theory? (page 204) Does that seem like a copout for a group of scientists to be organizing around a non-scientific theory?CHAPTER 11: TRUTH SEEKERSCollins tells his conversion story in the final chapter. We have on several occasions honestly discussed the question, “What would it take for you to become a person of faith?” and “What would it take for you to become a disbeliever?” Has this book modified your answers to these questions?One of the previous books we discussed was written by the world’s leading intellectual atheist and documented his conversion to theism. This book was written by the person who may be the world’s leading medical geneticist and why he is a Christian. Has the stature of these two authors provoked any intellectual movement from those of you who are atheists?DID ANYONE HAVE A CHANGE OF OPINION (ABOUT ANYTHING) AS A RESULT OF READING THIS BOOK? HAS ANYONE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE YEAR WE HAVE SPENT READING AND DISCUSSING TOGETHER?Supplementary note: Several of the atheistic authors we have read in our book group have indicated that all inerrantists believe in a young earth. This is not true. For a survey of the different viewpoints of inerrantists you can read the following short article: https://www.christianpost.com/news/do..."

There is little ""evidence for belief"" here, and I think most people who have seriously engaged with the god question will have already encountered the main arguments elsewhere.That being said, it was an enjoyable read and I came away with renewed respect for Dr. Collins and his work. Even though his attempt at reconciling the scientific and religious worldviews was ultimately unconvincing for me, he comes across as one of the most intellectually honest and sincere Christian thinkers I've encountered on this topic."

153,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43496878-chris-woody,4,"When I was a student small group leader a few years ago, I had a group of abnormally inquisitive middle schoolers. One day, one of them asked about how we as Christians should look at ""cavemen,"" and, though I don't remember what all was said from there, I know that I mentioned it is okay for Christians to accept evolution. Of course, this didn't sit well with one of my other, well-meaning students, who had never been exposed to such an idea. Even when I said that C.S. Lewis might have accepted the possibility of evolution, his response was ""No, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure he was a Christian."" This all ended with me having to have a chat with the youth pastor to ensure that I wasn't saying anything heretical. All of this is to say that, as a Christian who sees the theory of evolution as compatible with belief, I've found myself in some trouble with my church over these views.This question has been one that I've been mulling over for years: How can Christians accept the evidence that we evolved over millions of years without also saying that we don't take the sanctity of Scripture seriously. I think that Francis Collins, a world-renowned geneticist and devout believer, does a pretty good job of this. He lays out a pretty good argument that science can actually enhance our ability to appreciate God's creation, not jeopardize it. He also does a good job of arguing against both atheism and strict creationism, both of which exist on the far ends of the spectrum when it comes to the ""science-faith"" debate. I think that a lot of believers would do well to read this book and find that it is okay to trust science and still believe in a loving God. Had I read this before, I would have been able to recommend it to my student, as I'm sure Collins can articulate things and explain complex scientific concepts far better than I can."
154,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121586-aaron-barnhart,3,"Our Sunday School class has been reading this clear, concise defense of Christian faith from an evangelical and one of the country's leading geneticists. Collins is controversial with his fellow evangelicals because he argues that evolution is an accepted scientific method, and he is controversial among atheists and skeptics because he asserts that God is both the loving creator of the universe and a being who exists beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. He is, essentially, C.S. Lewis brought into the 21st century — and I say that as someone who is well aware of Lewis's literary reputation. Collins is a highly readable author, and his informal, avuncular prose is arguably more accessible to Christians today than the somewhat outdated and dense argumentation of ""Mere Christianity.""That said, I find The Language of God unsatisfying because it is largely a guide to fellow evangelicals on how to defend their faith against the atheistic meanies of the scientific world like Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. Such people, and we can throw Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens in there while we're at it, are no threat to Christianity because they comprise such a small part of the population. (Harris's argument that Collins should not have been appointed the head of the National Institutes of Health because of his Christian views is a case in point. Collins has no controversial scientific views that I know of, and he is, like most taxpayers, a professed Christian.) Many, if not most, American Christians, however, are neither evangelicals of the Collins stripe nor fundamentalist six-day creationist types (the other group this book takes aim at). Many Christians are members of non-evangelical churches who take their values to their workplace and households without a lot of fanfare or ""God talk."" Another emerging group is Gen-Y evangelicals, who grew up in these churches but disdain their parents' conservative politics and are ready to rethink what it is to be a Christian in the secular society. To me, a major challenge facing Christianity is how to coax these two sets of believers back into the public square, where their moderating influence and quiet moral strength would really come in handy right about now. With his evangelical zeal and quick answers to every problem, Collins strikes me as too much like the nut cases he claims to oppose — people whose minds are made up and aren't interested in real discussion. The Language of God may appear to be at first on the side of such reasonable people, but in the end it offers them surprisingly little help, unless they happen to go to a church much like the one Collins attends."
155,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5292677-al-datum,5,"There are a few claims made by atheists on a regular basis. They include the following:- Only the uneducated become Christians. Truly educated people, especially scientists, would never accept such nonsense- The only reason people are Christians is that they were raised to believe as they doThis book is proof that these two claims are simply nonsense. Francis Collins was an atheist prior to his scientific work on the human genome project. His career has been stellar (he led the Human Genome Project and is currently the director of the National Institutes of Health). He is a leading scientist, and certainly qualifies as a truly educated person. He was also not a Christian his entire life.Collins became a Christian when he began to look at the complexity of the human genome. As he recounts in this book, he was simply unable to remain an atheist since his scientific findings led him to the inescapable conclusion of design and a transcendent designer (this same argument has persuaded many atheists, by the way...check out Antony Flew's conversion. Or Alister McGrath. Or John Polkinghorne. Or Frank Tipler...I could go on).In this book, Collins describes his journey and shows why he came to the conclusion that God exists. He makes the case that was persuasive to him, and also builds the case that evolution and Christianity are not mutually exclusive (in fact, as philosopher William Lane Craig has said, the existence of evolution in such a short span of time [speaking of the length of time our planet has existed] would itself be a miracle, and thus proof of God).Collins does a good job of showing that science and Christianity are not enemies, but partners in the quest for truth (Christianity is, after all, largely responsible for Western Science getting its start). He shows the reasonableness of being both a leading scientist and a believer. And he destroys the two claims I listed at the beginning of this review. Not only is it possible for highly educated scientists to be raised as non-believers only to be converted to Christianity when confronted with the evidence. But Dr. Collins is living proof of this fact.Pick this book up if you'd like to read Dr. Collins' story. It's a very interesting one. And if you're open to following the evidence where it leads, it provides a persuasive case that the evidence leads directly to the existence of an all-powerful creator and designer.One other thing...if you're looking for a good, quick overview of Bayes Theorem, this book has a nice treatment of it that anyone can understand.Simply put...atheism is wrong. The evidence is inescapable."
156,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1225279-clint,3,"3.0 - In this book Collins explains how he harmonizes his belief in God with his understanding of evolution and other scientific processes involved in the creation of our universe. While I don't agree with every conclusion that Collins reaches, his honest and reasonable approach make this a very interesting book. He does a good job of giving a broad-brush description of the major scientific theories involved (big bang and evolution) and evidence for them. His explanations of DNA, how it's used, and how it provides further evidence of evolutionary processes was particularly interesting. I felt his establishment of evolution as truth was a little lacking, as there were a few evolutionary question marks that weren't acknowledged, or weren't addressed as thoroughly as I'd have liked. His arguments in favor of God were based primarily on the philosophical ideas of Moral Law and universal longing for God as presented by C. S. Lewis. While he touched on some physical evidences of a Creator, such as the beautiful mathematical connection with nature and its laws, based on the title I was expecting more. Just as his establishment of evolution was lacking, I found his establishment of God also lacking. He proclaimed Moral Law as his most convincing evidence, yet failed to really establish any sort of spiritual-based evidence. I realize that spiritual evidence is subjective and it deals more on a personal level, but isn't that how it should be? Faith is a personal decision, salvation is a personal issue, our relationship with God is personal, so the spiritual evidence for him should be personal. The bottom line of the book though was that science and faith can and should happily coexist. Truth should be in harmony with truth. Science cannot prove nor disprove the existance and role of a Creator, all it can do is shed light on how the creations behave. "
157,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"Dr. Collins articulates the two sides of the argument (faith v. science) well - and then demonstrates how the argument really shouldn't exist at all as both faith and science are involved in the search for Truth, albeit with different tools and methods. Nothing spectacularly new, in fact he leans heavily on others' words, notably C.S. Lewis, but also many others from Copernicus to Augustine to generally good effect. Hard to judge how convincing he was since I already agreed with most of his premises and assertions.Brief, helpful review of biological reproduction of DNA was clearly explained without either condescending to the reader or assuming the reader remembered every detail from Biology 101.For more book reviews, visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."
158,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312471-karen-l,3,"I liked this book but I did not love it. Why? Well, I have to say that as other critics of this book have noted, he does quote Lewis a little too much. I love C. S. Lewis and agreed with the author on many points yet I would have rather had him quote a little more of a variety of influences.Still, I did find his stories interesting and his ability to make science accessible to the non science layman very helpful. The book contains a lot of good information and most definitely could boost the faith of someone who is a doubter."

160,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,4,I saw this author one afternoon on the Beeb and checked out his book from the library. I have always been disgusted with the fundamentalist belief that it is either science or faith. This book is a wonderful statement for the idea that science is evidence of God in action. I really enjoyed this book. It even re-awakened a sense of faith that the Bush administration had nearly destroyed.

162,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62738513-richard-webb,2,"Devoted to reconciling Judeo-Christians and evolutionists. Misses many opportunities to do so. As a renowned geneticist and leader of the Human Genome Project, reputed to be the greatest achievement of our generation, Collins team completed the first-draft mapping of the 3 billion gene sequences in DNA in 2000, and now heads the National Institutes of Health.As a Christian, Collins proposes that faith in God and faith in science can coexist and be harmonious saying, ‘We have caught the first glimpse of our instruction book, previously known only to God”.Collins boldly challenges his Darwinian colleagues: “So those who choose to be atheists must find some other basis for taking that position, evolution won’t do.” (Pg 167), and “agnosticism also runs the risk of being a cop-out,” (Pg 168). Further, he notes that distinguished agnostics who took time to consider the evidence “unexpectedly converted themselves” (Pg 168). Perhaps he wrote this book to those folks. But instead of reconciling atheistic/agnostic science to God’s Word in the Bible, Collins attempts to push the Bible toward today’s tenuous tenets of science. He first tries to build bridges to atheists by recounting common misconceptions about the Salem Witch Trials, the Crusades, and the underlying beliefs of fundamentally violent Islam; leading him to unjustified self-criticisms of Christianity (Pg 41). However, unexpurgated history shows witch trials ended because two Christian preachers objected to the execution of 20 Salem witches, ending the murder of tens of thousands in Europe. The Crusades were a last-option response to Moslems terrorizing Europe – a resurrected scourge that we must again excise as our Founders did in the 1780’s.Outside His FieldAs a Biblical apologist, Collins writes outside his field of expertise, borrowing credibility from his reputation as an eminent scientist. His discussion of suffering (Pg 43) fails to understand that all good flows from God’s highest value - LOVE Mark 12:30-31, requiring totally free will, and the inseparable freedom to not love. Love cannot be compelled (logically, anything less than totally free-will regarding an all-powerful God could easily be coercion, which God sedulously avoids). Logically then, the failure to choose love begets all evil and suffering. Should God have restrained free-will in order to prevent evil behavior? Logically, He cannot.Additionally, Collins misunderstanding the concept of dominion from Psalm 115:16 and Psalm 8:6, and how Adam ceded to satan the dominion given to Adam in Genesis 1:28, hinders Collins analysis of suffering and evil. Satan now exercises that dominion. Luke 4:6 and 2Cor 4:4 But Jesus gave us, His followers, the power to defeat satan James 4:7, John 4:4, Matt 10:8 if we will “be transformed by the renewing of [our] mind” Rom 12:2 and use that power.Collins also misunderstands (Pg 44-45), that miracles are intended to routinely follow believers: “These signs will follow those who believe” Mark 16:17 and “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out demons.” Matt 10:8 “These things you have seen me do, you will also do, and greater works than these…” John 14:12-14, and “God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders…” Heb 2:4. Perhaps a more Pentecostal understanding of believer’s authority in Eph 1:19-20 and Mark 16:17 would be helpful to him.Big BangCollins assertion that Big Bang is “well described and unlikely to be revised” is hubristic and inconsistent with history. Collins’ Big-Bang endorsement (Pg 68) fails to mention serious doubts raised by observations of counter-rotating galaxies, stars moving toward us, and quantized red-shift. Dissenting scientists question why supposedly “old” supernova exploding stars have projected materials such short distances when an old universe theory would predict extremely long distances. His assumption of a 14 billion universe age (Pg 64) ignores Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy) and radically faster speed of light at creation that promises to someday fit paleontology within the Biblical framework. Collins warns against literal interpretation of the Bible (Pg 83), but science, as an attempt to know the mind of God, would proceed more rapidly if a Biblical view of Origin informed astronomy, physics, biology, etc. Instead, atheists waste billions of taxpayer-funded research dollars constructing fairy-tales to “prove” God does not exist. “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” Rom 1:22 In contrast to Sir Isaac Newton and William Maury who researched scripture to launch their scientific inquiry, Einstein, Hawking, and many others initially presupposed a naturalistic origin and as evidence mounted, got dragged into reluctant recognition of a Creator. Biogenesis Perhaps as a professional courtesy, but with absolutely no evidence, Collins PRESUMES (Pg 89) that dirt assembled ITSELF into DNA digital code, acquired the capability of information storage, and differentiated into multiple “kinds”. We’ve not seen such baseless backward extrapolation since Darwin, in his book of speculative conjecture published without corroborating data, presumed that adaptation explains origin. Science predicated itself on the foundational principle that there is God’s discoverable order in the universe - down to the structure of sub-atomic particles. Order sans intelligence is logically impossible! Yet scientists thrill at each new fairy-tale atheistic deception, and deem anything plausible when multiplied by millions of years. Possibly the Rosetta Stone was formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion (wink).  Collins draws no clear distinction between ADAPTATATION (micro-evolution) and ORIGIN (macro-evolution).Collins says random assembly of molecules may have occurred. He tries to torpedo the entropy argument against biogenesis (the fairy-tale that chemistry begat biology vs. the truth that everything degrades) with an analogy that ignores the essential element of purpose-driven order, plus sustainability, and replication (Pg. 92). Molecules bumping into molecules, like people in a crowd, does not infer or confer a relationship, or transfer properties, or create order. There is no reason for the new combination to persist, incorporate, amalgamate, congregate, consolidate, or replicate.He allows that God could have created the first DNA, but offers no rationale for why God would have stopped with one or a few samples, and thus enjoy the fun of creating diversity. He warns against a “God of the Gaps” (Pg 93) but fails to acknowledge the eventual overturning of nearly every contravening “scientific” presumption, hypothesis, and theory to date. Instead of asking, “How did God do this?” the world supports vain imaginations (hubristic fairy-tales) that eventually fail. Contrast this with the greatest physicist/mathmetician ever, Sir Isaac Newton’s 1704 manuscript describing his quest to extract scientific information from the Bible. Newton’s Laws of Motion and Gravity have withstood the test of time. Perhaps there is a correlation between seeking God and finding truth.Collins warns against betting on a literal Genesis occurrence, then he ventures into paleontology dogma (Pg 93), failing to include recent creationist evidence that disputes long-held scientific beliefs. Neither does he proffer any evidence for the claim that extinct ”kinds” are the missing transitional forms.Self-DevelopmentCollins introduces Darwin’s assertion (which he ultimately adopts) that God may have “created a few original forms capable of self-development” (Pg 98). Biologists mis-use anthropomorphic terms like “strategy” saying that bugs develop a strategy to overcome pesticides. Ridiculous! If self-development is possible, the most intelligent of all God’s creation would have, by now, a bigger penis! Kindly pardon this graphic illustration needed to dramatize my point.Emulating Darwin, Collins takes pains to point out possible harmonious interpretations, but instead of accepting the Bible as true, and reconciling the current nascent state of struggling science with it, Collins incorrectly proclaims that “no serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life” (Pg 99). He should visit Institute for Creation Research or Answers in Genesis or Creation.com to be enlightened by an ever-growing body of scientists whose compelling evidence refutes his assertion. My own feeble survey of the beauty and apparently gratuitous diversity of amazing fish (28,000 species) is sufficient to understand that God intended to give a glimpse of his power, magnificence, and divinity thru our observation of what He made. Romans 1:20.AdaptationCollins cites adaptations in stickleback fish, malaria, HIV, and flu as examples of evolution (Pg 132), but each degraded mutation is just a variant of itself, an adaptation. The flu virus is still a flu virus; it does not morph into an HIV virus or a new disease, or new “kind”. Even purposeful (with intelligence) attempts to modify fruitfly genes over thousands of generations only result in mutant fruitflies, some with wings sticking out of their heads.His refutation of Special Creation’s “Ex Nihilo Species” (Pg 137) is feeble in that he illogically ignores God’s prerogative to re-use successful patterns. Why should God start anew with each “kind” He created? The Bible repeatedly says“after his kind” (e.g. Gen 1:24 Webster’s version is the most grammatically correct) which reinforces that God created multiple kinds of plants and animals. One can only imagine how much fun God must have had with the variations.DNAIt appears that DNA is comprised of error-correcting code like a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). If a piece is lost or corrupted, the piece can be reconstructed by referencing the other pieces. The math and logic needed to accomplish this feat was developed in computers long before it was recognized in DNA. Neither happened without intelligent design!Normally I would avoid criticism tangential to this distinguished scientist’s area of expertise, but Collins makes a special point of calling caspace-12 a “nonfunctional gene” (Pg 139) to argue against Special Creation.Certainly, it is illogical to presume that God would design a gene with 45% flotsam and jetsam (Pg 136). Having been a computer programmer I visualize genes as analogous to a computer memory-dump in which data and instructions mix within the hexadecimal strings. I remember it was frequently easier to spot data (analogous to GAA and GAG recipe for glutamic acid) than to identify instructions within the memory dump. Doesn’t it make sense to pursue an inquiry into what Collins dismissively calls Ancient Repetitive Elements (AREs) as possible instructions governing the GAA and GAG? I could find nowhere that this cellular biology expert presents the fact that DNA requires 75 proteins to exist, but proteins require DNA for construction. Using this undeniable fact, he could have made a much stronger case for God.Young EarthCollins attacks Young Earth creationists (Pg 172-179) saying “Young Earth creationism has reached a point of intellectual bankruptcy, both in its science and in its theology”. He assumes processes like deuterium decay always functioned as now, assumes light had to travel from distant stars (Pg 176) as opposed to beams having been created simultaneous with, or BEFORE (Gen 1:3) the stars (Gen 1:14). He fails to cite these arguments for a young earth fitting a Bible timeline:•	Ocean salinity and sediment deposits at river mouths are consistent with a young earth.•	The number of exploding star (supernova) remnants (SNRs) in all three stages is consistent with a 7000 year-young universe.•	Evidence that God did not create an embryonic universe, but a fully functioning interactive SYSTEM, manifests in plants that require creatures for pollination.•	Due to Barry Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy, the physical manifestation of Planck’s constant) The speed of light and electrons has decreased asymptotically since Creation. Light appears to have 30% faster in Jesus day, 400 times faster in Abraham’s day, and ten million times faster prior to 3,000BC.•	Speed of light may be increasing as it encounters less ZPE at the outer edges of space. Just as light speeds up after it emerges from water, allow me to speculate that the nature of light may be such (otherwise, what is the energy source?) that it goes at a fixed speed except while ZPE, water, atmosphere, and space dust etc. hinders.•	Electrons bouncing erratically off ZPE as they negotiate the ZPE hurdles on their orbital track, probably explains the “Uncertainty Principle” of quantum physics. Electrons are moving slower too. Calculations of age based on atomic decay need extreme revision.•	We are simply peering thru a longer taillight beam as the once-close stars travel away. The light appears redder because the lower-energy photons were redder, not a Doppler effect as suggested by Hubbel’s red-shift. We cannot observe light from outside the beam because it always heads directly toward us. The speed is relative to our own speed.When people study the Bible’s supernatural truths, fulfilled prophesies, structure, its heptadic code (7’s), and gematria (Jewish numbering) sufficiently to know that the Bible is, beyond doubt, directly from God, then their worldview is firmly rooted in truth. God’s account of how He created the universe, and us, is not an allegory as Collins maintains. Successful (real, true) science, like Bible study, is an attempt to know the mind of God.Science hinders itself with materialistic terms of engagement that stifle investigation. Our physics is likely only a shadow of a larger reality hinted at by mathematical postulations of additional dimensions we cannot yet comprehend. We should think of our material universe as a subset of a larger (supernatural) reality. Science thwarts progress by clinging to foolish atheistic traditions designed to deny the existence of God. Beware of OrthodoxyEducator John Taylor Gatto (author of Dumbing Us Down) told me schooling trains people to act like fish (swim in unison). Joe Bobier, inventor of Single-Cycle Modulation said “If I had been an electrical engineer, they would have convinced me this is not possible.” The reason breakthrough ideas are coming from sophomore high schoolers (Jack Andraka’s cancer detector, Simon Tsaoussis, two-transistor ternary RAM) is that they are not overly encumbered by orthodoxy. Revolutionary, disruptive, correct ideas encounter establishment ridicule as Dr. Robert O. Becker describes in his journey The Body Electric. Collins incorrectly struggles to conform to atheist/agnostic orthodoxy instead of standing firmly on God’s Word. I strongly urge him to revise this book."
163,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,4,"Francis Collins is a renowned scientist -- the former director of the Human Genome Project -- and also a Christian. In a time when science and faith can seem so diametrically opposed, it was encouraging to read one person's view of how he balances the two perspectives, and sees them as complementary rather than hostile to each other. I don't know how well this book will speak to all the different perspectives it could potentially be speaking to. I don't know whether an atheist or agnostic reader will be convinced or touched by the arguments and ideas presented here, since I am neither of those. It does cover quite a few topics -- from Collins' path to faith from his initial atheism; to a discussion of both scientific and faith-based approaches to worldviews, covering atheism, agnosticism, intelligent design, young-earth creationism, as well as theistic evolution, which he terms ""BioLogos""; as well as an overview of human DNA and what the Human Genome Project was aiming to accomplish; and an appendix devoted to bioethics, there was a lot to take in here (though I found it a relatively quick read).I think I was able to get the scientific gist of most of what he was writing about, since this was written for a layperson, but obviously there's a lot beneath the surface. I found the bits about the human genome most interesting. Faith-wise, numerous C.S. Lewis quotes will always draw me in, though I'm sure I'm not from the same ""bent"" of Christianity as Collins (though the same could be said for Lewis). But I valued the discussions of the various intersections of faith and science in regards to worldview (with an emphasis on origins).I don't agree with all of Collins' views here (though I can appreciate that we can still hold the same faith despite differences), and in many cases I don't even understand enough yet to know whether I agree or disagree. But I'm still grateful for his perspective, because it has helped me to clarify my thinking on some things, which includes some errors and inconsistencies in perspectives that I have held or entertained. I also appreciate him incorporating other thinkers (both scientists and theologians) into his arguments, because many quotes he uses are also interesting and make me want to learn more.I especially appreciate his call to not view God's Word and his creation as being ""at war with itself,"" as expressed in this quote that I think sums up his views nicely:“Will we turn our backs on science because it is perceived as a threat to God, abandoning all the promise of advancing our understanding of nature and applying that to the alleviation of suffering and the betterment of humankind? Alternatively, will we turn our backs on faith, concluding that science has rendered the spiritual life no longer necessary, and that traditional religious symbols can now be replaced by engravings of the double helix on our altars?Both of these choices are profoundly dangerous. Both deny truth. Both will diminish the nobility of humankind. Both will be devastating to our future. And both are unnecessary. The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. He can be worshipped in the cathedral or in the laboratory. His creation is majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful - and it cannot be at war with itself. Only we imperfect humans can start such battles. And only we can end them.”"

His first objective was to sieve Darwinian Evolution from atheism, on which he sold me. His second was to defend Theistic Evolution, in which he thoroughly failed. On the first matter, he created the best starting apologetic for scientific atheists that I've read. Collins was once an atheist. He took apart Dawkins. He glossed over true differences between DE and theology for the sake of (a false) harmony, but believably estranged DE and materialism. He seems to be a real Christian, however it is of course always hard to reliably tell. He professed belief and a relationship, which sounded genuine, but he kept referring to the value of other faith traditions, never called Jesus the only Way, and otherwise generally retreated to what sounded vaguely like a ""it works for me"" stance.On defending TE, he hung his cap on Darwinian Evolution. He erected a caricature of Young Earth Creationism and proceeded to beat the straw out of it. He didn't just oppose YEC and Intelligent Design, he called them untenable and impossible. His evidences were quite dated for 2006. Such faulty data that he determined to irrefutably support DE included: the DNA similarity between humans, chimps and mice; the immutability of isotopic dating and isotope half-lives (despite no evidence of universe conditions past 100 years ago or so); Occam's Razor; and the proposed reducible complexity of blood clots, flagella and the human eye (the former two of which were plausible, but not irrefutable). He got right the fact that scientific truth and spiritual truth cannot contradict, but he promoted the DE argument as overwhelming instead of its true, overwhelming ambiguity. He resembled Ptolemy, accepting the noticeable errors in satellite epicycles rather than telling the world that the earth revolves around the Sun, all for the sake of a contrived peace. His views have been thoroughly and convincingly refuted by the publications of Answers in Genesis, and plausibly so by Gerald Schroeder's creation-physics model (which reconciles YEC and OEC) in his book, The Science of God."

Still though, I thought Collins’s argument for theistic evolution was compelling. As a scientist and a person of faith, I’ve never seen incompatibility between the two domains, but haven’t been able to clearly articulate my beliefs as theistic evolution. I am deeply compelled by the Moral Law argument and this book helped to strengthen my beliefs. I found myself coming back to this book and Collins’s arguments frequently over the course of the semester in my Philosophy of Religion class. We didn’t talk about theistic evolution directly, but The Language of God supplemented a lot of my coursework well. I was less compelled by Collins’s arguments for Christianity in particular toward the end of the book, but I appreciate his insistence that faith is a personal journey we must all come to for ourselves. Overall, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to understand more about science, faith, and the relationship between the two. "

I read Darwin's Black Box and felt compelled by Behe's explanations. I was similarly compelled by Collins's dismantling of Behe, though. What all of this comes down to is that I am a layman having to trust whoever writes these books to tell me what they wish, leave out & skip over what they wish, and interpret everything for me. The only solution is to go back to school for my own PhD in biology, I guess. Honestly, though, I would skip reading this book. If you want the good faith parts just read Mere Christianity or better yet C. S. Lewis's entire bibliography. If you want the good science parts, just read any mainstream college molecular biology textbook, or whatever the latest Richard Dawkins book is."
167,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57363039-emily-monroe,5,"For someone familiar with both Christianity and science, this is a great summary type of read that seeks to reconcile what many sources today tout as unreconcilable. Collins provides brief backgrounds on both apologetics (belief) and genetics (science). If a reader is not familiar with either of those topics, this book is not a good introduction. As a believer with a science and engineering background, I enjoyed learning his perspective. Collins is frank in stating that young earth creationism is a dangerous concept, and he gave language and examples to support it. He is also frank in saying that science does not and cannot explain everything about our existence and the meaning of life. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and took a lot away from it that I will use in conversations with both believers and non-believers."
168,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23188545-josh,4,"More and more,if you are willing to open your eyes, you will be confronted with those who have differing views and beliefs than your own. The temptation is great to simply dismiss any idea or worldview that seems contrary to the one you already hold. My brother characterizes, and to a degree caricatures, the typical Christian response to contrary ideas as that of a petulant child putting his fingers in his ears and repeating, “I CAN'T HEAR YOU” to drown out the sound of anything that might question what is held so dearly.As a Christian,who deals with many Christians, it is hard to not acquiesce to his diagnosis. So often, those who should be genuinely searching out truth wherever it lies (seeing as how all truth is God's truth) will allow ourselves to remain ignorant out of fear that our beliefs will come crashing down and our God with them. If this fear is not present,then the possibility of ever having to admit some degree of error in our interpretation of the Bible or of the world or of our self is more than our pride can stand.Labels abound. If you believe in health care for all or government based social services then you are a “communist”. If you believe that some of the Bible is not to be taken literally, you're a “liberal” who does not believe the Bible. If you preach grace you are “antinomian” and if you preach responsibility and fidelity, you are a “legalist”. The word “heretic” gets thrown around on anyone not conforming to “the Bible” which would be more accurately and honesty communicated as “my interpretation of the Bible”.All these labels do in most cases is perpetuate ignorance and division, making it more convenient and efficient for us as we sit in God's seat of judgment on any who might not submit themselves to what we “know” as truth. Enter Francis Collins. Talk about a guy getting it from all angles. Collins was the head of the Human Genome Project, the scientific research to map out the human genome. The work done under his leadership has led to us have a genetic map of human beings. The benefit of this in the war against disease and defect is incapable of being overstated. The work God has done through this man and his leadership is amazing.And therein lies the reason he receives such criticism. Collins, a biologist, stood in the Oval Office with then President Clinton and nodded approvingly when President Clinton remarked that we could now see the “language of God” used in creation. How a professional biologist could hold to an “inherently unscientific” belief in God and approve of such theistic speak offended many in the biological community. That a committed Christian could believed in the “inherently atheistic” doctrine of evolution, offended many in the Christian community.That is the backdrop for the book, The Language of God by Francis Collins. Collins work is one part biography, one part scientific treatise and one part apologetic. Collins spends time going over his life, and his own path from atheism, to agnosticism, and finally to his firm belief in the theism of Biblical Christianity. The biographical aspects of the book are all centered on how he has related his lifelong love of science with his lifelong struggle with faith,and it is quite engrossing. Even as the biographical aspects of the book focus on Collins' own personal path, the way he presents it is overtly apologetic. He constantly goes over how he was convinced of the truth of theism and eventually the Christian truth claim, not simply recounting the fact that he was convinced. The way the apologetic is intertwined with the biographical narrative reminds one of reading C.S. Lewis when he deals with the same subject. Based on the references to and quotes from Lewis, this may not have been intentional but certainly it is without shock that some of Lewis' writing style was adopted by Collins.The apologetic nature of the book is not limited solely to a defense of the Christian faith. The idea of this book is how to rectify a belief in current scientific trends and the Christian faith. In doing so, Collins argues that Darwinian Evolution is true and that it is NOT contrary to the Christian faith. With so much teaching for and evidence of evolution, Collins' devotes a chapter to each of the possible responses to evolution. These chapters are Atheism and Agnosticism (When Science Trumps Faith), Creationism (When Faith Trumps Science), Intelligent Design (When Science Needs Divine Help),and BioLogos (Faith and Science in Harmony). Collins is basically fair in his assessment of the opposing views, but throughout the chapters it is clear that he is building to what he holds as truth by dismantling what he holds as false(or even silly). Collins closes with pleas to believers to not abandon science and scientists to not abandon faith.As I read the book I had to remind myself that Collins is not a theologian, he is a biologist. His interpretation of some Christian doctrines is off what he seems to hold as essential is debated amongst Christians. Some of the history he cites is incorrect and the citations could have been more thorough, especially on some instances where no citation was given. Also, there were times where Collins began speaking exclusively to his peers, losing the reader with limited scientific knowledge in the process.While this book is far from perfect, it is a great read. It would benefit anyone involved in the evolution debate(that would be anyone who has any religious, secular or scientific interest....everyone) to read this book and consider the arguments made and data presented"
169,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58566782-shane-allen,5,"A must read for those who love science and Jesus Christ. Of course the author of science is compatible with the science He created. It’s hard to believe this is still or has ever been an issue. However, it’s definitely worth the read just to hear his perspective on evolution. I’m not quite sold on the science but he is very persuasive. I’ve been reading both sides of the theistic evolution-intelligent design debate for a while now and I’m not convinced humans have fully learned enough yet to die on any hill. One thing is for certain– Francis Collins truly loves Jesus and it grieves me when Christians attack each other over non-essential doctrines not explicit in the Bible. Remember, we are all bothers and sisters in Christ. "

This book details out the driving questioning skepticism of science, details some of the journey of the DNA discoveries, and some of the probable limits of 'designer DNA'. It raises questions, but importantly, it defines what science can and cannot discover and why faith and science are not in conflict. For me, it helped clarify issues surrounding stem cell research, some things regarding evolution, and other hotbed controversial issues without me feeling like I had to 'check my faith in God' at the door in order to engage in the things this scientist was saying.

180,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32254765-kevin-stilley,3,"The following are discussion questions for ""The Language of God"" that I created for the monthly meeting of of the Atheist Christian Book Club. For information on the Atheist Christian Book Club you can go to the website at http://atheistchristianbookclub.com/ or seek us out on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/AtheistChris... .CHAPTER 1: FROM ATHEISM TO BELIEFCollins says that for him agnosticism was a place of retreat where he wouldn’t actually have to seriously consider the evidence for or against belief. That is obviously not true of those in this book group, but do you think it is generally true for most agnostics? Is agnosticism a position that is held in order to avoid the question of God’s existence altogether?Collins writes that the Moral Law was the primary thing that made him reconsider his atheism. What about those in our book group. Is there a “one thing” that creates cognitive dissonance and makes the atheists in the group pause to reconsider?CHAPTER 2: THE WAR OF THE WORLDVIEWSA similar question for the Christians; is there a question that makes you uncomfortable with your faith? Collins talks about four questions that he struggled with during the early days of his newfound belief. Is there a question like that that makes the Christians in the group sometimes doubt? If not currently, was there a question you struggled with at some time in your life?Collins lists four difficult questions that he struggled with as a new believer; (1) Isn’t the idea of God just wish-fulfillment?, (2) What about all the harm done in the name of religion?, (3) Why would a loving God allow suffering in the world?, and (4) How can a rational person believe in miracles? Were you satisfied with the answers Collins has arrived at and shares here?CHAPTER 3: THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSECollins writes, “Immanuel Kant wrote: ""Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the Moral Law within."" I have heard some former atheist/agnostics similarly indicate that these two things, nature and the moral law, seemed to be ever present in the back of their mind/heart as an indication that there had to be something more than just the material even when they were most intellectually opposed to the idea of God. I’m curious if those two concerns have any influence on the atheists/agnostics in our book group?Collins writes, “Based on these and other observations, physicists are in agreement that the universe began as an infinitely dense, dimensionless point of pure energy. The laws of physics breakdown in this circumstance, referred to as a ""singularity."" Is there the same kind of unanimity among the members of this book group as there seems to be among physicists? Collins seems to think that the question of origins hinges upon the question “What happened before the Big Bang?” Would the book club members agree?Collins' timeline (number of years) differs from some of the Christians in the room. For those who hold to a young earth theory of creation, how important do you think it is to adhere to a “thousands of years” formula instead of a “millions or billions of years” formula?The question of old earth vs. young earth is primarily a discussion held within the camp of Christianity. However, how does it affect those of you who are atheistic/agnostic?Collins writes of the Anthropic Principle, that “The existence of a universe as we know it rests upon a knife edge of improbability.” (page 73) This same fine-tuning argument also had an influence on the author of a previous book we read, Anthony Flew. The author gives three possibilities; (1) an infinite number of universes, (2) we are just very, very lucky, or (3) The precise tuning of all of the physical constants and physical laws to make intelligent life possible is not an accident, but reflects the action of the one who created the universe in the first place. What do you think?Collins quotes a number of famous scientists who believe that “""It would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun in just this way, except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us."" (pages 75ff). Do you think that Stephen Hawking, Freeman Dyson, Arno Penzias and other such scientists (such as Collins, himself) forfeit their scientific bona fides by taking such a position?The author claims that “there is nothing inherently in conflict between the idea of a creator God and what science has revealed.” Do you agree or disagree with him? Why? (page 81) The author further claims that “the opening words of Genesis (""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"") are entirely compatible with the Big Bang.” Do you agree or disagree with him? (pages 82-83)CHAPTER 4: LIFE ON EARTH – OF MICROBES AND MENCollins says that “no serious scientist would currently claim that a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life is at hand” but warns Christians not to result to a God of the gaps apologetic. He encourages them to adopt an approach using “positive reasons, based on knowledge, rather than default assumptions based on (a temporary) lack of knowledge.” However, for those of you who are atheists, does “the inability of modern science to develop a statistically probable mechanism” for the origin of life give you any intellectual pause? (pages 92-93)Collins writes, “No serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life. In fact, the relatedness of all species through the mechanism of evolution is such a profound foundation for the understanding of all biology that it is difficult to imagine how one would study life without it.” Is this true? Are there no serious biologists that doubt the theory of evolution? Is Collins being fair to those who disagree with him on this matter? (page 99)CHAPTER 5: DECIPHERING GOD’S INSTRUCTION BOOK – THE LESSONS OF THE HUMAN GENOMECollins asserts that the difference between macroevolution and microevolution is “increasingly seen to be artificial. But then to illustrate it is a distinction without a difference he uses the example of a stickleback fish with armor becoming a stickleback fish without armor. I think most critics of Darwinism would find this example not to be compelling. A fish becomes a fish. A virus becomes a slightly different virus. How is this evidence for the “tree of life”? Was his example sufficient for you to think that the distinction between macroevolution and microevolution is “arbitrary”? (pages 131-132)In reference to similarities between human and mouse genomes, Collins writes, “This evidence alone does not, of course, prove a common ancestor; from a creationist perspective, such similarities could simply demonstrate that God used successful design principles over and over again. As we shall see, however, and as was foreshadowed above by the discussion of ""silent"" mutations in protein-coding regions, the detailed study of genomes has rendered that interpretation virtually untenable—not only about all other living things, but also about ourselves.” Do you think that the evidence provided by Collins actually supports his claim that it is untenable to believe that God used successful design principles over and over again? (pages 133-137)Does Collins provide compelling evidence from genetic similarities to prove that humans and other life forms have a common ancestor? (pages 137- 142)CHAPTER 6: GENESIS, GALILEO, AND DARWINCollins writes about the emotional distance between Christian believers who are adherents of Darwinism and those who reject this biological theory. What do you think about this? Is it difficult for these to “sides” to coexist in theological harmony? (pages 145-147)CHAPTER 7: OPTION 1 – ATHEISM AND AGNOSTICISM (WHEN SCIENCE TRUMPS FAITH)Collins writes about the hostility between some believers and unbelievers. How common is this? Why do you think this is so? (pages 159ff)The author of our book quotes Dawkins as saying, “""It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus, 'mad cow' disease, and many others, but I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.” Do the atheists in our group believe that faith is evil? (page 163)Collins quotes Stephen Jay Gould as saying that since “Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny” the existence of God. Do you agree with Gould? (page 166)The author refers to four different groups:1. Strong Atheists = have a firm conviction that no deities exist.2. Weak Atheism = the absence of belief in the existence of a God or gods3. Strong Agnostics = believes there is no way that human kind will “ever” know if there is a God4. Weak Atheists = believes only that it is not possible to know “yet” whether or not there is a GodWhat is the composition of atheists/agnostics in our group in regard to these four descriptions?CHAPTER 8: OPTION 2 - CREATIONISM (WHEN FAITH TRUMPS SCIENCE)Does Collins accurately reflect the beliefs of most Young Earth Creationists when he claims that they believe in Microevolution, which he defines as small changes within a species, but do not believe in Macroevolution, which he describes as one species evolving into another species? Many of the young earth creationists that I know are much more flexible with the definition of Microevolution, and define it as changing from one genus, or one order, into another genus or order. (page 172) Does this matter, or is this a distinction without a difference?Is Collins being a bit hysterical when he declares that should YEC scientific claims be true then, “it would lead to a complete and irreversible collapse of the sciences of physics, chemistry, cosmology, geology, and biology.”? (page 174) He makes it sound down right apocalyptic; are YEC that dangerous?CHAPTER 9: OPTION 3 – INTELLIGENT DESIGN (WHEN SCIENCE NEEDS DIVINE HELP)Collins asserts that if the logic of Intelligent Design “truly had merit on scientific grounds, one would expect that the rank and file of working biologists would also show interest in pursuing these ideas, especially since a significant number of biologists are also believers.” (page 187) However, haven’t historians of science like Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) written that just the opposite is true? Does not history tell us that science that none of the revolutionary paradigmatic changes that science has undergone were quickly accepted on the basis of reason/evidence alone? Is head-counting an appropriate way to determine truth?Collins claims that ID is a God of the gaps theory and that science is busily filling in those gaps with things other than God, and thus the theory is collapsing. If so, what then happens with faith? (page 195)CHAPTER 10: BIOLOGOS (SCIENCE AND FAITH IN HARMONY)Within Christianity there is frequently contentious debates among believers about what is the right approach/beliefs regarding creation. How do those of you who are atheists react when you witness such debates?Collins points out that BioLogos is not a scientific theory? (page 204) Does that seem like a copout for a group of scientists to be organizing around a non-scientific theory?CHAPTER 11: TRUTH SEEKERSCollins tells his conversion story in the final chapter. We have on several occasions honestly discussed the question, “What would it take for you to become a person of faith?” and “What would it take for you to become a disbeliever?” Has this book modified your answers to these questions?One of the previous books we discussed was written by the world’s leading intellectual atheist and documented his conversion to theism. This book was written by the person who may be the world’s leading medical geneticist and why he is a Christian. Has the stature of these two authors provoked any intellectual movement from those of you who are atheists?DID ANYONE HAVE A CHANGE OF OPINION (ABOUT ANYTHING) AS A RESULT OF READING THIS BOOK? HAS ANYONE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE YEAR WE HAVE SPENT READING AND DISCUSSING TOGETHER?Supplementary note: Several of the atheistic authors we have read in our book group have indicated that all inerrantists believe in a young earth. This is not true. For a survey of the different viewpoints of inerrantists you can read the following short article: https://www.christianpost.com/news/do..."

There is little ""evidence for belief"" here, and I think most people who have seriously engaged with the god question will have already encountered the main arguments elsewhere.That being said, it was an enjoyable read and I came away with renewed respect for Dr. Collins and his work. Even though his attempt at reconciling the scientific and religious worldviews was ultimately unconvincing for me, he comes across as one of the most intellectually honest and sincere Christian thinkers I've encountered on this topic."

183,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43496878-chris-woody,4,"When I was a student small group leader a few years ago, I had a group of abnormally inquisitive middle schoolers. One day, one of them asked about how we as Christians should look at ""cavemen,"" and, though I don't remember what all was said from there, I know that I mentioned it is okay for Christians to accept evolution. Of course, this didn't sit well with one of my other, well-meaning students, who had never been exposed to such an idea. Even when I said that C.S. Lewis might have accepted the possibility of evolution, his response was ""No, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure he was a Christian."" This all ended with me having to have a chat with the youth pastor to ensure that I wasn't saying anything heretical. All of this is to say that, as a Christian who sees the theory of evolution as compatible with belief, I've found myself in some trouble with my church over these views.This question has been one that I've been mulling over for years: How can Christians accept the evidence that we evolved over millions of years without also saying that we don't take the sanctity of Scripture seriously. I think that Francis Collins, a world-renowned geneticist and devout believer, does a pretty good job of this. He lays out a pretty good argument that science can actually enhance our ability to appreciate God's creation, not jeopardize it. He also does a good job of arguing against both atheism and strict creationism, both of which exist on the far ends of the spectrum when it comes to the ""science-faith"" debate. I think that a lot of believers would do well to read this book and find that it is okay to trust science and still believe in a loving God. Had I read this before, I would have been able to recommend it to my student, as I'm sure Collins can articulate things and explain complex scientific concepts far better than I can."
184,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121586-aaron-barnhart,3,"Our Sunday School class has been reading this clear, concise defense of Christian faith from an evangelical and one of the country's leading geneticists. Collins is controversial with his fellow evangelicals because he argues that evolution is an accepted scientific method, and he is controversial among atheists and skeptics because he asserts that God is both the loving creator of the universe and a being who exists beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. He is, essentially, C.S. Lewis brought into the 21st century — and I say that as someone who is well aware of Lewis's literary reputation. Collins is a highly readable author, and his informal, avuncular prose is arguably more accessible to Christians today than the somewhat outdated and dense argumentation of ""Mere Christianity.""That said, I find The Language of God unsatisfying because it is largely a guide to fellow evangelicals on how to defend their faith against the atheistic meanies of the scientific world like Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. Such people, and we can throw Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens in there while we're at it, are no threat to Christianity because they comprise such a small part of the population. (Harris's argument that Collins should not have been appointed the head of the National Institutes of Health because of his Christian views is a case in point. Collins has no controversial scientific views that I know of, and he is, like most taxpayers, a professed Christian.) Many, if not most, American Christians, however, are neither evangelicals of the Collins stripe nor fundamentalist six-day creationist types (the other group this book takes aim at). Many Christians are members of non-evangelical churches who take their values to their workplace and households without a lot of fanfare or ""God talk."" Another emerging group is Gen-Y evangelicals, who grew up in these churches but disdain their parents' conservative politics and are ready to rethink what it is to be a Christian in the secular society. To me, a major challenge facing Christianity is how to coax these two sets of believers back into the public square, where their moderating influence and quiet moral strength would really come in handy right about now. With his evangelical zeal and quick answers to every problem, Collins strikes me as too much like the nut cases he claims to oppose — people whose minds are made up and aren't interested in real discussion. The Language of God may appear to be at first on the side of such reasonable people, but in the end it offers them surprisingly little help, unless they happen to go to a church much like the one Collins attends."
185,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5292677-al-datum,5,"There are a few claims made by atheists on a regular basis. They include the following:- Only the uneducated become Christians. Truly educated people, especially scientists, would never accept such nonsense- The only reason people are Christians is that they were raised to believe as they doThis book is proof that these two claims are simply nonsense. Francis Collins was an atheist prior to his scientific work on the human genome project. His career has been stellar (he led the Human Genome Project and is currently the director of the National Institutes of Health). He is a leading scientist, and certainly qualifies as a truly educated person. He was also not a Christian his entire life.Collins became a Christian when he began to look at the complexity of the human genome. As he recounts in this book, he was simply unable to remain an atheist since his scientific findings led him to the inescapable conclusion of design and a transcendent designer (this same argument has persuaded many atheists, by the way...check out Antony Flew's conversion. Or Alister McGrath. Or John Polkinghorne. Or Frank Tipler...I could go on).In this book, Collins describes his journey and shows why he came to the conclusion that God exists. He makes the case that was persuasive to him, and also builds the case that evolution and Christianity are not mutually exclusive (in fact, as philosopher William Lane Craig has said, the existence of evolution in such a short span of time [speaking of the length of time our planet has existed] would itself be a miracle, and thus proof of God).Collins does a good job of showing that science and Christianity are not enemies, but partners in the quest for truth (Christianity is, after all, largely responsible for Western Science getting its start). He shows the reasonableness of being both a leading scientist and a believer. And he destroys the two claims I listed at the beginning of this review. Not only is it possible for highly educated scientists to be raised as non-believers only to be converted to Christianity when confronted with the evidence. But Dr. Collins is living proof of this fact.Pick this book up if you'd like to read Dr. Collins' story. It's a very interesting one. And if you're open to following the evidence where it leads, it provides a persuasive case that the evidence leads directly to the existence of an all-powerful creator and designer.One other thing...if you're looking for a good, quick overview of Bayes Theorem, this book has a nice treatment of it that anyone can understand.Simply put...atheism is wrong. The evidence is inescapable."
186,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1225279-clint,3,"3.0 - In this book Collins explains how he harmonizes his belief in God with his understanding of evolution and other scientific processes involved in the creation of our universe. While I don't agree with every conclusion that Collins reaches, his honest and reasonable approach make this a very interesting book. He does a good job of giving a broad-brush description of the major scientific theories involved (big bang and evolution) and evidence for them. His explanations of DNA, how it's used, and how it provides further evidence of evolutionary processes was particularly interesting. I felt his establishment of evolution as truth was a little lacking, as there were a few evolutionary question marks that weren't acknowledged, or weren't addressed as thoroughly as I'd have liked. His arguments in favor of God were based primarily on the philosophical ideas of Moral Law and universal longing for God as presented by C. S. Lewis. While he touched on some physical evidences of a Creator, such as the beautiful mathematical connection with nature and its laws, based on the title I was expecting more. Just as his establishment of evolution was lacking, I found his establishment of God also lacking. He proclaimed Moral Law as his most convincing evidence, yet failed to really establish any sort of spiritual-based evidence. I realize that spiritual evidence is subjective and it deals more on a personal level, but isn't that how it should be? Faith is a personal decision, salvation is a personal issue, our relationship with God is personal, so the spiritual evidence for him should be personal. The bottom line of the book though was that science and faith can and should happily coexist. Truth should be in harmony with truth. Science cannot prove nor disprove the existance and role of a Creator, all it can do is shed light on how the creations behave. "
187,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"Dr. Collins articulates the two sides of the argument (faith v. science) well - and then demonstrates how the argument really shouldn't exist at all as both faith and science are involved in the search for Truth, albeit with different tools and methods. Nothing spectacularly new, in fact he leans heavily on others' words, notably C.S. Lewis, but also many others from Copernicus to Augustine to generally good effect. Hard to judge how convincing he was since I already agreed with most of his premises and assertions.Brief, helpful review of biological reproduction of DNA was clearly explained without either condescending to the reader or assuming the reader remembered every detail from Biology 101.For more book reviews, visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."

Well, I have to say that as other critics of this book have noted, he does quote Lewis a little too much. I love C. S. Lewis and agreed with the author on many points yet I would have rather had him quote a little more of a variety of influences.Still, I did find his stories interesting and his ability to make science accessible to the non science layman very helpful. The book contains a lot of good information and most definitely could boost the faith of someone who is a doubter."

I expected a philosophical treatise but received a shallow description of one man's career and how he came to assume a life of faith. While there might be a place for this sort of literature, it was not what I was looking for. I clearly was not a member of the target audience."
190,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,4,I saw this author one afternoon on the Beeb and checked out his book from the library. I have always been disgusted with the fundamentalist belief that it is either science or faith. This book is a wonderful statement for the idea that science is evidence of God in action. I really enjoyed this book. It even re-awakened a sense of faith that the Bush administration had nearly destroyed.
191,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29591849-elinor,3,"This was pretty great. Relied heavily on CS Lewis for the apologetics, but gave a lot of interesting insight on the biology/science side of things."
192,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62738513-richard-webb,2,"Devoted to reconciling Judeo-Christians and evolutionists. Misses many opportunities to do so. As a renowned geneticist and leader of the Human Genome Project, reputed to be the greatest achievement of our generation, Collins team completed the first-draft mapping of the 3 billion gene sequences in DNA in 2000, and now heads the National Institutes of Health.As a Christian, Collins proposes that faith in God and faith in science can coexist and be harmonious saying, ‘We have caught the first glimpse of our instruction book, previously known only to God”.Collins boldly challenges his Darwinian colleagues: “So those who choose to be atheists must find some other basis for taking that position, evolution won’t do.” (Pg 167), and “agnosticism also runs the risk of being a cop-out,” (Pg 168). Further, he notes that distinguished agnostics who took time to consider the evidence “unexpectedly converted themselves” (Pg 168). Perhaps he wrote this book to those folks. But instead of reconciling atheistic/agnostic science to God’s Word in the Bible, Collins attempts to push the Bible toward today’s tenuous tenets of science. He first tries to build bridges to atheists by recounting common misconceptions about the Salem Witch Trials, the Crusades, and the underlying beliefs of fundamentally violent Islam; leading him to unjustified self-criticisms of Christianity (Pg 41). However, unexpurgated history shows witch trials ended because two Christian preachers objected to the execution of 20 Salem witches, ending the murder of tens of thousands in Europe. The Crusades were a last-option response to Moslems terrorizing Europe – a resurrected scourge that we must again excise as our Founders did in the 1780’s.Outside His FieldAs a Biblical apologist, Collins writes outside his field of expertise, borrowing credibility from his reputation as an eminent scientist. His discussion of suffering (Pg 43) fails to understand that all good flows from God’s highest value - LOVE Mark 12:30-31, requiring totally free will, and the inseparable freedom to not love. Love cannot be compelled (logically, anything less than totally free-will regarding an all-powerful God could easily be coercion, which God sedulously avoids). Logically then, the failure to choose love begets all evil and suffering. Should God have restrained free-will in order to prevent evil behavior? Logically, He cannot.Additionally, Collins misunderstanding the concept of dominion from Psalm 115:16 and Psalm 8:6, and how Adam ceded to satan the dominion given to Adam in Genesis 1:28, hinders Collins analysis of suffering and evil. Satan now exercises that dominion. Luke 4:6 and 2Cor 4:4 But Jesus gave us, His followers, the power to defeat satan James 4:7, John 4:4, Matt 10:8 if we will “be transformed by the renewing of [our] mind” Rom 12:2 and use that power.Collins also misunderstands (Pg 44-45), that miracles are intended to routinely follow believers: “These signs will follow those who believe” Mark 16:17 and “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out demons.” Matt 10:8 “These things you have seen me do, you will also do, and greater works than these…” John 14:12-14, and “God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders…” Heb 2:4. Perhaps a more Pentecostal understanding of believer’s authority in Eph 1:19-20 and Mark 16:17 would be helpful to him.Big BangCollins assertion that Big Bang is “well described and unlikely to be revised” is hubristic and inconsistent with history. Collins’ Big-Bang endorsement (Pg 68) fails to mention serious doubts raised by observations of counter-rotating galaxies, stars moving toward us, and quantized red-shift. Dissenting scientists question why supposedly “old” supernova exploding stars have projected materials such short distances when an old universe theory would predict extremely long distances. His assumption of a 14 billion universe age (Pg 64) ignores Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy) and radically faster speed of light at creation that promises to someday fit paleontology within the Biblical framework. Collins warns against literal interpretation of the Bible (Pg 83), but science, as an attempt to know the mind of God, would proceed more rapidly if a Biblical view of Origin informed astronomy, physics, biology, etc. Instead, atheists waste billions of taxpayer-funded research dollars constructing fairy-tales to “prove” God does not exist. “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” Rom 1:22 In contrast to Sir Isaac Newton and William Maury who researched scripture to launch their scientific inquiry, Einstein, Hawking, and many others initially presupposed a naturalistic origin and as evidence mounted, got dragged into reluctant recognition of a Creator. Biogenesis Perhaps as a professional courtesy, but with absolutely no evidence, Collins PRESUMES (Pg 89) that dirt assembled ITSELF into DNA digital code, acquired the capability of information storage, and differentiated into multiple “kinds”. We’ve not seen such baseless backward extrapolation since Darwin, in his book of speculative conjecture published without corroborating data, presumed that adaptation explains origin. Science predicated itself on the foundational principle that there is God’s discoverable order in the universe - down to the structure of sub-atomic particles. Order sans intelligence is logically impossible! Yet scientists thrill at each new fairy-tale atheistic deception, and deem anything plausible when multiplied by millions of years. Possibly the Rosetta Stone was formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion (wink).  Collins draws no clear distinction between ADAPTATATION (micro-evolution) and ORIGIN (macro-evolution).Collins says random assembly of molecules may have occurred. He tries to torpedo the entropy argument against biogenesis (the fairy-tale that chemistry begat biology vs. the truth that everything degrades) with an analogy that ignores the essential element of purpose-driven order, plus sustainability, and replication (Pg. 92). Molecules bumping into molecules, like people in a crowd, does not infer or confer a relationship, or transfer properties, or create order. There is no reason for the new combination to persist, incorporate, amalgamate, congregate, consolidate, or replicate.He allows that God could have created the first DNA, but offers no rationale for why God would have stopped with one or a few samples, and thus enjoy the fun of creating diversity. He warns against a “God of the Gaps” (Pg 93) but fails to acknowledge the eventual overturning of nearly every contravening “scientific” presumption, hypothesis, and theory to date. Instead of asking, “How did God do this?” the world supports vain imaginations (hubristic fairy-tales) that eventually fail. Contrast this with the greatest physicist/mathmetician ever, Sir Isaac Newton’s 1704 manuscript describing his quest to extract scientific information from the Bible. Newton’s Laws of Motion and Gravity have withstood the test of time. Perhaps there is a correlation between seeking God and finding truth.Collins warns against betting on a literal Genesis occurrence, then he ventures into paleontology dogma (Pg 93), failing to include recent creationist evidence that disputes long-held scientific beliefs. Neither does he proffer any evidence for the claim that extinct ”kinds” are the missing transitional forms.Self-DevelopmentCollins introduces Darwin’s assertion (which he ultimately adopts) that God may have “created a few original forms capable of self-development” (Pg 98). Biologists mis-use anthropomorphic terms like “strategy” saying that bugs develop a strategy to overcome pesticides. Ridiculous! If self-development is possible, the most intelligent of all God’s creation would have, by now, a bigger penis! Kindly pardon this graphic illustration needed to dramatize my point.Emulating Darwin, Collins takes pains to point out possible harmonious interpretations, but instead of accepting the Bible as true, and reconciling the current nascent state of struggling science with it, Collins incorrectly proclaims that “no serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life” (Pg 99). He should visit Institute for Creation Research or Answers in Genesis or Creation.com to be enlightened by an ever-growing body of scientists whose compelling evidence refutes his assertion. My own feeble survey of the beauty and apparently gratuitous diversity of amazing fish (28,000 species) is sufficient to understand that God intended to give a glimpse of his power, magnificence, and divinity thru our observation of what He made. Romans 1:20.AdaptationCollins cites adaptations in stickleback fish, malaria, HIV, and flu as examples of evolution (Pg 132), but each degraded mutation is just a variant of itself, an adaptation. The flu virus is still a flu virus; it does not morph into an HIV virus or a new disease, or new “kind”. Even purposeful (with intelligence) attempts to modify fruitfly genes over thousands of generations only result in mutant fruitflies, some with wings sticking out of their heads.His refutation of Special Creation’s “Ex Nihilo Species” (Pg 137) is feeble in that he illogically ignores God’s prerogative to re-use successful patterns. Why should God start anew with each “kind” He created? The Bible repeatedly says“after his kind” (e.g. Gen 1:24 Webster’s version is the most grammatically correct) which reinforces that God created multiple kinds of plants and animals. One can only imagine how much fun God must have had with the variations.DNAIt appears that DNA is comprised of error-correcting code like a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). If a piece is lost or corrupted, the piece can be reconstructed by referencing the other pieces. The math and logic needed to accomplish this feat was developed in computers long before it was recognized in DNA. Neither happened without intelligent design!Normally I would avoid criticism tangential to this distinguished scientist’s area of expertise, but Collins makes a special point of calling caspace-12 a “nonfunctional gene” (Pg 139) to argue against Special Creation.Certainly, it is illogical to presume that God would design a gene with 45% flotsam and jetsam (Pg 136). Having been a computer programmer I visualize genes as analogous to a computer memory-dump in which data and instructions mix within the hexadecimal strings. I remember it was frequently easier to spot data (analogous to GAA and GAG recipe for glutamic acid) than to identify instructions within the memory dump. Doesn’t it make sense to pursue an inquiry into what Collins dismissively calls Ancient Repetitive Elements (AREs) as possible instructions governing the GAA and GAG? I could find nowhere that this cellular biology expert presents the fact that DNA requires 75 proteins to exist, but proteins require DNA for construction. Using this undeniable fact, he could have made a much stronger case for God.Young EarthCollins attacks Young Earth creationists (Pg 172-179) saying “Young Earth creationism has reached a point of intellectual bankruptcy, both in its science and in its theology”. He assumes processes like deuterium decay always functioned as now, assumes light had to travel from distant stars (Pg 176) as opposed to beams having been created simultaneous with, or BEFORE (Gen 1:3) the stars (Gen 1:14). He fails to cite these arguments for a young earth fitting a Bible timeline:•	Ocean salinity and sediment deposits at river mouths are consistent with a young earth.•	The number of exploding star (supernova) remnants (SNRs) in all three stages is consistent with a 7000 year-young universe.•	Evidence that God did not create an embryonic universe, but a fully functioning interactive SYSTEM, manifests in plants that require creatures for pollination.•	Due to Barry Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy, the physical manifestation of Planck’s constant) The speed of light and electrons has decreased asymptotically since Creation. Light appears to have 30% faster in Jesus day, 400 times faster in Abraham’s day, and ten million times faster prior to 3,000BC.•	Speed of light may be increasing as it encounters less ZPE at the outer edges of space. Just as light speeds up after it emerges from water, allow me to speculate that the nature of light may be such (otherwise, what is the energy source?) that it goes at a fixed speed except while ZPE, water, atmosphere, and space dust etc. hinders.•	Electrons bouncing erratically off ZPE as they negotiate the ZPE hurdles on their orbital track, probably explains the “Uncertainty Principle” of quantum physics. Electrons are moving slower too. Calculations of age based on atomic decay need extreme revision.•	We are simply peering thru a longer taillight beam as the once-close stars travel away. The light appears redder because the lower-energy photons were redder, not a Doppler effect as suggested by Hubbel’s red-shift. We cannot observe light from outside the beam because it always heads directly toward us. The speed is relative to our own speed.When people study the Bible’s supernatural truths, fulfilled prophesies, structure, its heptadic code (7’s), and gematria (Jewish numbering) sufficiently to know that the Bible is, beyond doubt, directly from God, then their worldview is firmly rooted in truth. God’s account of how He created the universe, and us, is not an allegory as Collins maintains. Successful (real, true) science, like Bible study, is an attempt to know the mind of God.Science hinders itself with materialistic terms of engagement that stifle investigation. Our physics is likely only a shadow of a larger reality hinted at by mathematical postulations of additional dimensions we cannot yet comprehend. We should think of our material universe as a subset of a larger (supernatural) reality. Science thwarts progress by clinging to foolish atheistic traditions designed to deny the existence of God. Beware of OrthodoxyEducator John Taylor Gatto (author of Dumbing Us Down) told me schooling trains people to act like fish (swim in unison). Joe Bobier, inventor of Single-Cycle Modulation said “If I had been an electrical engineer, they would have convinced me this is not possible.” The reason breakthrough ideas are coming from sophomore high schoolers (Jack Andraka’s cancer detector, Simon Tsaoussis, two-transistor ternary RAM) is that they are not overly encumbered by orthodoxy. Revolutionary, disruptive, correct ideas encounter establishment ridicule as Dr. Robert O. Becker describes in his journey The Body Electric. Collins incorrectly struggles to conform to atheist/agnostic orthodoxy instead of standing firmly on God’s Word. I strongly urge him to revise this book."
193,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,4,"Francis Collins is a renowned scientist -- the former director of the Human Genome Project -- and also a Christian. In a time when science and faith can seem so diametrically opposed, it was encouraging to read one person's view of how he balances the two perspectives, and sees them as complementary rather than hostile to each other. I don't know how well this book will speak to all the different perspectives it could potentially be speaking to. I don't know whether an atheist or agnostic reader will be convinced or touched by the arguments and ideas presented here, since I am neither of those. It does cover quite a few topics -- from Collins' path to faith from his initial atheism; to a discussion of both scientific and faith-based approaches to worldviews, covering atheism, agnosticism, intelligent design, young-earth creationism, as well as theistic evolution, which he terms ""BioLogos""; as well as an overview of human DNA and what the Human Genome Project was aiming to accomplish; and an appendix devoted to bioethics, there was a lot to take in here (though I found it a relatively quick read).I think I was able to get the scientific gist of most of what he was writing about, since this was written for a layperson, but obviously there's a lot beneath the surface. I found the bits about the human genome most interesting. Faith-wise, numerous C.S. Lewis quotes will always draw me in, though I'm sure I'm not from the same ""bent"" of Christianity as Collins (though the same could be said for Lewis). But I valued the discussions of the various intersections of faith and science in regards to worldview (with an emphasis on origins).I don't agree with all of Collins' views here (though I can appreciate that we can still hold the same faith despite differences), and in many cases I don't even understand enough yet to know whether I agree or disagree. But I'm still grateful for his perspective, because it has helped me to clarify my thinking on some things, which includes some errors and inconsistencies in perspectives that I have held or entertained. I also appreciate him incorporating other thinkers (both scientists and theologians) into his arguments, because many quotes he uses are also interesting and make me want to learn more.I especially appreciate his call to not view God's Word and his creation as being ""at war with itself,"" as expressed in this quote that I think sums up his views nicely:“Will we turn our backs on science because it is perceived as a threat to God, abandoning all the promise of advancing our understanding of nature and applying that to the alleviation of suffering and the betterment of humankind? Alternatively, will we turn our backs on faith, concluding that science has rendered the spiritual life no longer necessary, and that traditional religious symbols can now be replaced by engravings of the double helix on our altars?Both of these choices are profoundly dangerous. Both deny truth. Both will diminish the nobility of humankind. Both will be devastating to our future. And both are unnecessary. The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. He can be worshipped in the cathedral or in the laboratory. His creation is majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful - and it cannot be at war with itself. Only we imperfect humans can start such battles. And only we can end them.”"

His first objective was to sieve Darwinian Evolution from atheism, on which he sold me. His second was to defend Theistic Evolution, in which he thoroughly failed. On the first matter, he created the best starting apologetic for scientific atheists that I've read. Collins was once an atheist. He took apart Dawkins. He glossed over true differences between DE and theology for the sake of (a false) harmony, but believably estranged DE and materialism. He seems to be a real Christian, however it is of course always hard to reliably tell. He professed belief and a relationship, which sounded genuine, but he kept referring to the value of other faith traditions, never called Jesus the only Way, and otherwise generally retreated to what sounded vaguely like a ""it works for me"" stance.On defending TE, he hung his cap on Darwinian Evolution. He erected a caricature of Young Earth Creationism and proceeded to beat the straw out of it. He didn't just oppose YEC and Intelligent Design, he called them untenable and impossible. His evidences were quite dated for 2006. Such faulty data that he determined to irrefutably support DE included: the DNA similarity between humans, chimps and mice; the immutability of isotopic dating and isotope half-lives (despite no evidence of universe conditions past 100 years ago or so); Occam's Razor; and the proposed reducible complexity of blood clots, flagella and the human eye (the former two of which were plausible, but not irrefutable). He got right the fact that scientific truth and spiritual truth cannot contradict, but he promoted the DE argument as overwhelming instead of its true, overwhelming ambiguity. He resembled Ptolemy, accepting the noticeable errors in satellite epicycles rather than telling the world that the earth revolves around the Sun, all for the sake of a contrived peace. His views have been thoroughly and convincingly refuted by the publications of Answers in Genesis, and plausibly so by Gerald Schroeder's creation-physics model (which reconciles YEC and OEC) in his book, The Science of God."

Still though, I thought Collins’s argument for theistic evolution was compelling. As a scientist and a person of faith, I’ve never seen incompatibility between the two domains, but haven’t been able to clearly articulate my beliefs as theistic evolution. I am deeply compelled by the Moral Law argument and this book helped to strengthen my beliefs. I found myself coming back to this book and Collins’s arguments frequently over the course of the semester in my Philosophy of Religion class. We didn’t talk about theistic evolution directly, but The Language of God supplemented a lot of my coursework well. I was less compelled by Collins’s arguments for Christianity in particular toward the end of the book, but I appreciate his insistence that faith is a personal journey we must all come to for ourselves. Overall, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to understand more about science, faith, and the relationship between the two. "

I read Darwin's Black Box and felt compelled by Behe's explanations. I was similarly compelled by Collins's dismantling of Behe, though. What all of this comes down to is that I am a layman having to trust whoever writes these books to tell me what they wish, leave out & skip over what they wish, and interpret everything for me. The only solution is to go back to school for my own PhD in biology, I guess. Honestly, though, I would skip reading this book. If you want the good faith parts just read Mere Christianity or better yet C. S. Lewis's entire bibliography. If you want the good science parts, just read any mainstream college molecular biology textbook, or whatever the latest Richard Dawkins book is."

Collins provides brief backgrounds on both apologetics (belief) and genetics (science). If a reader is not familiar with either of those topics, this book is not a good introduction. As a believer with a science and engineering background, I enjoyed learning his perspective. Collins is frank in stating that young earth creationism is a dangerous concept, and he gave language and examples to support it. He is also frank in saying that science does not and cannot explain everything about our existence and the meaning of life. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and took a lot away from it that I will use in conversations with both believers and non-believers."
198,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23188545-josh,4,"More and more,if you are willing to open your eyes, you will be confronted with those who have differing views and beliefs than your own. The temptation is great to simply dismiss any idea or worldview that seems contrary to the one you already hold. My brother characterizes, and to a degree caricatures, the typical Christian response to contrary ideas as that of a petulant child putting his fingers in his ears and repeating, “I CAN'T HEAR YOU” to drown out the sound of anything that might question what is held so dearly.As a Christian,who deals with many Christians, it is hard to not acquiesce to his diagnosis. So often, those who should be genuinely searching out truth wherever it lies (seeing as how all truth is God's truth) will allow ourselves to remain ignorant out of fear that our beliefs will come crashing down and our God with them. If this fear is not present,then the possibility of ever having to admit some degree of error in our interpretation of the Bible or of the world or of our self is more than our pride can stand.Labels abound. If you believe in health care for all or government based social services then you are a “communist”. If you believe that some of the Bible is not to be taken literally, you're a “liberal” who does not believe the Bible. If you preach grace you are “antinomian” and if you preach responsibility and fidelity, you are a “legalist”. The word “heretic” gets thrown around on anyone not conforming to “the Bible” which would be more accurately and honesty communicated as “my interpretation of the Bible”.All these labels do in most cases is perpetuate ignorance and division, making it more convenient and efficient for us as we sit in God's seat of judgment on any who might not submit themselves to what we “know” as truth. Enter Francis Collins. Talk about a guy getting it from all angles. Collins was the head of the Human Genome Project, the scientific research to map out the human genome. The work done under his leadership has led to us have a genetic map of human beings. The benefit of this in the war against disease and defect is incapable of being overstated. The work God has done through this man and his leadership is amazing.And therein lies the reason he receives such criticism. Collins, a biologist, stood in the Oval Office with then President Clinton and nodded approvingly when President Clinton remarked that we could now see the “language of God” used in creation. How a professional biologist could hold to an “inherently unscientific” belief in God and approve of such theistic speak offended many in the biological community. That a committed Christian could believed in the “inherently atheistic” doctrine of evolution, offended many in the Christian community.That is the backdrop for the book, The Language of God by Francis Collins. Collins work is one part biography, one part scientific treatise and one part apologetic. Collins spends time going over his life, and his own path from atheism, to agnosticism, and finally to his firm belief in the theism of Biblical Christianity. The biographical aspects of the book are all centered on how he has related his lifelong love of science with his lifelong struggle with faith,and it is quite engrossing. Even as the biographical aspects of the book focus on Collins' own personal path, the way he presents it is overtly apologetic. He constantly goes over how he was convinced of the truth of theism and eventually the Christian truth claim, not simply recounting the fact that he was convinced. The way the apologetic is intertwined with the biographical narrative reminds one of reading C.S. Lewis when he deals with the same subject. Based on the references to and quotes from Lewis, this may not have been intentional but certainly it is without shock that some of Lewis' writing style was adopted by Collins.The apologetic nature of the book is not limited solely to a defense of the Christian faith. The idea of this book is how to rectify a belief in current scientific trends and the Christian faith. In doing so, Collins argues that Darwinian Evolution is true and that it is NOT contrary to the Christian faith. With so much teaching for and evidence of evolution, Collins' devotes a chapter to each of the possible responses to evolution. These chapters are Atheism and Agnosticism (When Science Trumps Faith), Creationism (When Faith Trumps Science), Intelligent Design (When Science Needs Divine Help),and BioLogos (Faith and Science in Harmony). Collins is basically fair in his assessment of the opposing views, but throughout the chapters it is clear that he is building to what he holds as truth by dismantling what he holds as false(or even silly). Collins closes with pleas to believers to not abandon science and scientists to not abandon faith.As I read the book I had to remind myself that Collins is not a theologian, he is a biologist. His interpretation of some Christian doctrines is off what he seems to hold as essential is debated amongst Christians. Some of the history he cites is incorrect and the citations could have been more thorough, especially on some instances where no citation was given. Also, there were times where Collins began speaking exclusively to his peers, losing the reader with limited scientific knowledge in the process.While this book is far from perfect, it is a great read. It would benefit anyone involved in the evolution debate(that would be anyone who has any religious, secular or scientific interest....everyone) to read this book and consider the arguments made and data presented"

Of course the author of science is compatible with the science He created. It’s hard to believe this is still or has ever been an issue. However, it’s definitely worth the read just to hear his perspective on evolution. I’m not quite sold on the science but he is very persuasive. I’ve been reading both sides of the theistic evolution-intelligent design debate for a while now and I’m not convinced humans have fully learned enough yet to die on any hill. One thing is for certain– Francis Collins truly loves Jesus and it grieves me when Christians attack each other over non-essential doctrines not explicit in the Bible. Remember, we are all bothers and sisters in Christ. "

It raises questions, but importantly, it defines what science can and cannot discover and why faith and science are not in conflict. For me, it helped clarify issues surrounding stem cell research, some things regarding evolution, and other hotbed controversial issues without me feeling like I had to 'check my faith in God' at the door in order to engage in the things this scientist was saying. It was a breath of fresh air. "

210,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32254765-kevin-stilley,3,"The following are discussion questions for ""The Language of God"" that I created for the monthly meeting of of the Atheist Christian Book Club. For information on the Atheist Christian Book Club you can go to the website at http://atheistchristianbookclub.com/ or seek us out on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/AtheistChris... .CHAPTER 1: FROM ATHEISM TO BELIEFCollins says that for him agnosticism was a place of retreat where he wouldn’t actually have to seriously consider the evidence for or against belief. That is obviously not true of those in this book group, but do you think it is generally true for most agnostics? Is agnosticism a position that is held in order to avoid the question of God’s existence altogether?Collins writes that the Moral Law was the primary thing that made him reconsider his atheism. What about those in our book group. Is there a “one thing” that creates cognitive dissonance and makes the atheists in the group pause to reconsider?CHAPTER 2: THE WAR OF THE WORLDVIEWSA similar question for the Christians; is there a question that makes you uncomfortable with your faith? Collins talks about four questions that he struggled with during the early days of his newfound belief. Is there a question like that that makes the Christians in the group sometimes doubt? If not currently, was there a question you struggled with at some time in your life?Collins lists four difficult questions that he struggled with as a new believer; (1) Isn’t the idea of God just wish-fulfillment?, (2) What about all the harm done in the name of religion?, (3) Why would a loving God allow suffering in the world?, and (4) How can a rational person believe in miracles? Were you satisfied with the answers Collins has arrived at and shares here?CHAPTER 3: THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSECollins writes, “Immanuel Kant wrote: ""Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the Moral Law within."" I have heard some former atheist/agnostics similarly indicate that these two things, nature and the moral law, seemed to be ever present in the back of their mind/heart as an indication that there had to be something more than just the material even when they were most intellectually opposed to the idea of God. I’m curious if those two concerns have any influence on the atheists/agnostics in our book group?Collins writes, “Based on these and other observations, physicists are in agreement that the universe began as an infinitely dense, dimensionless point of pure energy. The laws of physics breakdown in this circumstance, referred to as a ""singularity."" Is there the same kind of unanimity among the members of this book group as there seems to be among physicists? Collins seems to think that the question of origins hinges upon the question “What happened before the Big Bang?” Would the book club members agree?Collins' timeline (number of years) differs from some of the Christians in the room. For those who hold to a young earth theory of creation, how important do you think it is to adhere to a “thousands of years” formula instead of a “millions or billions of years” formula?The question of old earth vs. young earth is primarily a discussion held within the camp of Christianity. However, how does it affect those of you who are atheistic/agnostic?Collins writes of the Anthropic Principle, that “The existence of a universe as we know it rests upon a knife edge of improbability.” (page 73) This same fine-tuning argument also had an influence on the author of a previous book we read, Anthony Flew. The author gives three possibilities; (1) an infinite number of universes, (2) we are just very, very lucky, or (3) The precise tuning of all of the physical constants and physical laws to make intelligent life possible is not an accident, but reflects the action of the one who created the universe in the first place. What do you think?Collins quotes a number of famous scientists who believe that “""It would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun in just this way, except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us."" (pages 75ff). Do you think that Stephen Hawking, Freeman Dyson, Arno Penzias and other such scientists (such as Collins, himself) forfeit their scientific bona fides by taking such a position?The author claims that “there is nothing inherently in conflict between the idea of a creator God and what science has revealed.” Do you agree or disagree with him? Why? (page 81) The author further claims that “the opening words of Genesis (""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"") are entirely compatible with the Big Bang.” Do you agree or disagree with him? (pages 82-83)CHAPTER 4: LIFE ON EARTH – OF MICROBES AND MENCollins says that “no serious scientist would currently claim that a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life is at hand” but warns Christians not to result to a God of the gaps apologetic. He encourages them to adopt an approach using “positive reasons, based on knowledge, rather than default assumptions based on (a temporary) lack of knowledge.” However, for those of you who are atheists, does “the inability of modern science to develop a statistically probable mechanism” for the origin of life give you any intellectual pause? (pages 92-93)Collins writes, “No serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life. In fact, the relatedness of all species through the mechanism of evolution is such a profound foundation for the understanding of all biology that it is difficult to imagine how one would study life without it.” Is this true? Are there no serious biologists that doubt the theory of evolution? Is Collins being fair to those who disagree with him on this matter? (page 99)CHAPTER 5: DECIPHERING GOD’S INSTRUCTION BOOK – THE LESSONS OF THE HUMAN GENOMECollins asserts that the difference between macroevolution and microevolution is “increasingly seen to be artificial. But then to illustrate it is a distinction without a difference he uses the example of a stickleback fish with armor becoming a stickleback fish without armor. I think most critics of Darwinism would find this example not to be compelling. A fish becomes a fish. A virus becomes a slightly different virus. How is this evidence for the “tree of life”? Was his example sufficient for you to think that the distinction between macroevolution and microevolution is “arbitrary”? (pages 131-132)In reference to similarities between human and mouse genomes, Collins writes, “This evidence alone does not, of course, prove a common ancestor; from a creationist perspective, such similarities could simply demonstrate that God used successful design principles over and over again. As we shall see, however, and as was foreshadowed above by the discussion of ""silent"" mutations in protein-coding regions, the detailed study of genomes has rendered that interpretation virtually untenable—not only about all other living things, but also about ourselves.” Do you think that the evidence provided by Collins actually supports his claim that it is untenable to believe that God used successful design principles over and over again? (pages 133-137)Does Collins provide compelling evidence from genetic similarities to prove that humans and other life forms have a common ancestor? (pages 137- 142)CHAPTER 6: GENESIS, GALILEO, AND DARWINCollins writes about the emotional distance between Christian believers who are adherents of Darwinism and those who reject this biological theory. What do you think about this? Is it difficult for these to “sides” to coexist in theological harmony? (pages 145-147)CHAPTER 7: OPTION 1 – ATHEISM AND AGNOSTICISM (WHEN SCIENCE TRUMPS FAITH)Collins writes about the hostility between some believers and unbelievers. How common is this? Why do you think this is so? (pages 159ff)The author of our book quotes Dawkins as saying, “""It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus, 'mad cow' disease, and many others, but I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.” Do the atheists in our group believe that faith is evil? (page 163)Collins quotes Stephen Jay Gould as saying that since “Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny” the existence of God. Do you agree with Gould? (page 166)The author refers to four different groups:1. Strong Atheists = have a firm conviction that no deities exist.2. Weak Atheism = the absence of belief in the existence of a God or gods3. Strong Agnostics = believes there is no way that human kind will “ever” know if there is a God4. Weak Atheists = believes only that it is not possible to know “yet” whether or not there is a GodWhat is the composition of atheists/agnostics in our group in regard to these four descriptions?CHAPTER 8: OPTION 2 - CREATIONISM (WHEN FAITH TRUMPS SCIENCE)Does Collins accurately reflect the beliefs of most Young Earth Creationists when he claims that they believe in Microevolution, which he defines as small changes within a species, but do not believe in Macroevolution, which he describes as one species evolving into another species? Many of the young earth creationists that I know are much more flexible with the definition of Microevolution, and define it as changing from one genus, or one order, into another genus or order. (page 172) Does this matter, or is this a distinction without a difference?Is Collins being a bit hysterical when he declares that should YEC scientific claims be true then, “it would lead to a complete and irreversible collapse of the sciences of physics, chemistry, cosmology, geology, and biology.”? (page 174) He makes it sound down right apocalyptic; are YEC that dangerous?CHAPTER 9: OPTION 3 – INTELLIGENT DESIGN (WHEN SCIENCE NEEDS DIVINE HELP)Collins asserts that if the logic of Intelligent Design “truly had merit on scientific grounds, one would expect that the rank and file of working biologists would also show interest in pursuing these ideas, especially since a significant number of biologists are also believers.” (page 187) However, haven’t historians of science like Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) written that just the opposite is true? Does not history tell us that science that none of the revolutionary paradigmatic changes that science has undergone were quickly accepted on the basis of reason/evidence alone? Is head-counting an appropriate way to determine truth?Collins claims that ID is a God of the gaps theory and that science is busily filling in those gaps with things other than God, and thus the theory is collapsing. If so, what then happens with faith? (page 195)CHAPTER 10: BIOLOGOS (SCIENCE AND FAITH IN HARMONY)Within Christianity there is frequently contentious debates among believers about what is the right approach/beliefs regarding creation. How do those of you who are atheists react when you witness such debates?Collins points out that BioLogos is not a scientific theory? (page 204) Does that seem like a copout for a group of scientists to be organizing around a non-scientific theory?CHAPTER 11: TRUTH SEEKERSCollins tells his conversion story in the final chapter. We have on several occasions honestly discussed the question, “What would it take for you to become a person of faith?” and “What would it take for you to become a disbeliever?” Has this book modified your answers to these questions?One of the previous books we discussed was written by the world’s leading intellectual atheist and documented his conversion to theism. This book was written by the person who may be the world’s leading medical geneticist and why he is a Christian. Has the stature of these two authors provoked any intellectual movement from those of you who are atheists?DID ANYONE HAVE A CHANGE OF OPINION (ABOUT ANYTHING) AS A RESULT OF READING THIS BOOK? HAS ANYONE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE YEAR WE HAVE SPENT READING AND DISCUSSING TOGETHER?Supplementary note: Several of the atheistic authors we have read in our book group have indicated that all inerrantists believe in a young earth. This is not true. For a survey of the different viewpoints of inerrantists you can read the following short article: https://www.christianpost.com/news/do..."
211,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14348847-henry-stoltzfus,4,"I had a hard time deciding on a rating for this book.On the one hand, the author really fails to deliver on the promise in the subtitle. There is little ""evidence for belief"" here, and I think most people who have seriously engaged with the god question will have already encountered the main arguments elsewhere.That being said, it was an enjoyable read and I came away with renewed respect for Dr. Collins and his work. Even though his attempt at reconciling the scientific and religious worldviews was ultimately unconvincing for me, he comes across as one of the most intellectually honest and sincere Christian thinkers I've encountered on this topic."

213,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43496878-chris-woody,4,"When I was a student small group leader a few years ago, I had a group of abnormally inquisitive middle schoolers. One day, one of them asked about how we as Christians should look at ""cavemen,"" and, though I don't remember what all was said from there, I know that I mentioned it is okay for Christians to accept evolution. Of course, this didn't sit well with one of my other, well-meaning students, who had never been exposed to such an idea. Even when I said that C.S. Lewis might have accepted the possibility of evolution, his response was ""No, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure he was a Christian."" This all ended with me having to have a chat with the youth pastor to ensure that I wasn't saying anything heretical. All of this is to say that, as a Christian who sees the theory of evolution as compatible with belief, I've found myself in some trouble with my church over these views.This question has been one that I've been mulling over for years: How can Christians accept the evidence that we evolved over millions of years without also saying that we don't take the sanctity of Scripture seriously. I think that Francis Collins, a world-renowned geneticist and devout believer, does a pretty good job of this. He lays out a pretty good argument that science can actually enhance our ability to appreciate God's creation, not jeopardize it. He also does a good job of arguing against both atheism and strict creationism, both of which exist on the far ends of the spectrum when it comes to the ""science-faith"" debate. I think that a lot of believers would do well to read this book and find that it is okay to trust science and still believe in a loving God. Had I read this before, I would have been able to recommend it to my student, as I'm sure Collins can articulate things and explain complex scientific concepts far better than I can."
214,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121586-aaron-barnhart,3,"Our Sunday School class has been reading this clear, concise defense of Christian faith from an evangelical and one of the country's leading geneticists. Collins is controversial with his fellow evangelicals because he argues that evolution is an accepted scientific method, and he is controversial among atheists and skeptics because he asserts that God is both the loving creator of the universe and a being who exists beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. He is, essentially, C.S. Lewis brought into the 21st century — and I say that as someone who is well aware of Lewis's literary reputation. Collins is a highly readable author, and his informal, avuncular prose is arguably more accessible to Christians today than the somewhat outdated and dense argumentation of ""Mere Christianity.""That said, I find The Language of God unsatisfying because it is largely a guide to fellow evangelicals on how to defend their faith against the atheistic meanies of the scientific world like Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. Such people, and we can throw Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens in there while we're at it, are no threat to Christianity because they comprise such a small part of the population. (Harris's argument that Collins should not have been appointed the head of the National Institutes of Health because of his Christian views is a case in point. Collins has no controversial scientific views that I know of, and he is, like most taxpayers, a professed Christian.) Many, if not most, American Christians, however, are neither evangelicals of the Collins stripe nor fundamentalist six-day creationist types (the other group this book takes aim at). Many Christians are members of non-evangelical churches who take their values to their workplace and households without a lot of fanfare or ""God talk."" Another emerging group is Gen-Y evangelicals, who grew up in these churches but disdain their parents' conservative politics and are ready to rethink what it is to be a Christian in the secular society. To me, a major challenge facing Christianity is how to coax these two sets of believers back into the public square, where their moderating influence and quiet moral strength would really come in handy right about now. With his evangelical zeal and quick answers to every problem, Collins strikes me as too much like the nut cases he claims to oppose — people whose minds are made up and aren't interested in real discussion. The Language of God may appear to be at first on the side of such reasonable people, but in the end it offers them surprisingly little help, unless they happen to go to a church much like the one Collins attends."
215,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5292677-al-datum,5,"There are a few claims made by atheists on a regular basis. They include the following:- Only the uneducated become Christians. Truly educated people, especially scientists, would never accept such nonsense- The only reason people are Christians is that they were raised to believe as they doThis book is proof that these two claims are simply nonsense. Francis Collins was an atheist prior to his scientific work on the human genome project. His career has been stellar (he led the Human Genome Project and is currently the director of the National Institutes of Health). He is a leading scientist, and certainly qualifies as a truly educated person. He was also not a Christian his entire life.Collins became a Christian when he began to look at the complexity of the human genome. As he recounts in this book, he was simply unable to remain an atheist since his scientific findings led him to the inescapable conclusion of design and a transcendent designer (this same argument has persuaded many atheists, by the way...check out Antony Flew's conversion. Or Alister McGrath. Or John Polkinghorne. Or Frank Tipler...I could go on).In this book, Collins describes his journey and shows why he came to the conclusion that God exists. He makes the case that was persuasive to him, and also builds the case that evolution and Christianity are not mutually exclusive (in fact, as philosopher William Lane Craig has said, the existence of evolution in such a short span of time [speaking of the length of time our planet has existed] would itself be a miracle, and thus proof of God).Collins does a good job of showing that science and Christianity are not enemies, but partners in the quest for truth (Christianity is, after all, largely responsible for Western Science getting its start). He shows the reasonableness of being both a leading scientist and a believer. And he destroys the two claims I listed at the beginning of this review. Not only is it possible for highly educated scientists to be raised as non-believers only to be converted to Christianity when confronted with the evidence. But Dr. Collins is living proof of this fact.Pick this book up if you'd like to read Dr. Collins' story. It's a very interesting one. And if you're open to following the evidence where it leads, it provides a persuasive case that the evidence leads directly to the existence of an all-powerful creator and designer.One other thing...if you're looking for a good, quick overview of Bayes Theorem, this book has a nice treatment of it that anyone can understand.Simply put...atheism is wrong. The evidence is inescapable."
216,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1225279-clint,3,"3.0 - In this book Collins explains how he harmonizes his belief in God with his understanding of evolution and other scientific processes involved in the creation of our universe. While I don't agree with every conclusion that Collins reaches, his honest and reasonable approach make this a very interesting book. He does a good job of giving a broad-brush description of the major scientific theories involved (big bang and evolution) and evidence for them. His explanations of DNA, how it's used, and how it provides further evidence of evolutionary processes was particularly interesting. I felt his establishment of evolution as truth was a little lacking, as there were a few evolutionary question marks that weren't acknowledged, or weren't addressed as thoroughly as I'd have liked. His arguments in favor of God were based primarily on the philosophical ideas of Moral Law and universal longing for God as presented by C. S. Lewis. While he touched on some physical evidences of a Creator, such as the beautiful mathematical connection with nature and its laws, based on the title I was expecting more. Just as his establishment of evolution was lacking, I found his establishment of God also lacking. He proclaimed Moral Law as his most convincing evidence, yet failed to really establish any sort of spiritual-based evidence. I realize that spiritual evidence is subjective and it deals more on a personal level, but isn't that how it should be? Faith is a personal decision, salvation is a personal issue, our relationship with God is personal, so the spiritual evidence for him should be personal. The bottom line of the book though was that science and faith can and should happily coexist. Truth should be in harmony with truth. Science cannot prove nor disprove the existance and role of a Creator, all it can do is shed light on how the creations behave. "
217,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"Dr. Collins articulates the two sides of the argument (faith v. science) well - and then demonstrates how the argument really shouldn't exist at all as both faith and science are involved in the search for Truth, albeit with different tools and methods. Nothing spectacularly new, in fact he leans heavily on others' words, notably C.S. Lewis, but also many others from Copernicus to Augustine to generally good effect. Hard to judge how convincing he was since I already agreed with most of his premises and assertions.Brief, helpful review of biological reproduction of DNA was clearly explained without either condescending to the reader or assuming the reader remembered every detail from Biology 101.For more book reviews, visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."
218,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312471-karen-l,3,"I liked this book but I did not love it. Why? Well, I have to say that as other critics of this book have noted, he does quote Lewis a little too much. I love C. S. Lewis and agreed with the author on many points yet I would have rather had him quote a little more of a variety of influences.Still, I did find his stories interesting and his ability to make science accessible to the non science layman very helpful. The book contains a lot of good information and most definitely could boost the faith of someone who is a doubter."
219,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1647255-fire-kovarovic,1,"The reviews were so promising... I expected a philosophical treatise but received a shallow description of one man's career and how he came to assume a life of faith. While there might be a place for this sort of literature, it was not what I was looking for. I clearly was not a member of the target audience."
220,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,4,I saw this author one afternoon on the Beeb and checked out his book from the library. I have always been disgusted with the fundamentalist belief that it is either science or faith. This book is a wonderful statement for the idea that science is evidence of God in action. I really enjoyed this book. It even re-awakened a sense of faith that the Bush administration had nearly destroyed.
221,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29591849-elinor,3,"This was pretty great. Relied heavily on CS Lewis for the apologetics, but gave a lot of interesting insight on the biology/science side of things."
222,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62738513-richard-webb,2,"Devoted to reconciling Judeo-Christians and evolutionists. Misses many opportunities to do so. As a renowned geneticist and leader of the Human Genome Project, reputed to be the greatest achievement of our generation, Collins team completed the first-draft mapping of the 3 billion gene sequences in DNA in 2000, and now heads the National Institutes of Health.As a Christian, Collins proposes that faith in God and faith in science can coexist and be harmonious saying, ‘We have caught the first glimpse of our instruction book, previously known only to God”.Collins boldly challenges his Darwinian colleagues: “So those who choose to be atheists must find some other basis for taking that position, evolution won’t do.” (Pg 167), and “agnosticism also runs the risk of being a cop-out,” (Pg 168). Further, he notes that distinguished agnostics who took time to consider the evidence “unexpectedly converted themselves” (Pg 168). Perhaps he wrote this book to those folks. But instead of reconciling atheistic/agnostic science to God’s Word in the Bible, Collins attempts to push the Bible toward today’s tenuous tenets of science. He first tries to build bridges to atheists by recounting common misconceptions about the Salem Witch Trials, the Crusades, and the underlying beliefs of fundamentally violent Islam; leading him to unjustified self-criticisms of Christianity (Pg 41). However, unexpurgated history shows witch trials ended because two Christian preachers objected to the execution of 20 Salem witches, ending the murder of tens of thousands in Europe. The Crusades were a last-option response to Moslems terrorizing Europe – a resurrected scourge that we must again excise as our Founders did in the 1780’s.Outside His FieldAs a Biblical apologist, Collins writes outside his field of expertise, borrowing credibility from his reputation as an eminent scientist. His discussion of suffering (Pg 43) fails to understand that all good flows from God’s highest value - LOVE Mark 12:30-31, requiring totally free will, and the inseparable freedom to not love. Love cannot be compelled (logically, anything less than totally free-will regarding an all-powerful God could easily be coercion, which God sedulously avoids). Logically then, the failure to choose love begets all evil and suffering. Should God have restrained free-will in order to prevent evil behavior? Logically, He cannot.Additionally, Collins misunderstanding the concept of dominion from Psalm 115:16 and Psalm 8:6, and how Adam ceded to satan the dominion given to Adam in Genesis 1:28, hinders Collins analysis of suffering and evil. Satan now exercises that dominion. Luke 4:6 and 2Cor 4:4 But Jesus gave us, His followers, the power to defeat satan James 4:7, John 4:4, Matt 10:8 if we will “be transformed by the renewing of [our] mind” Rom 12:2 and use that power.Collins also misunderstands (Pg 44-45), that miracles are intended to routinely follow believers: “These signs will follow those who believe” Mark 16:17 and “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out demons.” Matt 10:8 “These things you have seen me do, you will also do, and greater works than these…” John 14:12-14, and “God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders…” Heb 2:4. Perhaps a more Pentecostal understanding of believer’s authority in Eph 1:19-20 and Mark 16:17 would be helpful to him.Big BangCollins assertion that Big Bang is “well described and unlikely to be revised” is hubristic and inconsistent with history. Collins’ Big-Bang endorsement (Pg 68) fails to mention serious doubts raised by observations of counter-rotating galaxies, stars moving toward us, and quantized red-shift. Dissenting scientists question why supposedly “old” supernova exploding stars have projected materials such short distances when an old universe theory would predict extremely long distances. His assumption of a 14 billion universe age (Pg 64) ignores Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy) and radically faster speed of light at creation that promises to someday fit paleontology within the Biblical framework. Collins warns against literal interpretation of the Bible (Pg 83), but science, as an attempt to know the mind of God, would proceed more rapidly if a Biblical view of Origin informed astronomy, physics, biology, etc. Instead, atheists waste billions of taxpayer-funded research dollars constructing fairy-tales to “prove” God does not exist. “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” Rom 1:22 In contrast to Sir Isaac Newton and William Maury who researched scripture to launch their scientific inquiry, Einstein, Hawking, and many others initially presupposed a naturalistic origin and as evidence mounted, got dragged into reluctant recognition of a Creator. Biogenesis Perhaps as a professional courtesy, but with absolutely no evidence, Collins PRESUMES (Pg 89) that dirt assembled ITSELF into DNA digital code, acquired the capability of information storage, and differentiated into multiple “kinds”. We’ve not seen such baseless backward extrapolation since Darwin, in his book of speculative conjecture published without corroborating data, presumed that adaptation explains origin. Science predicated itself on the foundational principle that there is God’s discoverable order in the universe - down to the structure of sub-atomic particles. Order sans intelligence is logically impossible! Yet scientists thrill at each new fairy-tale atheistic deception, and deem anything plausible when multiplied by millions of years. Possibly the Rosetta Stone was formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion (wink).  Collins draws no clear distinction between ADAPTATATION (micro-evolution) and ORIGIN (macro-evolution).Collins says random assembly of molecules may have occurred. He tries to torpedo the entropy argument against biogenesis (the fairy-tale that chemistry begat biology vs. the truth that everything degrades) with an analogy that ignores the essential element of purpose-driven order, plus sustainability, and replication (Pg. 92). Molecules bumping into molecules, like people in a crowd, does not infer or confer a relationship, or transfer properties, or create order. There is no reason for the new combination to persist, incorporate, amalgamate, congregate, consolidate, or replicate.He allows that God could have created the first DNA, but offers no rationale for why God would have stopped with one or a few samples, and thus enjoy the fun of creating diversity. He warns against a “God of the Gaps” (Pg 93) but fails to acknowledge the eventual overturning of nearly every contravening “scientific” presumption, hypothesis, and theory to date. Instead of asking, “How did God do this?” the world supports vain imaginations (hubristic fairy-tales) that eventually fail. Contrast this with the greatest physicist/mathmetician ever, Sir Isaac Newton’s 1704 manuscript describing his quest to extract scientific information from the Bible. Newton’s Laws of Motion and Gravity have withstood the test of time. Perhaps there is a correlation between seeking God and finding truth.Collins warns against betting on a literal Genesis occurrence, then he ventures into paleontology dogma (Pg 93), failing to include recent creationist evidence that disputes long-held scientific beliefs. Neither does he proffer any evidence for the claim that extinct ”kinds” are the missing transitional forms.Self-DevelopmentCollins introduces Darwin’s assertion (which he ultimately adopts) that God may have “created a few original forms capable of self-development” (Pg 98). Biologists mis-use anthropomorphic terms like “strategy” saying that bugs develop a strategy to overcome pesticides. Ridiculous! If self-development is possible, the most intelligent of all God’s creation would have, by now, a bigger penis! Kindly pardon this graphic illustration needed to dramatize my point.Emulating Darwin, Collins takes pains to point out possible harmonious interpretations, but instead of accepting the Bible as true, and reconciling the current nascent state of struggling science with it, Collins incorrectly proclaims that “no serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life” (Pg 99). He should visit Institute for Creation Research or Answers in Genesis or Creation.com to be enlightened by an ever-growing body of scientists whose compelling evidence refutes his assertion. My own feeble survey of the beauty and apparently gratuitous diversity of amazing fish (28,000 species) is sufficient to understand that God intended to give a glimpse of his power, magnificence, and divinity thru our observation of what He made. Romans 1:20.AdaptationCollins cites adaptations in stickleback fish, malaria, HIV, and flu as examples of evolution (Pg 132), but each degraded mutation is just a variant of itself, an adaptation. The flu virus is still a flu virus; it does not morph into an HIV virus or a new disease, or new “kind”. Even purposeful (with intelligence) attempts to modify fruitfly genes over thousands of generations only result in mutant fruitflies, some with wings sticking out of their heads.His refutation of Special Creation’s “Ex Nihilo Species” (Pg 137) is feeble in that he illogically ignores God’s prerogative to re-use successful patterns. Why should God start anew with each “kind” He created? The Bible repeatedly says“after his kind” (e.g. Gen 1:24 Webster’s version is the most grammatically correct) which reinforces that God created multiple kinds of plants and animals. One can only imagine how much fun God must have had with the variations.DNAIt appears that DNA is comprised of error-correcting code like a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). If a piece is lost or corrupted, the piece can be reconstructed by referencing the other pieces. The math and logic needed to accomplish this feat was developed in computers long before it was recognized in DNA. Neither happened without intelligent design!Normally I would avoid criticism tangential to this distinguished scientist’s area of expertise, but Collins makes a special point of calling caspace-12 a “nonfunctional gene” (Pg 139) to argue against Special Creation.Certainly, it is illogical to presume that God would design a gene with 45% flotsam and jetsam (Pg 136). Having been a computer programmer I visualize genes as analogous to a computer memory-dump in which data and instructions mix within the hexadecimal strings. I remember it was frequently easier to spot data (analogous to GAA and GAG recipe for glutamic acid) than to identify instructions within the memory dump. Doesn’t it make sense to pursue an inquiry into what Collins dismissively calls Ancient Repetitive Elements (AREs) as possible instructions governing the GAA and GAG? I could find nowhere that this cellular biology expert presents the fact that DNA requires 75 proteins to exist, but proteins require DNA for construction. Using this undeniable fact, he could have made a much stronger case for God.Young EarthCollins attacks Young Earth creationists (Pg 172-179) saying “Young Earth creationism has reached a point of intellectual bankruptcy, both in its science and in its theology”. He assumes processes like deuterium decay always functioned as now, assumes light had to travel from distant stars (Pg 176) as opposed to beams having been created simultaneous with, or BEFORE (Gen 1:3) the stars (Gen 1:14). He fails to cite these arguments for a young earth fitting a Bible timeline:•	Ocean salinity and sediment deposits at river mouths are consistent with a young earth.•	The number of exploding star (supernova) remnants (SNRs) in all three stages is consistent with a 7000 year-young universe.•	Evidence that God did not create an embryonic universe, but a fully functioning interactive SYSTEM, manifests in plants that require creatures for pollination.•	Due to Barry Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy, the physical manifestation of Planck’s constant) The speed of light and electrons has decreased asymptotically since Creation. Light appears to have 30% faster in Jesus day, 400 times faster in Abraham’s day, and ten million times faster prior to 3,000BC.•	Speed of light may be increasing as it encounters less ZPE at the outer edges of space. Just as light speeds up after it emerges from water, allow me to speculate that the nature of light may be such (otherwise, what is the energy source?) that it goes at a fixed speed except while ZPE, water, atmosphere, and space dust etc. hinders.•	Electrons bouncing erratically off ZPE as they negotiate the ZPE hurdles on their orbital track, probably explains the “Uncertainty Principle” of quantum physics. Electrons are moving slower too. Calculations of age based on atomic decay need extreme revision.•	We are simply peering thru a longer taillight beam as the once-close stars travel away. The light appears redder because the lower-energy photons were redder, not a Doppler effect as suggested by Hubbel’s red-shift. We cannot observe light from outside the beam because it always heads directly toward us. The speed is relative to our own speed.When people study the Bible’s supernatural truths, fulfilled prophesies, structure, its heptadic code (7’s), and gematria (Jewish numbering) sufficiently to know that the Bible is, beyond doubt, directly from God, then their worldview is firmly rooted in truth. God’s account of how He created the universe, and us, is not an allegory as Collins maintains. Successful (real, true) science, like Bible study, is an attempt to know the mind of God.Science hinders itself with materialistic terms of engagement that stifle investigation. Our physics is likely only a shadow of a larger reality hinted at by mathematical postulations of additional dimensions we cannot yet comprehend. We should think of our material universe as a subset of a larger (supernatural) reality. Science thwarts progress by clinging to foolish atheistic traditions designed to deny the existence of God. Beware of OrthodoxyEducator John Taylor Gatto (author of Dumbing Us Down) told me schooling trains people to act like fish (swim in unison). Joe Bobier, inventor of Single-Cycle Modulation said “If I had been an electrical engineer, they would have convinced me this is not possible.” The reason breakthrough ideas are coming from sophomore high schoolers (Jack Andraka’s cancer detector, Simon Tsaoussis, two-transistor ternary RAM) is that they are not overly encumbered by orthodoxy. Revolutionary, disruptive, correct ideas encounter establishment ridicule as Dr. Robert O. Becker describes in his journey The Body Electric. Collins incorrectly struggles to conform to atheist/agnostic orthodoxy instead of standing firmly on God’s Word. I strongly urge him to revise this book."
223,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,4,"Francis Collins is a renowned scientist -- the former director of the Human Genome Project -- and also a Christian. In a time when science and faith can seem so diametrically opposed, it was encouraging to read one person's view of how he balances the two perspectives, and sees them as complementary rather than hostile to each other. I don't know how well this book will speak to all the different perspectives it could potentially be speaking to. I don't know whether an atheist or agnostic reader will be convinced or touched by the arguments and ideas presented here, since I am neither of those. It does cover quite a few topics -- from Collins' path to faith from his initial atheism; to a discussion of both scientific and faith-based approaches to worldviews, covering atheism, agnosticism, intelligent design, young-earth creationism, as well as theistic evolution, which he terms ""BioLogos""; as well as an overview of human DNA and what the Human Genome Project was aiming to accomplish; and an appendix devoted to bioethics, there was a lot to take in here (though I found it a relatively quick read).I think I was able to get the scientific gist of most of what he was writing about, since this was written for a layperson, but obviously there's a lot beneath the surface. I found the bits about the human genome most interesting. Faith-wise, numerous C.S. Lewis quotes will always draw me in, though I'm sure I'm not from the same ""bent"" of Christianity as Collins (though the same could be said for Lewis). But I valued the discussions of the various intersections of faith and science in regards to worldview (with an emphasis on origins).I don't agree with all of Collins' views here (though I can appreciate that we can still hold the same faith despite differences), and in many cases I don't even understand enough yet to know whether I agree or disagree. But I'm still grateful for his perspective, because it has helped me to clarify my thinking on some things, which includes some errors and inconsistencies in perspectives that I have held or entertained. I also appreciate him incorporating other thinkers (both scientists and theologians) into his arguments, because many quotes he uses are also interesting and make me want to learn more.I especially appreciate his call to not view God's Word and his creation as being ""at war with itself,"" as expressed in this quote that I think sums up his views nicely:“Will we turn our backs on science because it is perceived as a threat to God, abandoning all the promise of advancing our understanding of nature and applying that to the alleviation of suffering and the betterment of humankind? Alternatively, will we turn our backs on faith, concluding that science has rendered the spiritual life no longer necessary, and that traditional religious symbols can now be replaced by engravings of the double helix on our altars?Both of these choices are profoundly dangerous. Both deny truth. Both will diminish the nobility of humankind. Both will be devastating to our future. And both are unnecessary. The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. He can be worshipped in the cathedral or in the laboratory. His creation is majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful - and it cannot be at war with itself. Only we imperfect humans can start such battles. And only we can end them.”"
224,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66465627-adam-balshan,3,"3 stars [Humanism]Apologetics (vs. Atheism): 3.5. Science: 2 stars.Collins's book failed and succeeded. His first objective was to sieve Darwinian Evolution from atheism, on which he sold me. His second was to defend Theistic Evolution, in which he thoroughly failed. On the first matter, he created the best starting apologetic for scientific atheists that I've read. Collins was once an atheist. He took apart Dawkins. He glossed over true differences between DE and theology for the sake of (a false) harmony, but believably estranged DE and materialism. He seems to be a real Christian, however it is of course always hard to reliably tell. He professed belief and a relationship, which sounded genuine, but he kept referring to the value of other faith traditions, never called Jesus the only Way, and otherwise generally retreated to what sounded vaguely like a ""it works for me"" stance.On defending TE, he hung his cap on Darwinian Evolution. He erected a caricature of Young Earth Creationism and proceeded to beat the straw out of it. He didn't just oppose YEC and Intelligent Design, he called them untenable and impossible. His evidences were quite dated for 2006. Such faulty data that he determined to irrefutably support DE included: the DNA similarity between humans, chimps and mice; the immutability of isotopic dating and isotope half-lives (despite no evidence of universe conditions past 100 years ago or so); Occam's Razor; and the proposed reducible complexity of blood clots, flagella and the human eye (the former two of which were plausible, but not irrefutable). He got right the fact that scientific truth and spiritual truth cannot contradict, but he promoted the DE argument as overwhelming instead of its true, overwhelming ambiguity. He resembled Ptolemy, accepting the noticeable errors in satellite epicycles rather than telling the world that the earth revolves around the Sun, all for the sake of a contrived peace. His views have been thoroughly and convincingly refuted by the publications of Answers in Genesis, and plausibly so by Gerald Schroeder's creation-physics model (which reconciles YEC and OEC) in his book, The Science of God."
225,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6422812-hawley,4,"Only took me a whole semester to finish this book, oops! Still though, I thought Collins’s argument for theistic evolution was compelling. As a scientist and a person of faith, I’ve never seen incompatibility between the two domains, but haven’t been able to clearly articulate my beliefs as theistic evolution. I am deeply compelled by the Moral Law argument and this book helped to strengthen my beliefs. I found myself coming back to this book and Collins’s arguments frequently over the course of the semester in my Philosophy of Religion class. We didn’t talk about theistic evolution directly, but The Language of God supplemented a lot of my coursework well. I was less compelled by Collins’s arguments for Christianity in particular toward the end of the book, but I appreciate his insistence that faith is a personal journey we must all come to for ourselves. Overall, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to understand more about science, faith, and the relationship between the two. "
226,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7287572-grace,2,"A manifesto for theistic evolution.Every time I read one of these books I feel smacked around and uneasy. I read Darwin's Black Box and felt compelled by Behe's explanations. I was similarly compelled by Collins's dismantling of Behe, though. What all of this comes down to is that I am a layman having to trust whoever writes these books to tell me what they wish, leave out & skip over what they wish, and interpret everything for me. The only solution is to go back to school for my own PhD in biology, I guess. Honestly, though, I would skip reading this book. If you want the good faith parts just read Mere Christianity or better yet C. S. Lewis's entire bibliography. If you want the good science parts, just read any mainstream college molecular biology textbook, or whatever the latest Richard Dawkins book is."
227,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57363039-emily-monroe,5,"For someone familiar with both Christianity and science, this is a great summary type of read that seeks to reconcile what many sources today tout as unreconcilable. Collins provides brief backgrounds on both apologetics (belief) and genetics (science). If a reader is not familiar with either of those topics, this book is not a good introduction. As a believer with a science and engineering background, I enjoyed learning his perspective. Collins is frank in stating that young earth creationism is a dangerous concept, and he gave language and examples to support it. He is also frank in saying that science does not and cannot explain everything about our existence and the meaning of life. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and took a lot away from it that I will use in conversations with both believers and non-believers."
228,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23188545-josh,4,"More and more,if you are willing to open your eyes, you will be confronted with those who have differing views and beliefs than your own. The temptation is great to simply dismiss any idea or worldview that seems contrary to the one you already hold. My brother characterizes, and to a degree caricatures, the typical Christian response to contrary ideas as that of a petulant child putting his fingers in his ears and repeating, “I CAN'T HEAR YOU” to drown out the sound of anything that might question what is held so dearly.As a Christian,who deals with many Christians, it is hard to not acquiesce to his diagnosis. So often, those who should be genuinely searching out truth wherever it lies (seeing as how all truth is God's truth) will allow ourselves to remain ignorant out of fear that our beliefs will come crashing down and our God with them. If this fear is not present,then the possibility of ever having to admit some degree of error in our interpretation of the Bible or of the world or of our self is more than our pride can stand.Labels abound. If you believe in health care for all or government based social services then you are a “communist”. If you believe that some of the Bible is not to be taken literally, you're a “liberal” who does not believe the Bible. If you preach grace you are “antinomian” and if you preach responsibility and fidelity, you are a “legalist”. The word “heretic” gets thrown around on anyone not conforming to “the Bible” which would be more accurately and honesty communicated as “my interpretation of the Bible”.All these labels do in most cases is perpetuate ignorance and division, making it more convenient and efficient for us as we sit in God's seat of judgment on any who might not submit themselves to what we “know” as truth. Enter Francis Collins. Talk about a guy getting it from all angles. Collins was the head of the Human Genome Project, the scientific research to map out the human genome. The work done under his leadership has led to us have a genetic map of human beings. The benefit of this in the war against disease and defect is incapable of being overstated. The work God has done through this man and his leadership is amazing.And therein lies the reason he receives such criticism. Collins, a biologist, stood in the Oval Office with then President Clinton and nodded approvingly when President Clinton remarked that we could now see the “language of God” used in creation. How a professional biologist could hold to an “inherently unscientific” belief in God and approve of such theistic speak offended many in the biological community. That a committed Christian could believed in the “inherently atheistic” doctrine of evolution, offended many in the Christian community.That is the backdrop for the book, The Language of God by Francis Collins. Collins work is one part biography, one part scientific treatise and one part apologetic. Collins spends time going over his life, and his own path from atheism, to agnosticism, and finally to his firm belief in the theism of Biblical Christianity. The biographical aspects of the book are all centered on how he has related his lifelong love of science with his lifelong struggle with faith,and it is quite engrossing. Even as the biographical aspects of the book focus on Collins' own personal path, the way he presents it is overtly apologetic. He constantly goes over how he was convinced of the truth of theism and eventually the Christian truth claim, not simply recounting the fact that he was convinced. The way the apologetic is intertwined with the biographical narrative reminds one of reading C.S. Lewis when he deals with the same subject. Based on the references to and quotes from Lewis, this may not have been intentional but certainly it is without shock that some of Lewis' writing style was adopted by Collins.The apologetic nature of the book is not limited solely to a defense of the Christian faith. The idea of this book is how to rectify a belief in current scientific trends and the Christian faith. In doing so, Collins argues that Darwinian Evolution is true and that it is NOT contrary to the Christian faith. With so much teaching for and evidence of evolution, Collins' devotes a chapter to each of the possible responses to evolution. These chapters are Atheism and Agnosticism (When Science Trumps Faith), Creationism (When Faith Trumps Science), Intelligent Design (When Science Needs Divine Help),and BioLogos (Faith and Science in Harmony). Collins is basically fair in his assessment of the opposing views, but throughout the chapters it is clear that he is building to what he holds as truth by dismantling what he holds as false(or even silly). Collins closes with pleas to believers to not abandon science and scientists to not abandon faith.As I read the book I had to remind myself that Collins is not a theologian, he is a biologist. His interpretation of some Christian doctrines is off what he seems to hold as essential is debated amongst Christians. Some of the history he cites is incorrect and the citations could have been more thorough, especially on some instances where no citation was given. Also, there were times where Collins began speaking exclusively to his peers, losing the reader with limited scientific knowledge in the process.While this book is far from perfect, it is a great read. It would benefit anyone involved in the evolution debate(that would be anyone who has any religious, secular or scientific interest....everyone) to read this book and consider the arguments made and data presented"
229,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58566782-shane-allen,5,"A must read for those who love science and Jesus Christ. Of course the author of science is compatible with the science He created. It’s hard to believe this is still or has ever been an issue. However, it’s definitely worth the read just to hear his perspective on evolution. I’m not quite sold on the science but he is very persuasive. I’ve been reading both sides of the theistic evolution-intelligent design debate for a while now and I’m not convinced humans have fully learned enough yet to die on any hill. One thing is for certain– Francis Collins truly loves Jesus and it grieves me when Christians attack each other over non-essential doctrines not explicit in the Bible. Remember, we are all bothers and sisters in Christ. "

This book details out the driving questioning skepticism of science, details some of the journey of the DNA discoveries, and some of the probable limits of 'designer DNA'. It raises questions, but importantly, it defines what science can and cannot discover and why faith and science are not in conflict. For me, it helped clarify issues surrounding stem cell research, some things regarding evolution, and other hotbed controversial issues without me feeling like I had to 'check my faith in God' at the door in order to engage in the things this scientist was saying. It was a breath of fresh air. "

For information on the Atheist Christian Book Club you can go to the website at http://atheistchristianbookclub.com/ or seek us out on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/AtheistChris... .CHAPTER 1: FROM ATHEISM TO BELIEFCollins says that for him agnosticism was a place of retreat where he wouldn’t actually have to seriously consider the evidence for or against belief. That is obviously not true of those in this book group, but do you think it is generally true for most agnostics? Is agnosticism a position that is held in order to avoid the question of God’s existence altogether?Collins writes that the Moral Law was the primary thing that made him reconsider his atheism. What about those in our book group. Is there a “one thing” that creates cognitive dissonance and makes the atheists in the group pause to reconsider?CHAPTER 2: THE WAR OF THE WORLDVIEWSA similar question for the Christians; is there a question that makes you uncomfortable with your faith? Collins talks about four questions that he struggled with during the early days of his newfound belief. Is there a question like that that makes the Christians in the group sometimes doubt? If not currently, was there a question you struggled with at some time in your life?Collins lists four difficult questions that he struggled with as a new believer; (1) Isn’t the idea of God just wish-fulfillment?, (2) What about all the harm done in the name of religion?, (3) Why would a loving God allow suffering in the world?, and (4) How can a rational person believe in miracles? Were you satisfied with the answers Collins has arrived at and shares here?CHAPTER 3: THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSECollins writes, “Immanuel Kant wrote: ""Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the Moral Law within."" I have heard some former atheist/agnostics similarly indicate that these two things, nature and the moral law, seemed to be ever present in the back of their mind/heart as an indication that there had to be something more than just the material even when they were most intellectually opposed to the idea of God. I’m curious if those two concerns have any influence on the atheists/agnostics in our book group?Collins writes, “Based on these and other observations, physicists are in agreement that the universe began as an infinitely dense, dimensionless point of pure energy. The laws of physics breakdown in this circumstance, referred to as a ""singularity."" Is there the same kind of unanimity among the members of this book group as there seems to be among physicists? Collins seems to think that the question of origins hinges upon the question “What happened before the Big Bang?” Would the book club members agree?Collins' timeline (number of years) differs from some of the Christians in the room. For those who hold to a young earth theory of creation, how important do you think it is to adhere to a “thousands of years” formula instead of a “millions or billions of years” formula?The question of old earth vs. young earth is primarily a discussion held within the camp of Christianity. However, how does it affect those of you who are atheistic/agnostic?Collins writes of the Anthropic Principle, that “The existence of a universe as we know it rests upon a knife edge of improbability.” (page 73) This same fine-tuning argument also had an influence on the author of a previous book we read, Anthony Flew. The author gives three possibilities; (1) an infinite number of universes, (2) we are just very, very lucky, or (3) The precise tuning of all of the physical constants and physical laws to make intelligent life possible is not an accident, but reflects the action of the one who created the universe in the first place. What do you think?Collins quotes a number of famous scientists who believe that “""It would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun in just this way, except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us."" (pages 75ff). Do you think that Stephen Hawking, Freeman Dyson, Arno Penzias and other such scientists (such as Collins, himself) forfeit their scientific bona fides by taking such a position?The author claims that “there is nothing inherently in conflict between the idea of a creator God and what science has revealed.” Do you agree or disagree with him? Why? (page 81) The author further claims that “the opening words of Genesis (""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"") are entirely compatible with the Big Bang.” Do you agree or disagree with him? (pages 82-83)CHAPTER 4: LIFE ON EARTH – OF MICROBES AND MENCollins says that “no serious scientist would currently claim that a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life is at hand” but warns Christians not to result to a God of the gaps apologetic. He encourages them to adopt an approach using “positive reasons, based on knowledge, rather than default assumptions based on (a temporary) lack of knowledge.” However, for those of you who are atheists, does “the inability of modern science to develop a statistically probable mechanism” for the origin of life give you any intellectual pause? (pages 92-93)Collins writes, “No serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life. In fact, the relatedness of all species through the mechanism of evolution is such a profound foundation for the understanding of all biology that it is difficult to imagine how one would study life without it.” Is this true? Are there no serious biologists that doubt the theory of evolution? Is Collins being fair to those who disagree with him on this matter? (page 99)CHAPTER 5: DECIPHERING GOD’S INSTRUCTION BOOK – THE LESSONS OF THE HUMAN GENOMECollins asserts that the difference between macroevolution and microevolution is “increasingly seen to be artificial. But then to illustrate it is a distinction without a difference he uses the example of a stickleback fish with armor becoming a stickleback fish without armor. I think most critics of Darwinism would find this example not to be compelling. A fish becomes a fish. A virus becomes a slightly different virus. How is this evidence for the “tree of life”? Was his example sufficient for you to think that the distinction between macroevolution and microevolution is “arbitrary”? (pages 131-132)In reference to similarities between human and mouse genomes, Collins writes, “This evidence alone does not, of course, prove a common ancestor; from a creationist perspective, such similarities could simply demonstrate that God used successful design principles over and over again. As we shall see, however, and as was foreshadowed above by the discussion of ""silent"" mutations in protein-coding regions, the detailed study of genomes has rendered that interpretation virtually untenable—not only about all other living things, but also about ourselves.” Do you think that the evidence provided by Collins actually supports his claim that it is untenable to believe that God used successful design principles over and over again? (pages 133-137)Does Collins provide compelling evidence from genetic similarities to prove that humans and other life forms have a common ancestor? (pages 137- 142)CHAPTER 6: GENESIS, GALILEO, AND DARWINCollins writes about the emotional distance between Christian believers who are adherents of Darwinism and those who reject this biological theory. What do you think about this? Is it difficult for these to “sides” to coexist in theological harmony? (pages 145-147)CHAPTER 7: OPTION 1 – ATHEISM AND AGNOSTICISM (WHEN SCIENCE TRUMPS FAITH)Collins writes about the hostility between some believers and unbelievers. How common is this? Why do you think this is so? (pages 159ff)The author of our book quotes Dawkins as saying, “""It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus, 'mad cow' disease, and many others, but I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.” Do the atheists in our group believe that faith is evil? (page 163)Collins quotes Stephen Jay Gould as saying that since “Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny” the existence of God. Do you agree with Gould? (page 166)The author refers to four different groups:1. Strong Atheists = have a firm conviction that no deities exist.2. Weak Atheism = the absence of belief in the existence of a God or gods3. Strong Agnostics = believes there is no way that human kind will “ever” know if there is a God4. Weak Atheists = believes only that it is not possible to know “yet” whether or not there is a GodWhat is the composition of atheists/agnostics in our group in regard to these four descriptions?CHAPTER 8: OPTION 2 - CREATIONISM (WHEN FAITH TRUMPS SCIENCE)Does Collins accurately reflect the beliefs of most Young Earth Creationists when he claims that they believe in Microevolution, which he defines as small changes within a species, but do not believe in Macroevolution, which he describes as one species evolving into another species? Many of the young earth creationists that I know are much more flexible with the definition of Microevolution, and define it as changing from one genus, or one order, into another genus or order. (page 172) Does this matter, or is this a distinction without a difference?Is Collins being a bit hysterical when he declares that should YEC scientific claims be true then, “it would lead to a complete and irreversible collapse of the sciences of physics, chemistry, cosmology, geology, and biology.”? (page 174) He makes it sound down right apocalyptic; are YEC that dangerous?CHAPTER 9: OPTION 3 – INTELLIGENT DESIGN (WHEN SCIENCE NEEDS DIVINE HELP)Collins asserts that if the logic of Intelligent Design “truly had merit on scientific grounds, one would expect that the rank and file of working biologists would also show interest in pursuing these ideas, especially since a significant number of biologists are also believers.” (page 187) However, haven’t historians of science like Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) written that just the opposite is true? Does not history tell us that science that none of the revolutionary paradigmatic changes that science has undergone were quickly accepted on the basis of reason/evidence alone? Is head-counting an appropriate way to determine truth?Collins claims that ID is a God of the gaps theory and that science is busily filling in those gaps with things other than God, and thus the theory is collapsing. If so, what then happens with faith? (page 195)CHAPTER 10: BIOLOGOS (SCIENCE AND FAITH IN HARMONY)Within Christianity there is frequently contentious debates among believers about what is the right approach/beliefs regarding creation. How do those of you who are atheists react when you witness such debates?Collins points out that BioLogos is not a scientific theory? (page 204) Does that seem like a copout for a group of scientists to be organizing around a non-scientific theory?CHAPTER 11: TRUTH SEEKERSCollins tells his conversion story in the final chapter. We have on several occasions honestly discussed the question, “What would it take for you to become a person of faith?” and “What would it take for you to become a disbeliever?” Has this book modified your answers to these questions?One of the previous books we discussed was written by the world’s leading intellectual atheist and documented his conversion to theism. This book was written by the person who may be the world’s leading medical geneticist and why he is a Christian. Has the stature of these two authors provoked any intellectual movement from those of you who are atheists?DID ANYONE HAVE A CHANGE OF OPINION (ABOUT ANYTHING) AS A RESULT OF READING THIS BOOK? HAS ANYONE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE YEAR WE HAVE SPENT READING AND DISCUSSING TOGETHER?Supplementary note: Several of the atheistic authors we have read in our book group have indicated that all inerrantists believe in a young earth. This is not true. For a survey of the different viewpoints of inerrantists you can read the following short article: https://www.christianpost.com/news/do..."

There is little ""evidence for belief"" here, and I think most people who have seriously engaged with the god question will have already encountered the main arguments elsewhere.That being said, it was an enjoyable read and I came away with renewed respect for Dr. Collins and his work. Even though his attempt at reconciling the scientific and religious worldviews was ultimately unconvincing for me, he comes across as one of the most intellectually honest and sincere Christian thinkers I've encountered on this topic."

243,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43496878-chris-woody,4,"When I was a student small group leader a few years ago, I had a group of abnormally inquisitive middle schoolers. One day, one of them asked about how we as Christians should look at ""cavemen,"" and, though I don't remember what all was said from there, I know that I mentioned it is okay for Christians to accept evolution. Of course, this didn't sit well with one of my other, well-meaning students, who had never been exposed to such an idea. Even when I said that C.S. Lewis might have accepted the possibility of evolution, his response was ""No, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure he was a Christian."" This all ended with me having to have a chat with the youth pastor to ensure that I wasn't saying anything heretical. All of this is to say that, as a Christian who sees the theory of evolution as compatible with belief, I've found myself in some trouble with my church over these views.This question has been one that I've been mulling over for years: How can Christians accept the evidence that we evolved over millions of years without also saying that we don't take the sanctity of Scripture seriously. I think that Francis Collins, a world-renowned geneticist and devout believer, does a pretty good job of this. He lays out a pretty good argument that science can actually enhance our ability to appreciate God's creation, not jeopardize it. He also does a good job of arguing against both atheism and strict creationism, both of which exist on the far ends of the spectrum when it comes to the ""science-faith"" debate. I think that a lot of believers would do well to read this book and find that it is okay to trust science and still believe in a loving God. Had I read this before, I would have been able to recommend it to my student, as I'm sure Collins can articulate things and explain complex scientific concepts far better than I can."
244,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121586-aaron-barnhart,3,"Our Sunday School class has been reading this clear, concise defense of Christian faith from an evangelical and one of the country's leading geneticists. Collins is controversial with his fellow evangelicals because he argues that evolution is an accepted scientific method, and he is controversial among atheists and skeptics because he asserts that God is both the loving creator of the universe and a being who exists beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. He is, essentially, C.S. Lewis brought into the 21st century — and I say that as someone who is well aware of Lewis's literary reputation. Collins is a highly readable author, and his informal, avuncular prose is arguably more accessible to Christians today than the somewhat outdated and dense argumentation of ""Mere Christianity.""That said, I find The Language of God unsatisfying because it is largely a guide to fellow evangelicals on how to defend their faith against the atheistic meanies of the scientific world like Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. Such people, and we can throw Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens in there while we're at it, are no threat to Christianity because they comprise such a small part of the population. (Harris's argument that Collins should not have been appointed the head of the National Institutes of Health because of his Christian views is a case in point. Collins has no controversial scientific views that I know of, and he is, like most taxpayers, a professed Christian.) Many, if not most, American Christians, however, are neither evangelicals of the Collins stripe nor fundamentalist six-day creationist types (the other group this book takes aim at). Many Christians are members of non-evangelical churches who take their values to their workplace and households without a lot of fanfare or ""God talk."" Another emerging group is Gen-Y evangelicals, who grew up in these churches but disdain their parents' conservative politics and are ready to rethink what it is to be a Christian in the secular society. To me, a major challenge facing Christianity is how to coax these two sets of believers back into the public square, where their moderating influence and quiet moral strength would really come in handy right about now. With his evangelical zeal and quick answers to every problem, Collins strikes me as too much like the nut cases he claims to oppose — people whose minds are made up and aren't interested in real discussion. The Language of God may appear to be at first on the side of such reasonable people, but in the end it offers them surprisingly little help, unless they happen to go to a church much like the one Collins attends."
245,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5292677-al-datum,5,"There are a few claims made by atheists on a regular basis. They include the following:- Only the uneducated become Christians. Truly educated people, especially scientists, would never accept such nonsense- The only reason people are Christians is that they were raised to believe as they doThis book is proof that these two claims are simply nonsense. Francis Collins was an atheist prior to his scientific work on the human genome project. His career has been stellar (he led the Human Genome Project and is currently the director of the National Institutes of Health). He is a leading scientist, and certainly qualifies as a truly educated person. He was also not a Christian his entire life.Collins became a Christian when he began to look at the complexity of the human genome. As he recounts in this book, he was simply unable to remain an atheist since his scientific findings led him to the inescapable conclusion of design and a transcendent designer (this same argument has persuaded many atheists, by the way...check out Antony Flew's conversion. Or Alister McGrath. Or John Polkinghorne. Or Frank Tipler...I could go on).In this book, Collins describes his journey and shows why he came to the conclusion that God exists. He makes the case that was persuasive to him, and also builds the case that evolution and Christianity are not mutually exclusive (in fact, as philosopher William Lane Craig has said, the existence of evolution in such a short span of time [speaking of the length of time our planet has existed] would itself be a miracle, and thus proof of God).Collins does a good job of showing that science and Christianity are not enemies, but partners in the quest for truth (Christianity is, after all, largely responsible for Western Science getting its start). He shows the reasonableness of being both a leading scientist and a believer. And he destroys the two claims I listed at the beginning of this review. Not only is it possible for highly educated scientists to be raised as non-believers only to be converted to Christianity when confronted with the evidence. But Dr. Collins is living proof of this fact.Pick this book up if you'd like to read Dr. Collins' story. It's a very interesting one. And if you're open to following the evidence where it leads, it provides a persuasive case that the evidence leads directly to the existence of an all-powerful creator and designer.One other thing...if you're looking for a good, quick overview of Bayes Theorem, this book has a nice treatment of it that anyone can understand.Simply put...atheism is wrong. The evidence is inescapable."
246,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1225279-clint,3,"3.0 - In this book Collins explains how he harmonizes his belief in God with his understanding of evolution and other scientific processes involved in the creation of our universe. While I don't agree with every conclusion that Collins reaches, his honest and reasonable approach make this a very interesting book. He does a good job of giving a broad-brush description of the major scientific theories involved (big bang and evolution) and evidence for them. His explanations of DNA, how it's used, and how it provides further evidence of evolutionary processes was particularly interesting. I felt his establishment of evolution as truth was a little lacking, as there were a few evolutionary question marks that weren't acknowledged, or weren't addressed as thoroughly as I'd have liked. His arguments in favor of God were based primarily on the philosophical ideas of Moral Law and universal longing for God as presented by C. S. Lewis. While he touched on some physical evidences of a Creator, such as the beautiful mathematical connection with nature and its laws, based on the title I was expecting more. Just as his establishment of evolution was lacking, I found his establishment of God also lacking. He proclaimed Moral Law as his most convincing evidence, yet failed to really establish any sort of spiritual-based evidence. I realize that spiritual evidence is subjective and it deals more on a personal level, but isn't that how it should be? Faith is a personal decision, salvation is a personal issue, our relationship with God is personal, so the spiritual evidence for him should be personal. The bottom line of the book though was that science and faith can and should happily coexist. Truth should be in harmony with truth. Science cannot prove nor disprove the existance and role of a Creator, all it can do is shed light on how the creations behave. "
247,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"Dr. Collins articulates the two sides of the argument (faith v. science) well - and then demonstrates how the argument really shouldn't exist at all as both faith and science are involved in the search for Truth, albeit with different tools and methods. Nothing spectacularly new, in fact he leans heavily on others' words, notably C.S. Lewis, but also many others from Copernicus to Augustine to generally good effect. Hard to judge how convincing he was since I already agreed with most of his premises and assertions.Brief, helpful review of biological reproduction of DNA was clearly explained without either condescending to the reader or assuming the reader remembered every detail from Biology 101.For more book reviews, visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."
248,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312471-karen-l,3,"I liked this book but I did not love it. Why? Well, I have to say that as other critics of this book have noted, he does quote Lewis a little too much. I love C. S. Lewis and agreed with the author on many points yet I would have rather had him quote a little more of a variety of influences.Still, I did find his stories interesting and his ability to make science accessible to the non science layman very helpful. The book contains a lot of good information and most definitely could boost the faith of someone who is a doubter."

I expected a philosophical treatise but received a shallow description of one man's career and how he came to assume a life of faith. While there might be a place for this sort of literature, it was not what I was looking for. I clearly was not a member of the target audience."
250,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,4,I saw this author one afternoon on the Beeb and checked out his book from the library. I have always been disgusted with the fundamentalist belief that it is either science or faith. This book is a wonderful statement for the idea that science is evidence of God in action. I really enjoyed this book. It even re-awakened a sense of faith that the Bush administration had nearly destroyed.
251,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29591849-elinor,3,"This was pretty great. Relied heavily on CS Lewis for the apologetics, but gave a lot of interesting insight on the biology/science side of things."
252,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62738513-richard-webb,2,"Devoted to reconciling Judeo-Christians and evolutionists. Misses many opportunities to do so. As a renowned geneticist and leader of the Human Genome Project, reputed to be the greatest achievement of our generation, Collins team completed the first-draft mapping of the 3 billion gene sequences in DNA in 2000, and now heads the National Institutes of Health.As a Christian, Collins proposes that faith in God and faith in science can coexist and be harmonious saying, ‘We have caught the first glimpse of our instruction book, previously known only to God”.Collins boldly challenges his Darwinian colleagues: “So those who choose to be atheists must find some other basis for taking that position, evolution won’t do.” (Pg 167), and “agnosticism also runs the risk of being a cop-out,” (Pg 168). Further, he notes that distinguished agnostics who took time to consider the evidence “unexpectedly converted themselves” (Pg 168). Perhaps he wrote this book to those folks. But instead of reconciling atheistic/agnostic science to God’s Word in the Bible, Collins attempts to push the Bible toward today’s tenuous tenets of science. He first tries to build bridges to atheists by recounting common misconceptions about the Salem Witch Trials, the Crusades, and the underlying beliefs of fundamentally violent Islam; leading him to unjustified self-criticisms of Christianity (Pg 41). However, unexpurgated history shows witch trials ended because two Christian preachers objected to the execution of 20 Salem witches, ending the murder of tens of thousands in Europe. The Crusades were a last-option response to Moslems terrorizing Europe – a resurrected scourge that we must again excise as our Founders did in the 1780’s.Outside His FieldAs a Biblical apologist, Collins writes outside his field of expertise, borrowing credibility from his reputation as an eminent scientist. His discussion of suffering (Pg 43) fails to understand that all good flows from God’s highest value - LOVE Mark 12:30-31, requiring totally free will, and the inseparable freedom to not love. Love cannot be compelled (logically, anything less than totally free-will regarding an all-powerful God could easily be coercion, which God sedulously avoids). Logically then, the failure to choose love begets all evil and suffering. Should God have restrained free-will in order to prevent evil behavior? Logically, He cannot.Additionally, Collins misunderstanding the concept of dominion from Psalm 115:16 and Psalm 8:6, and how Adam ceded to satan the dominion given to Adam in Genesis 1:28, hinders Collins analysis of suffering and evil. Satan now exercises that dominion. Luke 4:6 and 2Cor 4:4 But Jesus gave us, His followers, the power to defeat satan James 4:7, John 4:4, Matt 10:8 if we will “be transformed by the renewing of [our] mind” Rom 12:2 and use that power.Collins also misunderstands (Pg 44-45), that miracles are intended to routinely follow believers: “These signs will follow those who believe” Mark 16:17 and “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out demons.” Matt 10:8 “These things you have seen me do, you will also do, and greater works than these…” John 14:12-14, and “God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders…” Heb 2:4. Perhaps a more Pentecostal understanding of believer’s authority in Eph 1:19-20 and Mark 16:17 would be helpful to him.Big BangCollins assertion that Big Bang is “well described and unlikely to be revised” is hubristic and inconsistent with history. Collins’ Big-Bang endorsement (Pg 68) fails to mention serious doubts raised by observations of counter-rotating galaxies, stars moving toward us, and quantized red-shift. Dissenting scientists question why supposedly “old” supernova exploding stars have projected materials such short distances when an old universe theory would predict extremely long distances. His assumption of a 14 billion universe age (Pg 64) ignores Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy) and radically faster speed of light at creation that promises to someday fit paleontology within the Biblical framework. Collins warns against literal interpretation of the Bible (Pg 83), but science, as an attempt to know the mind of God, would proceed more rapidly if a Biblical view of Origin informed astronomy, physics, biology, etc. Instead, atheists waste billions of taxpayer-funded research dollars constructing fairy-tales to “prove” God does not exist. “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” Rom 1:22 In contrast to Sir Isaac Newton and William Maury who researched scripture to launch their scientific inquiry, Einstein, Hawking, and many others initially presupposed a naturalistic origin and as evidence mounted, got dragged into reluctant recognition of a Creator. Biogenesis Perhaps as a professional courtesy, but with absolutely no evidence, Collins PRESUMES (Pg 89) that dirt assembled ITSELF into DNA digital code, acquired the capability of information storage, and differentiated into multiple “kinds”. We’ve not seen such baseless backward extrapolation since Darwin, in his book of speculative conjecture published without corroborating data, presumed that adaptation explains origin. Science predicated itself on the foundational principle that there is God’s discoverable order in the universe - down to the structure of sub-atomic particles. Order sans intelligence is logically impossible! Yet scientists thrill at each new fairy-tale atheistic deception, and deem anything plausible when multiplied by millions of years. Possibly the Rosetta Stone was formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion (wink).  Collins draws no clear distinction between ADAPTATATION (micro-evolution) and ORIGIN (macro-evolution).Collins says random assembly of molecules may have occurred. He tries to torpedo the entropy argument against biogenesis (the fairy-tale that chemistry begat biology vs. the truth that everything degrades) with an analogy that ignores the essential element of purpose-driven order, plus sustainability, and replication (Pg. 92). Molecules bumping into molecules, like people in a crowd, does not infer or confer a relationship, or transfer properties, or create order. There is no reason for the new combination to persist, incorporate, amalgamate, congregate, consolidate, or replicate.He allows that God could have created the first DNA, but offers no rationale for why God would have stopped with one or a few samples, and thus enjoy the fun of creating diversity. He warns against a “God of the Gaps” (Pg 93) but fails to acknowledge the eventual overturning of nearly every contravening “scientific” presumption, hypothesis, and theory to date. Instead of asking, “How did God do this?” the world supports vain imaginations (hubristic fairy-tales) that eventually fail. Contrast this with the greatest physicist/mathmetician ever, Sir Isaac Newton’s 1704 manuscript describing his quest to extract scientific information from the Bible. Newton’s Laws of Motion and Gravity have withstood the test of time. Perhaps there is a correlation between seeking God and finding truth.Collins warns against betting on a literal Genesis occurrence, then he ventures into paleontology dogma (Pg 93), failing to include recent creationist evidence that disputes long-held scientific beliefs. Neither does he proffer any evidence for the claim that extinct ”kinds” are the missing transitional forms.Self-DevelopmentCollins introduces Darwin’s assertion (which he ultimately adopts) that God may have “created a few original forms capable of self-development” (Pg 98). Biologists mis-use anthropomorphic terms like “strategy” saying that bugs develop a strategy to overcome pesticides. Ridiculous! If self-development is possible, the most intelligent of all God’s creation would have, by now, a bigger penis! Kindly pardon this graphic illustration needed to dramatize my point.Emulating Darwin, Collins takes pains to point out possible harmonious interpretations, but instead of accepting the Bible as true, and reconciling the current nascent state of struggling science with it, Collins incorrectly proclaims that “no serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life” (Pg 99). He should visit Institute for Creation Research or Answers in Genesis or Creation.com to be enlightened by an ever-growing body of scientists whose compelling evidence refutes his assertion. My own feeble survey of the beauty and apparently gratuitous diversity of amazing fish (28,000 species) is sufficient to understand that God intended to give a glimpse of his power, magnificence, and divinity thru our observation of what He made. Romans 1:20.AdaptationCollins cites adaptations in stickleback fish, malaria, HIV, and flu as examples of evolution (Pg 132), but each degraded mutation is just a variant of itself, an adaptation. The flu virus is still a flu virus; it does not morph into an HIV virus or a new disease, or new “kind”. Even purposeful (with intelligence) attempts to modify fruitfly genes over thousands of generations only result in mutant fruitflies, some with wings sticking out of their heads.His refutation of Special Creation’s “Ex Nihilo Species” (Pg 137) is feeble in that he illogically ignores God’s prerogative to re-use successful patterns. Why should God start anew with each “kind” He created? The Bible repeatedly says“after his kind” (e.g. Gen 1:24 Webster’s version is the most grammatically correct) which reinforces that God created multiple kinds of plants and animals. One can only imagine how much fun God must have had with the variations.DNAIt appears that DNA is comprised of error-correcting code like a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). If a piece is lost or corrupted, the piece can be reconstructed by referencing the other pieces. The math and logic needed to accomplish this feat was developed in computers long before it was recognized in DNA. Neither happened without intelligent design!Normally I would avoid criticism tangential to this distinguished scientist’s area of expertise, but Collins makes a special point of calling caspace-12 a “nonfunctional gene” (Pg 139) to argue against Special Creation.Certainly, it is illogical to presume that God would design a gene with 45% flotsam and jetsam (Pg 136). Having been a computer programmer I visualize genes as analogous to a computer memory-dump in which data and instructions mix within the hexadecimal strings. I remember it was frequently easier to spot data (analogous to GAA and GAG recipe for glutamic acid) than to identify instructions within the memory dump. Doesn’t it make sense to pursue an inquiry into what Collins dismissively calls Ancient Repetitive Elements (AREs) as possible instructions governing the GAA and GAG? I could find nowhere that this cellular biology expert presents the fact that DNA requires 75 proteins to exist, but proteins require DNA for construction. Using this undeniable fact, he could have made a much stronger case for God.Young EarthCollins attacks Young Earth creationists (Pg 172-179) saying “Young Earth creationism has reached a point of intellectual bankruptcy, both in its science and in its theology”. He assumes processes like deuterium decay always functioned as now, assumes light had to travel from distant stars (Pg 176) as opposed to beams having been created simultaneous with, or BEFORE (Gen 1:3) the stars (Gen 1:14). He fails to cite these arguments for a young earth fitting a Bible timeline:•	Ocean salinity and sediment deposits at river mouths are consistent with a young earth.•	The number of exploding star (supernova) remnants (SNRs) in all three stages is consistent with a 7000 year-young universe.•	Evidence that God did not create an embryonic universe, but a fully functioning interactive SYSTEM, manifests in plants that require creatures for pollination.•	Due to Barry Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy, the physical manifestation of Planck’s constant) The speed of light and electrons has decreased asymptotically since Creation. Light appears to have 30% faster in Jesus day, 400 times faster in Abraham’s day, and ten million times faster prior to 3,000BC.•	Speed of light may be increasing as it encounters less ZPE at the outer edges of space. Just as light speeds up after it emerges from water, allow me to speculate that the nature of light may be such (otherwise, what is the energy source?) that it goes at a fixed speed except while ZPE, water, atmosphere, and space dust etc. hinders.•	Electrons bouncing erratically off ZPE as they negotiate the ZPE hurdles on their orbital track, probably explains the “Uncertainty Principle” of quantum physics. Electrons are moving slower too. Calculations of age based on atomic decay need extreme revision.•	We are simply peering thru a longer taillight beam as the once-close stars travel away. The light appears redder because the lower-energy photons were redder, not a Doppler effect as suggested by Hubbel’s red-shift. We cannot observe light from outside the beam because it always heads directly toward us. The speed is relative to our own speed.When people study the Bible’s supernatural truths, fulfilled prophesies, structure, its heptadic code (7’s), and gematria (Jewish numbering) sufficiently to know that the Bible is, beyond doubt, directly from God, then their worldview is firmly rooted in truth. God’s account of how He created the universe, and us, is not an allegory as Collins maintains. Successful (real, true) science, like Bible study, is an attempt to know the mind of God.Science hinders itself with materialistic terms of engagement that stifle investigation. Our physics is likely only a shadow of a larger reality hinted at by mathematical postulations of additional dimensions we cannot yet comprehend. We should think of our material universe as a subset of a larger (supernatural) reality. Science thwarts progress by clinging to foolish atheistic traditions designed to deny the existence of God. Beware of OrthodoxyEducator John Taylor Gatto (author of Dumbing Us Down) told me schooling trains people to act like fish (swim in unison). Joe Bobier, inventor of Single-Cycle Modulation said “If I had been an electrical engineer, they would have convinced me this is not possible.” The reason breakthrough ideas are coming from sophomore high schoolers (Jack Andraka’s cancer detector, Simon Tsaoussis, two-transistor ternary RAM) is that they are not overly encumbered by orthodoxy. Revolutionary, disruptive, correct ideas encounter establishment ridicule as Dr. Robert O. Becker describes in his journey The Body Electric. Collins incorrectly struggles to conform to atheist/agnostic orthodoxy instead of standing firmly on God’s Word. I strongly urge him to revise this book."
253,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,4,"Francis Collins is a renowned scientist -- the former director of the Human Genome Project -- and also a Christian. In a time when science and faith can seem so diametrically opposed, it was encouraging to read one person's view of how he balances the two perspectives, and sees them as complementary rather than hostile to each other. I don't know how well this book will speak to all the different perspectives it could potentially be speaking to. I don't know whether an atheist or agnostic reader will be convinced or touched by the arguments and ideas presented here, since I am neither of those. It does cover quite a few topics -- from Collins' path to faith from his initial atheism; to a discussion of both scientific and faith-based approaches to worldviews, covering atheism, agnosticism, intelligent design, young-earth creationism, as well as theistic evolution, which he terms ""BioLogos""; as well as an overview of human DNA and what the Human Genome Project was aiming to accomplish; and an appendix devoted to bioethics, there was a lot to take in here (though I found it a relatively quick read).I think I was able to get the scientific gist of most of what he was writing about, since this was written for a layperson, but obviously there's a lot beneath the surface. I found the bits about the human genome most interesting. Faith-wise, numerous C.S. Lewis quotes will always draw me in, though I'm sure I'm not from the same ""bent"" of Christianity as Collins (though the same could be said for Lewis). But I valued the discussions of the various intersections of faith and science in regards to worldview (with an emphasis on origins).I don't agree with all of Collins' views here (though I can appreciate that we can still hold the same faith despite differences), and in many cases I don't even understand enough yet to know whether I agree or disagree. But I'm still grateful for his perspective, because it has helped me to clarify my thinking on some things, which includes some errors and inconsistencies in perspectives that I have held or entertained. I also appreciate him incorporating other thinkers (both scientists and theologians) into his arguments, because many quotes he uses are also interesting and make me want to learn more.I especially appreciate his call to not view God's Word and his creation as being ""at war with itself,"" as expressed in this quote that I think sums up his views nicely:“Will we turn our backs on science because it is perceived as a threat to God, abandoning all the promise of advancing our understanding of nature and applying that to the alleviation of suffering and the betterment of humankind? Alternatively, will we turn our backs on faith, concluding that science has rendered the spiritual life no longer necessary, and that traditional religious symbols can now be replaced by engravings of the double helix on our altars?Both of these choices are profoundly dangerous. Both deny truth. Both will diminish the nobility of humankind. Both will be devastating to our future. And both are unnecessary. The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. He can be worshipped in the cathedral or in the laboratory. His creation is majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful - and it cannot be at war with itself. Only we imperfect humans can start such battles. And only we can end them.”"

His first objective was to sieve Darwinian Evolution from atheism, on which he sold me. His second was to defend Theistic Evolution, in which he thoroughly failed. On the first matter, he created the best starting apologetic for scientific atheists that I've read. Collins was once an atheist. He took apart Dawkins. He glossed over true differences between DE and theology for the sake of (a false) harmony, but believably estranged DE and materialism. He seems to be a real Christian, however it is of course always hard to reliably tell. He professed belief and a relationship, which sounded genuine, but he kept referring to the value of other faith traditions, never called Jesus the only Way, and otherwise generally retreated to what sounded vaguely like a ""it works for me"" stance.On defending TE, he hung his cap on Darwinian Evolution. He erected a caricature of Young Earth Creationism and proceeded to beat the straw out of it. He didn't just oppose YEC and Intelligent Design, he called them untenable and impossible. His evidences were quite dated for 2006. Such faulty data that he determined to irrefutably support DE included: the DNA similarity between humans, chimps and mice; the immutability of isotopic dating and isotope half-lives (despite no evidence of universe conditions past 100 years ago or so); Occam's Razor; and the proposed reducible complexity of blood clots, flagella and the human eye (the former two of which were plausible, but not irrefutable). He got right the fact that scientific truth and spiritual truth cannot contradict, but he promoted the DE argument as overwhelming instead of its true, overwhelming ambiguity. He resembled Ptolemy, accepting the noticeable errors in satellite epicycles rather than telling the world that the earth revolves around the Sun, all for the sake of a contrived peace. His views have been thoroughly and convincingly refuted by the publications of Answers in Genesis, and plausibly so by Gerald Schroeder's creation-physics model (which reconciles YEC and OEC) in his book, The Science of God."
255,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6422812-hawley,4,"Only took me a whole semester to finish this book, oops! Still though, I thought Collins’s argument for theistic evolution was compelling. As a scientist and a person of faith, I’ve never seen incompatibility between the two domains, but haven’t been able to clearly articulate my beliefs as theistic evolution. I am deeply compelled by the Moral Law argument and this book helped to strengthen my beliefs. I found myself coming back to this book and Collins’s arguments frequently over the course of the semester in my Philosophy of Religion class. We didn’t talk about theistic evolution directly, but The Language of God supplemented a lot of my coursework well. I was less compelled by Collins’s arguments for Christianity in particular toward the end of the book, but I appreciate his insistence that faith is a personal journey we must all come to for ourselves. Overall, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to understand more about science, faith, and the relationship between the two. "
256,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7287572-grace,2,"A manifesto for theistic evolution.Every time I read one of these books I feel smacked around and uneasy. I read Darwin's Black Box and felt compelled by Behe's explanations. I was similarly compelled by Collins's dismantling of Behe, though. What all of this comes down to is that I am a layman having to trust whoever writes these books to tell me what they wish, leave out & skip over what they wish, and interpret everything for me. The only solution is to go back to school for my own PhD in biology, I guess. Honestly, though, I would skip reading this book. If you want the good faith parts just read Mere Christianity or better yet C. S. Lewis's entire bibliography. If you want the good science parts, just read any mainstream college molecular biology textbook, or whatever the latest Richard Dawkins book is."
257,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57363039-emily-monroe,5,"For someone familiar with both Christianity and science, this is a great summary type of read that seeks to reconcile what many sources today tout as unreconcilable. Collins provides brief backgrounds on both apologetics (belief) and genetics (science). If a reader is not familiar with either of those topics, this book is not a good introduction. As a believer with a science and engineering background, I enjoyed learning his perspective. Collins is frank in stating that young earth creationism is a dangerous concept, and he gave language and examples to support it. He is also frank in saying that science does not and cannot explain everything about our existence and the meaning of life. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and took a lot away from it that I will use in conversations with both believers and non-believers."
258,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23188545-josh,4,"More and more,if you are willing to open your eyes, you will be confronted with those who have differing views and beliefs than your own. The temptation is great to simply dismiss any idea or worldview that seems contrary to the one you already hold. My brother characterizes, and to a degree caricatures, the typical Christian response to contrary ideas as that of a petulant child putting his fingers in his ears and repeating, “I CAN'T HEAR YOU” to drown out the sound of anything that might question what is held so dearly.As a Christian,who deals with many Christians, it is hard to not acquiesce to his diagnosis. So often, those who should be genuinely searching out truth wherever it lies (seeing as how all truth is God's truth) will allow ourselves to remain ignorant out of fear that our beliefs will come crashing down and our God with them. If this fear is not present,then the possibility of ever having to admit some degree of error in our interpretation of the Bible or of the world or of our self is more than our pride can stand.Labels abound. If you believe in health care for all or government based social services then you are a “communist”. If you believe that some of the Bible is not to be taken literally, you're a “liberal” who does not believe the Bible. If you preach grace you are “antinomian” and if you preach responsibility and fidelity, you are a “legalist”. The word “heretic” gets thrown around on anyone not conforming to “the Bible” which would be more accurately and honesty communicated as “my interpretation of the Bible”.All these labels do in most cases is perpetuate ignorance and division, making it more convenient and efficient for us as we sit in God's seat of judgment on any who might not submit themselves to what we “know” as truth. Enter Francis Collins. Talk about a guy getting it from all angles. Collins was the head of the Human Genome Project, the scientific research to map out the human genome. The work done under his leadership has led to us have a genetic map of human beings. The benefit of this in the war against disease and defect is incapable of being overstated. The work God has done through this man and his leadership is amazing.And therein lies the reason he receives such criticism. Collins, a biologist, stood in the Oval Office with then President Clinton and nodded approvingly when President Clinton remarked that we could now see the “language of God” used in creation. How a professional biologist could hold to an “inherently unscientific” belief in God and approve of such theistic speak offended many in the biological community. That a committed Christian could believed in the “inherently atheistic” doctrine of evolution, offended many in the Christian community.That is the backdrop for the book, The Language of God by Francis Collins. Collins work is one part biography, one part scientific treatise and one part apologetic. Collins spends time going over his life, and his own path from atheism, to agnosticism, and finally to his firm belief in the theism of Biblical Christianity. The biographical aspects of the book are all centered on how he has related his lifelong love of science with his lifelong struggle with faith,and it is quite engrossing. Even as the biographical aspects of the book focus on Collins' own personal path, the way he presents it is overtly apologetic. He constantly goes over how he was convinced of the truth of theism and eventually the Christian truth claim, not simply recounting the fact that he was convinced. The way the apologetic is intertwined with the biographical narrative reminds one of reading C.S. Lewis when he deals with the same subject. Based on the references to and quotes from Lewis, this may not have been intentional but certainly it is without shock that some of Lewis' writing style was adopted by Collins.The apologetic nature of the book is not limited solely to a defense of the Christian faith. The idea of this book is how to rectify a belief in current scientific trends and the Christian faith. In doing so, Collins argues that Darwinian Evolution is true and that it is NOT contrary to the Christian faith. With so much teaching for and evidence of evolution, Collins' devotes a chapter to each of the possible responses to evolution. These chapters are Atheism and Agnosticism (When Science Trumps Faith), Creationism (When Faith Trumps Science), Intelligent Design (When Science Needs Divine Help),and BioLogos (Faith and Science in Harmony). Collins is basically fair in his assessment of the opposing views, but throughout the chapters it is clear that he is building to what he holds as truth by dismantling what he holds as false(or even silly). Collins closes with pleas to believers to not abandon science and scientists to not abandon faith.As I read the book I had to remind myself that Collins is not a theologian, he is a biologist. His interpretation of some Christian doctrines is off what he seems to hold as essential is debated amongst Christians. Some of the history he cites is incorrect and the citations could have been more thorough, especially on some instances where no citation was given. Also, there were times where Collins began speaking exclusively to his peers, losing the reader with limited scientific knowledge in the process.While this book is far from perfect, it is a great read. It would benefit anyone involved in the evolution debate(that would be anyone who has any religious, secular or scientific interest....everyone) to read this book and consider the arguments made and data presented"
259,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58566782-shane-allen,5,"A must read for those who love science and Jesus Christ. Of course the author of science is compatible with the science He created. It’s hard to believe this is still or has ever been an issue. However, it’s definitely worth the read just to hear his perspective on evolution. I’m not quite sold on the science but he is very persuasive. I’ve been reading both sides of the theistic evolution-intelligent design debate for a while now and I’m not convinced humans have fully learned enough yet to die on any hill. One thing is for certain– Francis Collins truly loves Jesus and it grieves me when Christians attack each other over non-essential doctrines not explicit in the Bible. Remember, we are all bothers and sisters in Christ. "

This book details out the driving questioning skepticism of science, details some of the journey of the DNA discoveries, and some of the probable limits of 'designer DNA'. It raises questions, but importantly, it defines what science can and cannot discover and why faith and science are not in conflict. For me, it helped clarify issues surrounding stem cell research, some things regarding evolution, and other hotbed controversial issues without me feeling like I had to 'check my faith in God' at the door in order to engage in the things this scientist was saying.

270,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32254765-kevin-stilley,3,"The following are discussion questions for ""The Language of God"" that I created for the monthly meeting of of the Atheist Christian Book Club. For information on the Atheist Christian Book Club you can go to the website at http://atheistchristianbookclub.com/ or seek us out on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/AtheistChris... .CHAPTER 1: FROM ATHEISM TO BELIEFCollins says that for him agnosticism was a place of retreat where he wouldn’t actually have to seriously consider the evidence for or against belief. That is obviously not true of those in this book group, but do you think it is generally true for most agnostics? Is agnosticism a position that is held in order to avoid the question of God’s existence altogether?Collins writes that the Moral Law was the primary thing that made him reconsider his atheism. What about those in our book group. Is there a “one thing” that creates cognitive dissonance and makes the atheists in the group pause to reconsider?CHAPTER 2: THE WAR OF THE WORLDVIEWSA similar question for the Christians; is there a question that makes you uncomfortable with your faith? Collins talks about four questions that he struggled with during the early days of his newfound belief. Is there a question like that that makes the Christians in the group sometimes doubt? If not currently, was there a question you struggled with at some time in your life?Collins lists four difficult questions that he struggled with as a new believer; (1) Isn’t the idea of God just wish-fulfillment?, (2) What about all the harm done in the name of religion?, (3) Why would a loving God allow suffering in the world?, and (4) How can a rational person believe in miracles? Were you satisfied with the answers Collins has arrived at and shares here?CHAPTER 3: THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSECollins writes, “Immanuel Kant wrote: ""Two things fill me with constantly increasing admiration and awe, the longer and more earnestly I reflect on them: the starry heavens without and the Moral Law within."" I have heard some former atheist/agnostics similarly indicate that these two things, nature and the moral law, seemed to be ever present in the back of their mind/heart as an indication that there had to be something more than just the material even when they were most intellectually opposed to the idea of God. I’m curious if those two concerns have any influence on the atheists/agnostics in our book group?Collins writes, “Based on these and other observations, physicists are in agreement that the universe began as an infinitely dense, dimensionless point of pure energy. The laws of physics breakdown in this circumstance, referred to as a ""singularity."" Is there the same kind of unanimity among the members of this book group as there seems to be among physicists? Collins seems to think that the question of origins hinges upon the question “What happened before the Big Bang?” Would the book club members agree?Collins' timeline (number of years) differs from some of the Christians in the room. For those who hold to a young earth theory of creation, how important do you think it is to adhere to a “thousands of years” formula instead of a “millions or billions of years” formula?The question of old earth vs. young earth is primarily a discussion held within the camp of Christianity. However, how does it affect those of you who are atheistic/agnostic?Collins writes of the Anthropic Principle, that “The existence of a universe as we know it rests upon a knife edge of improbability.” (page 73) This same fine-tuning argument also had an influence on the author of a previous book we read, Anthony Flew. The author gives three possibilities; (1) an infinite number of universes, (2) we are just very, very lucky, or (3) The precise tuning of all of the physical constants and physical laws to make intelligent life possible is not an accident, but reflects the action of the one who created the universe in the first place. What do you think?Collins quotes a number of famous scientists who believe that “""It would be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun in just this way, except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us."" (pages 75ff). Do you think that Stephen Hawking, Freeman Dyson, Arno Penzias and other such scientists (such as Collins, himself) forfeit their scientific bona fides by taking such a position?The author claims that “there is nothing inherently in conflict between the idea of a creator God and what science has revealed.” Do you agree or disagree with him? Why? (page 81) The author further claims that “the opening words of Genesis (""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth"") are entirely compatible with the Big Bang.” Do you agree or disagree with him? (pages 82-83)CHAPTER 4: LIFE ON EARTH – OF MICROBES AND MENCollins says that “no serious scientist would currently claim that a naturalistic explanation for the origin of life is at hand” but warns Christians not to result to a God of the gaps apologetic. He encourages them to adopt an approach using “positive reasons, based on knowledge, rather than default assumptions based on (a temporary) lack of knowledge.” However, for those of you who are atheists, does “the inability of modern science to develop a statistically probable mechanism” for the origin of life give you any intellectual pause? (pages 92-93)Collins writes, “No serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life. In fact, the relatedness of all species through the mechanism of evolution is such a profound foundation for the understanding of all biology that it is difficult to imagine how one would study life without it.” Is this true? Are there no serious biologists that doubt the theory of evolution? Is Collins being fair to those who disagree with him on this matter? (page 99)CHAPTER 5: DECIPHERING GOD’S INSTRUCTION BOOK – THE LESSONS OF THE HUMAN GENOMECollins asserts that the difference between macroevolution and microevolution is “increasingly seen to be artificial. But then to illustrate it is a distinction without a difference he uses the example of a stickleback fish with armor becoming a stickleback fish without armor. I think most critics of Darwinism would find this example not to be compelling. A fish becomes a fish. A virus becomes a slightly different virus. How is this evidence for the “tree of life”? Was his example sufficient for you to think that the distinction between macroevolution and microevolution is “arbitrary”? (pages 131-132)In reference to similarities between human and mouse genomes, Collins writes, “This evidence alone does not, of course, prove a common ancestor; from a creationist perspective, such similarities could simply demonstrate that God used successful design principles over and over again. As we shall see, however, and as was foreshadowed above by the discussion of ""silent"" mutations in protein-coding regions, the detailed study of genomes has rendered that interpretation virtually untenable—not only about all other living things, but also about ourselves.” Do you think that the evidence provided by Collins actually supports his claim that it is untenable to believe that God used successful design principles over and over again? (pages 133-137)Does Collins provide compelling evidence from genetic similarities to prove that humans and other life forms have a common ancestor? (pages 137- 142)CHAPTER 6: GENESIS, GALILEO, AND DARWINCollins writes about the emotional distance between Christian believers who are adherents of Darwinism and those who reject this biological theory. What do you think about this? Is it difficult for these to “sides” to coexist in theological harmony? (pages 145-147)CHAPTER 7: OPTION 1 – ATHEISM AND AGNOSTICISM (WHEN SCIENCE TRUMPS FAITH)Collins writes about the hostility between some believers and unbelievers. How common is this? Why do you think this is so? (pages 159ff)The author of our book quotes Dawkins as saying, “""It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by the AIDS virus, 'mad cow' disease, and many others, but I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.” Do the atheists in our group believe that faith is evil? (page 163)Collins quotes Stephen Jay Gould as saying that since “Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny” the existence of God. Do you agree with Gould? (page 166)The author refers to four different groups:1. Strong Atheists = have a firm conviction that no deities exist.2. Weak Atheism = the absence of belief in the existence of a God or gods3. Strong Agnostics = believes there is no way that human kind will “ever” know if there is a God4. Weak Atheists = believes only that it is not possible to know “yet” whether or not there is a GodWhat is the composition of atheists/agnostics in our group in regard to these four descriptions?CHAPTER 8: OPTION 2 - CREATIONISM (WHEN FAITH TRUMPS SCIENCE)Does Collins accurately reflect the beliefs of most Young Earth Creationists when he claims that they believe in Microevolution, which he defines as small changes within a species, but do not believe in Macroevolution, which he describes as one species evolving into another species? Many of the young earth creationists that I know are much more flexible with the definition of Microevolution, and define it as changing from one genus, or one order, into another genus or order. (page 172) Does this matter, or is this a distinction without a difference?Is Collins being a bit hysterical when he declares that should YEC scientific claims be true then, “it would lead to a complete and irreversible collapse of the sciences of physics, chemistry, cosmology, geology, and biology.”? (page 174) He makes it sound down right apocalyptic; are YEC that dangerous?CHAPTER 9: OPTION 3 – INTELLIGENT DESIGN (WHEN SCIENCE NEEDS DIVINE HELP)Collins asserts that if the logic of Intelligent Design “truly had merit on scientific grounds, one would expect that the rank and file of working biologists would also show interest in pursuing these ideas, especially since a significant number of biologists are also believers.” (page 187) However, haven’t historians of science like Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) written that just the opposite is true? Does not history tell us that science that none of the revolutionary paradigmatic changes that science has undergone were quickly accepted on the basis of reason/evidence alone? Is head-counting an appropriate way to determine truth?Collins claims that ID is a God of the gaps theory and that science is busily filling in those gaps with things other than God, and thus the theory is collapsing. If so, what then happens with faith? (page 195)CHAPTER 10: BIOLOGOS (SCIENCE AND FAITH IN HARMONY)Within Christianity there is frequently contentious debates among believers about what is the right approach/beliefs regarding creation. How do those of you who are atheists react when you witness such debates?Collins points out that BioLogos is not a scientific theory? (page 204) Does that seem like a copout for a group of scientists to be organizing around a non-scientific theory?CHAPTER 11: TRUTH SEEKERSCollins tells his conversion story in the final chapter. We have on several occasions honestly discussed the question, “What would it take for you to become a person of faith?” and “What would it take for you to become a disbeliever?” Has this book modified your answers to these questions?One of the previous books we discussed was written by the world’s leading intellectual atheist and documented his conversion to theism. This book was written by the person who may be the world’s leading medical geneticist and why he is a Christian. Has the stature of these two authors provoked any intellectual movement from those of you who are atheists?DID ANYONE HAVE A CHANGE OF OPINION (ABOUT ANYTHING) AS A RESULT OF READING THIS BOOK? HAS ANYONE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THE YEAR WE HAVE SPENT READING AND DISCUSSING TOGETHER?Supplementary note: Several of the atheistic authors we have read in our book group have indicated that all inerrantists believe in a young earth. This is not true. For a survey of the different viewpoints of inerrantists you can read the following short article: https://www.christianpost.com/news/do..."

There is little ""evidence for belief"" here, and I think most people who have seriously engaged with the god question will have already encountered the main arguments elsewhere.That being said, it was an enjoyable read and I came away with renewed respect for Dr. Collins and his work. Even though his attempt at reconciling the scientific and religious worldviews was ultimately unconvincing for me, he comes across as one of the most intellectually honest and sincere Christian thinkers I've encountered on this topic."

273,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43496878-chris-woody,4,"When I was a student small group leader a few years ago, I had a group of abnormally inquisitive middle schoolers. One day, one of them asked about how we as Christians should look at ""cavemen,"" and, though I don't remember what all was said from there, I know that I mentioned it is okay for Christians to accept evolution. Of course, this didn't sit well with one of my other, well-meaning students, who had never been exposed to such an idea. Even when I said that C.S. Lewis might have accepted the possibility of evolution, his response was ""No, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure he was a Christian."" This all ended with me having to have a chat with the youth pastor to ensure that I wasn't saying anything heretical. All of this is to say that, as a Christian who sees the theory of evolution as compatible with belief, I've found myself in some trouble with my church over these views.This question has been one that I've been mulling over for years: How can Christians accept the evidence that we evolved over millions of years without also saying that we don't take the sanctity of Scripture seriously. I think that Francis Collins, a world-renowned geneticist and devout believer, does a pretty good job of this. He lays out a pretty good argument that science can actually enhance our ability to appreciate God's creation, not jeopardize it. He also does a good job of arguing against both atheism and strict creationism, both of which exist on the far ends of the spectrum when it comes to the ""science-faith"" debate. I think that a lot of believers would do well to read this book and find that it is okay to trust science and still believe in a loving God. Had I read this before, I would have been able to recommend it to my student, as I'm sure Collins can articulate things and explain complex scientific concepts far better than I can."
274,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121586-aaron-barnhart,3,"Our Sunday School class has been reading this clear, concise defense of Christian faith from an evangelical and one of the country's leading geneticists. Collins is controversial with his fellow evangelicals because he argues that evolution is an accepted scientific method, and he is controversial among atheists and skeptics because he asserts that God is both the loving creator of the universe and a being who exists beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. He is, essentially, C.S. Lewis brought into the 21st century — and I say that as someone who is well aware of Lewis's literary reputation. Collins is a highly readable author, and his informal, avuncular prose is arguably more accessible to Christians today than the somewhat outdated and dense argumentation of ""Mere Christianity.""That said, I find The Language of God unsatisfying because it is largely a guide to fellow evangelicals on how to defend their faith against the atheistic meanies of the scientific world like Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. Such people, and we can throw Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens in there while we're at it, are no threat to Christianity because they comprise such a small part of the population. (Harris's argument that Collins should not have been appointed the head of the National Institutes of Health because of his Christian views is a case in point. Collins has no controversial scientific views that I know of, and he is, like most taxpayers, a professed Christian.) Many, if not most, American Christians, however, are neither evangelicals of the Collins stripe nor fundamentalist six-day creationist types (the other group this book takes aim at). Many Christians are members of non-evangelical churches who take their values to their workplace and households without a lot of fanfare or ""God talk."" Another emerging group is Gen-Y evangelicals, who grew up in these churches but disdain their parents' conservative politics and are ready to rethink what it is to be a Christian in the secular society. To me, a major challenge facing Christianity is how to coax these two sets of believers back into the public square, where their moderating influence and quiet moral strength would really come in handy right about now. With his evangelical zeal and quick answers to every problem, Collins strikes me as too much like the nut cases he claims to oppose — people whose minds are made up and aren't interested in real discussion. The Language of God may appear to be at first on the side of such reasonable people, but in the end it offers them surprisingly little help, unless they happen to go to a church much like the one Collins attends."
275,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5292677-al-datum,5,"There are a few claims made by atheists on a regular basis. They include the following:- Only the uneducated become Christians. Truly educated people, especially scientists, would never accept such nonsense- The only reason people are Christians is that they were raised to believe as they doThis book is proof that these two claims are simply nonsense. Francis Collins was an atheist prior to his scientific work on the human genome project. His career has been stellar (he led the Human Genome Project and is currently the director of the National Institutes of Health). He is a leading scientist, and certainly qualifies as a truly educated person. He was also not a Christian his entire life.Collins became a Christian when he began to look at the complexity of the human genome. As he recounts in this book, he was simply unable to remain an atheist since his scientific findings led him to the inescapable conclusion of design and a transcendent designer (this same argument has persuaded many atheists, by the way...check out Antony Flew's conversion. Or Alister McGrath. Or John Polkinghorne. Or Frank Tipler...I could go on).In this book, Collins describes his journey and shows why he came to the conclusion that God exists. He makes the case that was persuasive to him, and also builds the case that evolution and Christianity are not mutually exclusive (in fact, as philosopher William Lane Craig has said, the existence of evolution in such a short span of time [speaking of the length of time our planet has existed] would itself be a miracle, and thus proof of God).Collins does a good job of showing that science and Christianity are not enemies, but partners in the quest for truth (Christianity is, after all, largely responsible for Western Science getting its start). He shows the reasonableness of being both a leading scientist and a believer. And he destroys the two claims I listed at the beginning of this review. Not only is it possible for highly educated scientists to be raised as non-believers only to be converted to Christianity when confronted with the evidence. But Dr. Collins is living proof of this fact.Pick this book up if you'd like to read Dr. Collins' story. It's a very interesting one. And if you're open to following the evidence where it leads, it provides a persuasive case that the evidence leads directly to the existence of an all-powerful creator and designer.One other thing...if you're looking for a good, quick overview of Bayes Theorem, this book has a nice treatment of it that anyone can understand.Simply put...atheism is wrong. The evidence is inescapable."
276,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1225279-clint,3,"3.0 - In this book Collins explains how he harmonizes his belief in God with his understanding of evolution and other scientific processes involved in the creation of our universe. While I don't agree with every conclusion that Collins reaches, his honest and reasonable approach make this a very interesting book. He does a good job of giving a broad-brush description of the major scientific theories involved (big bang and evolution) and evidence for them. His explanations of DNA, how it's used, and how it provides further evidence of evolutionary processes was particularly interesting. I felt his establishment of evolution as truth was a little lacking, as there were a few evolutionary question marks that weren't acknowledged, or weren't addressed as thoroughly as I'd have liked. His arguments in favor of God were based primarily on the philosophical ideas of Moral Law and universal longing for God as presented by C. S. Lewis. While he touched on some physical evidences of a Creator, such as the beautiful mathematical connection with nature and its laws, based on the title I was expecting more. Just as his establishment of evolution was lacking, I found his establishment of God also lacking. He proclaimed Moral Law as his most convincing evidence, yet failed to really establish any sort of spiritual-based evidence. I realize that spiritual evidence is subjective and it deals more on a personal level, but isn't that how it should be? Faith is a personal decision, salvation is a personal issue, our relationship with God is personal, so the spiritual evidence for him should be personal. The bottom line of the book though was that science and faith can and should happily coexist. Truth should be in harmony with truth. Science cannot prove nor disprove the existance and role of a Creator, all it can do is shed light on how the creations behave. "
277,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"Dr. Collins articulates the two sides of the argument (faith v. science) well - and then demonstrates how the argument really shouldn't exist at all as both faith and science are involved in the search for Truth, albeit with different tools and methods. Nothing spectacularly new, in fact he leans heavily on others' words, notably C.S. Lewis, but also many others from Copernicus to Augustine to generally good effect. Hard to judge how convincing he was since I already agreed with most of his premises and assertions.Brief, helpful review of biological reproduction of DNA was clearly explained without either condescending to the reader or assuming the reader remembered every detail from Biology 101.For more book reviews, visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."
278,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312471-karen-l,3,"I liked this book but I did not love it. Why? Well, I have to say that as other critics of this book have noted, he does quote Lewis a little too much. I love C. S. Lewis and agreed with the author on many points yet I would have rather had him quote a little more of a variety of influences.Still, I did find his stories interesting and his ability to make science accessible to the non science layman very helpful. The book contains a lot of good information and most definitely could boost the faith of someone who is a doubter."

I expected a philosophical treatise but received a shallow description of one man's career and how he came to assume a life of faith. While there might be a place for this sort of literature, it was not what I was looking for. I clearly was not a member of the target audience."
280,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten,4,I saw this author one afternoon on the Beeb and checked out his book from the library. I have always been disgusted with the fundamentalist belief that it is either science or faith. This book is a wonderful statement for the idea that science is evidence of God in action. I really enjoyed this book. It even re-awakened a sense of faith that the Bush administration had nearly destroyed.
281,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29591849-elinor,3,"This was pretty great. Relied heavily on CS Lewis for the apologetics, but gave a lot of interesting insight on the biology/science side of things."
282,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62738513-richard-webb,2,"Devoted to reconciling Judeo-Christians and evolutionists. Misses many opportunities to do so. As a renowned geneticist and leader of the Human Genome Project, reputed to be the greatest achievement of our generation, Collins team completed the first-draft mapping of the 3 billion gene sequences in DNA in 2000, and now heads the National Institutes of Health.As a Christian, Collins proposes that faith in God and faith in science can coexist and be harmonious saying, ‘We have caught the first glimpse of our instruction book, previously known only to God”.Collins boldly challenges his Darwinian colleagues: “So those who choose to be atheists must find some other basis for taking that position, evolution won’t do.” (Pg 167), and “agnosticism also runs the risk of being a cop-out,” (Pg 168). Further, he notes that distinguished agnostics who took time to consider the evidence “unexpectedly converted themselves” (Pg 168). Perhaps he wrote this book to those folks. But instead of reconciling atheistic/agnostic science to God’s Word in the Bible, Collins attempts to push the Bible toward today’s tenuous tenets of science. He first tries to build bridges to atheists by recounting common misconceptions about the Salem Witch Trials, the Crusades, and the underlying beliefs of fundamentally violent Islam; leading him to unjustified self-criticisms of Christianity (Pg 41). However, unexpurgated history shows witch trials ended because two Christian preachers objected to the execution of 20 Salem witches, ending the murder of tens of thousands in Europe. The Crusades were a last-option response to Moslems terrorizing Europe – a resurrected scourge that we must again excise as our Founders did in the 1780’s.Outside His FieldAs a Biblical apologist, Collins writes outside his field of expertise, borrowing credibility from his reputation as an eminent scientist. His discussion of suffering (Pg 43) fails to understand that all good flows from God’s highest value - LOVE Mark 12:30-31, requiring totally free will, and the inseparable freedom to not love. Love cannot be compelled (logically, anything less than totally free-will regarding an all-powerful God could easily be coercion, which God sedulously avoids). Logically then, the failure to choose love begets all evil and suffering. Should God have restrained free-will in order to prevent evil behavior? Logically, He cannot.Additionally, Collins misunderstanding the concept of dominion from Psalm 115:16 and Psalm 8:6, and how Adam ceded to satan the dominion given to Adam in Genesis 1:28, hinders Collins analysis of suffering and evil. Satan now exercises that dominion. Luke 4:6 and 2Cor 4:4 But Jesus gave us, His followers, the power to defeat satan James 4:7, John 4:4, Matt 10:8 if we will “be transformed by the renewing of [our] mind” Rom 12:2 and use that power.Collins also misunderstands (Pg 44-45), that miracles are intended to routinely follow believers: “These signs will follow those who believe” Mark 16:17 and “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out demons.” Matt 10:8 “These things you have seen me do, you will also do, and greater works than these…” John 14:12-14, and “God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders…” Heb 2:4. Perhaps a more Pentecostal understanding of believer’s authority in Eph 1:19-20 and Mark 16:17 would be helpful to him.Big BangCollins assertion that Big Bang is “well described and unlikely to be revised” is hubristic and inconsistent with history. Collins’ Big-Bang endorsement (Pg 68) fails to mention serious doubts raised by observations of counter-rotating galaxies, stars moving toward us, and quantized red-shift. Dissenting scientists question why supposedly “old” supernova exploding stars have projected materials such short distances when an old universe theory would predict extremely long distances. His assumption of a 14 billion universe age (Pg 64) ignores Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy) and radically faster speed of light at creation that promises to someday fit paleontology within the Biblical framework. Collins warns against literal interpretation of the Bible (Pg 83), but science, as an attempt to know the mind of God, would proceed more rapidly if a Biblical view of Origin informed astronomy, physics, biology, etc. Instead, atheists waste billions of taxpayer-funded research dollars constructing fairy-tales to “prove” God does not exist. “Professing to be wise, they became fools.” Rom 1:22 In contrast to Sir Isaac Newton and William Maury who researched scripture to launch their scientific inquiry, Einstein, Hawking, and many others initially presupposed a naturalistic origin and as evidence mounted, got dragged into reluctant recognition of a Creator. Biogenesis Perhaps as a professional courtesy, but with absolutely no evidence, Collins PRESUMES (Pg 89) that dirt assembled ITSELF into DNA digital code, acquired the capability of information storage, and differentiated into multiple “kinds”. We’ve not seen such baseless backward extrapolation since Darwin, in his book of speculative conjecture published without corroborating data, presumed that adaptation explains origin. Science predicated itself on the foundational principle that there is God’s discoverable order in the universe - down to the structure of sub-atomic particles. Order sans intelligence is logically impossible! Yet scientists thrill at each new fairy-tale atheistic deception, and deem anything plausible when multiplied by millions of years. Possibly the Rosetta Stone was formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion (wink).  Collins draws no clear distinction between ADAPTATATION (micro-evolution) and ORIGIN (macro-evolution).Collins says random assembly of molecules may have occurred. He tries to torpedo the entropy argument against biogenesis (the fairy-tale that chemistry begat biology vs. the truth that everything degrades) with an analogy that ignores the essential element of purpose-driven order, plus sustainability, and replication (Pg. 92). Molecules bumping into molecules, like people in a crowd, does not infer or confer a relationship, or transfer properties, or create order. There is no reason for the new combination to persist, incorporate, amalgamate, congregate, consolidate, or replicate.He allows that God could have created the first DNA, but offers no rationale for why God would have stopped with one or a few samples, and thus enjoy the fun of creating diversity. He warns against a “God of the Gaps” (Pg 93) but fails to acknowledge the eventual overturning of nearly every contravening “scientific” presumption, hypothesis, and theory to date. Instead of asking, “How did God do this?” the world supports vain imaginations (hubristic fairy-tales) that eventually fail. Contrast this with the greatest physicist/mathmetician ever, Sir Isaac Newton’s 1704 manuscript describing his quest to extract scientific information from the Bible. Newton’s Laws of Motion and Gravity have withstood the test of time. Perhaps there is a correlation between seeking God and finding truth.Collins warns against betting on a literal Genesis occurrence, then he ventures into paleontology dogma (Pg 93), failing to include recent creationist evidence that disputes long-held scientific beliefs. Neither does he proffer any evidence for the claim that extinct ”kinds” are the missing transitional forms.Self-DevelopmentCollins introduces Darwin’s assertion (which he ultimately adopts) that God may have “created a few original forms capable of self-development” (Pg 98). Biologists mis-use anthropomorphic terms like “strategy” saying that bugs develop a strategy to overcome pesticides. Ridiculous! If self-development is possible, the most intelligent of all God’s creation would have, by now, a bigger penis! Kindly pardon this graphic illustration needed to dramatize my point.Emulating Darwin, Collins takes pains to point out possible harmonious interpretations, but instead of accepting the Bible as true, and reconciling the current nascent state of struggling science with it, Collins incorrectly proclaims that “no serious biologist today doubts the theory of evolution to explain the marvelous complexity and diversity of life” (Pg 99). He should visit Institute for Creation Research or Answers in Genesis or Creation.com to be enlightened by an ever-growing body of scientists whose compelling evidence refutes his assertion. My own feeble survey of the beauty and apparently gratuitous diversity of amazing fish (28,000 species) is sufficient to understand that God intended to give a glimpse of his power, magnificence, and divinity thru our observation of what He made. Romans 1:20.AdaptationCollins cites adaptations in stickleback fish, malaria, HIV, and flu as examples of evolution (Pg 132), but each degraded mutation is just a variant of itself, an adaptation. The flu virus is still a flu virus; it does not morph into an HIV virus or a new disease, or new “kind”. Even purposeful (with intelligence) attempts to modify fruitfly genes over thousands of generations only result in mutant fruitflies, some with wings sticking out of their heads.His refutation of Special Creation’s “Ex Nihilo Species” (Pg 137) is feeble in that he illogically ignores God’s prerogative to re-use successful patterns. Why should God start anew with each “kind” He created? The Bible repeatedly says“after his kind” (e.g. Gen 1:24 Webster’s version is the most grammatically correct) which reinforces that God created multiple kinds of plants and animals. One can only imagine how much fun God must have had with the variations.DNAIt appears that DNA is comprised of error-correcting code like a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). If a piece is lost or corrupted, the piece can be reconstructed by referencing the other pieces. The math and logic needed to accomplish this feat was developed in computers long before it was recognized in DNA. Neither happened without intelligent design!Normally I would avoid criticism tangential to this distinguished scientist’s area of expertise, but Collins makes a special point of calling caspace-12 a “nonfunctional gene” (Pg 139) to argue against Special Creation.Certainly, it is illogical to presume that God would design a gene with 45% flotsam and jetsam (Pg 136). Having been a computer programmer I visualize genes as analogous to a computer memory-dump in which data and instructions mix within the hexadecimal strings. I remember it was frequently easier to spot data (analogous to GAA and GAG recipe for glutamic acid) than to identify instructions within the memory dump. Doesn’t it make sense to pursue an inquiry into what Collins dismissively calls Ancient Repetitive Elements (AREs) as possible instructions governing the GAA and GAG? I could find nowhere that this cellular biology expert presents the fact that DNA requires 75 proteins to exist, but proteins require DNA for construction. Using this undeniable fact, he could have made a much stronger case for God.Young EarthCollins attacks Young Earth creationists (Pg 172-179) saying “Young Earth creationism has reached a point of intellectual bankruptcy, both in its science and in its theology”. He assumes processes like deuterium decay always functioned as now, assumes light had to travel from distant stars (Pg 176) as opposed to beams having been created simultaneous with, or BEFORE (Gen 1:3) the stars (Gen 1:14). He fails to cite these arguments for a young earth fitting a Bible timeline:•	Ocean salinity and sediment deposits at river mouths are consistent with a young earth.•	The number of exploding star (supernova) remnants (SNRs) in all three stages is consistent with a 7000 year-young universe.•	Evidence that God did not create an embryonic universe, but a fully functioning interactive SYSTEM, manifests in plants that require creatures for pollination.•	Due to Barry Setterfield’s ZPE (Zero Point Energy, the physical manifestation of Planck’s constant) The speed of light and electrons has decreased asymptotically since Creation. Light appears to have 30% faster in Jesus day, 400 times faster in Abraham’s day, and ten million times faster prior to 3,000BC.•	Speed of light may be increasing as it encounters less ZPE at the outer edges of space. Just as light speeds up after it emerges from water, allow me to speculate that the nature of light may be such (otherwise, what is the energy source?) that it goes at a fixed speed except while ZPE, water, atmosphere, and space dust etc. hinders.•	Electrons bouncing erratically off ZPE as they negotiate the ZPE hurdles on their orbital track, probably explains the “Uncertainty Principle” of quantum physics. Electrons are moving slower too. Calculations of age based on atomic decay need extreme revision.•	We are simply peering thru a longer taillight beam as the once-close stars travel away. The light appears redder because the lower-energy photons were redder, not a Doppler effect as suggested by Hubbel’s red-shift. We cannot observe light from outside the beam because it always heads directly toward us. The speed is relative to our own speed.When people study the Bible’s supernatural truths, fulfilled prophesies, structure, its heptadic code (7’s), and gematria (Jewish numbering) sufficiently to know that the Bible is, beyond doubt, directly from God, then their worldview is firmly rooted in truth. God’s account of how He created the universe, and us, is not an allegory as Collins maintains. Successful (real, true) science, like Bible study, is an attempt to know the mind of God.Science hinders itself with materialistic terms of engagement that stifle investigation. Our physics is likely only a shadow of a larger reality hinted at by mathematical postulations of additional dimensions we cannot yet comprehend. We should think of our material universe as a subset of a larger (supernatural) reality. Science thwarts progress by clinging to foolish atheistic traditions designed to deny the existence of God. Beware of OrthodoxyEducator John Taylor Gatto (author of Dumbing Us Down) told me schooling trains people to act like fish (swim in unison). Joe Bobier, inventor of Single-Cycle Modulation said “If I had been an electrical engineer, they would have convinced me this is not possible.” The reason breakthrough ideas are coming from sophomore high schoolers (Jack Andraka’s cancer detector, Simon Tsaoussis, two-transistor ternary RAM) is that they are not overly encumbered by orthodoxy. Revolutionary, disruptive, correct ideas encounter establishment ridicule as Dr. Robert O. Becker describes in his journey The Body Electric. Collins incorrectly struggles to conform to atheist/agnostic orthodoxy instead of standing firmly on God’s Word. I strongly urge him to revise this book."
283,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33792597-laura-book-scrounger,4,"Francis Collins is a renowned scientist -- the former director of the Human Genome Project -- and also a Christian. In a time when science and faith can seem so diametrically opposed, it was encouraging to read one person's view of how he balances the two perspectives, and sees them as complementary rather than hostile to each other. I don't know how well this book will speak to all the different perspectives it could potentially be speaking to. I don't know whether an atheist or agnostic reader will be convinced or touched by the arguments and ideas presented here, since I am neither of those. It does cover quite a few topics -- from Collins' path to faith from his initial atheism; to a discussion of both scientific and faith-based approaches to worldviews, covering atheism, agnosticism, intelligent design, young-earth creationism, as well as theistic evolution, which he terms ""BioLogos""; as well as an overview of human DNA and what the Human Genome Project was aiming to accomplish; and an appendix devoted to bioethics, there was a lot to take in here (though I found it a relatively quick read).I think I was able to get the scientific gist of most of what he was writing about, since this was written for a layperson, but obviously there's a lot beneath the surface. I found the bits about the human genome most interesting. Faith-wise, numerous C.S. Lewis quotes will always draw me in, though I'm sure I'm not from the same ""bent"" of Christianity as Collins (though the same could be said for Lewis). But I valued the discussions of the various intersections of faith and science in regards to worldview (with an emphasis on origins).I don't agree with all of Collins' views here (though I can appreciate that we can still hold the same faith despite differences), and in many cases I don't even understand enough yet to know whether I agree or disagree. But I'm still grateful for his perspective, because it has helped me to clarify my thinking on some things, which includes some errors and inconsistencies in perspectives that I have held or entertained. I also appreciate him incorporating other thinkers (both scientists and theologians) into his arguments, because many quotes he uses are also interesting and make me want to learn more.I especially appreciate his call to not view God's Word and his creation as being ""at war with itself,"" as expressed in this quote that I think sums up his views nicely:“Will we turn our backs on science because it is perceived as a threat to God, abandoning all the promise of advancing our understanding of nature and applying that to the alleviation of suffering and the betterment of humankind? Alternatively, will we turn our backs on faith, concluding that science has rendered the spiritual life no longer necessary, and that traditional religious symbols can now be replaced by engravings of the double helix on our altars?Both of these choices are profoundly dangerous. Both deny truth. Both will diminish the nobility of humankind. Both will be devastating to our future. And both are unnecessary. The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. He can be worshipped in the cathedral or in the laboratory. His creation is majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful - and it cannot be at war with itself. Only we imperfect humans can start such battles. And only we can end them.”"
284,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66465627-adam-balshan,3,"3 stars [Humanism]Apologetics (vs. Atheism): 3.5. Science: 2 stars.Collins's book failed and succeeded. His first objective was to sieve Darwinian Evolution from atheism, on which he sold me. His second was to defend Theistic Evolution, in which he thoroughly failed. On the first matter, he created the best starting apologetic for scientific atheists that I've read. Collins was once an atheist. He took apart Dawkins. He glossed over true differences between DE and theology for the sake of (a false) harmony, but believably estranged DE and materialism. He seems to be a real Christian, however it is of course always hard to reliably tell. He professed belief and a relationship, which sounded genuine, but he kept referring to the value of other faith traditions, never called Jesus the only Way, and otherwise generally retreated to what sounded vaguely like a ""it works for me"" stance.On defending TE, he hung his cap on Darwinian Evolution. He erected a caricature of Young Earth Creationism and proceeded to beat the straw out of it. He didn't just oppose YEC and Intelligent Design, he called them untenable and impossible. His evidences were quite dated for 2006. Such faulty data that he determined to irrefutably support DE included: the DNA similarity between humans, chimps and mice; the immutability of isotopic dating and isotope half-lives (despite no evidence of universe conditions past 100 years ago or so); Occam's Razor; and the proposed reducible complexity of blood clots, flagella and the human eye (the former two of which were plausible, but not irrefutable). He got right the fact that scientific truth and spiritual truth cannot contradict, but he promoted the DE argument as overwhelming instead of its true, overwhelming ambiguity. He resembled Ptolemy, accepting the noticeable errors in satellite epicycles rather than telling the world that the earth revolves around the Sun, all for the sake of a contrived peace. His views have been thoroughly and convincingly refuted by the publications of Answers in Genesis, and plausibly so by Gerald Schroeder's creation-physics model (which reconciles YEC and OEC) in his book, The Science of God."
285,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6422812-hawley,4,"Only took me a whole semester to finish this book, oops! Still though, I thought Collins’s argument for theistic evolution was compelling. As a scientist and a person of faith, I’ve never seen incompatibility between the two domains, but haven’t been able to clearly articulate my beliefs as theistic evolution. I am deeply compelled by the Moral Law argument and this book helped to strengthen my beliefs. I found myself coming back to this book and Collins’s arguments frequently over the course of the semester in my Philosophy of Religion class. We didn’t talk about theistic evolution directly, but The Language of God supplemented a lot of my coursework well. I was less compelled by Collins’s arguments for Christianity in particular toward the end of the book, but I appreciate his insistence that faith is a personal journey we must all come to for ourselves. Overall, I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to understand more about science, faith, and the relationship between the two. "
286,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7287572-grace,2,"A manifesto for theistic evolution.Every time I read one of these books I feel smacked around and uneasy. I read Darwin's Black Box and felt compelled by Behe's explanations. I was similarly compelled by Collins's dismantling of Behe, though. What all of this comes down to is that I am a layman having to trust whoever writes these books to tell me what they wish, leave out & skip over what they wish, and interpret everything for me. The only solution is to go back to school for my own PhD in biology, I guess. Honestly, though, I would skip reading this book. If you want the good faith parts just read Mere Christianity or better yet C. S. Lewis's entire bibliography. If you want the good science parts, just read any mainstream college molecular biology textbook, or whatever the latest Richard Dawkins book is."
287,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57363039-emily-monroe,5,"For someone familiar with both Christianity and science, this is a great summary type of read that seeks to reconcile what many sources today tout as unreconcilable. Collins provides brief backgrounds on both apologetics (belief) and genetics (science). If a reader is not familiar with either of those topics, this book is not a good introduction. As a believer with a science and engineering background, I enjoyed learning his perspective. Collins is frank in stating that young earth creationism is a dangerous concept, and he gave language and examples to support it. He is also frank in saying that science does not and cannot explain everything about our existence and the meaning of life. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and took a lot away from it that I will use in conversations with both believers and non-believers."
288,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23188545-josh,4,"More and more,if you are willing to open your eyes, you will be confronted with those who have differing views and beliefs than your own. The temptation is great to simply dismiss any idea or worldview that seems contrary to the one you already hold. My brother characterizes, and to a degree caricatures, the typical Christian response to contrary ideas as that of a petulant child putting his fingers in his ears and repeating, “I CAN'T HEAR YOU” to drown out the sound of anything that might question what is held so dearly.As a Christian,who deals with many Christians, it is hard to not acquiesce to his diagnosis. So often, those who should be genuinely searching out truth wherever it lies (seeing as how all truth is God's truth) will allow ourselves to remain ignorant out of fear that our beliefs will come crashing down and our God with them. If this fear is not present,then the possibility of ever having to admit some degree of error in our interpretation of the Bible or of the world or of our self is more than our pride can stand.Labels abound. If you believe in health care for all or government based social services then you are a “communist”. If you believe that some of the Bible is not to be taken literally, you're a “liberal” who does not believe the Bible. If you preach grace you are “antinomian” and if you preach responsibility and fidelity, you are a “legalist”. The word “heretic” gets thrown around on anyone not conforming to “the Bible” which would be more accurately and honesty communicated as “my interpretation of the Bible”.All these labels do in most cases is perpetuate ignorance and division, making it more convenient and efficient for us as we sit in God's seat of judgment on any who might not submit themselves to what we “know” as truth. Enter Francis Collins. Talk about a guy getting it from all angles. Collins was the head of the Human Genome Project, the scientific research to map out the human genome. The work done under his leadership has led to us have a genetic map of human beings. The benefit of this in the war against disease and defect is incapable of being overstated. The work God has done through this man and his leadership is amazing.And therein lies the reason he receives such criticism. Collins, a biologist, stood in the Oval Office with then President Clinton and nodded approvingly when President Clinton remarked that we could now see the “language of God” used in creation. How a professional biologist could hold to an “inherently unscientific” belief in God and approve of such theistic speak offended many in the biological community. That a committed Christian could believed in the “inherently atheistic” doctrine of evolution, offended many in the Christian community.That is the backdrop for the book, The Language of God by Francis Collins. Collins work is one part biography, one part scientific treatise and one part apologetic. Collins spends time going over his life, and his own path from atheism, to agnosticism, and finally to his firm belief in the theism of Biblical Christianity. The biographical aspects of the book are all centered on how he has related his lifelong love of science with his lifelong struggle with faith,and it is quite engrossing. Even as the biographical aspects of the book focus on Collins' own personal path, the way he presents it is overtly apologetic. He constantly goes over how he was convinced of the truth of theism and eventually the Christian truth claim, not simply recounting the fact that he was convinced. The way the apologetic is intertwined with the biographical narrative reminds one of reading C.S. Lewis when he deals with the same subject. Based on the references to and quotes from Lewis, this may not have been intentional but certainly it is without shock that some of Lewis' writing style was adopted by Collins.The apologetic nature of the book is not limited solely to a defense of the Christian faith. The idea of this book is how to rectify a belief in current scientific trends and the Christian faith. In doing so, Collins argues that Darwinian Evolution is true and that it is NOT contrary to the Christian faith. With so much teaching for and evidence of evolution, Collins' devotes a chapter to each of the possible responses to evolution. These chapters are Atheism and Agnosticism (When Science Trumps Faith), Creationism (When Faith Trumps Science), Intelligent Design (When Science Needs Divine Help),and BioLogos (Faith and Science in Harmony). Collins is basically fair in his assessment of the opposing views, but throughout the chapters it is clear that he is building to what he holds as truth by dismantling what he holds as false(or even silly). Collins closes with pleas to believers to not abandon science and scientists to not abandon faith.As I read the book I had to remind myself that Collins is not a theologian, he is a biologist. His interpretation of some Christian doctrines is off what he seems to hold as essential is debated amongst Christians. Some of the history he cites is incorrect and the citations could have been more thorough, especially on some instances where no citation was given. Also, there were times where Collins began speaking exclusively to his peers, losing the reader with limited scientific knowledge in the process.While this book is far from perfect, it is a great read. It would benefit anyone involved in the evolution debate(that would be anyone who has any religious, secular or scientific interest....everyone) to read this book and consider the arguments made and data presented"
289,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58566782-shane-allen,5,"A must read for those who love science and Jesus Christ. Of course the author of science is compatible with the science He created. It’s hard to believe this is still or has ever been an issue. However, it’s definitely worth the read just to hear his perspective on evolution. I’m not quite sold on the science but he is very persuasive. I’ve been reading both sides of the theistic evolution-intelligent design debate for a while now and I’m not convinced humans have fully learned enough yet to die on any hill. One thing is for certain– Francis Collins truly loves Jesus and it grieves me when Christians attack each other over non-essential doctrines not explicit in the Bible. Remember, we are all bothers and sisters in Christ. "

I thank God for the influence that C.S. Lewis is still having on the honest skeptic. Collins’ testimony is a glory to God and how wonderful to have a brother in Christ in such an influential position, like a lighthouse to call many who feel exiled from the faith, Home. "

This book details out the driving questioning skepticism of science, details some of the journey of the DNA discoveries, and some of the probable limits of 'designer DNA'. It raises questions, but importantly, it defines what science can and cannot discover and why faith and science are not in conflict. For me, it helped clarify issues surrounding stem cell research, some things regarding evolution, and other hotbed controversial issues without me feeling like I had to 'check my faith in God' at the door in order to engage in the things this scientist was saying. It was a breath of fresh air. "

293,0743286391,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93234321-lucas-mroz,5,"Such a great book that tackles the coexistence of science and faith. Highly recommend no matter where you fall on that continuum. Big take away: if God created everything, and science studies everything, then science helps us understand God more, not less."

However, many topics I had hoped would be in here were either not or just glossed over. There were some major topics that I disagree with. I would not recommend to the average reader. "
