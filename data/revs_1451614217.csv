0,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"In Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think, author and X Prize founder Peter Diamandis makes his case that the standard of living of the bulk of the world’s population can be raised to a level in which everyone’s basic needs are met within the next twenty-five years. How is this to be done you might ask given the many seemingly intractable problems that are present around the globe today? …. SCIENCE, the private sector and the largesse of billionaires!! This might seem far-fetched, but you don’t have to look very far into the past for other visionaries whose dreams have come true. In the 1940s and 50s there were crazy prophets who envisioned a future of jet packs, hover cars, transporters, ray guns, robot servants, food pills, 4-hour workweeks, space elevators, cryogenic freezers that would bring us back from the dead, colonies on the moon, mars and in our oceans and an abundance of shiny unisex jumpsuits. In the post WWII years, these individuals were viewed as seers, eccentrics, and dreamers with unrealistic expectations, and yet, look at us now … with … uh … exactly none of that stuff. Ok, it’s a bit odd that they didn’t get any of it right and that they failed to anticipate the negative aspects of technology such as nuclear waste, massive species extinction, global warming, thalidomide, the formation of the ozone hole, toxic waste, fishery die-off and oceanic dead zones. But that’s all in the past, and now we have a fresh breed of Utopians who portend to usher in a new era of prosperity through chemistry. Could they be right this time? Well … it’s a nice thought, but no one really knows. It’s not possible to predict the future and the road is littered with the failed attempts of those who have tried. Data shows that prosperity is rising in most third world countries and that this rise is driven in large part by new technologies (in particular computers and the internet). Barring some catastrophe (such as the worst case predictions of global climate models) it’s reasonable to assume that this trend will continue in the near term. In the long term, one can’t ignore the fact that rising prosperity also leads to increased consumption, environmental degradation and pollution.I didn’t feel like the book provided a convincing argument, instead, the bulk of the text simply consists of a survey of some of the technologies that are presently under development and a description of the purportedly benign global benefits that they will bring … that is, assuming that they wind up being technologically viable, scalable, cost effective and adopted into broad public use (a huge assumption, given that most technologies fail to satisfy these requirements). Unfortunately, there are many claims that Diamandis’ makes that I found to be flawed (here are but a few):1. Diamandis claims that cell phones reduce consumption because they obviate the need for such thing as TVs , stereos, flashlights, tools, video games, computers and home entertainment systems. How many people own not just all of these items but multiple versions of each? Lots. Cell phones are just another consumer item that people purchase on top of many other consumer items.2. He repeatedly uses the term “sustainable growth” a phrase which is, at best, meaningless and at worst a disingenuous marketing ploy. The term is most often used as a green veneer to allay the guilt of hyper-active consumers. More to the point though, the U.S. EPA stated in a 2007 report: “While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable.” In other words … nobody even knows what the term means or how to measure it. The phrase represents little more than empty rhetoric. 3. Diamandis is enamored of the robber barons (which is weird on its face … given the fact that they were, you know … first and foremost “robbers”) and believes their philanthropy will save the planet (Diamandis falls into this category and clearly likes to thinks of himself in heroic terms). Here’s the thing though, robber barons and philanthropists have been around as long as civilization has existed. Ignoring the oppression they engender for the moment, they've had more than enough time to solve the world's problems and have not come close to doing so. 4. Along with the above, he believes the private sector will offer all the solutions, ignoring any role of government. That’s fine, but completely ignores the fact that all of the fundamental research for the programs he discusses had their origin in publically funded programs. The internet, space program and human genome project among others would not have existed but for government funded research. Private companies do not engage in basic research because their motive is profit (as opposed to knowledge). 5. Diamandis spends an entire chapter arguing that those who disagree with him do so because of the inherent psychological underpinnings of the brain, which cause us to be unduly influenced by an innate pessimism and to place increased weight on negative arguments and evidence (and to ignore positive news and events in turn). Evidently, if you disagree with Diamandis’ point of view, it is not because he failed to provide convincing evidence, but because of your unconscious pathologically negative patterns of thought. Interesting idea, but as a rebuttal to criticism it’s intellectually dishonest. But the biggest problem with the book is that Diamandis simply does not seem to understand human nature. Just as those who earn $1 per day wish to earn more to meet basic needs , so does the lower class want to become middle class, and the middle class to become millionaires, millionaires strive to become multi-millionaires, and multi-millionaires wish to become billionaires. Simply put, there is no such thing as 'enough' when it comes to human beings and their desires to acquire material wealth and possessions. Increased wealth begets increased consumption and as long as we continue to overlook the role of population, it will become increasingly difficult to ignore the fact that we live on a finite planet with finite resources. A far better solution than the ones Diamandis proposes, would be to put humane programs in place to systematically reduce human birth rates. The world is quite big enough to sustain many millions (as opposed to billions) of people in abundance, with plenty of room left over for other species and vibrant ecosystems. "

Yay!Everything in the whole wide world will soon be radically better because of the business-like innovations of the techno-philanthropists. They are like gods; praise them!The problem for this goofy book is reality. As documented in Forbes, Fortune and other publications, the Gates Foundation (to use the biggest example of techno-philanthropy) actually has a pretty bad track record. They justify this by saying you have to take risks and fail a lot to succeed sometime. Perhaps, but that's also what losing gamblers say. The life-saving success they hang their hat on is the expansion of polio vaccination. But this is a program that has been going on for decades under the leadership of the Rotary Club and other non-profits and uses an old, simple, cheap, evidence-based intervention. It's wonderful that the Gateses have used their enormous clout to promote this worthy endeavor, but it doesn't prove Diamandis's point. It actually supports the opposite conclusion: we should look at what is known to work and do more of that. And when one digs into the details of specific issues, it seems the author is just making stuff up. I don't know about the safety of hypothetical next-gen nuclear reactors, but I know about public health history. Diamandis messes up on basic concepts like the difference between lifespan and average life expectancy at birth. He actually talks about 30-something year-old grandparents dying as the natural state of the species, apparently not understanding that life expectancy 150 years ago was 30-something not because people got ""old"" and died at 35 but because children routinely died before their fifth birthdays. If half the people die at age 70 and half at age 0, then average life expectancy is 35. People who can't do basic math shouldn't write science books.For more sanity on related topics:

In this book, X PRIZE founder Peter Diamandis tackles that view head on with a compelling argument that humanity is actually in far better shape than the 24/7 news cycle would have you believe.The core of his argument is that a number of forces have come together to create an opportunity for problem solving unprecedented in human history. Among those forces are the explosive growth of computing technology, the democratizing power of the Internet, and the rise of billionaire technophilanthropists with a genuine desire to save the world.Diamandis and co-author Steven Kotler spend good portions of this book looking at the most serious problems facing the world today, including water, food, sanitation, health care, energy and repressive governments. In doing so, they offer tangible examples of new technologies that have or soon will have the potential to eliminate those problems.Among the most interesting sections for me were those on how cheap mobile diagnostic tools and cloud based medical computers can bring health care to remote regions of the planet; how Generation IV nuclear reactors can power the earth for 1,000 years using existing nuclear waste with zero risk of the dangers of current plants; the discovery that kids in an Indian slum who spoke no English and had no computer experience could teach themselves biotechnology if given a computer; and that a guy in Colombia with a Facebook page succeeded in taking down FARC, a rebel organization that had been terrorizing his country with kidnappings and violence for 40 years.Examples like these were the most valuable part of this book for me, provided in enough abundance to combat my own natural ""yeah, but..."" tendencies. The author's attempt to provide a structural framework through which to view these examples - a pyramid of possibility inspired by Maslow - was less successful; it was too abstract and less engaging than the inspiring, real world examples. In addition, I couldn't help noting that just because many technologies do drop dramatically in price as they increase exponentially in power doesn't mean that the exponential growth he anticipates can solve many of our problems will actually occur. Despite that, I found this book to be authentically hopeful; it pushes back hard enough against the doomsayers that I finished it feeling like we have a much better chance at solving our big problems than I did before I started it."
3,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/880021-david-sasaki,2,"When I worked at Open Society Foundations, we had a focus on defending rights, which derived from a worldview that assumes there are large institutions (mostly corporations and governments) that encroach upon our individual freedoms and our ability to live a prosperous life. By strengthening and defending rights, we can mitigate the negative effects of these large institutions. For all the insane blabber by Glenn Beck about George Soros being a Communist puppet master, the foundation actually has a worldview much aligned with the Republican Party of early 20th century: defend the rights of individuals so that they can seek prosperity and political representation.At Omidyar Network, we never spoke about rights. Within the Omidyar Network worldview, there are no enemies, only opportunities to improve. Technology, according to this worldview, is the fulcrum that creates these new opportunities. To put it in unsophisticated terms, Open Society Foundations seeks to defend individuals from a pessimistic view of the world while Omidyar Network seeks to accelerate and distribute an optimistic view of the world.In general, Silicon Valley is a geography of optimism, but no one takes it to such an extreme as Peter Diamandis, co-founder of Singularity University, founder of the X Prize Foundation, and author of 
Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think
. The book makes three main arguments:

   The world today is better off than it ever has been. This is a result of formerly scarce resources becoming abundant and accessible to all thanks to technological innovations. 
  
   As a species, we are psychologically primed to exaggerate the negative and ignore the positive. 
  
   There are three main forces that are accelerating innovation to improve the lives of everyone, but especially the poor of developing countries. 
  
The book begins by recounting the famous anecdote of a goldsmith who presented a new type of metal to Emperor Tiberius of Rome in 23 AD. The shiny silver metal was so alluring that, rather than reward the goldsmith for his invention, Tiberius ordered his beheading to ensure the new metal wouldn't devalue the empire's massive store of gold. Aluminum remained a rare metal until the middle of the 19th century. We are told that Napoléon III hosted the King of Siam for a banquet ""where the honored guests were given aluminum utensils, while the others had to make do with gold."" Decades of technological innovation from 1825 to 1886 made aluminum cheaper and faster to produce. Today the International Aluminum Institute calls the lightweight material that we use to wrap our leftovers ""almost infinite."" For Diamandis, the anecdote is illustrative of the most important trend of the past 300 years: what begins as rare and only accessible by the rich becomes abundant and accessible to everyone. And, significantly, the timeframe between rare and abundant -- whether it's access to the latest gadgets or an individual's ability to sequence her DNA -- is narrowing with each passing year.One of the book's many examples from Singularity University is Matternet, a start-up that aims to deliver food and medicine to African villagers by drone. More recently, the questionably branded ""Flying Donkey Challenge"" wants to ""pioneer a new transport system of large cargo robots in Africa and beyond.""Diamandis spends a long time arguing with the pessimists. It's a tiring, repetitive portion of the book that could have been summed up in a single paragraph: Our evolution on the African Savanna surrounded by predators primed us to be hypersensitive to any signs of threat. Our brains are structured to focus on the bad. As a result, even if our rational selves acknowledge that life expectancies have tripled in the past few hundred years, we still spend all our time worrying about Y2K or melting ice caps or the threat of China. It's probably a good thing that our brains are wired for alarmism -- if, that is, our alarmism persuades us to lead more sustainable lives. Unfortunately, often times we spend all our attention worrying about the downfall that awaits us without ever changing the behaviors that cause the problems in the first place. Many of today's most influential pundits gain fame by constantly pointing to the latest potential threats without ever offering any suggestions to address them. Diamandis thinks we'd all be better off if we spent less time worrying and more time innovating.That takes us to his third and final argument: three forces are coming together to accelerate innovation in order to improve the lives of the world's poor. 

The DIY Innovator -- You no longer need to work at Bell Labs or IBM in order to invent new products and bring them to market. Microsoft, Apple, Google and Craig Venter's indie sequencing of the genome are all examples of how individual entrepreneurs have been able to outperform the giants. 
  
The Technophilanthropists -- Modern capitalism has produced extremely wealthy technology entrepreneurs who are increasingly using their money, insight and fame to address the world's greatest problems. 
  
The Rising Billion -- Ever since C.K. Prahalad published The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, an increasing number of entrepreneurs are trying to build products and services designed for the billions of people at the bottom of the financial pyramid.  
  
As an illustration of how old business is rethinking their practices to reach the ""bottom billion,"" one of the most intriguing anecdotes of the book describes how an Indian jeans manufacturer was able to change his approach to reach the rural poor that make up the majority of the country:Arvind saw a golden opportunity forming in the budding domestic market for jeans. Today, the company sells four brands, priced between $7 and $30 a pair. Its best-selling label, Ruf & Tuf, caters to rural India, home to 70 percent of the country's 950 million people. Before Ruf & Tuf was introduced in 1995, most rural Indians had only seen jeans on television.It took some creativity to crack the rural market, where many Indians still prefer custom-tailored clothes. Rather than fight that mindset, Arvind conceived ""ready-to-stitch"" jeans. Ruf & Tuf jeans are sold as a kit: two legs, buttons, rivets, zipper, leather label and an instruction booklet for the neighborhood tailor.I am sufficiently optimistic to get annoyed by the pessimists who are always crying wolf about the next disaster that awaits us. Yet, I am sufficiently pessimistic to get equally annoyed by the uber-optimists that disregard threats to our freedom because they are so focused on the next innovation. As I've written many times before, the automobile probably seemed like a pretty great idea at the time. Diamandis sits squarely in the camp of tunnel vision optimists. He isn't concerned that we could run out of water, but rather that we aren't able to make the systems efficient enough. He isn't worried about our information overload, only that we don't have better filters to help us focus on what's important. His only doubt as to whether we are gliding effortlessly toward utopia is how quickly we will arrive. "
4,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1287431-jonathan,2,"The basic premise of Abundance is that there are a lot of problems in the world, and its hard to get people to change, but the right technological innovations will fix everything. As someone who notices many of the same problems in the world, I want to believe the authors' assertions. And the book inspired me! The characters and anecdotes are appealing. I finished the book feeling nagged by a few big holes, but overall excited.Unfortunately, in reflection the excitement wore off. There are plenty of technical problems with the book – for instance, a few of the stories (computer education in the villages, do-everything water filters) are exaggerated and don't pan out as well in the real world. Devoting a major pillar of the book to the author's own X-prizes project was lame. Wasting a whole chapter on the claim that all their opponents are just deluded by their brain chemistry was a waste of space. But the real difficulties are fundamental philosophical problems with expecting technology to change the world.First off, the human tendency toward greed has proven able to absorb anything it's been given. Everyone always wants more. The idea that we could produce so much that the rich people would be satisfied and let the poor have enough, without major society changes, doesn't fit with any period in human history. The powerful have always been able to limit other people's access to resources whenever it benefited them, and the authors never explain how they'd keep powerful corporations and powerful governments from continuing to do such a thing. On occasion they allude to such problems (such as Monsanto's wield of patents to force farmers to be reliant on their products indefinitely), but they just “hope” such things will change.Second, the degree to which wealth disparity, rather than absolute wealth alone, contributes to societal problems is never dealt with. Problems like violence and mental health appear not to be connected just to a nation's overall resources, but to its ability to deal out those resources evenly. That's one reason that Americans are less happy now than we were in the 1950s and 1960s (despite having FAR more stuff, including all the innovations the authors praise), and why many countries – including Sweden, Norway, Denmark, New Zealand, etc. - do better than America an d England on nearly every social index despite having far less money at their disposal. The authors don't deal with that issue at all.Finally, the book shows absolutely no real interest in the people and things that the authors claim to be trying to preserve. They want to solve poverty, yet don't show any knowledge of the experience of the poor or any desire to ask them what they want. They want to save the environment, but everything they propose is irrelevant to and often disregarding of nature. They want to preserve land, but seem to think they could do that by just destroying small bits of land more efficiently, and hope that other land will be saved in the process. In general, they reach for technological numbers and statistics, but completely ignore the much greater damage to human societal structures and the Earth's environmental balance that are caused by both previous technological ""advancements"" and their own proposed technological ""solutions"".As long as the people with power are obsessed with the greed for more things, they will continue abusing the poor, nature, and the land in order to satisfy their greed. Technology is neutral – no matter what you invent, the powerful aren't going to give up their desire to own more than everyone else, to possess the land, to control other peoples' lives. The authors are right that greed is part of the problem. They're right that people's nature is difficult to change. They're wrong that we can just hope that enough technology will just make that issue go away. It has never, ever worked before."
5,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912138-alex-givant,5,Excellent book about why our future is better than you think. Have you seen bunch of depressing news today on TV? Just switch it off and use this time to read more books like this one.
6,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14139887-david-buccola,1,"A truly awful book. Take the futurism of a world's fair, add the hucksterism of a veteran of the start-up world, and rose-tinted outlook of a millennial and you get an idea of what this book is like. The book is littered with the false hope of NGO's and other companies that--just three years from publication--are already complete failures. But never fear, Peter Diamandis assures us, the world's billionaires will save us all! Conveniently missing from the narrative is the looming ecological crisis posed by Global Climate Change. There is very little of substance here.Just three years since publication, we already know that a number of the ideas espoused in this book are complete failures. The world's cheapest and most dangerous car, the Tato Nano, has not even close to meeting the expectations of shareholders. The devestation of the predatory micro loan industry has been well documented and has shook the Indian economy to its core. The much touted One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) has already shuttered its doors after passing out a paltry 2.3 million laptops that are mostly junk. The guy who gave fat suburbanites the segueway claims to have invented a machine that's going to bring clean water to the poorest of the poor. It costs $100,000 at this point so a family making a few dollars a day might have to save up for a few generations before they can buy one. It goes like this, on and on throughout the book. There are, of course, things aren't failures yet. Bill Gates is promoting the next generation of nuclear power that is supposedly safe and cheap. Of course that's been the mantra of the nuclear industry since its inception. With the recent disaster at Fukushima I think there's little reason to give this much credence. Even Gates admits that we're at least ten years away from a working prototype. So it's really just hype at this point. Other ideas, like the next generation of biofuels are also highlighted. I won't go on much here. Some of this stuff may indeed work out at some point down the line but it's mostly empty hype at this point.There are points when Peter Diamandis comes dangerously close to touching on something worth while. He admits, for instance, that we already have enough food to feed everybody. We have an abundance of food! Yay, we're already there. But then he goes off the rails to explain to the patient reader that we don't have a distribution problem. Our problem, he insists, is that we need to move the farm! Now much of what he has to saw about vertical farming and even urban farming is spot on. We would certainly benefit from moving the farm. But it doesn't matter how much we increase our food production if we don't allow hungry people access to that food. You can move the farm wherever you like, but until we start producing food to feed people we're going to still have this problem. Diamandis' biggest problem is conflating a trend within the computing industry with a scientific law. Moore's law has lead to incredible advances in computing. They're faster and cheaper than ever. But most things we need, like major infrastructure projects, cars, housing and the like still require huge amounts of energy and cost. He talks about the smart water grid were going to build, which is essentially a bunch of sensors, but he's mute on how we're actually going to fix our aging water infrastructure and replace all those pipes. His answers again and again are essentially, ""We'll let a computer do it."" When grandma needs to go to an old folks home because the rest of the family is working too many hours to look after her, she can talk to a robot! When we start running out of trained professional teachers, we'll just replace them with iPads and laptops! Again and again we're told that all of life problems will be solved with a giant technological bandaid. I was told again and again that this was a book full of hope. I don't find techno-charlatanism hopeful. If anything, I found the ""future of abundance"" outlined here sounds like a complete nightmare where meaningful human interactions are replaced with machine interfaces with artificial intelligence. If you want a realistic look at our future with some hopeful observations I highly recommend Richard Heinberg's ""The End of Growth."" "
7,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5906767-shirley-freeman,5,"This is an amazing book! The authors define abundance as 'providing all people with a life of possibility.' Imagine a world where 9 billion people have adequate clean water, food, shelter, energy, education and health. The authors not only imagine it, but think it is possible within the next 25 years. Yes, it seems overly optimistic but their argument (with supporting data) and their energy and enthusiasm are contagious. They outline the incredible technological advances that are occurring in psychology and biology and therefore in health care and food production, in education, in energy development, in every field of human endeavor. They tell the story in a readable format, but more than half the book is notes and data supporting their argument. The Kindle version is 45% words and 65% appendices and notes. I would highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in entrepreneurship, technology, improving the world, helping others live a fulfilling life, you name it. If you read it, I'd love to know what you think."
8,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,3,"The future according to our popular novelists is almost always dystopian. Peter Diamandis encourages us to imagine otherwise, based on the potential of recent developments in science and technology.Taking a page from Ray Kurzweil (with whom he has established Singularity University), Diamandis's future is very much the present-day reality of artificial technology, nanotechnology, robotics, communications, and biotechnology, where the pace of innovation conferred by computerization has greatly improved the prospects of the planet to support all of its inhabitants comfortably.Thus, this is more than another account of gee-whizardy. It's about how technological progress can be translated into a higher degree of creature comfort for earth's creatures (well, at least its people), including those living at the ""bottom of the pyramid."" Indeed, one of the most encouraging messages of the book is how some parts of the world--Africa in particular--occupy in some respects an advantageous position vis-a-vis some of these new technologies. The advantage, such as it is, comes from the fact that they don't have the developed countries' huge invested interest in the old and expensive technologies of land lines, coal, and gasoline, which puts the under-developed countries in a better position to be early adopters of the new technologies, particularly solar power. Cell phones have already proven themselves to be a potent tool for delivering financial and public health benefits in such countries as Bangladesh and Kenya.Diamandis places a great deal of faith on the ability of tech philanthropists to deliver the goods that will produce our abundant future. While never providing an overt critique of centralized governments, Diamandis consistently uses such examples as Bill Gates to show how much tech tycoons really care about the world and are the key to its salvation.Unfortunately, he fails to make a distinction between private actions taken for public benefit--Wikipedia comes to mind--and private actions taken for proprietary benefit, like those of Craig Venter in the race to map the human genome. Diamandis's account of Venter's role is brief, glowing--and self-contradictory: ""Building on work that had come before, Venter ... delivered a fully sequenced human genome in less than one year (tying the government's ten-year effort) for just under $100 million (while the government spent $1.5 billion)."" Sounds like a wasteful government, doesn't it? What he doesn't say is that ""government"" (actually scientists using money from public sources) had done 80% of the work by the time Venter got to it--and copied it. That's what ""building on work that had come before"" means. And then, Venter wanted to declare private ownership of what his company had ""discovered,"" whereas the ""government"" wanted to make the information available to create future wealth in the form of new knowledge by others ""building on work that came before.""Diamandis also places a great deal of stock in prizes as an engine of progress. I have no beef with that, but if he wants to point fingers--even without seeming to do so--I do have to wonder why, five years after the awarding of an X-prize to not one but three winners of a competition to design ""the world's first fast, affordable, production-ready car able to achieve over one hundred miles per gallon equivalent,"" there is still no such car on the market. The reason, I'm sure, has something to do with why American auto-makers were never able to release any fuel-efficient cars in the first place and had to have Japan show them how; it has something to do with the fact that so-called ""fuel-efficient"" cars are being marketed today that get less than 40 mpg, which is disgraceful. The reason is one that I don't fully understand, but it is a demonstrable phenomenon no less. And it has nothing to do with wasteful governments.I am hopeful that the future will turn out the way Diamandis describes. But there is one reason why dystopian fiction prevails--it is really more about people than technology. If, as J-P Sartre said, hell is other people, so might we say the same about the future."
9,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144537-adam-ford,4,"Abundance is one of the better books about the modern world that I have read. A very informative and well written book that flowed quickly. I highly recommend it. A few things that stood out to me:1. The main forces pushing us forward are the buying power of the bottom billion (the poorest billion people on the planet), the exponential growth of technology, the rise of the super-smart techno philanthropist and the do-it-your-selfers.2. We are heading into a significant shortage of doctors as the baby-boomers retire. There have never been enough doctors worldwide, but we are about to experience a major shortage in the first world. The best hope for dealing with the crisis will be technology. Health scans will engage in direct biocommunication and diagnostics with greater accuracy than possible with a live doctor. Exciting times lie ahead in medical technology. 3. More people should be working on things that are significant. The book quotes one of Google's founders saying that something is significant if it has the potential to affect the lives of 1 billion people in the next decade. This is thinking big. If more people stretched towards this goal, the world would be a much better place. I like this a lot and think I need to broaden my horizons significantly. I spend far too much time obsessing over the tiny religious sect I happened to be born into. It is a long-term historical irrelevancy and has distracted me for most of my life from applying my skills towards accomplishing great things. If your audience size is less than a million people, you are wasting your gift. 4. The bottom billion are a massive market with amazing growth potential for businesses and will not be ignored much longer. As these consumers are understood and targeted engineers and businessmen will be forced to lower the cost of their products. Nearly every household in the Philippines or Kenya or Nigeria or Pakistan have cell phones today. In a decade they will all have more than the average first world household has today due to advances in technology. The 3rd world is disappearing. 5. The next decade will see an explosion in game-based learning. Video games are not harmful and in fact can be a very powerful tool in teaching. We are just figuring out how to use the video game format to revolutionize teaching and learning. It will be exciting to watch this happen. "
10,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4743119-oleksandr-zholud,3,"This is an optimistic non-fic from 2012, written mainly in 2010, that is a great alternative to doom and gloom of todays and even earlier near-future prediction literature. I read is as a part of monthly reading for August 2020 at  Non Fiction Book Club group.The book starts with an attempt to understand why most of the near-future prediction literature, starting roughly from 1972’s The Limits to Growth and continuing since is mostly saying: “we are on the bring (or just passed it) and there is a great disaster ahead”, namely the fact that humans have evolved as pessimists, having a negativity bias—the tendency to give more weight to negative information and experiences than positive ones. This allowed us to survive, while more happy-marry cousins were eaten by predators or died from hunger. The same bias shaped our media, which much more likely will talk about disasters than about happier happenings. In no way this suggests that the are no disasters, for there are a lot, but more that nevertheless for the majority of Earth population the life is longer, happier, more diverse and fulfilling lives despite worsening environmental situation or growing income disparity in many countries. It continues by giving examples of discovering and inventions, which were “just behind the corner” ten years ago, when the book was written. This include a lengthy discussion about cleaning the water, supplying/generating electricity, lowering carbon emissions, assessing knowledge with concrete examples of what has been done and can be done. The fact that it was mostly written 10 years ago gives a unique perspective on what has been realized and what still lags behind, so that we, the readers, can look deeper to answer why this is so.I see that a lot of reviewer see this book as one-sided, but doom-and-gloom books are one-sided as well, so if seen in a larger context, it is ok. The book also actively praises “the new rich”, internet-era millionaires, who are seen here as the major drive of change. As a person from the formerly socialist country, I actually support the view that the newly self-made (wo-)men from the western world that quite actively spend their wealth – say Bill Gates or George Soros – to improve the livelihood of many, actually do a better job than the governments, to which they ought to give their money via taxes according to some. Alas, in the developing world, ‘new money’ are quite often made and later supported by corrupt practices, so as any solution ‘rich folk will save us’ isn’t that universal."
11,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8514061-glenn-capuano,3,"This book was recommended by a friend, and I certainly enjoyed reading it. The main premise is that the doom & gloom which dominates the media is ill-placed and we are in fact much better off and will soon have the means at our disposal to beat the challenges facing humanity today. Much of this makes sense to me - certainly there is a tendency to focus on the negative, and it's good to see a book which catalogues some of the good inventions which do have the potential to change our lives in the foreseeable future.As far as how believable some of their predictions are - well I think they vary. I found the section on water quite interesting, and some of the technologies discussed around the provision of clean water are very exciting. Also the education section is worth a read, as I think the authors are onto something with the profound way the internet has penetrated our lives and made so much information accessible, and the availability of mobile apps replacing many devices.I'm a little more skeptical about their claims on energy generation and health care - claiming that there are trends for both of these becoming much cheaper and affordable which seems to be exactly the opposite of what we're seeing in the real world at the moment (both electricity and health care costs increasing rapidly).At times it seems to be a little too self-promoting, with many passages little more than ads for the authors' companies (eg. the X-prize and Singularity University). There is also a lot of faith placed on continued exponential growth, almost to the point of it being a religion - eg. Moore's Law will continue to apply indefinitely - not considering things like quantum limits where it starts to break down. Just because something has grown exponentially in the past doesn't mean it will continue to do so in the future.In the end, the book is a good read (and quite easy to read) if you want to know about some of the more exciting technologies which are being developed and appearing on the horizon, and how they might affect our lives. I certainly found it engrossing and wanted to read more.In terms of providing an overarching view of argument in the title that ""the future is better than you think"" I think it falls a little short, and didn't leave me convinced of the broader view but predicting the future is a difficult game and I'm looking forward to a follow-up in a few years where the same authors evaluate their own predictions against reality."
12,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"The cover of this book, which you can't really see from the snapshot, has been done to look like it's wrapped in aluminum foil. Aluminum was once the most precious metal on earth, and now technology has made it so cheap it's ubiquitous. That's basically the premise of the book; technology brings about abundance. Diamandis has oodles of examples, and he backs them up with a thick selection of charts and graphs in the back. For every doom-and-gloom prophecy that journalists have brought up to frighten us with, Diamandis proposes a technologically feasible solution.Some of the book deals with the psychology of why people are predisposed to believe the worst about the future, and some of it deals with how typical economic models of helping developing countries are flawed. He seems to be a big fan of capitalism.This tome of Gee Whizzery feels a little like reading the transcript of a couple hours of TED talks, edited into a single optimistic book. I recommend it for people who like pop science books and want to read one that doesn't leave them feeling like the end of the world is upon us."

I want to hear the message that this book presents and I got what I was looking for. Lots of it. No wasted words here and never over my head.Some examples: ""We used to think that healthy and wealthy meant you had to be fat. We don't think that anymore. Today, we think that to be healthy and wealthy we need a ton of things, but maybe that too will become old thinking. Technology can replace much ""stuff"" without reducing our standard of living.We must expand our notions of the possible."" Considering the developing world: ""The free flow of information enabled by cellphones replaces the need for a free press"". The ""bottom billion"" in the developing world are about to come online. ""This influx of intellect from the rising billion may turn out to be the saving grace of the planet.""My big takeaway is that there are lots of people with ideas, money and desire to make the world a world of abundance for all, not pipe dreams but real workable solutions.

It changed my opinion about a lot of technologies (solar and medical) for the better. The section on the future of power collection was very interesting. I do hope their predictions about robots come true... imagine finally having a robot that would clean your house. My favorite part of the book dealt with people who are attempting to reform the educational process throughout the world. Khan Academy is an excellent tool and is being utilized by many people.

17,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21965967-amber,3,"In certain very limited ways, this book is really exciting and full of great news. The incredible technologies that have the potential to virtually eliminate problems of water scarcity, food scarcity, energy scarcity, healthcare scarcity, and education scarcity will make your jaw drop. But I found myself having a lot of, “Yes, but...” questions along the way, like:If the planned petroleum-free, carbon-neutral, “one planet living” city of Masdar outside Abu Dhabi is so great, did it ever get built, and what's its status now? The 2019 answer seems to be NO, and it's looking a lot like it was nothing but a giant boondoggle.When you say, “even the poorest Americans have access to a telephone, electricity, and flush toilets,” are you including in that generalization the several hundred thousand Americans who live in cars, tent cities, or literally on the streets?If we're this close to solving the global scarcity of potable water, why have residents of Flint, Michigan, a city in the richest country in the world, spent five years fighting for safe, reliable access to this basic essential for human life? If “Ethos” bottled water was such a wonderful idea for funding projects to improve water access in the third world, why has it only helped half a million people, and what do you plan to do about all the additional plastic waste the company has generated and put into the environment? For that matter, what's your proposed solution to plastic waste generally, and the already-wealthy petroleum companies who have big plans for more fracking so they can flood the world with even more cheap plastic?If exponentially improving technology is the solution to so many of humanity's problems, what's the solution to the next problem that solution creates – the exponentially-increasing mountains of toxic e-waste?If aquaculture is such a great solution to providing protein to 9 billion people, what's the solution to the appalling water pollution aquaculture creates? And for god's sake, the answer better not be what industry's answer has been for 60 years: “Dilution is the solution to pollution.”In general, what's the solution to the undeniable fact of human nature that for every new solution technology comes up with, greedy, shortsighted human beings will find the cheapest, quickest, dirtiest way to deploy it because that's the easiest and fastest way for them to make a short-term profit?What's the solution to the fact that very few of your proposed solutions close the loop, and appear likely to create a new environmental problem for every humanitarian problem they solve?The “Slingshot” water purifier sounds incredible, but did the cost ever get to or below $1,000 per unit? And how many did Coca-Cola actually deploy in remote locations around the world? The answer appears to be no, and very few.I had more, but this is where I stopped listing them individually. In short, this book is interesting and even exciting as far as it goes, but it doesn't go far enough, it's full of holes, and it has some larger overarching problems:It's relentlessly anthropocentric. If you're feeling angry, sad, depressed, and helpless about things like whales dying with bellies full of plastic waste, or Bornean jungles being burned so Americans can have convenient snack foods made with palm oil, or Amazon rain forest disappearing faster than ever under the policies of President Jair Bolsonaro, ""the Brazilian Trump,"" or anything of that sort, this book has only very a limited sort of solace to offer. Yes, Diamandis and Kotler say, we're in the midst of an unprecedented mammalian extinction, and it's definitely our fault. But don't worry, it's not as bad as you think. Your brain is just hard-wired to focus on the negative, the media is biased in favor of alarmist news, and anyway, you're one of the 1-2 billion lucky people whose more basic needs are being sufficiently met so that you can spend time and energy worrying about next-level issues like the survival of other Earthlings. And there's great news - we're getting closer and closer to the point where we can meet the needs of the other 8 billion humans who will probably be on this planet by 2050, so that they will also be free to worry about things like whales and orangutans and rain forests. The only question is, can we get a critical mass of humans to the point where they can care about the rest of the planet before the rain forests, orangutans, and whales are gone?Of the many resources Diamandis and Kotler discuss, the sheer amount of ecological space humanity takes up on this planet is not one of them. And ecological space isn't a resource that's subject to the kind of “bigger pie” tinkering that's the star of the book. We have to use less. A lot less. Or, if you insist on using the kind of “bigger pie” terminology the authors love so much, you have to invent ways to create new ecological space by going up (vertical farming is one example discussed in the book, but arcologies, something dreamers have been dreaming about for decades, would be a much bigger way of doing this) or turn the ocean into living and farming space (floating cities have also been on that list of things dreamers dream about for decades). Some scientists, E.O. Wilson lead among them, have been saying for 10+ years that to stop the mass extinction that's already under way, humanity needs to set aside half the planet for the rest of Earth's citizens. Unless technological tinkering can make arcologies and floating cities real and allow 9 billion people to live fulfilled, happy lives in carbon-neutral, waste-neutral, self-contained megacities and happily conduct all of their activities on just half of a landmass that is shrinking due to rising ocean levels, and do it quickly, technology simply can't make ecological space a bigger pie. And the authors have very little to say about any environmental problem beyond population, except to tell you you're probably overreacting, because after all, 40 years ago, scientists and policymakers thought acid rain was our biggest environmental problem, and it turned out all we needed was sulfur-scrubbing technology to solve it.Where Are the Women? While vreading this book, I noticed a variant of my usual gripe. In this case, it's not a direct criticism of Diamandis and Kotler – after all, their writing on the subject is descriptive, not prescriptive. There are exactly 14 women mentioned in the text, and I know this because once I noticed their absence, I started paying attention anytime a woman's name went by. As a result, I know the names of all 14 of them: April Rinne, Pamela Ronald, Sylvia Earle, PETA president Ingrid Newkirk, Melinda Gates (mentioned here solely as the wife and co-philanthropist of Bill Gates), Barbara Ward (author of Spaceship Earth), Ann Cotton, Jacqueline Novagratz, Mercy Njima, Laura Ipsen, Katie Salen, Anita Goel, Catherine Mohr, and Wendy Schmidt. This is compared to probably a solid 75-100 men. This leads me to think about the much-discussed problem of the lack of women in the top tiers of science and technology. It seems to me that one fairly obvious explanation that doesn't get talked about much is the simple fact that women are still recovering from centuries of cultural conditioning that tells us significant chunks of our attention must first be devoted to (a) making ourselves attractive and amenable to men, (b) birthing and raising children, and (c) maintaining the home. And the din of that cultural conditioning hasn't been shut off in the last 100 years, but only gradually lessened. Once those issues take up 40% of more of your conscious attention on a daily basis, how many women really have enough brainpower left to succeed as creative geniuses in any field at all? Diamandis and Kotler openly acknowledge a variant of this problem when they discuss the concept of attention as a finite and even scarce resource, mention the hundreds of billions of attention-hours Americans devote to watching TV annually, and ponder what cognitive miracles we could accomplish if we all quit our TV addictions for a year. The same principle applies to women and the things that monopolize our finite ration of daily attention, only the things that demand our attention aren't as easily shut off as a TV, and tend to demand active responses from us, rather than passive absorption of entertainment. How many hundreds of billions of attention-hours do American women (not to mention women worldwide) devote to domestic tasks that the men in their lives are freed from? What could American women be accomplishing creatively and professionally right now if in 1919, when we won the vote, we had also been unshackled en masse from (a) the physical labor of beauty and fashion regimens, housework, and child care; (b) the mental labor of staying aware of a truckload of daily minutiae ranging from your mother-in-law's birthday, to which kid has soccer practice what days, to the need to pick up the mail and replace the toilet paper roll; and (c) the emotional labor of managing the often destructive moods and egos of the men around us? We're still trying to get out from under all those burdens, and even now, in 2019, American women are being forced to choose between professional success, a domestic life that isn't littered with old take-out cartons, and sleep.Of course, I could be wrong about all this – it's entirely possible that women really are achieving great things in the important fields discussed in this book, and as a result of their own social conditioning, Diamandis and Kotler simply neglected to interview or mention more than 14 of them. I'll never know, and I can't be arsed to find out because every day after my first job, I work the unpaid second shift. It's seven years old. Published in 2012, and with a lot of research and writing presumably done well before that publication date, some of the book suffers from the problem of being at least seven years out of date in fields like technology, where seven years is an eternity. For example, Diamandis and Kotler's enthusiasm for the new (in 2012) concept of “the internet of things” belies the place we're at now in 2019, where all “the internet of things” means is that anything in your home that's connected to the web can be (a) hacked by a malicious third party or (b) bricked by the manufacturer because they were really only renting you the thing you thought you bought. And once the manufacturer bricks it, it becomes another piece of e-waste. (The authors lived in an optimistic world where “brick” hadn't yet become a verb.) As shown by some of my, “Yes, but...” questions above, I repeatedly feel like they underestimated the ability of people to take any good idea and harness it to a selfish economic interest that helps a few people get rich at the expense of the many and/or the planet. And I can't help feeling that they also repeatedly underestimated the ability and will of existing power structures to preserve themselves at the expense of the many and/or the planet.Diamandis and Kotler's praise for the man who came up with the idea of Ethos bottled water is a prime example of so much that's wrong with this book. Some dude was in South Africa and observed South African women walking for hours to collect water, and he came up with the “brilliant” idea of bottling water and selling it to wealthy Americans at an exorbitant price, advertised by the promise that 5% of the profits would go to water development projects in under-served parts of the world. The authors seem to think this is a genius combination of entrepreneurship and humanitarianism. That's bullshit. This is nothing but self-serving greenwashing. Diamandis and Kotler admit that the 5% donated profits have only helped about half a million people get improved access to clean water. Meanwhile, the dude took the other 95% of the profits and no doubt laughed all the way to the bank. Even if 100% of the profits were donated to water development projects and they helped 10 million people get clean water, who the 
fuck
 thinks more bottled water for sale is a good idea for anyone? And China has told the world, ""We're tired of recycling your plastic for you,"" so every bottle of Ethos sold is just adding to the plastic waste problem as well as this douchebag's bank account. Go Google “The Story of Bottled Water” if you're unclear on why bottled water is an awful thing for anyone to sell. Starbucks ought to remove all bottled water, including Ethos, from its shelves, install drinking fountains with filtered tap water, charge customers a quarter to use the fountains, and give all that money to the water projects."
18,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100858305-posthuman,4,"Despite the authors getting lost on rabbit trails in a couple of chapters, this was a rather memorable and enjoyable read by the founders of the X Prize. An invaluable dose of rational optimism in the face of our daily barrage of irrational doom and gloom.The premise is that humanity's evolutionary adaptations for surviving in the Pleistocene are holding most of us back from realizing scarcity is entirely contextual. Instead of responding to scarcity by slicing our pie thinner or redistributing pieces of pie around, the only viable solution is to make more pies. We are no longer living in world of competing for zero-sum resources, but a world where new pies are being made, entirely new ways to access to resources that make the previous scarcity obsolete.These days, we are saturated with information. Millions of news sources compete for our mind share. And how do they compete? By vying for the amygdala's attention. The old journalism adage ""If it bleeds, it leads"" works because the first stop that all incoming information encounters is an organ already primed to look for danger. We're feeding a fiend.

""over 90 percent of articles are pessimistic. Quite simply, good news doesn't catch our attention. Bad news sells because the amygdala is always looking for something to fear...Our early warning system evolved in an era of immediacy, when threats were of the tiger-in-the-bush variety.""

 But today's dangers are largely probabilistic -- the economy might nosedive, there could be a terrorist attack, freak weather might strike somewhere nearby -- and the amygdala can't tell the difference between immediate threat or statistical insignificance. Even worse, this system is designed not to shut off until the potential danger has completely vanished. But statistical probability dangers never completely go away. Add in an impossible-to-avoid media continuously scaring us in an attempt to capture market share, and you have a brain convinced that it's living in a state of siege, despite the fact that our world is statistically safer now than at any prior time in history. Most of us are living much longer and more uneventful lives. Nevertheless, we live in worst-case fear scenarios. 

In dangerous situations, the amygdala directs information around the prefontal cortex. This is why you jump backward when you see a squiggly shape on the ground before you have time to deduce stick, not snake. But because of the difference in neuronal processing speeds, once our primitive survival instincts take over, our newer, prosocial instincts [wired into the much slower prefontal cortex] stay sidelined....Over the past 150,000 years, Homo sapiens evovled in a world that was ""local and linear"" but today's environment is ""global and exponential.""

 In the local and linear environment of our ancestors, nearly everything happened within a day's walk. Life was effectively the same from one generation to the next, and the gradual changes that did occur followed a linear progression.

Today's global and exponential world is very different from the one our brain evolved to comprehend. Consider the sheer scope of data we now encounter...From the very beginning of time until the year 2003, humankind created five exabytes of digital information....in the year 2010 the human race [was] generating five exabytes every two days. By the year 2013, the number will be five exabytes produced every ten minutes...It's no wonder we're exhausted.""

 Five hundred years ago, technologies were not doubling in power and halving in price every eighteen months. Waterwheels were not becoming cheaper every year. A hammer was not easier to use from one decade to the next. Iron was not increasing in strength. You could not upgrade your oxen's yoke every 12 months. Crop yields varied by seasonal climate instead of improving each year.For the first time in history, non-zero abundance is actually within our grasp. Technology has the potential to significantly raise the basic standards of living for every human on the planet. Within a generation, we will be able to provide goods and services once reserved for the wealthy few to any and all. 

""Right now a Masai warrior with a cell phone has better access to information than the president of the United States did just fifteen years ago...If we stop thinking of the world's poor as victims or as a burden and start recognizing them as resilient and creative entrepreneurs and value-concious consumers, a whole new world of opportunity opens up. The BoP [four billion people occupying the ""bottom of the pyramid"", surviving on less than $2 per day] market potential is huge: 4 to 5 billion underserved people and an economy of more than $13 trillion purchasing power parity""

 The bulk of this book describes hundreds of examples of resources becoming more abundant by means of disruptive technological breakthroughs in agriculture, healthcare, nanotech, biotech and AI etc. I would have liked to see a bit more coherent defense of the central argument, an overarching vision of how all these interconnected exponential breakthroughs make scarcity obsolete. Some of the chapters seemed a bit outdated or irrelevant to the premise of the book, for example too much emphasis on the Arab Spring and political changes brought by social media, the author's own X Prize, and a few others. There was a particularly weird chapter promoting low fertility rate, despite the fact low fertility rate presents a massive looming crisis for the global economy (shrinking consumer markets and underfunded pensions crisis)."
19,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"In her book This Changes Everything, Naomi Klein stated how much she disliked scientists who focused on innovation over conservation. For this reason, Klein would absolutely hate Peter Diamandis. He began his book with example after example of why we worry too much about depleting Earth's resources. He even went so far as to Kahneman shame his reader. (I have decided that Khaneman shame should be an actual term). I usually enjoy being Kahneman shamed because I know that even the most logical individuals among us hold biases that are held from their consciousness. But Diamandis' Kahneman shaming rubbed me the wrong way. I remember thinking, ""You are joking right? You are lecturing your reader while you are, yourself, failing to seek out evidence against your own argument?"" Clearly I was not a fan of this book, at first anyway. However, as I continued to read, I came to understand he is just terrible at conveying what steps he took to look at both sides of the coin. The early part of the book reads like a pollyanna approach to the future-- everything looks great! We shouldn't worry now or worry then. He didn't seem, to me, to engage in critical thinking in the way his colleague Kurzweil did, as evidenced by his constant homage to the old guard, gene jocks like Pinker and Ridley. However, toward the middle of the book he became more problem oriented and began to illustrate one solution after the other, and it was beautiful! Here are some examples of limited resources and the possible solutions for providing everyone on Earth with an abundance of these limited resources:- Water is hard to come by for those in many developing countries, but laying pipes that carry clean water to everyone around the globe is ridiculously costly. One solution to this problem is to provide them with filters that have pores only 15 nm wide (I love that someone invented such a filter)! That means water is filtered so thoroughly, it will even keep bacteria from getting through. Using these filters, people can turn undrinkable water into drinkable water in seconds at much less cost than running pipes all over the world. - Many people in developing countries don't have waste systems. When human waste sits around, humans get sick, very sick. Recall the plagues throughout history and the pandemics of more recent times. To address the lack of sanitation, the Malinda and Bill Gates Foundation is working to provide these countries with the best waste system I have ever heard of. They are providing high tech outhouses that powder and burn up feces. Human feces hold more than a megajoule of energy! When that energy is harvested and released by the powder and burn process, it can be used to get rid of the urine, and the left over energy can be sent to a grid and used to power things, such as a cell phone. I know Klein has it in for scientists who innovate over conserve, but Naomi, even you have to love this! Right? - Of course, providing water and waste systems to people around the world won't amount to much if we end up using more carbon in order to keep progress progressing. Poisoning our planet while trying to provide abundance would be the stupidest thing imaginable. Addressing that concern was perhaps the best part of the entire book. How can we have create an abundance of energy *and* keep atmosphere intact? There are many methods being researched and implemented that could provide not only the energy we need for daily life, but the energy needed to help combat climate change (not a bad plan if we can make it work). Diamandis is clear in his suggestion to take conservation efforts very seriously. I am certain he would suggest that we fight against Trump's plans for the usage of coal- and fight hard. Trump calls everything a huge disaster. Yet, he fights for coal, the use of which would actually be a huge disaster, on a global scale. Coal isn't just a little bit bad for Earth; it is one of the most significant contributors to climate change. That is precisely why there are regulations limiting and prohibiting its use. Our better bet, according to Diamandis, is to restrict the use of coal and use incentives to get the best minds all over our world to come up with alternative ways to generate energy, ways that don't have harmful waste products (e.g. carbon) that destroy our planet. So far, it's looking pretty promising. Now if we can only stop Trump and others like him until we can develop and implement safer energy generating mechanisms. - Providing an abundance of eduction to everyone around the world is also a really worthwhile goal. I loved the plans for this. It was not the first time I have read about these same methods-- computer / game oriented learning with oversight by teachers who are more like tutors than traditional tutors. This will not only solve the education crisis in developing countries, it might help fix the rigid teaching style that destroys plenty of children's love for learning in schools all over America. - With better global education comes longer-lived individuals who will need an abundance of access to healthcare. No problem. Innovators of the future have this covered. Smart medicine (e.g. smart phone diagnosis, surgeons in LA who robotically operate on patients in developing countries in their spare time, etc) will change the face of treatment. For more on this, I highly recommend Eric Topol's The Patient Will See You Now.- And finally, these healthy, well-educated individuals will need an abundance of access to political power. How can we help that happen? Through the internet of course, but as Diamandis will tell you, that might only be accessible to the young ;) "
20,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182996-marti,5,"Possibly the most fascinating nonfiction book I have read in a decade: a reader-friendly overview from the originator of the X Prize, this book covers advances and reasons for optimism in areas of food, water, shelter, energy, commerce, healthcare, education and more. While realistically laying out causes for concern (over-population, climate change, poverty), the author counters each of these with a solid reason for optimism. Many of these causes for hope come from advances in technology, but they do not rely either on large corporations or political will to implement. The growing D.I.Y. movement, or ""makers"" have a big part to play in this brighter future envisioned by the author. Worth a read if only for the ideas it sparks (""Wow, if that could happen, maybe this could happen . . .) and a refreshing change from the 24/7 news cycle based on ""if it bleeds, it leads"" -- in other words, bad news sells."

Cornucopians feel that the rate of technological growth will outpace the rate of population growth, and that will solve all our problems. Malthusians believe that we've already exceeded the planet's carrying capacity, and if population growth continues unchecked, nothing we invent will be powerful enough to reverse those effects.
I finally know what to call myself: I am definitely a Cornucopian (even if those killjoy Malthusians don't mean the term kindly). I am firmly within the camp that says that, no matter how badly industry -- and by extension, technology -- has messed up the planet so far, solutions will be found in the technology of the future. In Abundance, authors Peter H. Diamandis (of X Prize fame) and Steven Kotler (used here as a visible ghostwriter) provide the case for optimism.I'm just going to quote the book's summary from 
The New York Times
 here since they captured it and I'd only be paraphrasing:
His thesis rests on a four-legged stool. The first idea is that our technologies in computing, energy, medicine and a host of other areas are improving at such an exponential rate that they will soon enable breakthroughs we now barely think possible. Second, these technologies have empowered do-it-yourself innovators to achieve startling advances — in vehicle engineering, medical care and even synthetic biology — with scant resources and little manpower, so we can stop depending on big corporations or national laboratories. Third, technology has created a generation of techno-philanthropists (think Bill Gates) who are pouring their billions into solving seemingly intractable problems like hunger and disease. And finally, we have what Diamandis calls “the rising billion.” These are the world’s poor, who are now (thanks again to technology) able to lessen their burdens in profound ways. “For the first time ever,” Diamandis says, “the rising billion will have the remarkable power to identify, solve and implement their own abundance solutions.”
The rising billion is really the key here because, for instance, as seen with the rapid spread of cell phones in Africa (helped along by the fact that there was little vested interest in traditional copper wire phone infrastructure), this is one billion consumers who can be quick and early adopters of technology (which, with the economies of scale, is attractive to investors), and with connections to the global economy, they can then pull themselves out of poverty faster than a century of aid efforts have failed to achieve. And we are on the cusp of technology that will help this billion rise, with advances in water purifying, medicine, sanitation, and education. One example that intrigues me is the ""techno-toilet"": We have known for a hundred years that proper sanitation systems are needed to prevent diseases, but in remote locations with poor water supplies, it is unreasonable to plan a western-style sewer system. As an alternative, this techno-toilet is an affordable and self-contained unit that burns feces (using the feces as its power source), and this is such an efficient process that it generates more energy than it consumes. It can then not only zap urine into clean water and table salt (!), but there is still enough energy left in the system for a family to charge their cell phones and laptops with. Abundance is full of these examples -- from 100% safe backyard nuclear generators to vertical farms that could provide year-round food supplies for urban centers -- and as the book was written in 2012 (already three years old as I write this) I can only assume that there have been even more advances, with the technology progressively becoming more efficient and affordable all the time. Diamandis is enthusiastic about the future and his views here confirm my own optimism.On the other hand, having just read Dave Eggers' The Circle, it's interesting that many of the advances that Eggers warns will eventually enslave us, are here presented as exciting breakthroughs. The ""Internet of Things"" (like a central nervous system for the planet, connecting every thing on earth through ""a self-configuring, wireless network of sensors"") was a concept that some people found off-putting in The Circle, as was LOC (lab on a chip) technology that will automatically upload all of a person's medical data to the cloud to be analysed for ""deeper patterns"". Most alarming to me was when Diamandis quoted Google cofounder Larry Page as saying, ""Google will be included in people's brains. When you think about something you don't know much about, you will automatically get the information."" I don't want any of this! And if I can add one more caveat: I appreciate the concept of raising up the bottom billion and providing them with the building blocks of Diamandis' Abundance Pyramid:  
And while I understand that people can't realise their full potential and become, themselves, innovators without having all of these basic needs met, I just want to point out that I live in a community where these needs are indeed all met and yet I know very few innovators. Raise up the bottom billion and how long will it be until you have a billion more people spending their hours on Candy Crush and cat videos?Yes, Abundance reads like a collection of TED talks, so it might suffer from a degree of gee whiz naiveté, but I remain hopeful for the future of humanity. Yes, technology has led us to where we are (which is unsustainable but a pretty great place from my perch) and technology will lead us to where we need to go."
23,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48484712-nicole-anderson,5,"Authors Peter H. Diamandis and Steve Kotler have created just about the perfect handbook when it comes to envisioning a technically advanced, democratic and thriving society. Written in 2012, this book is still an important read for anyone who’s interested in a technical future where humanity finally rises above the mire it has been tethered to for millennia.Much can be said about the book, but there are two aspects that put Abundance at the top of my recommended reading list. First, Diamandis starts out by addressing the most obvious elephant in the room when it comes to hindering progress: our Cognitive Biases. We tend to be negative creatures, programmed from birth to fear our world and each other. Scarcity is driven into our minds, from supply-side economics to original sin. The media focuses on bad news because that’s what the human mind responds to. While we claim to desire happiness and peace, most people simply don’t believe that they, or anyone else, deserve it.Diamandis goes straight to the heart of the matter by addressing this flaw, and why it holds us back. The reason technology hasn’t lived up to its promise is because we’ve been thwarting progress with our negativity. In order to free technology and allow it to evolve, we too must free our own minds and evolve from our reptilian, amygdala driven patterns, to higher order thinking and use of the frontal lobes of our brains. This is not a simple task, but in the grand scheme of things, there’s nothing more important than for us to realize that life is actually much better than it’s ever been and that the future will serve us even more when we trust in the abundance of both the Earth and our capabilities.Basically we need to rewire our brains. We’re still heavily relying on a hardware platform designed to keep us safe from wild animals, weather and other threats our ancient ancestors had to deal with. As Diamandis writes,“…our early warning system evolved in an era of immediacy, when threats were of the tiger-in-the-bush variety. Things have changed. Many of today’s dangers are probabilistic—the economy might nose-dive, there could be a terrorist attack—and the amygdala can’t tell the difference. Worse, the system is also designed not to shut off until the potential danger has vanished completely, but probabilistic dangers never vanish completely.”Physically our brains have grown in size, particularly in the frontal lobe, since the days of the caveman. We have an entire neurology we can embrace, and with it, a totally different perspective of life. Essentially we’ve evolved the hardware to be capable of seeing the systems before us and know that scarcity is something we can overcome, if we chose to believe in it. There’s really no other way.As long as we remain stuck in the endless negative threat loop, our technology will be held hostage by fearful minds.Diamandis goes on to point out,“For abundance, all this carries a triple penalty. First, it’s hard to be optimistic, because the brain’s filtering architecture is pessimistic by design. Second, good news is drowned out, because it’s in the media’s best interest to overemphasize the bad. Third, scientists have discovered an even bigger cost: it’s not just that these survival instincts make us believe that the hold we’re in is too big to climb out of, but they also limit our desire to climb out of that hole.”What follows after this realization is an attempt by the authors to show your logical brain, that part of you that thinks beyond threat, why you can believe in a better future, using both science and personal stories to prove their point. It’s a brilliant exercise in cheerleading for their cause: an abundant future for all Earth’s citizens.The second reason I recommend this book is because of its treatment of the BOP, or the over four billion people on our planet who live at the Bottom of The Pyramid, on less than $2 a day. Imagine it, four billion of us live in extreme poverty. Many of us spin our wheels trying to figure out how to get our resources to this group. This book actually gives us a blueprint that doesn’t merely suggest we share our resources with these folks, rather that we make the resources of the Earth and technology available to them in a variety of ways. From Technophilanthropists to the effects of putting cheap Smartphones in the pockets of villagers in West Africa, the possibilities to liberate half the world from poverty are literally in the palm of our hands.For example, we in the west often look at our Smartphones as luxuries, but to someone in the BOP, it’s a way to share goods with others, discover information about clean water sources, and inform the world when violence erupts in the middle of the night. As they come online, they become a part of the global economy, which changes everything.Not enough is written about the BOP as a group of consumers. Recipients of charity, yes. But as the old saying goes, “You can give a man a fish, but better to teach him how to fish,” the same holds true for the BOP and technology. This is the market place where solar paneled eco-friendly housing and inexpensive water filtration systems will come to be. Food distribution and agriculture as we know it will dramatically change when we invest in the BOP, which in turn will teach us how to manage the world when 9 billion of us roam the streets.Abundance—The Future is Better Than You Think was a great read, and belongs on home bookshelves everywhere. Next on my reading list, BOLD, the authors how-to-guide follow up. If anyone can inspire us to make a difference, it’s Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler. "
24,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56007-siah,2,"This book trivializes the magnitude of some of our greatest existential challenges as humans. The authors use simplistic analogies and argue that technology fixes all of our problems. From climate change to war. Some of the problems that they enumerate have nothing to with technology and that is my primary problem with this book. For instance, take the problem of excess green house gases in the atmosphere, this has become a political and policy challenge rather than a technology challenge. One can realize the childish view when the authors talk about 3D printing as a paradigm shift technology. A few years after the writing we all know these ideas did not pan out. Having drinkable water is a much bigger problem than funding open source robotics projects. I find the message in this book to possibly appeal to folks who believe in a creator who magically takes care of our future. Everyone else should look at this as just one side of a very complex story. "
25,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86691220-jaguar,5,"I thought that I wouldn't be interested in this book, so I put it aside. Now that I'm in quarantine I decided to give it a try. I was AMAZED!!Normally, I don't care about business, science, technology, etc. When I first started reading this book, I thought that I wouldn't understand anything. Quite the opposite. The authors word everything in a way that someone who has no knowledge about the topic can understand. I really enjoyed it, and I learned quite a lot."

27,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"A Technology Maven's Vision of Humanity's Bright FuturePeter Diamandis envisions a world in which humanity triumphs against all its challenges, from climate change, overpopulation, and poverty to the planetary deficits in energy and water. This is not science fiction. It’s an eye-opening survey of what one celebrated technology visionary perceives as a feasible future for our species. As Diamandis writes, “Abundance is a tale of good news. At its core, this book examines the hard facts, the science and engineering, the social trends and economic forces that are rapidly transforming our world. . . The point is this: When seen through the lens of technology, few resources are truly scarce; they’re mainly inaccessible. Yet the threat of scarcity still dominates our worldview.” Diamandis is unusually well qualified to write this book. He is a Harvard-trained physician and an aeronautical engineer with a master’s degree from MIT. Ever since the age of 8, he has been preoccupied with space exploration. He has founded or co-founded a half-dozen businesses and organizations involved in that field and is widely credited with being the seminal figure in jump-starting the private space exploration business with the $10 million Ansari X Prize that led to the flight of SpaceShipOne. In Abundance, co-written with Steven Kotler and published February 2012, Diamandis veers far from the course he set in space, settling down to earth to explore how humankind can leverage emerging technologies to confront its most pressing problems. Though Diamandis’ focus is squarely on the exponential growth in speed, capability, and spread of information processing technologies, he is not a gadget freak. He recognizes the social and political context in which technology is brought to light, although he may downplay the ferocity of humanity’s innate resistance to change. He writes about “game-changing” technologies, such as the “Lab-on-a-Chip . . . a portable, cell-phone-sized device [that] will allow doctors, nurses, and even patients themselves to take a sample of bodily fluid (such as urine, sputum, or a single drop of blood) and run dozens, if not hundreds, of diagnostics on the spot and in a manner of minutes.” He cites other potential breakthrough technologies now being developed by such luminaries as inventor Dean Kamen and biogeneticist Craig Venter. For anyone but a Luddite, Abundance is exciting to read. Diamandis clearly believes that the technological advances he writes about hold promise of a much brighter future for humanity despite the anticipated growth in the world’s population to nine billion by 2050. (He even points to growing “in vitro” meat as one solution to the fast-rising demand for protein by ever more prosperous people.) For a science fiction fan such as myself, it’s difficult not to get starry-eyed. However, the principal flaw in his line of reasoning is that, no matter how promising these new devices and processes might be, it’s not practical to assume that they’ll be quickly adopted around the world. That Lab-on-a-Chip sound wonderful? Great! But how many years will it take to put one billion copies of that device into the hands of the nurses running rural health clinics in Western Kenya and Uttar Pradesh and everywhere else in our wide, wide world? And how much will that cost? And will the spread of the device be rapid enough to prevent what other futurists see as the inevitable pandemics of new communicable diseases? Similar questions arise about nearly every one of the marvelous inventions cited in Abundance. Peter Diamandis, founder and chairman of the X Prize Foundation and cofounder of Singularity University, laid out his vision of abundance in earth’s future in a brilliant TED2012 talk. The themes he introduced onstage at TED are explored in depth in this book. To give some sense of the exalted circles in which Diamandis travels, here are some of the trustees of the X Prize Foundation: Larry Page, Elon Musk, James Cameron, Dean Kamen, Ratan Tata, Ray Kurzweil, Arianna Huffington, and Craig Venter, every one of whom would figure in anyone’s list of the brightest and most innovative thinkers and doers in the world.(From www.malwarwickonbooks.com)"
28,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20495277-anny,4,"I love how this book gave a glimpse of the wonders that technology could bring to us. Water-filter that can filter just about anything liquid (seawater, sewage water, factory wastes, etc) to drinkable water. Solar power to replace our fossil fuel power, abundant, renewable, eco-friendly, cheap (hopefully in the coming years). Internet helping to connect people with abundant resources to those that needed them (be it in the form of loans or crowd-funding). Genetics and nano-technology that will help us live longer and healthier. In fact, what used to be miracles was now our reality, where the lame can walk (prosthetic limbs getting better and better), the deaf can hear, and the blind can see (the newest technology feed visual signals directly to our brain, enabling us to 'see').But, I disagree with the author's view that abundance for all are within our reach in twenty or thirty years coming. That, I reckoned, was way too optimistic. First, the technology that I mentioned before could take decades before they are available on the market and even then only affordable for those with money. Second, having read Grapes of wrath before this book, I believe abundance in goods does not translate to abundance for all. The starving people in California had an abundance of foods around them, and yet their children died for lack of food.Technology after all, are merely tools, and tools can either be used for good or for evil. Thus, it does not follow that improvement in technology meant improvement in life for everyone. Yes, it will mean better lives for some (or for many), but I think it will be a long long way still before this earth would become a paradise of abundance for all."

I hope these guys are right, but since their claim is based on a few cool tricks and the other one is based on rigorous data, I doubt it. Still, this is worth reading because I think half the premise is sound: technological answers to intractable problems are in the wings. The future will not be as anticipated. However, there are several broad economic and political trends that make me think that we need more than technology and their cool X project to make the world a better place. I also worry that so many people look to tech as the answer to problems that actually need policy to change. Like poverty for example. Technology may be able to make drinking water more accessible, and that should be celebrated, but that doesn't eliminate the other factors."

35,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7499654-maria-lasprilla,5,"The best and most useful book I have read in a while. I am extremely happy with having chosen to read it during a long vacation as it required my mind being rested and focused to absorb all the goodness in it.The book first reinforced my distaste for reading newspaper. Traditional media is full of useless negativity. But that was just the beginning. What it did best was filled me in a very compressed way with all the technological advancements we are making in this time of human history that, combined, can help us solve the problems we have as a civilization. 300 pages of factual optimism that recharges my desire to do bigger things, but in an organized way, and not in the romantic way of my twenty-odd self. Plus there are about 40 pages of graphs from differente sources backing all that optimism up.All the information in it is something I was somewhat or pretty aware of. The beauty of this book is seeing it all related and helping me create a wider view of things that otherwise is really hard to achieve without long hours of study.One important point the book makes is what ""abundance"" refers to in the point they try to make. Starting with that, here are some good quotes from the book:""Abundance is not about providing everyone on this planet with a life of luxyry- rather it's about providing all with a life of possibility"" (p.13).""Scarcity is often contextual (...). Technology is a resource-liberating mechanism. It can make the once scarce now abundant"". (p.4)(Quoting Sir Ken Robinson): ""Our education system rarely give people permission to be themselves. But if you can't be yourself, it's hard to know yourself, and if you don't know yourself, how can you ever tap into your true potential?"" (p.180)""What we do know is that the industrialized model of education, with its emphasis on rote memorization of facts, is no longer necessary. Facts are what Google does best. But creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, and problem solving [are] skills repeatedly stressed by everyone as the fundamentals required by today's jobs."" (p. 181)""While ICT is clearly the greatest tool for self-empowerment we've yet seen, it's still only a tool, and, like all tools, is fundamentally neutral. A hammer can build bridges or bash brains (...). What ICT does guarantee is an exceptionally broad platform for cooperation"". (p. 213)""You need to be a little crazy to change the world, and you can't really fake it. If you don't believe in the possibility, then you'll never give it the 200 percent effort required."" (p. 233)""Abundance is both a plan and a perspective (...) our perspective shapes our reality."" (p. 239)."
36,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67905927-william-ng,3,"Thesis: Despite challenges facing humanity due to an increase in population and living standards, the future is better than we think because of innovation and technology. Right now, we're experiencing an unprecedented acceleration in technology, bridging the gap between the ""haves"" and the ""have nots."" This applies in terms of access to resources such as water and food, education, healthcare, and so forth. Technology increases our ability to turn scarce resources into abundant resources. Technology will also solve our educational woes by flattening the structure of how learning takes place, encouraging self directed learning in small groups instead. Pros: I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the various innovative ideas and organizations presented in this book. It really challenges decades old assumptions about the world in terms of the scarcity of resources and how they are distributed. Furthermore, it really pushes socially responsible endeavors and investments. The possibilities are endless with technology and companies that have a socially sustainable core value.Cons: The author seems a bit too optimistic about the trends of technology and the ability of technology to solve all of our social and economic woes. While yes, technology occupies an integral part of societal plans moving forward, it doesn't address the implementation aspect of it all. Case in point, many of the companies he talks about as promising great results have since gone bankrupt just a few years later (Tribogenics for example). That's one problem with trying to predict the future with such an optimistic hope. Bottom Line: It's a book worth reading if not just to expose yourself to new ideas, new trends, and a new outlook on how to solve massive global problems. It's also inspiring that so many wealthy individuals have taken on philanthropic efforts to ensure that their wealth is being used to help the world grow more sustainably. However, it's rather outdated at this point in time and the specific examples he uses might not apply anymore."

While he, like Kevin Kelly, doesn't ask the ""should we"" question but rather focuses on all the ways we can, he does so from a cohesive and coherent worldview, and one that we can very much appreciate.Taking a cue from Maslow, Diamandis has a basis for his vision. He wants everyone to have access to clean water, nutritious food, affordable housing, personalized education, top-tier medical care, and nonpolluting ubiquitous energy. While you might read of that list of ""demands"" and chuckle quietly to yourself, after you've read the book, you'll be dazzled by all the possibilities that exist in a ""post scarcity"" world. (quoting Matt Ridley) ""The true measure of something's worth is the hours it takes to acquire it."" (p. 40)(quoting Larry Page) ""I now have a very simple metric I use: are you working on something that can change the world? Yes or no? The answer for 99.999999 percent of people is 'no.'"" (p. 73)(quoting Clay Shirky) ""If we were to forgo our television addiction for just one year, the world would have over a trillion hours of cognitive surplus to commit to share projects."" (p. 83)Don't miss the Appendix, entitled ""Dangers of the Exponentials"" in which Diamandis looks at the worst-case scenarios involving three prominent threats: bioterrorism, cybercrime, and robot replacement of human labor/removal of the impetus for ""work."""

Clean water is extremely important - and we need solutions which can be easily maintained, parts easily replace-able and readily available.2. Food: Genetically engineered seeds will take us closer to feeding the hungry. So will vertical farms and hydroponics. We can get protein from cultured meat, where we don't 'grow an entire chicken to eat the breast or wing'. 3. Dematerialization: A single smart phone has replaced cameras, radios, clocks, GPS navigators, dictionaries etc. 4. Energy is the most important lynchpin for abundance. The future is solar, and there are technologies coming up which let you 'store' it for later use. 5. Technology has a bias for individual empowerment. Change is being driven by a fundamental property of tech - 'the adjacent possible' - for ex, the invention of wheel opened up pathways which were completely off-limits before. A long list of first order possibilities open up with a new discovery.6. Technophilanthropists, DIY innovators motivated by incentive based competitions give us opportunities to brainstorm on solutions without waiting for the govt or major corporations to do this. 7. Banning tech is not a solution to problems like bioterrorism, cyber crime etc. This just creates a black market for these, hurts small businesses and makes researchers move to areas not deemed illegal."

One common theme is how technology has and will keep changing the world for the better. In Abundance Diamandis and Kotler describes how four emerging forces—exponential technologies, the DIY innovator, the Technophilanthropist, and the Rising Billion—are moving us from a world of scarcity to a world of abundance. It's such a refreshing read. The key is exponentially growing technologies like AI, robotics, infinite computing, ubiquitous broadband networks, digital manufacturing, nanomaterials, synthetic biology, etc. Technology is a resource liberating mechanism. It can make the once scarce the now abundant. In the book they introduce a new version of Maslov's famous hierarchy of needs. They have only 3 steps and start with a foundation of Food, Water, Shelter.

The many entrepreneurs, technology and futurist authors referenced in the book include Marvin Misnky, Nathan Myhrvold, Nicholas Negroponte, Ray Kurzweil, Kevin Kelly, even sci-fi novelist Neal Stephenson and many more!Some data was a bit biased but clear to get the idea of abundance of opportunities. This is an optimistic's book written to people looking for a reason to be optimistic when you see a rotten sick world out there.My favorite idea from the book was: Education is boring at schools and many courses are not even needed for daily life so they are quick forgotten.

The book presents a lot of key concepts such as dematerialization that will be essential in the future and he does it in such a way that is very easy to understand, no real economics or tech background needed.

When we rework education, we get better results - better in that they do in fact lead to accessible abundance. We must teach every child on the planet the basics of literacy, mathematics, life skills, and critical thinking - not the retention of facts, many of which they can simply do a Google search for now, and are the old news of scarcity.4. We need to ask ourselves why change has been slow in certain areas: We've settled for less, and we no longer have to settle because possibility has exploded. Quote: ""Abundance is not about providing everyone on this planet with a life of luxury - rather it's about providing all with a life of possibility... It also means stanching some fairly ridiculous bleeding. Ultimately, abundance is about CREATING our world of possibility: a world where everyone's days are spent dreaming and doing, not scrapping and scraping.""Selected quotes:""One of the better responses to the threat of scarcity is not to try to slice our pie thinner - rather it's to figure out how to make more pies.""""For the first time in history, our capabilities have begun to catch up to our ambitions. Humanity is now entering a period of radical transformation in which technology has the potential to significantly raise the basic standards of living for every man, woman, and child on the planet. Within a generation, we will be able to provide goods and services, once reserved for the wealthy few, to any and all who need them. Or desire them. Abundance for all is actually within our grasp.""""CULTURE (my caps) is the ability to store, exchange, and improve ideas. This vast cooperative system has always been one of abundance's largest engines. When the good ideas of your grandfather [or your predecessors in great work (- mine)] can be improved upon by the good ideas of your grandchildren, that engine is up and running.""And -""Human culture, and SCHOOL (my caps) is a fundamental component of how we pass along that culture [as is the workplace! (- mine)] is really a set of permissions. Permission to be different, permission to be creative. Our education systems rarely give people permission to be themselves. But if you can't be yourself, it's hard to know yourself, and if you don't know yourself, how can you ever tap into your true potential?""""If boredom is the number one cause of truancy [as experts claim and statistics reveal], then our new education system needs to be effective, scalable, and wildly entertaining. In fact, wildly entertaining might not be enough. If we really want to prepare our children for the future, then learning needs to become addictive.""Please read this book and become hopeful too. To be frank, I gave it 5 stars because I think we all NEED to read it!- Part One covers our Perspective, and how we need to change it for our own good. It explores the promise of abundance.- Part Two covers the powerful ""Exponential Technologies"" which the authors are familiar with, giving them their viewpoints - it expanded my own viewpoint quite effectively.- Part Three covers what most of us consider the basics in sustainability because realistically, these must get better in the next 2 or 3 decades of our immediate future: Cooperation, water issues, and food issues.- Part Four shares the Forces of Abundance - how our better future is meant to happen sooner than we think too. The catalysts for future growth we do have access to, are abundant energy, ample education opportunities, and ubiquitous communications and information.- Part Five acknowledges that a world of abundance requires a lot of energy, and thus, it looks at how we can power our planet in the decades to come, with Energy, Education, Health Care, and Freedom.- Part Six is called ""Steering Faster"" because Quote: ""this transformation [to better] is not inevitable. To go where we need to go also requires accelerating the rate of innovation, increasing global collaboration, and - perhaps more importantly - expanding our notions of the possible."""

There are some really innovative ideas in here. Chapter 9?really kind of creeped me out with the idea to make any kind of meat you want by genetically modifying it. The ideas of how farming will change in the future is just crazy! And probably not too far off to feed our ever growing population. "

From overpopulation, water crisis to greenhouse gases. While the numbers don't lie and might be worse than before in certain areas. It's great to read a book about the opportunity that lies ahead us and the people working on it. Really inspires you to see a vision of a better future. More importantly see the good that we've achieved in the last 100 years. From reduction in child mortality rates, an increase in well being, just the amount of time technology saves us. Peter Diamandis, isn't a lofty fool with cooked up numbers. He talks in detail about how we can make the world a better place by solving one problem at a time and the technologies which will allow us to achieve it and in the near future. Great read."

Abundance is about creating win-win-win solutions so that everyone can win. It's about doing what is right even if it's the difficult path to take. If we choose wisely, everyone can win.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to create a happier future for everyone."
49,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43739790-brian,5,"Abundance, by Peter Diamandis, is replete with optimism about the future, a well-needed antidote to the pessimism all around us. I purchased this book as a counterbalance to the novel Dry, by Neal Shusterman and Jarrod Shusterman, and it amply served its purpose. There are so many wonderful ways in which innovation has enabled us to constantly improve our lives. Malthusian predictions about severe weather, the end of oil, mass starvation, deforestation, inequity, racism, sexism, and the like distract us from moving forward to tangibly make the world a better place.Diamandis focuses not only on the incentives and methods we have used to make considerable progress in the world so far, but also on initiatives and incentives that promise a prosperous, healthy future. His book is a great companion to Steve Pinker's Enlightenment Now, which focuses on all of the wonderful things happening in the world."
50,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5076380-connor-stack,3,"This book was published in 2012 but I read it 2018, so I got to look up how a lot of his predictions panned out. And a lot of them did not turn out well. For example, the sustainable city Masdar mentioned near the beginning still only has grad students living in it. The energy company Aquion is bankrupt. I realize part of his argument is that we should be trying lots of stuff and failing at most of it, but you don't necessarily take that to heart when you're reading about all these amazing technologies.On the other hand, this book legitimately changed my view on water scarcity. Aluminum used to be super expensive, but it's the third most common element in Earth's crust. Once we figured out a cheap way to extract it, it became disposable. 97% of water on earth is salt water. If we can make desalination cheap, water scarcity means a lot less. Same goes for electricity. More solar energy reaches the earth than we'll ever need, if we can only utilize it cheaply."

55,1451614217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10110483-rick-howard,4,"Peter Diamandis and Ray Kurzwell founded Singularity University back in 2008. Their mission is to ""educate, inspire, and empower leaders to apply exponential technologies to address humanity’s grand challenges.” [1] Exponential Technologies Definition: Systems or tools where ""the power and/or speed doubles each year, and/or the cost drops by half.” [2] At the university’s founding, Diamandis and Kurzwell appointed Salim Ismail to be the school’s executive director and global ambassador. [3] Their joint vision, their Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP), is to ""Build an Abundant Future Together.” [2] Diamandis published “Abundance” in 2012 in order to explain the abundance concept to the world. [4] Later, in 2014, Ismail published “Exponential Organizations” to explain how modern business could take advantage of these exponential technologies and build leaner and more efficient companies in an abundant world. [5] So, just what do these visionaries mean when they talk about Abundance?Abundance is this radical idea that exponential technologies, those that meet the definition above, will flip our common notion about scarcity. For example, we all think about oil as a scarce resource because it is hard to get oil out of the ground. Oil companies make money by selling that scarcity because the typical consumer does not have the means to do it themselves. But in an abundant future, the cost of solar power and the exponential technologies that drive it might become so cheap that energy becomes essentially free for every person on the planet. Pause for a second and let that idea roll over you. Free energy for everybody on the planet. The mind boggles.In that future, oil companies would find themselves in an abundant world where their demonstrated expertise to get oil out of the ground is no longer needed. If this happens, this would be a classic case of Diamandis Six Ds of Exponentials; a predictable and observable transformational process that is occurring in many business sectors where exponential technologies are present: Digitization: Once a technology becomes digitized, it is easy to access, share, and distribute. Solar went digital about 25 years ago. [6] [7] [8]Deception: After digitization, growth is deceptively small until the numbers break the whole-number barrier. [9] If the speed of your exponential technology grows from .034 to .068, most will not notice. But once it grows to 1.088, that is crossing the whole-number barrier. When it grows ten more times, that number becomes exponential: 38,788.92. That is exactly what has been happening to the solar energy sector and the exponential technologies that drive it for the past 25 years. [4]Disruption: After the whole-number barrier is broken, the existing market is disrupted by the new market’s effectiveness and cost. [9] In the energy business, pundits call this the Utility Death Spiral as many utility companies have banned together to lobby against the proliferation of solar. [10]Demonetization: The technology increasingly becomes cheaper. [9] In 1998, residential solar power installation cost was $12 per WATT. In 2015, home owners pay under $4 per WATT. [11] In 2017, one home owner went from paying $250 a month for electricity to paying zero. [12]Dematerialization: Physical products are moved. [9] As more people move to Solar power, oil company refineries will start to vanish. The reliance of utility companies to distribute power start to disappear replaced by the individual home owner’s ability to generate and store their own power. [13]Democratization. Once the other 5 Ds happen, the technology price is so cheap that anybody can have it. [9] Energy flips from being a scarce resource to being an abundant resource.According to Diamandis, Kurzweil, and Ismail, this Abundance idea of the future is not a science fiction fantasy either. It is happening right before our eyes. They say that the world will flip from scarcity to abundance in the next 20 years for certain of humanity’s “Grand Challenges:"" FoodWaterShelterEnergyCommunicationEducationHealthcareFreedomKurzweil came up with an interesting metric to track this exponential technology behavior in his book, ""The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology:” What are the number of calculations per second that technology can perform for $1,000? [14] In 1900, with Charles Babbage’s mechanical Analytical Engine, the number of calculations was extremely small; only 0.000005821. But every five to ten years, that numbered doubled. By 1949, the number was 1.837, and we were off to the races. By 1977, the number was 26,870. By 1998, the last year in the study, the number was 133,300,000. [15] [16] That is demonstrated exponential growth. And even though Diamandis does not include cybersecurity in his list of grand challenges, you can certainly start to see the affects of the Six D’s on the network defender community: Digitization: More and more network defenders are putting their log data in the cloud where third parties can get access.Deception: This is the phase we are now but not many have noticed yet.Disruption: After the whole-number barrier is broken, the disruption will happen at the point product vendors.Demonetization: Network defenders will realize they don’t need point products to perform a specific task in their networks. They will get those services from the cloud at a much cheaper rate.Dematerialization: Point products start to disappear.Democratization. Cloud security services delivered to very cheap enforcement points makes it possible for anybody to get open source security services essentially for free.The authors are quick to point out that just because exponential growth is happening in many interesting technological areas doesn’t guarantee that the world’s entrepreneurial and technological leadership will build solutions to take advantage of it. The Singularity University's founders established the school just for that purpose. But they also realized that more emphasis is needed. The “Abundance” authors suggest that another way to encourage investment in exponential technologies is to create incentive competitions. [4]. The prizes establish a competition with a specific goal in mind and offer a high value prize as an incentive.A Sample Set of Incentive PrizesPrize: The Orteig Prize ($25,000) [4]Problem: First nonstop aircraft flight between New York and Paris.Winner: Chalres Lindberg in 1927Prize: The XPrize ($10 M) [17]Problem: The first commercial, reusable 3-person spaceship.Winner: Richard Branson in 2004Prize: The Google Lunar XPrize ($30 M) [18]Problem: Land on the moon, travel 500 meters, transmit high definition videos back to earthWinner: Nobody yetPrize: The Wendy Schmidth Ocean Health XPrize ($2 M) [19]Problem: Create PH Sensor technology that will affordably, accurately, and efficiently measure ocean chemistry.Winner: Sunburst Sensors, ANB Sensors, and Team DurafetPrize: The Qualcomm Tricorder XPrize ($10 M) [20]Problem: Build a device that will accurately diagnose 13 health conditions and capture five real-time health vital signs, independent of a health care worker or facility, and in a way that provides a compelling consumer experience.Winner: Final Frontier Medical Devices and Dynamical Biomarkers GroupI admit that the naive and hopeful side of me really wants the ideas expressed in “Abundance"" to be true. The notion that many of the world’s “grand challenges” that I have been exposed to in my life could literally dematerialize because science found a solution to them does my science-fiction-fanboy side good. The cynic side of me though is grappling with the nagging notion that if it sounds too good to be true, then maybe it is. I am slightly concerned that the “Abundance” authors might just be a highly exponential form of the huckster. Diamandis, Ismail, and Kurzweil have certainly built a cottage industry around these ideas. That said, the grand challenges they identified are certainly following their “Six Ds of Exponentials;"" especially in energy. Most are tantalizingly just 15 to 20 years away. That said, I am not recommending “Abundance” as a must read for the Cybersecurity Canon Project today. The ideas that the authors discuss will not improve your current defensive posture. But, if the authors are correct, exponential technologies will significantly impact how we all deploy security technology in the very near future. If you are intrigued by the abundance concept, this is the book for you.Sources[1] “Commonly Asked Questions: Some of the most common questions about what we do,” by Singularity University, Last Visited 20180813,https://su.org/about/faq/ [2] ""An Exponential Primer: Your guide to our essential concepts,” by Singularity University, Last Visited 20180813,https://su.org/concepts/[3] “Salim Ismail,” Last Visited 20180813,http://www.salimismail.com/[4] ""Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think,” by Peter H.
