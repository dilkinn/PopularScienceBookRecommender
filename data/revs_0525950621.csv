0,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-extremely-stable-genius,2,"This book was rather dry. With the title being fear I kind of expected it to be more dramatic. Not so much.In this book Mr. Gardner reveals to us that the stuff we are scared of, most of the time is really not what we should worry about. He points out how the news media will pick up a story and run with it because it is sensational. Fear sells. Then we will get all paranoid about it. I could have told you that.Pesticides for example, are not all that bad, because what we ingest is not enough to harm us. They have been demonized, but without them we would all be dying from malaria. What doesn’t kill you just makes you stronger, but I think if you can at all possible to avoid pesticides, why not?Cancer is another thing on our minds. He points out that we are living longer than we ever have, and with increased age the odds of getting cancer increases as well. Instead, we worry chemicals are causing the increased cancer. The problem is that everything is a chemical; just some are man made and most are not. Chlorine is a chemical and some people talk about removing it from the drinking water…..bad chemical…..bad! What that would do is cause widespread death from diseases such as diphtheria. Diphtheria kills children. Which brings me to a point that was not brought up in the book, vaccination. People in this country have kind of lost their noodles over vaccinating their children. The reason for this was someone somewhere linked autism with vaccination. This has never been proven. But a whole bunch of parents have refused to vaccinate their children for fear of autism. “Hello un-vaccinated child.” Said diphtheria. Diphtheria + child = deadVaccination + Child = Alive child with maybe, but not likely, autism.Terrorism. Another thing we all fear (well, except me). The odds of getting killed in a terrorist attack in very very very small, yet we spend a shit ton of money on counter terrorism. This money would be better spent on universal health care. By not wasting the cash on anti terrorism, and covering everybody medically, the country would save so much money."

Before I read the book, I knew that a lot of groups (political, product-marketing, health service related, etc.) were trying to motivate me by blasting me with ""threat of the moment"" scenarios in which I was left helpless, broke and disease-ridden, if alive at all. Gardiner does a valuable service by pulling the curtain back on these manipulators and putting their exhortations in perspective. Understanding what pushes our ""hot buttons"" is one of the steps to taking control back from the fear-mongers. "
2,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,".Okay, I’ll own up. Deep down, and not so deep down, I’m the sort of gal who could walk up and down Oxford Street with a placard on my back saying “THE END OF THE WORLD IS NIGH”. My outlook is definitely pessimistic. This book on the other hand is the absolute opposite, arguing from beginning to end that we should be a whole stack less worried than we are. It therefore gave me a very bumpy ride. To say it was counter-intuitive was putting it mildly.Dan Gardner’s basic premise is that we have two types of thinking – system one is conscious thought – The Head, and system two is unconscious thought – The Gut. “Head is our best bet for accurate results but it has its limitations. First, Head needs to be educated. We live in a world of complex information, and if Head doesn’t learn the basics of math, stats, and logic....it can make bad mistakes. Head also works very slowly.” Gut on the other had works very fast. It makes snap judgements, and usually works intuitively.  The Head THINKS. Throughout the book Gardner shows with fearsome clarity the degree to which the media, politics and organisations are Gut driven in their dealings with us, and time and time again he begs us to bring our Head, our THINKING, into the equation.Our gut is easily swayed by that which is emotional, recent, novel, sensational and frightening - and we need to fight to bring our slow-burning , thorough and thinking Head into the ways in which we negotiate the world. It helps if we are numerate. It helps if we look for statistics. It helps if we seek out the bigger picture.The factual patchiness and ineptitude of a lot of press releases is pretty mind-boggling, and given the time constraints that journalists work under nowadays – press releases are often the only sources they use for information. Grass roots research is seldom conducted, and press releases rule. We need to work to try and see the bigger picture, not just the emotive slant and woolly statistics so often presented in off-the-cuff newspaper articles.Companies use our fear to sell us things, and they are not the only culprits. In 1920 H.L. Mencken wrote “the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.” This doesn’t mean the politicians don’t themselves buy into the scaremongering. They do. But everything gets blown up out of all proportion as our Gut overrules our Head and runs down the road screaming– fired by fears of terrorism, nuclear attacks, gun outrages, paedophile activity, cancer, violent crime and chemical overload. Much of Dan Gardner’s task throughout this book is to counteract our fears in respect to these 21st century spectres. He doesn’t say there aren’t grounds for concern, but he does say that our fears are often grossly exaggerated. Our Gut is having a field day.This book was good for me. The degree to which it poked me out of my blinkered pessimism was laudable. I therefore give it five stars. I think all grumpy old ladies should read this book at least once a year."
3,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5717792-scott-rhee,5,"Daniel Gardner's ""The Science of Fear"" is an immensely readable and fascinating examination of the culture of fear that we live in and how it consistently makes us do stupid things. Gardner is fond of quoting FDR's famous quote, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" several times throughout the book, but he emphasizes that what FDR is referring to is not healthy fear (the kind that has helped our species to survive this long) but an ""unreasoning, unjustified"" fear. This kind of fear he is referring to is the same kind of fear that made a majority of people switch from flying to driving in the months following 9/11, even though, statistically, flying is still the safest means of travel. What was the outcome? Between September 2001 and September 2002, the number of fatalities due to car accidents skyrocketed. Indeed, many more people died from car accidents in that year alone than died in 9/11, and yet very few people actually know this fact. And, in fact, most people, if asked, still think driving in their own car is safer than flying in an airplane. Thanks to the media, the entertainment industry, politicians, and businesses who stand to profit from fear, we are constantly bombarded with all sorts of horrible things of which to be afraid, from terrorism, car-jacking, global warming, viral epidemics, baby car seats, Obamacare, etc. An entire industry has been created to manipulate the way we vote, shop, think, and behave. Of course, according to Gardner, it's not hard to manipulate our brains through fear. Evolutionarily, our brains have not changed much since early caveman times. The way we deal with fear is the same, but the things we have to fear have changed tremendously. Gardner separates our fear-coping mechanisms into two distinct mindsets: 1) unconscious thought, or ""Gut"", as he calls it, which creates snap judgments based on instinct; and 2) conscious thought, or ""Head"", which examines data, analyzes situations, and assesses the level of threat. Head is what should have prevented the majority of people from being terrified of flying after 9/11. Gut, unfortunately, is what took over after seeing, repeatedly, the same image of the planes crashing into the Twin Towers. This battle between Head and Gut is a constant. Sometimes Head wins, but sometimes Gut takes over. We live in a world governed by fear, which is ironic, according to Gardner, who claims, ""there's never been a better time to be alive"". Life expectancy is the highest it's ever been, birth mortality rates are the lowest they have ever been, there are more cures and better treatments for diseases than ever before, people have more and better access to education and healthcare than at anytime in history, and yet based on the evening news and what politicians keep saying, we are living in the tenth circle of Hell. You don't have to let Gut always win. It's just a matter of sifting through the bullshit and educating one's self. The first step is to read Gardner's excellent book. "
4,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,5,"Imagine, for a moment, one of our early human ancestors. A first-generation Homo sapiens, exploring his world with an amazing brain that would be the envy of the animal kingdom. If they understood envy. He, and his children, and their children and grandchildren will spread across the Earth as hunter-gatherers, the first beings (so far as we know) who can look at the world and attempt to pass on what it knows and learns. Their threats were simple: survive or don't. Find food or starve. Hunt or be hunted. And those fantastic brains did such a bang-up job that their descendants are still walking around, thousands of generations later. Now, take that Paleolithic man - swift of foot, sharp of eye, strong of hand - and drop him in the middle of modern-day Times Square. And, as his minder, give him a bored, easily distracted teenager - one who knows the world, but can't be bothered to do the work to make decisions. Congratulations. According to Daniel Gardner, we have just constructed a fine metaphor for how the human brain works. Part of it is very old, able to make decisions in an instant based on the slimmest of clues. The other is newer, more rational and savvy, able to put together reasoned, logical arguments, but doesn't have the sheer speed and force that is prehistoric partner has. And as much as we want it to be true that the rational, modern part of our mind is in charge,the sad fact is that out inner caveman has far more influence over us than we care to admit. Gardner begins the book with an interesting story about the most terrifying thing to happen in the last decade - the attacks of September 11th in the United States. By the time the towers fell, people around the world were watching, and anyone who didn't see it live would surely see it soon enough as it was replayed over and over again. It was truly terrifying to watch, unlike anything Americans had seen before in their country, and it scared the ever-loving hell out of people. Many people, as a result, chose to forgo air travel in favor of driving.Now, as Superman famously told Lois Lane, flying is statistically the safest way to travel. In fact, the most dangerous part of any trip that involves flying is usually the drive to the airport. But, in those days and months after the attacks, people were scared to fly. So they drove instead. And, according to a five year study of traffic fatalities in the U. S. after 9/11 by German psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer, 1,595 people died on the roads who otherwise would not have. They were afraid, and that's understandable. But they were afraid of the wrong thing. So they died.Gardner sets out in this book to figure out why it is that people in the healthiest, safest, most prosperous nations on Earth - in the healthiest, safest, most prosperous era of human history - live in a state of near-constant fear.A lot of it, as the intro implies, comes down to the fact that our brains, which evolved over millions of years to be very good at judging risks that might be found on the savannah, are simply not prepared to do the same in a modern technological world. Our brains can't tell the difference between risk in fiction and reality, between something that happened to us and something we saw on the news. When it comes to risk, our brains play it very safe, which is great out in nature. Is that shadow in the bushes a tiger? Maybe, maybe not, but either way it's probably a good idea to get the hell away from it. We can't say the same thing of that guy sitting on the bus who looks like maybe he might be a Muslim.We also tend to assume that if we've heard of something recently, then it must be more common. Again if you're out in nature and you saw a bear yesterday, there's a decent chance that the bear is still around today and you might want to be wary of that. But what if you see constant news coverage of a high-profile child abduction? It's on every show, being talked about on every blog - does that mean that the chance of your child being abducted has increased? Of course not, but your brain doesn't see it that way. Your brain thinks that your child will be taken from you the moment you look away, and all the reasoning in the world won't change its mind.One more thing: we don't get numbers. The news tells us that the rate of certain risks is up by 10%, but they don't tell us what the original figure was. We hear about millions of starving children in Africa, but don't do anything unless we get a personal story of one. We don't understand probability at all, we can't deal with randomness, and this lack of innate numeracy (compounded by an educational culture that makes it hard to teach kids to become numerate) costs us billions. Or more, as the recent economic Clusterthing has shown, when you have people who are good with numbers deliberately exploiting this flaw in order to profit. We think that correlation equals causation. We believe stories over facts. We think we don't have biases that we clearly possess. We assign high risk to things we don't like and low risk to things we do, regardless of how risky they actually are. And on top of all that, we know how to exploit others' fears in order to gain money and power for ourselves. It's easy to do, and it works like a charm. Reading this book won't make you into a magically unflappable person, mainly because all of this stuff is pretty well hard-wired in our brains. Even Gardner, who should have known better, tells a story about hunting through the slums of Lagos in the middle of the night to retrieve a photo of his children from the wallet that had been stolen from him. He had plenty more, but at that moment, his brain was convinced that losing the photo meant losing his children. Irrational, yes, and it nearly got him killed, but that's just one example of what a powerful force this primitive brain is.The good news, though, is that you can strengthen the newer, more recent brain - the lazy teenager from the initial example. By knowing how you make mistakes, how you can be fooled into fearing things that you don't need to fear, you can better understand your own reactions to events and make better decisions. You can educate yourself about the things that are actually dangerous, and stop losing sleep over the things that are not a threat. Being afraid is not your fault - it's an ingrained biological feature. Staying afraid, on the other hand, is something over which you have control. With enough will power, even you can overcome great fear.Sorry. Nerd moment there. Are there terrorists who want to destroy the United States? Sure. But they won't, because doing so is indescribably harder than certain politicians would have you believe. Are there creepy child molesters who want to abduct and defile your children? Yup. But the chances of that actually happening are so low that the odds of any specific child becoming such a victim are nil. Are there angry teens who want to come to their school and kill everyone they see? Of course. But when you look at the incidence of school shooting compared to how many kids go to school every day, you can see that the odds of your children being caught in a school shooting are slim to none. In fact, there are many parts of the country where your children are probably safer in school than out of it.There are real risks in our modern world, but they're not spectacular and they're not viscerally terrifying. A car accident, a heart attack, a diabetic death - these things don't make the news. Imagine a 9/11-style attack happening every three days, 3,000 dead each time. It would be an outrage, a national disgrace, and people would be scared to their bones. But it would take just about 233 attacks to equal the number of deaths in 2001 that occurred from cardiovascular disease in the United States.The nearly nonexistent chance of being killed by terrorists is enough to get people to submit to any number of indignities and intrusions on their persons and liberties when they travel, but the very real risk of death from a heart attack isn't enough to get people to go take a walk once in a while or stop eating junk food. So enjoy that delicious moment of irony the next time you go through the TSA molest-a-thon and get a seriously overweight screener taking liberties with your person.The fact is that we have it damn good compared to our ancestors. We live longer, we live better, even in parts of the world that are still developing, and it looks like the future will progress that way. But we still insist on needing to be afraid, even as we have less and less to actually fear. So put down the newspaper, turn off the 24-hour news, and take some time to figure out what is actually a threat. Give that bored teenager something to do with his time and let the caveman go back to his cave.--------------------------------------------------""Anyone who has spent time in a Victorian cemetery knows that gratitude, not fear, should be the defining feeling of our age. And yet it is fear that defines us. We worry. We cringe. It seems the less we have to fear, the more we fear.""- Daniel Gardner, The Science of Fear"
5,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4251182-david,5,"This is one of the few books that I've given 5 stars to this year and it deserves every one of them. Gardner's analysis of fear and the motivators of fear (both collective and individual) are brilliant and how these connect to ~ 1. Brain2. Media3. The many individuals and groups with an interest in stoking fear. His contention is that we are luckier than any generation that has ever lived, and he goes a long, long way to proving this, and yet we are more afraid than ever before. The reasons for this are many and varied. Gardner does a wonderful job of clearly enunciating these and then analyzing them. What made this book so interesting for me is that it cuts across political and theoretical boundaries to attempt to deal with fear and apocalyptic futurism in all its formats in a non-partisan and a mostly non-ideological manner. This is a book for anyone interested in the story behind the story we find in the rhetoric of fear. It will be eye opening or it will confirm what you've already suspected of Governments, the Media, Business, NGOs, Activists, and Advocacy Groups. There are no conspiracy theories here, in the sense most of us now understand them, but just human nature writ about as large as the first global civilization.You may agree with Gardner or not...but I doubt you will end the book being unaffected by it. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
6,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237290-ivan-raszl,0,Great book. Makes you realize that we fear things with a negligable risk and do not worry about things we rationally should. it also exlains why that happens and what to do about it.
7,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This is a good book, all-in all it was interesting and lucid although not all chapters had me sitting at the edge of my seat. Half-way through the book I was intent on giving it 3 stars, but the chapter on terrorism and the conclusion made me change my mind to 4. This book is about risk and fear. Or rather, it is about how fear makes us perceive risk. The one thing is miss is the lack of discussion of real and possibly imminent risk. Real risk is only used as comparison. The psychology of risk perception is quite interesting. Humans are not particularly rational beings and what we feel about something (the Gut - our unconscious) is instantaneous and our thoughts(the Head - our conscious mind) is a slow, cumbersome process. We are like stories and emotions and these have a lot more to say about how we make decisions than rationally going over statistics. Sure, Head can intervene with the Gut decision, but the prerequisite is that it wants to. Maybe this is why I rarely watch television news. The stories of the latest local crisis, let's say swine flu, wash over you and it's easy to be misled by the death toll in red. Half the population in Norway could get sick and thousands could die. Get vaccinated! This fear mongering certainly fed the purses of the drug companies. This is what media does - it plays on our emotions with stories. Cancer, for example. Most of the stories cited in the media are of children or young adults, but the true face of cancer is old. 91% of those who die are older than 60. That's not the picture I had in my mind exactly.After the basic psychology of risk perception and fear has been laid bare the book covers things people are especially afraid of - cancer, crime and terrorism. The book concludes with the fact that we are the most long-lived, healthy, wealthy generation of humans that have ever lived and that nothing short of Armageddon could change this. "
8,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13369978-jana-light,2,"In The Science of Fear, Dan Gardner explains the human experience of fear, first presenting accounts of how we consciously and unconsciously interpret information we receive, then showing how some current social and cultural circumstances bring out the worst in our reactionary interpretive tendencies. Overall, Gardner argues, we are far more afraid than reality warrants, for reasons both psychological and sociological. Even though the book is interesting and useful (I am certainly now more aware of cognitive pitfalls and am trying to use my awareness to improve how I interpret the world around me), the book as a whole left me irritated. It felt more like an application of concepts presented early on to different scenarios than an exploration of the nature of fear. This isn't a bad thing, per se, but I am irked at how misleading the title and subtitle are in this regard. Despite what the title says, it is light on the science. And the subtitle is the exact kind of click-bait provocation he says blows dangerous circumstances (potential or real) somewhat-insidiously out of proportion! Even in the book, Gardner uses one particular statistic over and over in a way that he decries as dishonest and fear-mongering when employed by the media and others. Perhaps he and his publisher knew that the book would sell more copies with a title that makes us believe our irrational fears are putting us in grave and unnecessary dangers, rather than choosing an honest title that lets the reader know the book is really about how much better and safer the world is today compared to any other time in human history. This on its own is an important message, and is presented well by Gardner. As a whole, the book just left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, as Gardner seems to exploit the irrationality of our fear instincts to sell books, and in doing so potentially contributes to the very problem he is trying to clarify and alleviate. "
9,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10204737-grant,5,"One of two books I recommend to anyone and everyone, but especially to young high school students and college students. Fear can make us adopt bad policies, waste money, and even do harm to very good people, companies or institutions. it's one of the best times in the world to be human, but you wouldn't know it from the press...and there's a reason for that. Read this to be the proper, skeptical and informed person you need to be and live in a democracy."
10,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4645281-eduardo,5,"This book has three main researchers at its heart: Paul Slovic, Amos Tversky, and Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman. The three men have both done work on the two-system brain and it is this idea that Daniel Gardner uses to explain and link all the topics in this book. It is a fascinating explanation of how we think and make decisions. There is an excellent description (chapter 2 Of Two Minds) of why our brains still function as our ancient ancestors brains did, even though our society has developed at a much quicker pace. By bringing this idea to the fore, Gardner asks us to both appreciate what our two-system brain is good for but also to investigate how that same brain can lead us astray in today's society.In chapter 3 (The Death of Homo Economicus), Gardner takes three ""heuristics and biases"" that we use and gives them simpler names: the ""Anchoring Rule"", the ""Rule of Typical Things"", and the ""Example Rule"". He refers to those rules throughout the book to help us understand how our two-system brain can accidentally or deliberately be led astray. Those errors in assessment can lead us into a spiral of ever-increasing fear and continued poor decisions.In my mind, perhaps the most sinister part of this that Gardner almost glosses over is that when we are railroaded by system one, we are often unaware of it. When we then look back at our decisions using system two, we use that reasoning brain to justify the decision that we made previously. (For an entire book on that phenomenon, read Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts.)All in all, I found this book to be very readable and informative. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about how our minds function in relation to the world around us."
11,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1309606-f-r,5,"“So why is it that so many of the safest humans in history are scared of their own shadows?”That’s the question posed by this fantastic tract which looks at why modern man – despite having advantages which his ancestors could never dream of – is beset by so much fear. It explores how that fear is exploited and exaggerated by the media, governments and corporations – so that we are constantly told of new things to worry about, new dangers ahead and new reasons to panic.Gardner deals with violent crime (which has actually been falling for decades, if not centuries; disease (most of the real killers – with the exception of cancer – are actually downplayed while attention focuses on the latest deadly bug du jour); car accidents (although there are substantial deaths, asthma and diabetes both kill more); chemicals in the air (I did not know that DDT actually had lots of positive qualities); and terrorism (a talking point for the last decade, but one which few people in the world will ever find themselves directly impacted by). The chapter on the terrorism is particularly good. It show how after the dreadful attacks on 9/11, the rhetoric used by George W. Bush actually increased the feeling of terror while playing straight into Osama Bin-Laden’s hands. To quote: “In 1933, it was in Franklin Roosevelt’s political interests to tell Americans the greatest danger was fear itself. Seventy years later, it was in George W. Bush’s political interest to do the opposite.”The book is statistic and number heavy so can look daunting, but Gardner’s prose style is smooth and dryly witty. There are phrases in this text which will make you smile, just as there are arguments which will astound you and make you question the world around you and how – and your own sense of fear – fits into it."
12,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4631512-kirsty-darbyshire,5,"This book is all about putting a realistic twist on all the big risks everyone thinks the world holds - zillions of people terrified of terrorism and the like. The only problem for me is that I'm already a numerate sceptic who explains to others that the risk of, oh, their kids being abducted by paedophiles or similar, is vanishingly small and takes all use of statistics in news stories with a huge pinch of salt. So I wasn't sure how much I was going to get out of it.The good news is that it's a good read and did tell me plenty of things I didn't know. Which just gives me more ammunition for playing the numerate sceptic role in future. Hah, fun.The bad news? Well, the book covers the phenomenon of ""confirmation bias"" where you tend to take away from a story only the bits that backup what you already think and disregard the rest. So I think I've probably done that even with this book... how do you counter that? The author mainly wants to play down people's fears of what they consider to be big dangers but doesn't really get into what the biggest risks we face in our comfortable first world lives are. We obviously all make bad decisions about them preferring to fixate on removing some minor environmental hazard before taking exercise.The point to take away is that we're fortunate to be about the healthiest, safest and longest lived humans who have ever walked the planet which is nice to have confirmed. (And don't believe any interpretation of statistics you hear in the news. Hmmm, the author's a journalist...)"

16,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Subtitle: Why We Fear Things We Shouldn't - and Put Ourselves in Greater Danger. Lame subtitle, good book.The starting point for this book is an observation: after 9/11, the number of people flying dropped, and stayed lower for about a year. However, during that time, people didn't stop traveling entirely, they just were more likely to take a car than a plane. For long trips, though, a plane is a much safer way to travel than a car. Sure enough, road deaths in America soared in the year after 9/11. Do the math, even taking into account the chance of a terrorist attack on a plane flight, and almost 1600 more people died than would have if people had continued to fly at the same rate as before 9/11.To put that in perspective, that is 6 times as many people as were on board the doomed flights of 9/11 (most of the people killed then were obviously not traveling at all). It's about half as many people as were killed by the 9/11 attacks directly. Basically, our cockeyed response to 9/11 added another 1600 deaths to the death toll, as a free gift to Al Qaeda.Except, of course, neither Al Qaeda nor almost anyone else even noticed this, because no terror was involved. It's not like you have to kill more than 1600 people to create terror; the anthrax attacks or the Washington, D.C. sniper killings did their share with far fewer deaths. It's that what we fear, and what's actually likely to get us, aren't especially well correlated. Why not? This is what Daniel Gardner examines in this book.The short answer is that fear comes from a particular part of the brain, which isn't much concerned with rational thought, and that part of the brain is still operating on some rules of thumb which were developed for the Pleistocene. Rules like:1) if you see somebody die from something, that's a common risk2) if you hear about somebody dying from something, but don't see it, it's less common3) if you don't hear about somebody dying from something, it's not a common risk at allGardner lists a bunch of these (with names like the Example Rule, the Anchoring Rule, the Rule of Typical Things), and I won't try to describe them all. Suffice to say, they're rules of thumb which work reasonably well when the only people you see are in your hunter-gatherer group, and the only other news you hear is about what happened in your group (or nearby ones) prior to your birth. Now, this part of the brain, the one responsible for telling you when to be afraid, is hearing (and seeing) tales of violent death brought to them from around the world, precisely because they are odd, with pictures and sometimes even video. We don't hear about car crashes in New York City. We do hear about terrorist attacks. We don't hear about kids dying of ordinary causes, like influenza (unless there's a flu scare on). We do hear about kids snatched away by strangers and tortured to death. We don't hear about old people dying of cancer. We do hear about young people dying of cancer.One of many intriguing deconstructions by Gardner is the fear surrounding violence, especially shootings, at schools. In one case, in 2006 in Asbury Park, New Jersey, a shooting near (a block away) a middle school caused city officials to close five public schools for two days. This despite the fact that the shooting was not in the school, and study after study has shown that in every part of the U.S. in every decade it was studied, children are at greater risk of violence when outside of school than when in school. Thus, a panicked (and political) response to fear-mongering is to throw the city's children into more dangerous surroundings. I have to admit that I could only read this book in small doses, lest annoyance at the (very familiar sounding) poor judgment described within make me too agitated to concentrate.How do you keep all of the news media's highly non-representative storytelling from biasing our fear, to make us obsess over things we shouldn't and ignore things we should look out for? In one sense, we cannot. Extensive research has demonstrated that no amount of reading statistics or hearing reassurances from experts will convince the fear-generating part of our brain to calm down. It does what it does, and its rules are not based on statistics or text or epidemiological study; they are based on what it sees and hears.What we can do, then, is choose not to feed this part of the brain a diet of news about far-flung disasters, picked by news organizations precisely because they are exotic and attention-grabbing. Can we convince most people to do this, to treat what news goes into their brain with as much care as they should treat what food goes into their stomach?Probably not; most of us aren't doing too well at putting good food into our stomach, either. But, Gardner does provide a good analysis of the many economic incentives that lead news corporations (and pharmaceutical corporations and many others) to market to your fears, and how that can easily spill into stoking your fears so they will be easier to market to. Likewise, while we cannot probably keep society from being blown one way and then the other by fear-based marketing and politics, each person has a choice about whether to let it affect themselves, personally.To avoid bad food, don't let it into your kitchen, and don't eat in a restaurant that's filled with junk, even if it does also have a salad on the menu. To avoid junk data, turn off the TV, pick news sources that are more text than pictures (so that your brain can do a better job of evaluating the data before it biases your emotions), and most of all take responsibility for critically evaluating how you feel, especially regarding risk. Also, read this book, so you can better recognize when you're being manipulated.To help the rest of society do a wiser job of coping with, and thinking about, risk? Uh, um...I dunno. And that IS something worth worrying about."
17,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"This is the sort of the book that is nice and easy to read – nothing that requires too much of thinking to comprehend – and yet so immensely useful and informative that I’d rate it as required reading for all of us. Everyone needs to read this book or something like it. It reminded me of Daniel Gilbert’s Stumbling Upon Happiness. It contains the same kind of tidbits of information and insight that can be very useful in helping us get a better grasp of what is happening to us and what is going on around us. Actually, Gardner quotes Gilbert a lot. I remember when I lived in San Diego a little girl named Danielle van Dam – I can’t believe I still remember her name – was kidnapped and murdered. I think there were also a few other cases like that in other parts of the country around the same time. It was quite amazing to me to watch all the people living in the safe and posh and clean suburbs of San Diego acting like there was a murderous pedophile lurking behind every tree of their neighborhood. I reasoned – in bad taste, I admit – with one fearful parent that his daughter was more likely to die in a car crash. Forget about car crashes. I learned in this book that children are far more likely to drown in a swimming pool than get killed by a pedophile. The book starts by citing the often quoted and taken-as-truth assertion that “at any given time there are 50,000 pedophiles on the internet” as an example of irrational paranoia created by the media. People seem to be happy to accept this statistics. No one bothers to ask where this 50,000 number came from (a number this nice and round is definitely pulled out of thin air). How can anyone tell if an internet user is a pedophile? And what does “on the internet” exactly mean? Maybe these supposed 50,000 pedophiles are just checking their stock quotes. Why people are willing to accept such absurdities is an interesting question that Gardner attempts to answer based on human psychology. And then he gets into an assortment of other really interesting subjects. Human psychology is not the only culprit. There are corporations that have learned that the surest way to profit is stirring fear. And it’s not just the evil and greedy corporations. Scientists, health officials, law enforcement agencies, activists of all sorts, nonprofit and charity organizations, and all sorts of other well-intentioned people do the same to push their agenda. And of course, politicians are masters of fear-mongering. Anyone remember the 10,000 (another nice and round number) Al-Qaeda operatives in the U.S. after September 11? The best chapter of the book was “Terrified of Terrorism” in which Gardner really went into the details of how and why the risk of terrorism was so much overblown. Read this book. It can give you peace of mind."
18,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1041468-jerry-smith,5,"Gardner takes a look at the psychology of fear and why we are more fearful today than ever, even though we live in perhaps the safest time in all human history. Introduces reasons that are hard wired into us via evolution and therefore served us well previously, but tend to misinterpret things in the modern world, resulting in erroneous assumptions especially regarding risk.The central point concerns the two means by which we perceive risk and react accordingly - Gut reaction and head reaction. Head is the logic, gut the emotion and the emotional side of us tends to act quickly on feelings. These can be modified by head but only if there is data to ponder and assess and this takes a long time. If there is no data the modification may not happen at all.Examples include psychological factors such as example theory - when we see a lot of coverage of a terrible event/illness it assumes a hiogh profile and we therefore credit it too much weight and figure it is much more common that it is. Even if we have the data, head will only modify this reaction so much. There are other examples of the way we think including a gut reaction to Good/Bad - assumption for example that ""chemicals = Bad""I imagine there will be those who think we should try to mitigate all risk but Gardner explains why this is impossible and the danger of swapping one perceived risk (e.g. flying after 9/11) with another, actually greater risk (driving instead). There is some left leaning comment as well on the war against terrorism that may be controversial although makes sense in the context of the book.Well worth reading, written in a very approachable way."
19,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1611326-blake-nelson,3,"This book starts out well - describing the psychology of how people evaluate risk, and how come we are often so bad at it. One great example from the September 11 attacks. If there had been a single attack of similar magnitude every month for a year, then a person's risk of dying in an attack would be 1 in 7,750. In one year, a person has a 1 in 6,498 chance of dying in a car accident. So our billions of dollars spent on anti-terrorism measures would have been better spent trying to find ways to make cars safer, even with attack occurring every month. The first half of the book does a very good job describing how and why we are so poor in evaluating the risk and therefore spend inordinate amounts of energy protecting against low probability risks while at the same time doing very little to protect against high probability ones.The second half of the book moved from the science of fear to how media, government, and companies use fear to achieve their own ends. At first this seemed out of place, but it does a very good job of illustrating how people who understand the principles from the first half can use that knowledge to advance their own agendas. It was fascinating to see how the government used fear to justify the unjustifiable.My main complaint is that the book is rather repetitive. It could have probably been half as long and still contained all of the relevant information."
20,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/144335-russell,4,"After years of trying to figure out why I think news reporting is bullshit, and advertising is bullshit, and politicians are full of bullshit, I finally have some reference material to actively back up my instincts. This book confirms something that I think we all sense, but don't have the context to express. Life should not be such a scary thing, but there are a whole lot of people with a whole lot of vested interest in convincing us otherwise.Only two problems with the book. First, his use of 'Gut' and 'Head' throughout the book was overly-simplistic, especially in the context of a book that goes into great detail about socio-psychological behavior. Second, I heart the apocalypse and this book is far too optimistic for my tastes. Zombies and wastelands and population-thinning is usually my cup of tea and Gardner insists on telling us how slim the possibilities of that are. I mean, that's great and everything. You know, my kid will live longer and be healthier and be wealthier than any generation before his, which is all well and good. But I want to shotgun the undead, dammit."
21,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6101789-peter,5,"A very good book: it’s rational, well documented, and extremely readable. I’m not sure why, but I was expecting something more in the way of an inventory of risks — that is, a discussion of what dangers are more prominent than others. Instead, the book dwells a lot on psychology, particularly on the ways that Gut (immediate reactions tooled for survival on the ancient savannah) is at odds with Head (our rational selves, all the way up to the rational self that can do statistics!). Irrational fears arise when Gut reactions take on jobs that really require pretty careful Head work. Gardner illustrates these with fascinating discussions of topics ranging from child abduction through toxic chemicals, with a splendid concluding set piece on the War on Terror. I thought that the examples were well chosen, as they studiously avoided alignment with any kind of predictable politics: the silly funks of both Right (terrorism!) and Left (toxic chemicals!) come in for equal criticism. Strongly recommended. "
22,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20572109-sergey-antopolskiy,4,"Your media and politics skepticism 101.The book covers a wide range of material, which is mostly related to what kind of things we fear as a society and individually, how and why most of these fear are completely unjustified, and how politicians, media and the market create a self-reinforcing environment of fear, which allows them to get votes/views/sales.This book is very unsettling in its own way. Unsettling, because you realize that the media-politics-psychology create such a screwed up environment (especially prominent in US), and it is completely unclear how we, as a society, can get over it. But it is also reassuring. It shows with examples and math that we live in the safest, happiest, and overall best times in the history of humanity.I think this book is a must-read for anyone who hopes to understand the gears inside politics and media, and those who try not to get overly worried about the constant stream of ""threats"" (terrorism, carcinogens, GMOs, pedophiles, etc) which media pours over our heads 24/7."
23,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5026447-sally-mcrogerson,5,"This was brilliant! We stress constantly; currently about swine flu, but that's only the most recent in a long list of many paranoias. This book actually quantifies risk in a way that puts everything into perspective. One part of the book focusses on 9/11. The world gave up flying and as a direct consequence about 1500 US citizens died in road accidents. This figure can be extrapolated from the data for years before and after and the empty plane seats. GETTING INTO A CAR IS THE MOST DANGEROUS ACTIVITY THAT MOST OF US PARTAKE IN, BUT WE GET INTO OUR CARS EVERY BLOODY DAY OF EVERY BLOODY WEEK. (Yes, I know I'm shouting, again!) We live in the healthiest, wealthiest, safest period in history. Why are we so bloody scared of our own shadows? This paradox is what makes the book so riveting. Really, read the book. It explains the difference between gut and head decisions and they are worlds apart! "
24,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33302690-marco-den-ouden,5,"How well do we assess risk? Not very well according to Dan Gardner in his fascinating book on the subject. He starts out with a story. The tragedy of 9/11 made a lot of people leery of flying. Yet, Gardner points out, flying remained and remains the safest way of traveling by far. How safe? Well, one statistician calculated that even if terrorists were hijacking and crashing one passenger jet a week in the United States, a person who flew once a month for a year would have a 1 in 135,000 chance of getting killed as a result. The annual risk of dying in a car crash? 1 in 6000. But the aftermath of to cars for the commute from Boston to New York. As a result, in the five years after 9/11, 1595 people died in car crashes who would have lived if they had flown. That's six times as many people as died in the two planes that crashed into the WTC.And that's just the prologue to this marvelous book. It just gets better from there. Highly recommended."
25,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81065199-caleb,3,"While I fully admit that at times, I was highly engrossed by “The Science of Fear”, and I learned a number of interesting facts and numbers that I will surely use when debating my friends and family, I want to start by prefacing this review with an assessment of both the title and the author himself. Dan Gardner is not a scientist. He is not a psychologist, biologist or cognitive neurologist. He is not a sociologist, policy maker or anthropologist. Gardner has consulted some of the relevant psychological and anthro-biological research of his time, but he lives a lot to the imagination. To call this book a deep dive into the “science” of fear and the reasoning behind our fear is disingenuous to some degree. The subtext is more accurate, and even then incomplete and somewhat misleading. Instead of “The Science of Fear”, the title of this book would more accurately be written as “The Statistics of Fear”. I would (generously) put forward that approximately 30% of this book actually focuses on the science of fear itself, while the rest is a handful of percentages, fractions and dates. However, Gardner, as someone schooled in journalism and no doubt under the pressure of a hungry publisher, knows the power and effectiveness of spinning something the way you want it to be spun. Everyone knows statistics are not sexy. The “Science of Fear” seems to attack one of the most fundamental aspects of our nature. It’s provocative and exciting. I believe this is an important distinction to make at the beginning, first because it can serve as a warning to future readers, and second because this understanding of the book colours my further opinions about the book as a I further deconstruct it. Once I realized that I was reading a book about statistics and not a book about science, it allowed me to come to grips with the authors vision and intentions. So what is the purpose of this book? Gardner sees a problem in this world, and it’s a problem that he can fix. There are things that humans are afraid of, and these things, so Gardner believes, are misguided appropriations of our mental efforts and time. Fearing these benign things leads to misuse of government funds, illogical public discourse, and at it’s worst, the death of innocent and unwitting citizens. This is certainly not trivial, and I fundamentally agree with Gardner about this point. There are many things which people believe fully to be unconditional truths about our world and our reality, which upon further investigation or re framing, turn out to be categorically false. This is harmful to our society in many ways and something that must be stopped. Not an easy task. The culprits, in Gardner’s view, are large, money hungry and soulless corporations, a basally motivated, and frequently malicious news media complex, public thinkers and rhetoricians, and even you, the every-man. Everyone exists as either a malevolent actor, plotting to subvert understanding in order to gain financial or political clout, or else too ignorant and uninformed to fully grasp the nature of the truth of the universe and unable to be responsible for their own well-being. Average individuals are constantly making choices that are meant to improve their safety, health and general well-being, and yet ironically lead them to damaging their lives. Gardner knows not only what not to fear, but what are real fears should be. Gardner exposes the truth behind the things we fear and the media bias that leads us to be afraid of them, and then demolishes them by showing what we really should be afraid of. Should we fear environmental pollutants and nuclear power plants? Probably not, and they probably won’t give you cancer. But we should fear getting older, because that probably will give you cancer. Terrorism, pesticides, and SARS, all are relatively rare and unlikely to kill you. Fearing these things distracts you from the real problems in life and makes you spend money and vote inappropriately. One thing that Gardner and I fundamentally disagree on is the way to get people to pay attention to what really matters and ignore the things that don’t. Gardner seems to think that simply telling people all of the facts and statistics will make them understand the true reality and change their minds. If he didn’t, he probably wouldn’t have written a book filled with emotionless statistics and numbers. This has been proven time and again not to work. In fact, usually it further polarizes people. Someone who believe we should fear terrorism and that America was being overrun by jihadists would probably believe it even more after reading the chapters in this book about it. Sometimes convincing people does not involve true facts, but appeals to emotion and feeling. Few people act perfectly rationally, unfortunately. This book could serve as fuel in a debate on the side of logic, but I would be skeptical if many read this book and changed their worldview.  Gardner also seems to blindly equivocate everything that on a surface level seems equivocal. A death is a death, a sickness is a sickness, and there isn’t anything in between. For Gardner, if 10,000 people died from terrorism, but 10,001 people died from cancer, then cancer is clearly the larger threat that we have to deal with. Not all deaths are necessarily equal, and certainly not all suffering. Certainly, I think that public policy, funding and personal opinions could be shaped in a much more productive and logical way, but there is a point at which logic is not the only thing that is important. We have to understand the deeper nature of things, and not just a handful of statistics that describe the thing.I think this book offers an endless stream of interesting and unexpected facts about the universe. Gardner successfully undermines the beliefs that many people have and offers a convincing argument for why we should change what we fear, at least if you are paying attention and have an open mind to learn something new. The content and idea behind this book are important and should not be taken lightly. I urge everyone to go into this experience with a sober perspective and get ready to say “no way” a few times, because you won’t always be ready for the reality you encounter in this book. "

Decided to find it finally: Driving deaths and injuries post-9/11. However I look into this data, I don't see it. So, injuries increased, it may be any reason, we don't know. Here's my reality based hypothesis - people don't give a f*ck, you only hear several active screamers, who consist of too small portion of the distribution.And again, many references to original Thinking, Fast and Slow. I don't even know how much I read those. Probably not very useful for me as I expected something new and its already all in. On the other hand, several small things and reasonable approach made me like this."

The author cites study after study that shows how humans in general allow their gut to control their decisions and thinking. I often found myself thinking ""Well, that doesn't apply to me"" or ""That's not how I look at it,"" before I realized that I am pretty much the same as the subjects in these studies. While people don't see themselves as biased by their gut or fear-tactics, we all certainly are. This isn't a book that you can cruise through, and there are some parts that are slower than others, but on the whole, this book was very interesting and one that everybody that is interested in how politicians, corporations, and the media use fear should read."

Hint: influence and profits can be had by presenting messages that speak to us on a visceral level. This hardwiring in humans may have served us well 50,000 years ago, but if we allow ourselves to be influenced by those who know how to press this button in our minds in this age of mass communication, our human condition can lead us to ill-considered decisions and misplaced worries. Some examples are the messages from political candidates, special interest groups, and a news media driven by advertiser revenue.A good read for those interested in influence, cognitive psychology, and clearer decision making."

Thank you, Dan Gardiner! Yes, there are things to worry about. No, we shouldn't ignore a risk just because it's a small chance.

London: Virgin Books. 2009.Gardner – al suo esordio in quest’opera – è un giornalista canadese. Questa sua opera si colloca in un filone che potrei definire quello del neo-ottimismo quantitativamente fondato, e il cui manifesto è The Rational Optimist di Matt Ridley, che abbiamo recensito qui. Non è un caso se l’ultimo capitolo si intitola There’s never been a better time to be alive.La speranza di vita è la più elevata da quando l’homo sapiens sapiens ha conservato qualche informazione sulle sue condizioni di vita. Perché allora ci sembra di vivere in un’epoca sempre più piena di rischi, si chiede Gardner? Perché le nostre ansie e le nostre paure, invece di diminuire, aumentano?In parte perché nelle nostre menti, in situazioni critiche, la parte irrazionale prende il sopravvento su quella razionale: nello spiegare questo, Gardner fa un buon lavoro di illustrazione delle ricerchea di Paul Slovic, Daniel Kahneman e Gerd Gigerenzer. Ma in parte anche perché i giornalisti fanno male il loro mestiere: e Gardner, pur appartenendo alla categoria, porta molti esempi ben documentati.Una combinazione micidiale, che porta a privilegiare l’evidenza aneddotica con un forte contenuto emotivo sulla fredda analisi statistica. Non restano molte speranze per chi, come me, è convinto della necessità della crescita delle cultura quantitativa e dell’esercizio dell’analisi critica. Non penso assolutamente (nonostante qualche oscillazione e qualche eccezione da parte mia) che la soluzione possa essere lo statistical storytelling, quanto meno nel senso approssimativo e corrivo in cui viene inteso, cioè come ricerca del sensazionalismo anche a scapito del rigore nella presentazione dei dati (su questo si veda, ad esempio, la polemica di Donato Speroni sui numeri della disoccupazione giovanile). Neppure Gardner – mi pare – ha antidoti convincenti da proporre, né scorciatoie da seguire, tranne quella della “immane fatica del concetto” (die Anstrengung des Begriffs) di hegeliana memoria.* * *Una delle storie di disinvoltura ai limiti della disonestà intellettuale, ancorché a fin di bene, raccontate da Gardner dovrebbe suonarci familiare, perché le statistiche sulla povertà (“le famiglie che non arrivano alla fine del mese”) sono tra le preferite dai nostri giornali e, anche nel nostro caso, le differenze tra povertà assoluta, povertà relativa, deprivazione materiale e percezione del disagio economico sono colpevolmente trascurate. Leaving my neighbourhood grocery store one afternoon, I came across a poster featuring a sad-eyed boy wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the words ‘I’m hungry.’ The caption read: ‘One in five Canadian children lives with hunger.’ It was an appeal for donations to ‘The Grocery Foundation’ [...]. The cause is irreproachable. But I’d never heard that statistic before and I couldn’t believe the situation was that dire. The wording was also odd. What does it mean that a child ‘lives with’ hunger? Does that mean that they experience it every day? Once a week? How is hunger defined and measured? I wanted to know more so I e-mailed the executive director of the foundation, John McNeil. [...] he sent me an excerpt from a letter written by Sue Cox, the former head of the Daily Bread Food Bank and ‘an acknowledged authority on hunger and poverty,’ according to McNeil. Cox’s case for the one-in-five statistic went like this: First, ‘child hunger and child poverty are inextricably linked’; second, Statistics Canada says the ‘current rate of child poverty is one in six’; third, the real number is likely closer to one in five because the telephone survey used to come up with the one-in-six number would not catch very poor people who can’t afford telephones. What Cox didn’t mention is that Statistics Canada has no data on ‘child poverty’ or any other kind of poverty. What the agency has is something called the ‘low Income Cut-off,’ or LICO. That’s where the one-in-six number came from. But the LICO is not a ‘poverty’ number, as Cox claimed. It is a measure of relative deprivation only, intended to identify ‘those who are substantially worse off than the average,’ in the words of Ivan Fellegi, the head of Statistics Canada. If the income of the top 10 per cent in the country doubled tomorrow, the number of people who fall below the LICO would soar – even though alla the people who suddenly dropped below that line would have exactly the same income they had before. The statistics agency has repeatedly stated that it does not consider LICO to be a measure of poverty. ‘Statistics Canada does not and cannot measure the level of “poverty” in Canada,’ wrote Fellegi. So the basis for the claim that ‘one in five Canadian children lives with hunger’ is this: A number that Statistics Canada says is not a measure of poverty was used as a measure of poverty; the word ‘poverty’ was changed to ‘hunger’; and the number was arbitrarily reduced from one in six to one in five. [...[ It's understandable that honourable people pursuing a worthy cause would not be terribly concerned about the strict accuracy of the information they use in the pursuit of their cause. But it is also unfortunate. And unfortunately common. [pp. 172-173]* * * ‘People can come up with statistics to prove anything, Kent. Forty per cent of all people know that.’ [Homer Simpson, citato a p. 127] Language is one of the most basic means of medicalizing a problem, the critical first step to getting people to ask their doctors for a pill. So impotence’ becomes ‘erectyle disfunction’, an impressive medical-y phrase that pushes away consideration of factors like stress and anxiety as causes of impotence that cab be cured without a pill. Numbers are also key. People will be more likely to conclude they have a condition if they think it’s common, and so drug companies push statistics like ‘more than half of all men over 40 have difficulties having or maintaining an erection’ [...] [p. 159] Call it ‘denominator blindness.’ The media routinely tell people ‘X people were killed’ but they rarely say ‘out of Y population.’ The ‘X’ is the numerator, ‘Y’ is the denominator. To get a basic sense of the risk, we have to divide the numerator by the denominator – so being blind to the denominator means we are blind to the real risk. An editorial in The Times of London is a case in point. The newspaper had found that the number of Britons murdered by strangers had ‘increased by a third in eight years.’ That meant, it noted in the fourth paragraph, that the total had increased from 99 to 130. Most people would find this at least a little scary. Certainly the editorial writers did. But what the editorial did not say is that there are roughly 60 million Britons and so the chance of being murdered by a stranger rose from 99 in 60 million to 130 in 60 million. Do the math and the risk is revealed to have risen from an almost invisible 0.0001 per cent to an almost invisible 0.00015 per cent. [pp. 194-195] According to the RAND-MIPT terrorism database – the most comprehensive available, there were 10,119 international terrorist incidents worldwide between 1968 and April 2007. Those attacks took the lives of 14,790 people, an average annual death toll of 379. [...] Terrorism is hideous, and every death it inflicts is a tragedy and a crime. But still, 379 deaths worldwide annually is a very small number. In 2003, in the United States alone, 497 people accidentally suffocated in bed; 396 were unintentionally electrocuted; 515 drowned in swimming ppols; 347 were killed by police officers. [pp. 299-300] ‘I do not know why attacks didn’t occur’ in the years after 9/11, [George Tenet, former director of the CIA] wrote. ‘But I do know one thing in my gut: al-Qa’ida is here and waiting.’ And that’s just what terrorists want the gut of George Tenet and every other American to think. ‘America is full of fear from its north to its south, from its west to its east,’ Osama bin Laden said in a 2004 video. ‘Thank God for that.’ [p.337] Jeffrey Sachs, a renowned economist and development guru, estimates malaria could be controlled at a cost of between $2 billion and $3 billion a year, so here is a case where millions of lives could be saved and billions of dollars saved for an annual cost equivalent to about 5 per cent of the money the United States budgeted for counter-terrorism in 2007. [p. 347]"
43,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"Imagine, for a moment, one of our early human ancestors. A first-generation Homo sapiens, exploring his world with an amazing brain that would be the envy of the animal kingdom. If they understood envy. He, and his children, and their children and grandchildren will spread across the Earth as hunter-gatherers, the first beings (so far as we know) who can look at the world and attempt to pass it on. Their threats were simple: survive or don't. Find food or starve. Hunt or be hunted. And those fantastic brains did such a bang-up job that their descendants are still walking around, thousands of generations later. Now, take that Paleolithic man - swift of foot, sharp of eye, strong of hand - and drop him in the middle of modern-day Times Square. And, as his minder, give him a bored, easily distracted teenager - one who knows the world, but can't be bothered to do the work to make decisions. Congratulations. According to Daniel Gardner, we have just constructed a fine metaphor for how the human brain works. Part of it is very old, able to make decisions in an instant. The other is newer, more rational and savvy, but doesn't have the sheer speed and force that is prehistoric partner has. And as much as we want it to be true that the rational, modern part of our mind is in charge,the sad fact is that out inner caveman has far more influence over us than we care to admit. Gardner begins the book with an interesting story about the most terrifying thing to happen in the last decade - the attacks of September 11th in the United States. By the time the towers fell, people around the world were watching, and anyone who didn't see it live would surely see it soon enough as it was replayed over ands over again. It was truly terrifying to watch, unlike anything Americans had seen before in their country, and it scared the ever-loving he'll out of people. Many people, as a result, chose to forgo air travel in favor of driving.Now, as Superman famously told Lois Lane, flying is statistically the safest way to travel. In fact, the most dangerous part of any trip that involves flying is actually the drive to the airport. But, in those days and months after the attacks, people were scared to fly. So they drove instead. And, according to a five year study of traffic fatalities in the U. S. After 9/11 by German psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer, 1,595 people died on the roads who otherwise would not have. They were across, and that's understandable. But they were afraid of the wrong thing.Gardner sets out in this book to figure out why it is that people in the healthiest, safest, most prosperous nations on Earth - in the healthiest, safest, most prosperous era of human history - live in a state of near-constant fear.A lot of it, as the intro implies, comes down to the fact that our brains, which evolved over millions of years to be very good at judging risks that might be found on the savannah, are simply not prepared to do the same in a modern technological world. Our brains can't tell the difference between risk in fiction and reality, between something that happened to us and something we saw on the news. When it comes to risk, our brains play it very safe, which is great out in nature. Is that shadow in the bushes a tiger? Maybe, maybe not, but either way it's probably a good idea to get the he'll away from it. We can't say the same thing of that guy sitting on the bus who looks like maybe he might be a Muslim.We also tend to assume that if we've heard of something recently, then it must be more common. Again if you're out in neater and you saw a bear yesterday, there's a decent chance that the bear is still around today and you might want to be wary of that. But what if you see constant news coverage of a high-profile child abduction? It's on every show, being talked about on every blog - does that mean that the chance of your child being abducted has increased? Of course not, but your brain doesn't see it that way.One more thing: we don't get numbers. The news tells us that the rate of certain risks is up by 10%, but they don't tell us what the original figure was. We hear about millions of starving children in Africa, but don't do anything unless we get a personal story of one. We don't understand probability at all, we can't deal with randomness, and this lack of innate numeracy (compounded by an educational culture that makes it hard to teach kids to become numerate) costs us billions. Or more, as the recent economic. Clusterthing has shown. We think that correlation equals causation. We believe stories over facts. We think we don't have biases that we clearly possess. We assign high risk to things we don't like and low risk to things we do, regardless of how risky they actually are. And on top of all that, we know how to exploit others' fears in order to gain money and power for ourselves. It's easy to do, and it works like a charm. Reading this book won't make you into a magically unflappable person, mainly because all of this stuff is pretty well hard-wired in our brains. Even Gardner, who should have known better, tells a story about hunting through the slums of Lagos in the middle of the night to retrieve a photo of his children from the wallet that had been stolen from him. He had plenty more, but at that moment, his brain was convinced that losing the photo meant losing his children. Irrational, yes, and it nearly got him killed, but that's just one example of what a powerful force this primitive brain is.The good news, though, is that you can strengthen the newer, more recent brain - the lazy teenager from the initial example. By knowing how you make mistakes, how you can be fooled into fearing things that you don't need to fear, you can better understand your own reactions to events and make better decisions. You can educate yourself about the things that are actually dangerous, and stop losing sleep over the things that are not a threat. Being afraid is not your fault - it's an ingrained biological feature. Staying afraid, on the other hand, is something over which you have control. Are there terrorists who want to destroy the United States? Sure. But they won't, because doing so is indescribably harder than certain politicians would have you believe. Are there strange child molesters who want to abduct and defile your children? Yup. But the chances of that actually happening are so low that the odds of any specific child becoming such a victim are nil. Are there angry teens who want to come to their school and kill everyone they see? Of course. But when you look at the incidence of school shooting compared to how many kids go to school every day, you can see that the odds of your children being caught in a school shooting are slim to none. In fact, your children are probably safer in school than out of it.There are real risks in our modern world, but they're not spectacular and they're not viscerally terrifying. A car accident, a heart attack, a diabetic death - these things don't make the news. Imagine a 9/11-style attack happening every three days, 3,000 dead each time. It would be an outrage, a national disgrace, and people would be scared to their bones. But it would take just about 233 attacks to equal the number of deaths in 2001 that occurred from cardiovascular disease in the United States.The nearly nonexistent chance of being killed by terrorists is enough to get people to submit to any number of indignities and intrusions on their persons and liberties when they travel, but the very real risk of death from a heart attack isn't enough to get people to go take a walk once in a while or stop eating junk food. So enjoy that delicious moment of irony the next time you go through the TSA molest-a-thon and get a seriously overweight screener taking liberties with your person.""Anyone who has spent time in a Victorian cemetery knows that gratitude, not fear, should be the defining feeling of our age. And yet it is fear that defines us. We worry. We cringe. It seems the less we have to fear, the more we fear.""- Daniel Gardner"
44,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23849290-jeffrey,4,"Dan Gardner is not a scientist, economist or psychologist, but that in many ways might be one of The Science of Fear's strong points. The concepts here are explained in a way even a non-scientist can understand, and with a generous helping of examples as well. One of Gardner's best points is how politicians, industry and special interest groups preys on these weaknesses to further their causes. And he reminds us how our entire society is made up of humans - yes there are egregious cases of manipulation, but he also reminds us that the journalists writing these pieces are also humans and thus susceptible to the same flaws as their audiences.One slightly annoying thing I found though, was Gardner renaming the heuristics (for example the affect heuristic becomes the Good-Bad). Of course this was intended to make the book more accessible, but I think it is unnecessary because the heuristics are not given particularly difficult names, plus it makes it a bit harder for the reader to do further research and reading if they want.In conclusion, if you want to go in depth, this isn't the best book - for that you would be better off reading Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow or other books written by experts (which Gardner quotes). But if you are looking for an accessible and accurate summary of most of the science, illustrated with real world examples - then you could go a lot worse than picking up The Science of Fear. Even if you have read books written by the experts - then this still serves as a great entertaining refresher - I definitely needed one as despite have reading many of the traps, I still fell into many - at the end of the day our gut still strongly influences us."
45,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19906889-paul-c-stalder,3,"If you aren't skeptical about statistics, journalism, and so-called epidemics in our present world, you will be after reading this book. Gardner, with a cool, rational tone, dismantles the culture of fear we currently reside in. Taking a page from Steven Pinker's work on society, Gardner tackles a wide range of issues which take up residence in our minds. Everything from terrorism, to pedophilia, to chemicals in the water (spolier, Mr. Jones, they are not turning the frogs gay), to crime and murder rates; nothing is off limits. And nothing, it would seem, is truly as it appears. Quoting numerous works of scholarship, sociological studies, and scientific research, Gardner claims that our fear may be, and probably is, misplaced. Sure there are things in this world to fear, but we should rationally consider what it is that occupies our minds. While the content of this work is outstanding, the writing is a little drab. Gardner's style seems better suited to the length of a long essay, rather than a 350 page book. It is readable, but you won't be flipping the pages with anticipation. The research is what shines; the writing is just the method delivery. All in all, worth the read. I especially recommend it to those of us who are saturated in media, be it news or entertainment. Sometimes we fall so far down that rabbit hole it is hard to get back to ground level. Gardner will not only lift you up and out, but provide you with the tools to rationally, and carefully, consider how to stay above ground."
46,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18840302-adelyne,4,"Brilliant effort by Gardner, for someone who has read a number of books on similar topics I thought this was a bit of a Thinking, Fast and Slow meets Bad Science meets Factfulness. While lacking the depth of any of those three (all of which I highly recommend), I thought this one found a nice angle combining the psychological biases described in great length in Thinking, Fast and Slow with the statistical sleights that Bad Science so brilliantly unearths. There is some discussion on why things are perceived the way they are, and I particularly liked the angle on how fear-mongering and politics influences how things are – and how this differs around the globe. The book is clearly thoroughly thought out, and chapters cleverly named to reflect the issue that he wants to address within. Most of the chapters followed a similar structure: A “blockbuster” opening, some myth-busting and then a quick conclusion. Reading this book while on COVID19 lockdown is an interesting experience (SARS features as one of the topics on the front cover), and I can’t help wondering how different these sorts of books will be between the BC and AC (before/after COVID) eras. My only qualm being that writing could have been a bit more concise, and in certain parts (the middle of chapters tended to get rather draggy) I found my mind starting to wander a bit. Still, 4.5 stars 4 on Goodreads. "
47,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19258748-feng-ouyang,4,"This book has two parts. The first part talks about cognition biases in general. The second part applies this knowledge and examines some phenomena of unfounded fear in culture, politics, and media.The first part mainly draws from other popular books such as “Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman. Although the author tries to tell the stories his own way, the underlying material is not novel, and the pace is very slow. People who are familiar with cognition biases and behavioral economics can pretty much skip this part.The second part consists the last few chapters. It examines how media, corporation, and politicians exploit fear for their gains. The author clearly has a political stand and does not agree with a lot of common views about the environment, terrorism, and some other topics. However, his tone is even and natural, and his arguments are well supported by facts and logic. This part of the book is well worth reading, even reading repeatedly. "
48,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101555902-rosie,4,"We are the healthiest, wealthiest, safest, most educated people to ever live, yet that has done little to assuage the constant fear we feel. Risk is about the ways in which we misunderstand risk. We overestimate the risk of long-tail events like plane crashes, shark attacks, childhood cancer, nuclear attacks, child abductions, and terrorist attacks. We underestimate the risk of common events, like diabetes and car crashes. Gardener begins by running through the science of fear, looking at the ways in which our brains are unsuited to the modern world and the common biases that trip us up. Then he considers the ways in which our fear gets manipulated. Of particular interest is Gardener’s analysis of how politicians manipulate the intense fear surrounding rare yet horrific events (like 9/11 and child murders by strangers) for political gain. If you want the world to seem a little less scary, read this book."
49,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56464899-joseph-vanburen,5,"I am giving this book 5 stars because it has helped me tremendously during these uncertain times amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The Science of Fear is all about risk assessment and critical thinking. It offers the reader a multi-disciplinary approach to considering why we fear what we fear, and why what we fear changes over time. Research from psychology and sociology, as well as history and media communications study, gives author Dan Gardner a wide range of information and perspectives to draw from. The book is objective and educational but also filled with just enough personality to keep it interesting without ever seeming flippant or questioning the seriousness of the subject matter. I loved it, and it has helped me stay calm during this whole coronavirus thing by encouraging me to assess the actual risk of getting infected and taking smart, necessary precautions while not wasting energy on emotional, overblown worries of extremely unlikely scenarios."
50,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14625967-michael-moseley,5,The main pretext of this book is one that has been my mantra for sometime. We live in a safer more prosperious time now than at anytime in our history; but most or at least many people don't believe it. Why is that? I think that Dan Gardner would aruge that it's because we are poor at dealing with risk. Our gut instinct or emontions guide our assesment of risk in a way that distorts our ability to make informed judgements. Our information sources from papers and social meadia gives us a distorted view of facts and even or politics has no benifit of making us feel content. Much if the rise if the political right I feel can be traced to our inability to properly asses risk.This book is such a transformational read i cannot recomend more highly.
51,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51515812-steliyan-stoyanov,5,"Very interesting book, the author gives a ton of relevant examples as well as a lot of stats. A lot of analysis is directly related to the late US history, which gave me a different view on the recent events (last 20-30 years).Personally, I've been trying to be more like the ""head"" and less like the ""gut"", however the author provides very thorough information.This book is a must-read and a great reminder for me why I avoid newspaper and any news, which are basically spreading panic across the population. The media always looks for a flashy title, something to scare the people and attract their attention to awful single events, basically just bending the stats."
52,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58410475-libby-andrews,5,"This book was heavy going because it was so well researched. It proves how much better and safer life is today than at any other point in history, yet people don’t feel this way. The reason for this are 1. Our brain which evolved to help us survive in the cave 2. The media, which is omnipresent today 3. Interested parties who use fear and inaccurate statistics to fight their cause. All three together cause our gut feeling to believe the stories / news we are told. The author picked apart fake beliefs like terrorism, cancer, stranger danger, war etc by showing how false our beliefs about these things are. This book will make you feel great about the world we live in."
53,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29812072-danny-hui,4,"What I liked:The author starts from the prehistoric humans to modern humans in the quest to reveal what exactly is fear.Every claim he makes he backs with scientific facts.My takeaway from this book is that fear is a human invention. And that people can create it to profit from it. Check your facts and live the life you want to live regardless of the fears holding you back.What I didn't like:I read this book a few years ago, and I don't recall any solid lesson.What could be improved:It would be nice if they had one clear take away that I could remember even after a few years."
54,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47665820-robert-kortus,4,"This book is both frightening and comforting at the same time. Frightening to learn and understand just how often and to what extent media, politicians, and corporations use fear to get your support/money/vote. Yet comforting to know that most of these fears are completely unjustified. Gardner goes into detail about the statistical probability of things like child abduction, West Nile virus, and terrorism and the just how unlikely these events are likely to happen to the average American. This book is a good lesson on the importance of skepticism and critical thinking. "
55,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51850513-chandrashekar-gangaraju,4,"As a Clinician who deals with risk on a regular basis, this book was a very interesting read. It explores the societal concept of risk and is quite sympathetic, I thought, towards various professionals who benefit from the politics of fear. I was shocked by some facts. I was wanting to see a chapter at least on the concept of risk in medicine and was somewhat disppointed but I suppose it will be a bigger book on its own and hopefully someone will decide to write it. I thought it was a slightly repetitive probably justifiably. "
56,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4155858-karen,5,"An exceptional book—pragmatic, clear, and surprisingly reassuring.A very rough summary: corporations, politicians, activists, officials, and the media can all profit (financially or otherwise, consciously or not) from promoting fear. Our less savvy Gut is easily influenced, while our more rational Head either doesn't have the facts it needs or simply takes a nap. Author Gardner has pulled together a very rational look at many modern-day fears, ranging from toxins in our foods to terrorism. A very worthwhile read."
57,0525950621,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4567284-rachel-cotterill,3,"I sort of struggled to get past the silly renaming of various heuristics and biases, away from the more common names that I'm familiar with, eg the affect heuristic becomes the Good-Bad Rule, the availability heuristic becomes the Example Rule... maybe that's easier to remember if you're a complete beginner to the field, but it won't help you if you go on to read more widely. Lots of good studies and examples in here, but I've read the same stuff presented better elsewhere. "

Largely based on Kahneman's system 1 / system 2 thinking (rebranded as the more user-friendly 'head' and 'gut'), it's packed with enough examples and engagingly written enough to feel worth skimming through. However, more than a decade after this was published and having read a fair few of these kinds of books, there's not that much new."

Gardner has a real knack for explaining the in-depth and often complex reasons for certain types of human behaviour, particularly decision making. His writing style is very informative and illuminating. He really seems to be able to bring complex topics to light and boil it down to the key factors. Anybody who deals with any type of risks related to human behaviour must read this book. "
