0,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,2,"Another book rec plucked from Bill Gates' reading list.Pros: There are a handful of interesting, thoughtful ideas about the near- and far-future consequences of genetic engineering, and the associated societal issues. It is a very good introduction to the state of genetic engineering (in animals, plants & people) today, where the technology is heading, and some of the outstanding ethical, policy, and geopolitical questions associated with it. As an example, my favourite question the author asked in the book framed the ethics of genetic screening (for negative traits like disease, or positive traits like ability or intelligence) as follows: will people who are ethically opposed to generic screening tomorrow be equated with the anti-vaccine movement of today? What valid reasons can you give for turning down a technological solution to benefit the health of your offspring? Cons: It's a short book (~270 pages), so my common complaint about the material being broad but not deep applies to this one too. Similar to Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century (my review) - touches on lots of interesting ideas, but the devil is in the details. It's also a book about the future, which means that 10-15 years from now the forward-looking predictions might be completely rubbish. I recently read a 13-year-old book about oil predictions over ""the next 10-15 years"" (ie, now), and seeing how much it got wrong was a good cautionary lesson about books that make a lot of predictions. I don't think Hacking Darwin book will be so wrong (its predictions are less specific), but what do I know? I'm going to give it 2 stars - Goodreads mouseover for ""it was OK"". For me it was OK. Pretty darn OK, with engaging writing and some interesting questions asked. After reading this book, there's no doubt in my mind that genetic engineering will become more and more of an important issue in the years to come. Maybe I will come and rev this up to 3 stars in the next few weeks if the ideas stick in my head. But overall, I just wasn't that info it. "

But he consistenly goes off on un-related tangents to bash religous people, politically conservative people and of course Donald Trump (Who doesn't bash on Trump these days?) It is frustrating that when I wanted to learn about genetic engineering, I got bombarded with opinions of the authors in the form of left wing and atheistic propaganda. Leave your bias and personal opnions at home when you write a book like this, Jamie."

The author is occasionally able to strike a good joke to break the science, but it's a science book, so don't be too optimistic. My problems with the title is that in some chapters it felt a little chaotic: there was no real drive or flow to the text and all seemed to be under the theme of the chapter, but nothing more. "
3,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,5,"[I received a copy of this book through NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.]This book is not heavy on the actual science details—if you’re looking for those, you’ll be better to get another book, but if you don’t know that much about genetics, then there won’t be anything in there impossible to follow. It focuses instead on the various advances in genetics in terms of “what do they do”, “what do they entail”, “what could the results be”, and “how should be approach those?” (You can tell that the author has also written novels, because there’s a definitive storytelling thread throughout some of the chapters, especially when he deals with IVF and the potential of modifying embryos to make their future selves healthier. This makes the reading all the more accessible and enjoyable.)You can also tell that Jamie Metzl is probably more on the side of advocating gene-related manipulations than on the side of those who want them banned, but in a cautious way: it’s not all enthusiasm and sparks and giggles, and for every “good point” he lists, he also takes care to consider the negative sides (or potentially negative sides, since there are still many approaches that haven’t been tested, so we just have no idea how people would react when given the choice). And it is true that while the transhumanist in me is excited at so many prospects, the cynic is me is also convinced that, like we so many other things, humanity in general will bork its way through this and pervert it. But let’s keep hope, shall we?“Hacking Darwin” considers the therapeutic potential of genetic intervention. Through current techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9, we are already able to cut material that leading to genetic diseases, although this hasn’t been approved so far on human embryos destined to be implanted, because the results are good, but more on a “60% good” scale than on a “95% good” one. Which leads to understandable caution about all this, and with reason. There is something frightening and sublime (in the philosophical and literary meanings of the word) to all these developing technologies, because when we contemplate them, we are put face to face with how we are, all in all, code; and code can be hacked, and modified, and this could be for the best or for the worst.The best: if we had a chance of preventing babies with genes condemning them to Alzheimer’s or to Huntington’s disease, for instance, shouldn’t we take it and thus prevent future suffering? If we can make crops that yield more nutrients (Golden Rice comes to mind, and is actually even mentioned), shouldn’t we do it, so that people dying of malnutrition illnesses can get a chance at life? And if we could give our future children better health and strength in general, better chances in their future lifes through specific abilities, wouldn’t we want to do that? But the worst, too: who’s to tell that this won’t spiral downward (eugenics and the earluy 20th century come to mind), lead to less diversity (not a good thing), to people all wanting the same kind of child—or, perhaps more alarmingly, to a growing chasm between those who can afford to enhance tyheir future babies, and those who can, thus leading to a class of “superhumans” trampling “subhumans”?The book considers these aspects, and other ones as well, including the major religion’s take on it (you’d be surprised at some of them) and approaches and pitfalls that humanity as a whole must consider here. It doesn’t hold all the answers, far from it. But it gives you a lot of food for thought. And even though it is perhaps too optimistic (again, seeing the world as it is today, I just don’t trust us in general to avoid creating worst societies based on even more inequalities, this time from before the womb), it does remain a very interesting start for more discussions about genetic engineering.4.5 stars"

6,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33998963-ksenia-kulichik,3,"A very readable, relentlessly optimistic book about the future of genetic engineering and how it may be applied to human reproduction. 	Jamie Metzl knows his subject matter very well and is an experienced writer: one does not need to have much familiarity with how human genome works or what the current state of science on the matter is to grasp his arguments. He covers a wide array of loosely related topics: genetic engineering, iPC research, IVF, embryo selection, genetic diseases, GMOs, political handling of all those, what “nature” means in such a context… His ultimate goal is to mobilize his readers to consider genetic engineering in human reproduction and spur productive discussions about it, since it is just around the corner, and to this end the book is a great tool and resource. 	Unfortunately, my pessimism is almost as bottomless as Metzl’s optimism, and a lot of his exuberantly hopeful claims smashed against my entrenched suspicions about the goodness of humanity. I found the brief chapter on social and political dimensions of the genetic engineering revolution (evolution?) he foresees particularly disconcerting. He does acknowledge the current inequality within first world countries and globally, but does not offer any realistic prognoses or sound advice on how genetic science could and should proceed on such terrain. Metzl limits himself to virtuous claims about how flawed our current social order and moral judgements are, and how they could use a critical eye and rethinking, but does not advance further towards how that could be achieved and what the absence of such rethinking would mean for the genetically advancing future of humanity. I see a world divided not just by wealth and technological progress, but by sheer physical fitness, and so does Metzl, but he does not explore this potential future further, simply stating its possible emergence, prescribing critical thinking as an antidote. I think such blasé attitude towards this most realistic of the futures is irresponsible and wish the social, political and financial consequences of genetically engineering humans were explored further in the book.	Despite this shortcoming, “Hacking Darwin” is absolutely worth a read. It is educational, interesting and pleasantly written, and is capable of starting necessary discussions, as it has between my friends and I. I tip my hat to Jamie Metzl for that success.Thanks to NetGalley for a digital ARC of the book."
7,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,4,"Being a father of two this book created a moral and ethical argument within myself on the topic of genetic engineering. If there was a way to pick to apply gene editing prior to my two kids being conceived, I probably would have done some gene editing to my kids. I am someone that reads a lot and can see the benefits of gene editing and the statistical probability of increasing the experience of my children's lives to be better if I didn't choose gene editing. This is a dilemma because it seems that the one who will survive and thrive in the future will be the kids that their parents choose gene editing, which is what Darwin called the ""the survival of fittest."" The only reason I read this book was because of the podcast the author did on Joe Rogan. So a lot of the content was over my head because of my knowledge of gene editing was close to nill before reading this book. It is still close to nill because it is an area of science that is growing and changing quickly but after reading this book seems like it will impact humanity greatly in the near future if not already. "
8,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/777140-alex,5,"This is an absolutely fascinating book.In 'Hacking Darwin,' author Jamie Metzl previews the future of human genetic engineering and the future of mankind. It's a science book for general audiences, so it's a bit of a lift but not unmanageable. The book begins with a refresher on evolution and genetics, moves through a discussion of eugenics, and proceeds to discuss how mankind will press the ""fast forward"" button on human evolution to reduce genetic disease, slow the aging process, and select for traits parents and/or governments find desirable. It concludes with some policy proposals to guide our species in the creation of a global policy on human genetic engineering.I found the first 20% or so of the book to be the most work. It reviewed material I recalled from elementary school reading on evolution, high school biology worksheets on cellular anatomy, and contemporary books on genetics such as Siddhartha Mukherjee's 'The Gene: An Intimate History.' Once Mentzl lays the groundwork, however, this book takes off. He explores recent developments in AI and big data analytics, and explains how the explosion of computing power available to science is beginning to make it possible to think of the gene as just another information storage device - one which can be corrupted, repaired, and modified. He reviews the growth of in vitro fertilization as an option for conceiving parents and explains how it's becoming increasingly possible to select the embryo (among tens today, perhaps thousands tomorrow) with the highest probability of health, longevity, intelligence, athleticism, beauty, or a myriad of other traits parents or governments may value. He discusses the latest developments in the engineering and creation of artificial life, as well as ways in which our increasing ability to analyze and edit the genes of embryos and even adults can affect health and longevity.Most importantly, he makes the case that this revolution in genetic engineering will come whether we're ready for it or not. After all, we live in a world in which most parents with the means are willing to pay for cosmetic orthodontia, some parents with the means are willing to pay for plastic surgery, and all parents with the means are willing to pay for life-saving or life-enhancing medical procedures for their children. Is it too much of a reach to imagine that parents will gladly pay to ensure that their newborn children have every possible advantage in the tooth-and-claw competition that is the global economy? Further, we live in a world in which parents and governments devote massive amounts of time and resources to advance their children's athletic development. Is it too much of a reach to imagine that parents will gladly pay to give their children advantages in speed, strength, reaction time, and other markers of athleticism? Is it too much of a reach to imagine that some governments will demand genetic screening of embryos and fetuses to screen for genetic diseases or, more disturbingly, proactively engineer their next generation to be better scientists, engineers, or warriors? What if we could engineer for radiation resistance, or bone density retention, that might make long-term habitation on places like Mars a possibility? If someone can think of it, someone somewhere someday will probably do it.This leads into the book's last section, policy. Mister Metzl asserts that the upheavals the new technology will create require a species-wide conversation about the future of genetic engineering and ethical guidelines we, as a species, want to create around it. A former Clinton Administration appointee, Metzl has a charming belief in the power and promise of international cooperative and governing bodies such as the United Nations, as well as the wisdom of the crowds that could be harnessed in a global conversation. I admit that the last three years in America have dimmed my view of even this country's ability to wrestle with difficult issues in good faith, much less the world's. Still, I'll root for hope over cynicism every day of the week, even as I keep my powder dry.Regardless of one's beliefs about policy, or one's beliefs (or knowledge) about genetic engineering, the fact is that humanity's ability to influence the fundamental makeup of its offspring is ballooning so rapidly that, one thousand years from now, our descendants may look upon us as we look upon our ancestors of 100,000 years ago. The future is coming. This book will help you get ready."
9,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,3,"This is going to be a long one, so buckle up if you're interested...This was an interesting read. Author Jamie Metzl writes with a style that holds the reader's attention, while effectively communicating the information. This easy writing style makes the book accessible to the layperson. It is not written in the overly technical manner that is a hallmark of many other science books.He covers a lot of ground in here. He starts the book theorizing about the increased utilization of IVF technology in the future, and then a brief outline of genetics, and the mapping of the human genome by The Human Genome Project.He then moves on to Mendelian diseases, twins studies and intelligence. He disappointingly mentions Charles' Murray's ""The Bell Curve"":
""By simultaneously raising the taboo topics of intelligence differences between people and groups, IQ, and race, Herrnstein and Murray smashed into the buzz saw of progressive public opinion.New York Times columnist Bob Herbert called The Bell Curve “a scabrous piece of racial pornography masquerading as serious scholarship.” Harvard’s Stephen Jay Gould, a longtime critic of the concept of general factor intelligence, argued that other environmental factors like prenatal nutrition, home life, and access to quality education had a more significant influence on a person’s intelligence than Herrnstein and Murray accounted for.Other critics attacked the book as reductionist, scientifically sloppy, and dangerously biased.""
...Conveniently not mentioning that the data documenting ""g"" - or general intelligence is very well documented and evidenced, as is the data on group differences. Murray's book was controversial because it hurt people's feelings. That there are average differences between groups is something patently obvious to any child, and something he ironically mentions towards the end of the book, when talking about the prowess of Kenyan runners. It would truly be a miracle of evolution if isolated groups located in vastly different environments around the globe all evolved identical traits, at the same time. He should know better.Moving on from this, he talks about how stem cells can be used to make gametes, and revolutionize IVF technology. This seemed like some odd reasoning, however:
""In their thought-provoking paper, Embryo Selection for Cognitive Enhancement: Curiosity or Game Changer?, Oxford professors Carl Shulman and Nick Bostrom attempt to quantify what increase in IQ might be possible based on mating unimplanted embryos with each other.The IQ of a traditionally conceived child, an n of 1, simply has the genetic component of IQ he or she is born with. Because the genetic component of IQ varies among embryos created by the same parents, other than identical twins, we can safely assume the range of IQ options would be greater the larger the number of embryos that might be generated. This means that we would have a greater chance of selecting an unimplanted embryo with a higher IQ if the number of options was larger.According to Shulman and Bostrom’s calculations, the average IQ difference between the highest and lowest IQ of the fifteen or so embryos conceived in IVF, as practiced today, from the same parents would be about twelve points. But if we use the induced stem-cell procedure to start with a hundred fertilized eggs, rather than just ten or fifteen, the average difference between the highest and lowest genetic IQ potentials between these hundred options is estimated at about twenty points. Making a thousand embryos could increase the average differential between the highest and lowest IQ of all the embryos to about twenty-five points.Twenty-five IQ points may seem like a small return from generating and testing a thousandpre implanted embryos, but that difference would, on average, lead to vastly different life experiences......Shulman and Bostrom estimate that breeding five generations of embryos picked for having the highest IQ among their ten cohorts could create a bump up of sixty-five points in IQ, and a 130-point bump after ten generations.""
I'm not sure you can just keep amplifying intelligence like that. They make the assumption that each grouping of embryos would have examples of progressively higher intelligence zygotes among them, well above the mean. Why would that be so? It seems more likely to me that the embryos will exhibit different values, but will still largely group around the mean. This is evidenced by how intelligence is distributed already in society. If super-high IQ happened with a large statistical regularity, random chance would dictate there would be many more intelligent people than there are now. Even if you could repeatedly select for the highest among the group, at some point you will push up against the physical limitations of our inherent hardware. Neurons can only fire so quickly. Only so many networks can be established and maintained. Our hardware is fixed and finite. He goes on to theorize a person with an IQ of 1000. Doesn't sound very likely to me. The book moves on with talk about CRISPR and gene therapy, gene editing, and the related ethics.These leftist writers crack me up:
""Mozart grew up in the Hapsburg court, but how many Mozarts are today languishing in Syrian refugee camps?""
LOL, judging by the relative technological, cultural, and musical output from the rest of the entire Middle East, I'm going to hazard a guess of NOT TOO MANY...To his credit, however, he then talks at length about GMOs, their introduction, usage, and benefits. He has a good blurb about anti-GMOers:
""...anti-GMO activists, many inspired by some combination of a distrust of newtechnologies, U.S. global corporations, and market capitalism more generally, as well as by theromanticizing of small farmers and fears their food supplies will be contaminated, have increasingly raised the alarm over what they started calling Frankenfoods.Anti-GMO organizations have launched massive disinformation campaigns designed to counter andmuffle the voices of the scientific community. Many people are susceptible to this type of disinformation because most of us instinctively resort to a “naturalistic fallacy” that nature is natural, even though our ancestors have been massively modifying much of it for thousands of years.""
Superfluous long-winded chapter at the end completely detached from reality where the author recommends global-wide regulation on genome editing, based on some empathy-driven ethical concerns he has. These leftist writers are hilarious - in a tragically ironic way... So knowledgeable in certain fields, yet so disconnected from reality. You know who is not encumbered by the same ethical constraints and concerns? CHINA AND RUSSIA. The author doesn't seem to realize the obvious here. Also completely detached from reality; he suggests military intervention could be needed in countries who don't agree to global restriction terms. Has he no understanding of MAD? MAD makes sure this would not be a tenable option with countries like China and Russia... Overall, this was a really interesting book, covering a broad range of science, and related research.I would recommend it, despite the author's inclusion of his laughable, irrelevant and unneeded political/ideological commentary. A cursory glance of his Twitter feed reveals a virtual cornucopia of leftist nonsense, coupled with raging Trump Derangement Syndrome.I wanted to give this 5 stars, but the author's inclusion of his screeching leftist nonsense makes me subtract 2 stars. This book didn't need his ideological commentary. I don't know why these ""progressives"" feel that people will appreciate their evangelizing and virtue signalling in a science book..."

Jamie Metzl provides insight through funny anecdotes, plain speaking English and sifts through all the facts and figures to give us a history of our DNA, what we know already and most important of all, where we are going in the not too distant future. Our children probably will be picking out our grandchildren from a catalog of desired traits and disease-free genes and great grandparents will be there to welcome them.

My thanks to the publisher for the advance copy."
13,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11003362-david,4,"This is an important book that covers an important emerging issue. The main focus of this book is to bring awareness of the issues pertaining to the growing knowledge and implementation of human genetic manipulation and engineering, and to encourage dialog among all people who will be affected by it (which is potentially everyone).  I heard this author on the JRE podcast and was intrigued. While he covered most of the points in this book on the podcast, it should still be required reading. One thing this book lacks is really any definable plan. Like climate change (which is frequently referenced and even used as parallel), it seems we are becoming aware, want to do something, but lack any realistic plan of actual implementation. For that realization, this book is rather depressing, as one gets the feeling that this may yet be another way of destroying ourselves that will be politically, morally and religiously divisive, and we will probably be arguing what to do about it while Rome burns."

16,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21723960-vittorio,4,"Evolution by natural selection is the most powerful force of nature. Starting from small self-replicating molecules almost four billion years ago it produced every single species alive today. Small changes accumulate over generations: if they are beneficial, they spread, if they aren't they are eliminated. Of course, most mutations are neither useful nor harmful, or they can be either depending on environmental factors. A single mutation causes sickle-cell anemia, but that very same mutation increases protection from malaria, making it far more common in areas where malaria is endemic. In other words, evolution is extremely powerful, but it's far from perfect. We are still susceptible to uncountable different diseases, and we slowly grow old and die.All of this, according to the author, is about to change:From this point onward, much of our mutation will not be random. It will be self-designed.From this point onward, our selection will not be natural. It will be self-directed.From this point onward, our species will take active control of our evolutionary process by genetically altering our future offspring into something different from what we are today. We are, in other words, beginning a process of hacking Darwin.Fields like Molecular Biology, Genetic Engineering, and Genomics have progressed to the point where we can start hacking our own genomes in order to change our species. In fact this is already happening with techniques such as Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD), wherein embryos can be screened for known diseases and terminated or implanted accordingly. This rather controversial technique is becoming increasingly common, along with others such as mitochondrial transfer, wherein the mutated mitochondria of a woman's egg cell are swapped with those of a donor's, producing an embryo with genetic material from three different people. This mirrors the experience of IVF itself, which has come to be accepted as normal in just a few years, even though the first ""test-tube baby"" was initially considered an abomination by many.But there's more: Biology is merging with Computer Science and the amount of data available is fuelling new discoveries everyday. Techniques like genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allow us to discover new genes and mutations associated with disease and other traits. With just a few million genomes, researchers argue, we will be able to understand most traits, even extremely complex ones such as intelligence and behavior. To put this into perspective, sequencing a full human genome can be done in a matter of hours or days for a few hundred dollars, and China has announced a plan to sequence half of its newborns.Given these premises, and other technical advances such as gene editing and stem cell manipulation, we may be able to fully control physical and mental traits of future generations within a few decades.This is extremely controversial territory, evoking age-old question like the role of nature and nurture and the spectre of eugenics. The book is a very good primer on the science, technology, ethics, and politics of human germline editing, although in my opinion it doesn't add much to the excellent Gmo Sapiens: The Life-Changing Science of Designer Babies by Paul Knoepfler."
17,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,2,"I love finding books at the very outskirts of my understanding. Most pop-science books either do too much to cater to the lowest common denominator (""black holes are like BIG balls of ENERGY that go CRASH""), or else the opposite - they're written by domain experts like Stephen Hawking who try to explain their ideas without any maths (""black holes are, for reasons too complicated to explain here, shaped like eight-dimensional tori""). Unfortunately this book is firmly in the first category. Metzl has worked as a White House policy analyst and a science-fiction writer, both jobs in which one must speculate wildly about the future with little penalty for inaccuracy. In general I tend to think that long-ranging predictions about nondeterministic systems are always a mug's game, and those foolhardy enough to try it develop a certain immunity to shame. This book contains a lot of speculation about the possibilities of genetic medicine and anti-aging research, and there is little reason to consider it likely.Metzl - an irrepressible optimist - sums up the history and present state of genetics and extrapolates it forward, imagining a very credible slide towards a world of 1) freezing reproductive cells in one's physical prime, 2) widespread IVF and 3) embryo selection based on increasingly fine-grained genetic insights, including eventually not just weeding out diseases (single-gene ""Mendelian"" ones or otherwise) but also selection of physical or personality traits. Is our vague unease about ""designer babies"" likely to halt this progression? Consumed as we are by a million other less important debates, it's hard to see this changing - barring some horrifying scientific developments, of course. Metzl correctly lambasts Europeans for their irrational opposition to GMO crops, and ends with some milquetoast policy suggestions. (These include a ""Non-Proliferation Treaty"" for genetic enhancements - with more advanced nations sharing technology in exchange for agreement to stay within broadly agreed red lines - and distributing educational materials to foster more public dialogue.)Anyway. It's striking to consider the high tide of bioethics, maybe from the Asilomar conference in 1975 until 9/11 erased stem cell research from the public consciousness. All that public nervousness about the future, seemingly much less audible today, seemed to bring about little gain: recombinant DNA research continued and created no monsters, IVF became a common if pricey recourse for couples struggling with infertility, and genetic screening before and after conception is now commonplace. CRISPR/Cas9 has thus far not sparked much ethical hand-wringing. Bioethicists and religious leaders have been left behind by the pace of science, and...so far, everything has been working out? In sum: even though this book is scientifically shallow and not especially well written, it does round up the story so far and show a credible path forward. For me, it was worth reading just for that, but a more expert, less speculative guide - maybe George Church's Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves? - would be better."
18,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20456668-diane-hernandez,5,"Hacking Darwin presents an evenhanded look at the future of genetic intervention from a non-scientist’s point-of-view.The first “test tube baby” was born using IVF in 1978. The human genome was fully sequenced in 2003. CRISPR, a method to cut and paste different genetic code into DNA, was developed in 1988 but first used on human cells in 2013. The combination of these three advances will soon allow IVF embryos to be selected for freedom from disease, hair/eye color, and gender. The ability to select based on IQ, longevity, or personality styles (i.e., extroversion or agreeableness) will soon follow. Basically, our DNA will become an IT product that can be hacked in ways we haven’t even thought of yet. There are many ethical issues inherent in this ability. Would only the rich be able to afford the cost of manipulating their offspring to be smarter than poorer offspring conceived the old fashioned way? Would one “look” be so popular that races are effectively wiped out? Would this allow an entire generation to be wiped out by a new disease for which they are not protected by natural selection? Will we trust artificial intelligence to make humans that are smarter than even they are?Hacking Darwin is a thought-provoking treatise on decisions that will need to be made soon to achieve the best results in the future with genetic engineering. The best part of this book is the author’s easy-to-read style. He uses examples of people in the future casually selecting their baby’s height and IQ. There is nothing so technical here that an average fiction reader cannot understand, or worse, have to Google. Perhaps it is because I’m a book blogger but I think this book would be a great resource for writers looking for ideas for a plot. There are a lot of unspoken “what ifs” in here. Would the genetically engineered younger children dominate the naturally made older ones? Would the smarter children be able to outsmart their parents? Could a disease wipe out a world made up of Kardashian clones? I’m not even an author so imagine what a real author could think up. For that reason, plus this is just a fascinating and well-written book, Hacking Darwin deserves 5 stars!

We're already seeing it or have already seen some preliminary examples of it in IVF, in targeted cancer treatments and immunotherapy, in genetic screenings which give people a warning about inherited conditions or potentially harmful mutations that are present in their DNA. With technology, science, and research gaining steam fast, Metzl argues it's only a matter of time before genetic manipulation becomes not only more feasible but more beneficial/mainstream for the health and evolution of humanity. He paints a strong, not-too-distant future picture that hints at things like embryo selection, the ability to select disease-free traits, pick gender or eye color; the means to enhance youthful rejuvenation, intelligence, athleticism etc. He also addresses the possible pitfalls of such innovation. He doesn't ignore the ethical, geopolitical, or religious questions that many will/should pose, nor does he shy away from listing some potential dangers that things like inequality (rich vs. poor) or reduced diversity (20th century eugenics-like horrors come to mind) could cause. Though Metzl doesn't offer any concrete solutions to any of these problems, which makes sense considering he's philosophizing and not answering, I think it's more important that he raises them at all. It's purposeful on his part. Why, you ask? Because he intends to drop them straight into our consciousness. Forcing us to start thinking about them baldly, tackling them seriously.What this book aims to do, in my opinion, is to inform some while also encouraging a chain of questions so as to further the discussion about genetic engineering and manipulation. That way, we, as a collective species, will start thinking about solutions to future genetically selective-type problems NOW so we have a few foundational answers in place before THEN inevitably arrives.I liked this. Obviously.It's a controversial subject that's handled with a good balance of optimism, realism, and underlying perils. Not overwhelmingly science-dense, either. So if you're worried about not understanding it, don't be. Metzl does a good job of explaining concepts narratively so that they're not difficult to grasp.If you're at all interested in the ethics behind genetic research or future technology, I'd definitely recommend it! 3.5 stars"
20,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66234538-casey-farrell,4,"Metzl has been able to take such an advanced topic such as genetic engineering and break it down to be understood by someone who has never touched the topic beyond the occasional story on the news. That being said, genetic engineering is complicated, so this book can still be a heavy read if you go into this without knowledge of genetics. Reading other reviews, it seems there is confusion on what the purpose of this book was. As a book informing the reader on the current technologies and advancements, it’s incredibly broad. And as a book for predicting where we are headed, also vague and open-ended. But as a book to get the conversation going on a revolution bound to explode in the coming years? Highly effective. Metzl places the reader in hypothetical stories and draws parallels with current ethical dilemmas to have us really consider “What would I do? What would this world look like?” The amount of conversations this sparked among those around me is insane, and I will admit the future of genetic engineering is now heightened on my radar and I won’t be caught off guard. The question is not will the genetic revolution happen (because it is absolutely forming as I write this), but how will we respond? I’ve been reading a lot of historical books, but maybe it’s time I integrate more futurist books, as well. As Metzl ends it, “Fellow humans, let us together begin the conversation.”"

People will send you donations when you’re in that condition. Genetic Engineering imagines a world where humans transcend the limitations of our current Biology(Homo Sapiens has time-limited hardware and a very buggy software) The future of human reproduction may lie in In vitro fertilisation(IVF) and embryo selection to screen for desired human traits(Height, beauty, IQ, resistance to diseases etc).Given the benefits of Genetic Engineering, there are serious ethical concerns to be addressed before it can be widely accepted, chief among them being the uncomfortable parallels with early 20th century Eugenics.This book covers a myriad of topics: The future of reproduction, implications of meddling with our genome, current gene-editing technologies, ethical implications of genetic engineering etcExpect a heavy dosage of Biology."

Anyways...He bases off the ideas from other futurist giants like Ray Kurzweil, Nick Bostrom, and Aubrey de Grey. I don't think there's a particularly original idea in this book. But he brings up interesting discussions around the political implication and everyday practical examples. I did enjoy his walkthrough of how the conversation we might have with the doctors in the future; we will start off with the easy decision of turning off disease provoking genes to a choice into the desirable personality traits.He also discusses how banning gene editing on embryos is impossible from one country is impossible. That is because any pregnant woman has an option to get such treatment in a legal country and bring back the embryoes. That gene, in theory, will be carried on eternally generation after generation.It is a fun thought-provoking read for sure."

The parental instinct to protect offspring and international competition will lead to the universal adoption of these technologies. It is up to individuals, nations and the international community to create educational and regulatory bodies and ensure that the genetic revolution leads to a brighter future.”This was, in quite some time now, the most fascinating and pretty darn frightening book I have read."

The book's saving grace is the next-to-the-last-chapter 'The Arms Race of the Human Race' where the author finally delves into the nitty-gritty ethics behind all he espouses in the previous chapters. I liked the last chapter 'The Future of Humanity', but was disappointed at how rushed it felt and would have preferred to have its vital points covered more specifically throughout the book. An important and timely subject was covered here, but its implications (at least from my perspective) were not. "

Metzl covers the history of genetic engineering, the latest breakthroughs in science, and his visions what the future could look like.Metzl's juxtaposition of state-of-the-art with future implications works extremely well for presenting research material while not burying the reader in piles of scientific literature. The questions he asks and the Gattaca-like future he pictures will leave your head spinning with fear and hope for the future of our species."

27,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110041329-michael,4,"The author makes it explicit that this book is intended to evoke discussion, so the prospective future Metzl proposes and scientific, political and historical views presented are often stated in such a way to allow for discussion. I felt two sides of the coin were always presented, but Metzl makes clear that the one thing we don't get a say on is stopping the genetic revolution.A great overview of most of the modern advances in genetics to date, in scientific language that no person would have difficulty understanding. If I had to recommend the book, I would only give it to an 18-25 age group as most of the topics raised in the book and subsequent questions it will leave you with are important for this particular demographic to consider. It is after all, going to effect them, and their potential future children most.Now...off to freeze my sperm."
28,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56169217-darsh-bakshi,3,It was an okayish read. The book had some brilliant ideas and a lot of thought expirement stuff but majority of it was an exercise in predicting the future without any concrete evidence to support it. A lot of times I felt as if this is no different from any financial forecasting which we do. Knowing in hindsight that majority of the ideas he shared isn't going to be true in future I was a little skeptical yet hopeful. Still a good read.
29,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,4,"Generally, I enjoyed this book. However, it wasn't quite what I expected. I expected that the book would talk about genetic engineering technologies that are new and developing and that was the 'sell' for me. It did... somewhat. But a LOT of the book was philosophy and musings on futurism and genetic engineering, which isn't what I sought out. Even though it wasn't the book I hoped it was, the author writes very passionately about his optimism and the future conundrums of genetic engineering. He's pretty pro genetic engineering and hopes it's the future. I personally... think the idea of living forever is folly and think if people do not die society would remain stagnant (to some degree it has... you see the older generation pushing against progress). I think it's also insanely egotistical in some ways. So I guess I didn't completely AGREE with his philosophy. Also, he would suddenly churn out weird ideas and thoughts that he did NOT cite (diet coke makes you brain damaged apparently? No source cited?). However, that aside, it was fun to see the explorations about how different societies would react to frontiers in genetic engineering and how they are so divided. It was interesting also to read about his thought experiments about the future of reproduction. So, if you like to muse on the future of society in the advent of genetic engineering, go ahead and read it. It's thoughtful, dense, and fun to read. If overly optimistic musings on technology and genetic engineering make your roll your eyes a little, it's probably not the book for you. I liked it though! "

It explains how it works, talks about the philosophical aspect, asks how it’ll impact us as a species, how it’ll affect sex for the purpose of conception (RIP sex to make babies) and much many more questions and important philosophical dilemmas.. The books goal is to provoke thinking and stir the conversation into a field that - in my opinion - is not getting enough attention from the general public yet...I recommend you all to read because I truly believe this will be something that’ll affect us all very soon, so read and get prepped. 4.3 Stars"

Now many oppose application of PGT (pre-implantation genetic testing) i.e. screening of human embryo for gene disorder, however, this will soon be future since it will create human without critical genetic diseases like Huntington’s disease, Down syndrome etc. Author describes the future situation may be fantastic, however not free with danger. This 'genetic enhancement' , through gene splicing by CASPER-CAS9, of human may create a unbridgeable chasm between those who can afford genetic enhancement and those who can't. There may be cold war scenario in creating genetically enhance soldiers who can tolerate any extreme weather or returning of 'eugenic' movement which created Nazi era.

I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in the topic.Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book via Netgalley for review purposes."
40,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19258748-feng-ouyang,4,"The topic of this book is how we should deal with the future of manipulating human genes before or after birth to achieve various goals such as better health, more talent, and more desirable personality traits. The first part is an overview of the history and current status with a concise and accessible explanation of genetic science. It is not the best popular science book on the subject. However, it successfully sets the stage for the subsequent discussion. The author points out that currently, with IVF and in some other circumstances, people can screen the potential embryos based on their genes to avoid having children with severe inherited diseases. We are also advancing the science of connecting genes with health factors and personal traits, although we are still at the beginning of such exploration and can only understand the cases involving a small number of genes. At the same time, gene editing techniques have developed quickly, giving us powerful tools to delete and add genes in our DNA.The second part is a discussion on whether we should allow for further manipulation of genes beyond screening and even beyond health reasons. The author argues that such future manipulation is inevitable for three reasons. First, it is a natural continuation of what we do today. People have been manipulating the genes of animals and plants for tens of thousands of years through passive selection in domestication, active cross-breeding, and genetic engineering. We have also accepted the genetic screening of embryos. Therefore, genetic manipulation is not a domain of God. There is no quantum leap in ethics if we go forward with more deliberate and more invasive genetic manipulation of human genes.Second, it is challenging to maintain the “genetic purity” anyway. As long as we cannot stop all countries from human genetic modification, there will be genetically modified humans entering our gene pool and spreading across the world. Therefore, there is no point in resisting the trend.Third, genetic technologies are a power field of international competition, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Therefore, unilaterally banning genetic manipulation hurts a country.Based on these arguments, the author thinks the best way forward is having international cooperation in setting up regulation and monitoring and drawing a clear boundary on the practices. This part of the book is compelling. However, the arguments do not have much direct factorial support. The author relies on analogies and logical extensions to develop his thesis. For example, the book spent much space recounting Chinese history from Mao’s poor society to the second-largest economy in the world. It then describes China’s competitiveness and ambition in various technical areas. This information is relevant to show that we must address the possibility that China will become a leading genetic editing innovator, and that could impact our national interest. However, to convey such a point, the historical narrative can be significantly simplified and compressed. In fact, such a statement is almost self-evident with today’s media reporting.Lastly, the book offers a short discussion about the danger of human genetic modification. Ill-minded people can use it as a powerful weapon not only against their enemies but against humanity itself. The author thus calls again for international cooperation to ban certain practices, just as how we dealt with nuclear prefoliation. Overall, the book raised an interesting topic and provided much food for thought. However, the examination of the subject is incomplete. Two important considerations are missing in the book.First, we need to delve into the philosophy and ethical contemplations. For example, a tenant of Western ethics is that all men are created equal. Therefore, they have equal rights. Any social policy should not discriminate against people with certain inherited traits, because these traits are not under our control and are considered as random. However, if we can “engineer” superb member of the society, should they have a different set of rights? If we engineer people for a specific purpose such as sport, does that mean they are not intended to participate in other social activities such as governing? If others determine people’s traits before their birth, where does free will stand? These questions show that the introduction of human genetic engineering beyond narrow health concerns will have a profound impact on society and culture. It is not an incremental technology advance, as the author portraits.Second, human genetic engineering poses unique and grave danger comparing to other technologies. One reason is we still have a very poor understanding of genetic science. For example, we may know a gene is responsible for (or associated with) a particular disease or trait. But the same gene may play other roles in physiology that we don’t know about. The interactions of genes are even more complex. Therefore, the consequence of gene editing cannot be predicted with high accuracy and confidence. The other reason is that the result of gene editing is irreversible. All gene editing results will be in the human gene pool forever. One may argue that gene mutation has been operating since the beginning, and gene editing is the same. However, the later operates at a much, much higher speed, and we cannot subject all results to natural selection. Therefore, even if we can control the malicious use of gene editing techniques as the author advocates, gene editing can still threaten human wellbeing or even existence. This book broaches an essential topic that most of us managed to avoid so far. It also shows that our contemplation is just beginning. The book offers more questions than answers, which is probably the very intention of the author."
41,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9142626-deepak-rao,4,"A good book that could very well have been half the size and still served the purpose. Genetic engineering and bio-hacking are transformative technologies which could change the face of our civilization. Genetic engineering has the potential to make our descendants better(or different) than us, by a wide margin. The Homo Deus , envisioned by Yuval Harari, will be built on the foundations of genetic engineering. But this technology may cause large scale disruptions in society and lead to a large number of ethical and other problems. As we debate over the costs and benfits of this technology, one thing is certain that the decisions we take today to regulate and direct research in genetic engineering will significantly impact the trajectory of our future development."
42,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10496704-robert-kenny,2,"I could have written this book myself, and I have no formal background in genetic engineering. I suppose that’s why I was disappointed. I was hoping to learn more about the science. Instead, the author spends nearly all of his time describing the very obvious ways in which genetic engineering may change our society in the future: longer lives, fewer inherited diseases, increased use of in vitro fertilization, and babies genetically designed by their parents. None of these are new concepts, and all have been explored very thoroughly in science fiction and discussions about the ethics of genetic engineering. We’ve been talking about these things for decades. So why write a new book and simply rehash it all? What’s the point of reading non-fiction and not learning anything new?"

46,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103056314-herta-elina-jansone,4,"Read this book for my university's Biology book club. Our general consensus was that the first half of the book is rather boring for those who know biology at an undergraduate level, and some comparisons are just ""bullshit"", as said by a professor. The skin color gradient is not comparable by mutations in petal colors in lilies and petunias, no matter how drastic the color change is. Also, comparing gene editing to nuclear energy because of how it was ""stopped before it could do any harm"" - wrong, nuclear energy caused world-changing harm even before it was employed for energy generation. Additionally, nuclear energy requires large funding and the attention of governments. Meanwhile, genetic engineering can be done in rogue mode, as was stated in the book. And nobody, scientist or gardener, has a good enough understanding of the big picture of genome editing yet. Bioterrorism is unequivocally a major global risk, don't get me wrong. Maybe AI development would be a much better comparison to the progress in genetic research. This is an very anthropocentric book. It would have been better to state this early on rather than after rambling about making the essence of your own children ""readable, writeable, hackable"" for 4-5 chapters. Despite this annoying issue, some good points are made, especially near the end of the book when Metzl finally puts his political science knowledge into use when describing trend-setters and their influence on the future course of Biotechnology research and applications, which blends well into the general scene of global politics.While Europe and the USA are bickering about whether any research on genome manipulation is a sensible thing to do, Chinese companies are acquiring Biotech companies in the bickering regions and carry out research, create genetic databases of whole populations and move towards selecting the best individuals for certain purposes to try to be on top of the world in Bioengineering, intelligence and perhaps even sports (although, in some disciplines, African and some Scandinavians might have better genetics to start with, but it'll become irrelevant once they find something beyond the slow and faulty CRISPR-Cas machinery to apply in the future modifications of embryos).According to Metzl in this book, everything eventually boils down to genetics, just give scientists time to decipher the currently still unknown factors in aging, intelligence, emotional intelligence, extra-/introversion etc. Nurture isn't left out entirely but it's as important in this conversation as a footnote that states that the author is just aware that it exists, and that's it.Important questions are nonetheless raised:- Why should we try to engineer people with specific traits when such people already exist but may be considered worthless in whatever field they have been forced into?- Is it really better to create people that are predisposed towards better skills instead of improving the resources for teaching and supporting the society?- With people eventually stepping into the era of engineering their progeny as they see fit, what remains of the engineered person's individuality, opinion and ability to choose their own path in life? - What should be the standard of genetic engineering as a whole? Who should be responsible for setting the standard, and how should it be set?Discussion of the book gives a lot more food for thought than the book itself. Maybe that's what Metzl tries to achieve with this book - to turn us into ""critical catalysts of this dialogue"". Only through education and discussion can we come closer to achieving consensus about the ultimate purpose and application of this emerging technology."

That is the question asked by the author? Little debate (though some) will occur as science uses genetics to cure disease and prevents hereditary transfer of certain diseases to later generations! But, with mass collection of the human races’ genetics and AI’s ability to pattern that data, the capabilities to select desirable(?) traits to the human race will become possible. What policies will be possible to prevent some civilization to try to use that to capitalize on that capability to advantage themselves? Some policy such as the nuclear proliferation treaty will probably be required. The question is: will some sub-national group try to misuse the technology! Access to large data bases and AI will enable highly trained individual(s) to take steps on their own. How will that capability be policed is another question. The human race evolved, so far, by genetic mixing genes randomly. Genetic errors or good fortune created unfortunate diseases and human genius.As a race we have learned through conflict and resolution to progress, though progress has been uneven. The question is: will we be overcome by the incredible pace of coming change? Will progress continue?It will require wise leadership to take advantage of the wondrous possibilities, while avoiding horrendous risk!A must read for our leaders! The changes will be subtle and seen as generally beneficial by the general public. Nuclear Non-proliferation was easier because destruction by those bombs in Japan demonstrated the existential risk.So leaders are going to have to reach treaties and propose regulations and explain the reasons to the public!!! To do that they will have to become students of our impending rapidly changing future!The author recommends a global dialogue to include top scientist, religious leaders, trusted thinkers to conceive and propose the essential questions that require exploration.Metzl’s proposed questions as follows:1. What can be done to ensure the broadest possible access to the health and well-being benefits of genetic technologies?2. Should there be a limit on the application of genetic technologies to treat or eliminate disease? If so, what should they be? 3. Should people have full access to information about their own and their potential children’s genetic makeup or should this access be limited? If limited, what should the restrictions be and why? 4. Should parents be allowed unlimited freedom to select from among their natural embryos during in vitro fertilization? If not, on what basis should limitations be set? Should parents be allowed to select embryos on non-disease-related traits, like height, projected IQ, personality style, etc.?5. If it is proven safe, should precision gene editing be used to eliminate genetic diseases in adult sex cells and pre-implanted embryos in a manner that would be passed to future generations?6. Do we need a global framework to help prevent the worst abuses of human genetic engineering? 7. What long-term institutions do we need to foster an inclusive global dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering that optimizes the benefits of those technologies and minimizes potential harms? 8. What more can be done to help ensure the genetic revolution helps enhance all of our humanity, and how can each of us be better engaged in the process?I recommend reading this book so you are prepared to participate fully in you and your progeny’s future!"

Thankfully, that is precisely what this book is. While I don't really like that all of the books on this subject sound like over-enthusiastic episode titles for some sci-fi series, the message is important; if we are going to move forward as a country and species with the use of this new technology then the public has to be informed to a degree that is currently unimaginable. This book goes a long way toward bridging the gulf between the incredible advances being made right now at unthinkably exponential rates and the intellectual stagnation of the general populace's understanding over the past few decades. Unfortunately, this discussion and the possibility for national advancement are left to intrepid scientists making cases before governmental bodies consisting entirely of lawyers and businessmen who are themselves beholden to the big money of unlettered, reductionist, simpleton-fostering religious organizations who love to talk endlessly about the need for caution in, ""playing god,"" yet remain blissfully ignorant of the entirety of human biomedical science and think it appropriate to quote Bronze-Age idiocy as a rebuttal to the latest developments in the sciences. That, or the epithet of, ""eugenics,"" is just thrown in as Hitler is to every Twitter conversation about anything. Jamie Metzl is very thorough when it comes to the areas where we do have legitimate cause for concern, and others where a certain naturalistic fallacy continues to rot the minds of otherwise sensible people. He does this with an amusing vignette of a visit to a clinic that progressively gets further and further advanced, allowing him to make choices regarding his future offspring that were unimaginable even a few years before when conceiving his previous children. He also deftly handles the competitive atmosphere that will continue to develop among the leading nations harnessing this technology. His sports reference in this section is particularly apt as given just how much time, money, and science is invested in athletic performance for the bizarrely useless purpose of nationalistic chest-beating at the Olympics every two years, the notion of having a populace that, due to the government's grasp and regulatory ability over genetic modification, is biologically more advanced in terms of resistance to disease/aging and further developed for intellect and physical prowess is one that policy-makers need to understand now. The final chapter is full of genuine policy recommendations and recommendations to the scientific community to achieve the type of widespread education I mentioned earlier. Most of these suggestions make total sense, are genuinely unthinkable in a country as stupid as 2020 USA, and require an intellectual investment on the part of the individual that is hard to fathom. However, that so many books are being written for the layperson about this area of science and public policy gives hope that more well-read future leaders might be able to steer the conversation to more rational levels. One can dream..."

I grew up believing that science would lead the way forward to a more peaceful, prosperous, and humanitarian world. Much like flying cars, electricity too cheap to meter, and the cure for the common cold, this future has not materialized in my lifetime.Messing with genes, whether in plants or animals, has always been a part of science that scared me. Nature is incrediblely complex and interactive and it wouldn’t take much to mess up the balance. The Butterfly Effect speaks to the sensitive interdependence of life on Earth. I’m writing this during the Covid-19 outbreak which shows exactly how vulnerable the human race is to even the smallest of changes.My fear and concern about genetic engineering caused me to pick-up and put back Hacking Darwin: Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity by Jamie Metzl several times. I’m glad that I finally decided to read it.Metzl has written an extremely informative, scientific book that is easy to read. He definitely has a personal opinion about how genetic engineering should proceed. I’m sure that the Non-GMO Project, Greenpeace, and others would differ greatly but I think Metzl ties to present a little of “the other side” in his book.Reading Hacking Darwin has given me a lot of new and useful information. I am no less afraid of genetic engineering than I was before but I now feel that my fears have a factual foundation. That said, I definitely also see Metzl’s argument that genetic “tinkering” can have a positive side. Humans have been engaging in genetic engineering for tens of thousands of years. We have bred a lowly grass into maize, a staple food for millions of people. We have bred rice and wheat so that they can grow in a much wider environment and produce significantly more edible food. These agricultural advancements have kept millions of people from starvation.So how is corn domestication and cultivation in the field any different that reorganizing the corn gene in the lab to resist insects, droughts, and increased global temperatures? For me, the heart of the debate is that genetic “tinkering” of crops provides much faster and sweeping changes and, therefore, could produce devastating results before we even become aware of what we have done. With human embryos the debate centers on “tinkering” with the human germline which would result in inheritable changes that could continue forward for generations possibly producing horrific consequences.Human genetic engineering is the ultimate Ying-Yang of contemporary science. On one had we could solve the horrible suffering of millions of people by preventing Sickle Cell Anemia, Tay–Sachs, and Diabetes. We might even be able to rid the human genome of cancer and heart disease. On the other hand we could reduce the diversity of the human race and create a eugenics movement that would make what the nazis did seem like a walk in the park.I highly recommend this book. It may scare you. It may make your head hurt trying to figure out what is the ethically correct road forward. It definitely will inform you that genetic engineering by one or more countries or companies is inevitable. This is definitely a case that forewarned is forearmed."""

I wore a frown the entire time I read this often deeply unnerving clarion call of a book - not because I did not thoroughly enjoy Jamie Metzl’s book, but rather because my feelings of transhumanistic enthusiasm and (warranted?) neophobia were necessarily in conflict. On one hand, I am inclined to believe that the survival of our progeny (note: I did not say “species”) will continue to be predicated upon our ability to fashion increasingly more effective weapons for our fight against entropy. On the other hand, if Metzl is to be believed, we are at the precipice of an explosion of Cambrian proportions, which will be ignited by our fast approaching competence in genome editing. I wholeheadedly agree with Metzl about the importance of raising public awareness of the issues at hand (everyone should read this book!), not least because I think it is an inexpensive kindness to shout to your neighbors, “brace yourselves!” when not just their minds are about to be blown. I docked a star because of Metzl’s frequent albeit forgivable use of scenarios. While entertaining and doubtless makes such a serious subject more palatable, the discussion of “concrete” scenarios will likely seduce many readers into overestimating the predictability of the future as well as the competence of the prognosticator. At present, we are nowhere near able to enumerate a large enough set of potential outcomes from the genetics revolution, sufficient to inform policies or controls that will help us avoid potholes ahead. This, precisely, is the problem with which we must grapple - and it is a wicked problem. Our present ability to predict the myriad effects of genome editing at the level of the individual is woefully inadequate, to say nothing of our ability to predict broad societal, national or global outcomes. As exceedingly difficult as it is to predict behavior, behavior supervenes on phenotype, and phenotype supervenes on (epi)genotype, and genes, darn them, exhibit pleiotropy. Alas, as Metzl notes, we will likely push forward blindly and with characteristic hubris. Disquietude is visited upon anyone that grasps the full import of the tectonic shifts we will all too soon experience. Reader beware. I am going to be thinking about what I learned in “Hacking Darwin” for a long time, and I am truly grateful to Metzl for writing this book and to the authors of the many bleeding-edge scientific studies cited. I also thank my lucky stars for genes that, at least, make me less susceptible to early-onset glabellar lines."
51,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,5,"An all-encompassing look at the future of gene editing. It covers everything from ancient history, today’s practices, upcoming practices, to possible moral, political, and scientific issues in the coming years. Gene editing is looked at from individual, scientific, governmental, international, and religious viewpoints throughout. War, athletics, space pioneering, individual data protection, and AI are some lenses looked through for speculations on a global scale. The author’s science fiction writing experience shines in a few example scenarios in the book of going to future clinics. One is being put in his character’s shoes and having to face a moral scenario like embryo selection: seeing all of your different potential children on a projected wall, as hundreds of probability statistics, and all of the ethical conflicts that come with it, is very effective at envisioning a similar future reality. While IVF, CRISPR/Cas9, embryo selection, aging, and longevity are thoroughly discussed topics, the author doesn’t lose sight of the importance of keeping our humanity, privacy, and diversity.So much is explored and presented for healthy, proactive discussion. - What if a country has voted on gene editing regulation, but neighboring countries are creating genetically advanced soldiers?- Will empathy and creativity, initially forgotten in the gene editing and AI craze, become increasingly valuable qualities?- Will different races, sexual preferences, and disorders cease to exist?- Will we become more susceptible to natural viruses and germs with a more genetically uniform species?- If you select a male embryo with a genetic proclivity for fast twitch muscles, but he develops an aversion to sports, did you ruin his chances in life? - Will a gap form between enhanced and un-enhanced individuals?""If people have gone ballistic over the environmental, GMO, and abortion debates—if they have manned the barricades and destroyed research centers over genetically modified crops, or attacked abortion clinics and murdered doctors—imagine what they might do when the same diversity of individual, cultural, societal, and governmental views inspires different national approaches to the emerging science of genetically modified people."""
52,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51063190-caden-howlett,5,"In c. 65 AD, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca stated that “…[we] and the things we live amongst are destined to perish.” In rereading Joseph Goldstein’s “Experience of Insight” (1976), I came across this concept eloquently rephrased as a reminder that “…inherent in all things that arise is decay.” Although these are not original ideas of the two men, I thought they served well as representatives of a concern we have had since the beginning of our self-consciousness: mortality.The concept of impermanence is pervasive through all human history, reaching back as far as the earliest surviving work of human literature (the Epic of Gilgamesh). Philosophers, historians, and scientists have always written about death, decay, and mortality as if they were unavoidable universal truths, hence the examples above. Our views on mortality remained constant over thousands of years due to essentially no scientific method and its consequential advances. Only recently has this changed. The unprecedented explosion of technology and scientific ability has profoundly transformed our understanding of life and death and, consequently, we are beginning to question if mortality is indeed a “fundamental truth” of existence. “Hacking Darwin” by Jamie Petzl addresses the current state of genetic engineering. His book makes it crystal clear that biology is no longer what it once was and will continue to change dramatically over the coming decades. Our technology and understanding of human biology are conjoining, and it is possible that within the next 30-50 years we will have the ability to safely alter our genome and greatly prolong our lives. Perhaps more importantly than prolonging our lives, we will be able to selectively choose which genes are present in our children, ultimately allowing us to produce offspring that far exceed us in intelligence, strength, and creativity. Are there limits to this? We will find out. Maybe our period of genetic engineering will only play a minor role between where we are now and the eventual uploading of our consciousness to “the cloud”.I can’t help but wonder what Seneca would think."
53,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16446997-reading,3,"Initially I struggled with this book as the author favoured the techno-utopian perspective, thankfully later chapters brought more balanced alternatives and concerns. Still I do not agree with his conclusions regarding some aspects of genetic engineering and man's apparent omnipresent battle with nature.In presenting humans pursuit of knowledge regarding cancer and domesticing crop's the author seems naive at best and disingenuous at worst when he writes ""...we balanced the costs and benefits and moved forward with imperfect information and a desire to learn and do more."" It's like watching Claude Rains react with feigned shock at witnessing gambling in Rick's, only to moments later surreptitiously receive his winnings. Not including PROFIT as a (if not THE) central motivating factor and therefore criticism, is a critical error in the thinking of all too many techno true believers.The author deserves credit for navigating and studying such a controversial subject that is so fraught with potential for destructive consequences if not applied judiciously. I appreciated observations such as ""Why breed people for superior IQ when we could significantly enhance our society's collective intellectual and problem solving capability by providing real opportunity and better schools to the least advantaged among us?"", and ""Diversity is our species' greatest asset should we chose to embrace it. Reducing our diversity, even with the best of intentions, could become our Achilles' heel."" Of 182Then there are doozies like, ""If we had demanded equal access to smartphones for everyone from the get go, the smartphone industry would never have grown quickly enough to drive down prices to where these phones became accessable to poor people around the world"" huh?! Contradictory and incorrect plus once again it doesn't deal with the inherent problem that capitalism, as presently practiced, perpetuates inequality.Particularly appreciate later chapters 8, 9 as they confront challenges.Author's continuing mantra ""...we are in a perpetual struggle with the cruelty of the natural world."" and his desire ""...to transcend our limited biology and, someday, our time-limited planet."" was impossible to get pay as it colored so many of the author's conclusions and observations."
54,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,3,"Easy-going, broad and largely-nontechnical introduction to human genetic engineering. The first couple of chapters are a tad off-putting as Metzl overindulges in an overt catechism of what is ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, the porous boundaries between disease prevention and enhancement, and the fine lines between eugenics and improvements to well-being. But if you can ignore the polemic that is sprinkled throughout the book there is a fair amount of informative material that is worth knowing. Metzl covers embryo screening, iterative embryo selection, induced pluripotent stem cells, mitochondrial transfer, gene therapy, CRISPR soup (Cas9, Cas12b2, Cas13a…), germline modifications, and life extension research. While he is at it, Metzl also comments on various regulatory regimes (UK, Europe, US, China, Middle East) that accommodate or fail to accommodate various forms of biotechnology. The last couple of chapters switches back to ‘how should we think about this’ mode, but it actually makes for a pretty engaging coda. One of his larger points is that differences in first principles among various nations are irreducible, and while we must strive for a global regulatory framework the challenge of achieving consensus is immense. He suggests that our best hope are categorical negatives which specify blatant red-lines that no biotechnology development should cross. I must admit that a libertarian in me is not unsympathetic to this ‘negative international rights’ idea.His other larger point is that international competition and global interconnectedness are all too likely to blow any good intentions out of the water. For example a country that forbids genetic enhancement and bioengineering out of concern for ‘human dignity’ will be faced with a prospect of being out-competed internationally, won’t be able to prevent its citizens from traveling elsewhere for desired procedures, and will need to forbid genetically-enhanced high-skill immigration from abroad. And if it does, it will end up paying for ‘human dignity’ with a totalitarian regime."

Hacking Darwin gets deep into the potential of genetic engineering and what it could mean for the human race. Hint, things will be much different than they are today. From the book description: “At the dawn of the genetics revolution, our DNA is becoming as readable, writable, and hackable as our information technology. But as humanity starts retooling our own genetic code, the choices we make today will be the difference between realizing breathtaking advances in human well-being and descending into a dangerous and potentially deadly genetic arms race.” Decisions will be made tomorrow that seem impossible today. This book may unsettle some who have rigid beliefs. They may hope to never experience what this book lays out as our likely future. Things like picking your kids traits, upgrading your biology, capabilities, personality, intelligence, strength, curing illnesses/diseases and practically anything you can think of as a genetic trait. No matter how you feel about it, it’s inevitable that things laid out in this book will happen. The author stresses that it’s important to have more discussion about the global implications of humanity’s future when it comes to genetic engineering. He likened it to the 1970 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, where the entire global community recognized both the opportunities and dangers and created standards that major powers agreed on. He states that implications could be just as serious if we don’t get ahead of this emerging field and create global standards that leverage the benefits while limiting the downsides. This is an interesting book that will make you view the world differently. It’s important to understand what’s coming and people who read this will be ahead of most in that regard."

""Hacking Darwin"" discusses the power of genetic technology and its possible future societal and ethical implications. ⁣⁣The book covers numerous topics including gene editing tools such as CRISPR, the future of reproduction and human enhancement, preimplantation genetic screening and editing, mitochondrial replacement therapy, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in gene editing, ageing, etc. An overview of the science and technology of genetic engineering is provided in a very comprehensible way even to readers who do not have a scientific background. ⁣⁣The author elegantly weaves the scientific, social, and ethical perspectives in his analyses and offers balanced views on the positives and negatives based on research. He draws parallels between the future of human enhancement with past and current events, such as the Eugenics movement of the 20th century and the cultural diversity between nations in relation to genetically modified (GM) food and crops. There’s also a very insightful talk about the importance of diversity for human survival. ⁣⁣The author provides future predictions of genetic engineering and possible conversations between parents and doctors about embryo gene editing and enhancement for certain traits. At the moment, there are so many technical and scientific challenges and many undiscovered biological pathways that these future scenarios might seem far-fetched. We might not be there yet, but given the rate at which advancements are being made, this book would definitely make you think deep about these future dilemmas and the need for global regulations.⁣⁣My only one criticism is that discussions sometimes get lengthy and protracted particularly in the final chapters. Nevertheless, I’d definitely recommend this thought-provoking and insightful read.⁣"
57,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38293445-stripe-fisk,4,"This is an interesting book that I think is best read as a way to look at where genetic technology is now, with a more skeptical eye towards where the author thinks it will arrive in the future. Though I agree with some of his predictions, others seem a little outlandish, or at least he is expecting them far too soon.The main thing that irked me about this book is the way that the author will occasionally mention a complication to one of his ideas, explain it, but go on describing his predictions as though that complication doesn’t really matter. For instance, he occasionally references how the human phenotype is affected by much more than just our straight genes due to epigenetic factors (and more!) but not much time is spent on this idea. There’s also a section where, after mentioning how intelligence is hard to define and there are some issues with IQ as a measurement, he marvels at the possibility of a human born with an IQ of 1000. (He also doesn’t acknowledge that there might be some limits to how far we can tweak our genome.) These moments make it a little hard to take some of his other predictions and claims seriously.Still, as I said, the book does a good job in outlining some of the current science on genetic engineering and outlines them in a straightforward but entertaining way. The chapters on aging and the future of fertility clinics were particularly engaging, though admittedly I found my eyes glazing over at his discussion of political movements in the last couple of chapter. That could just be my own bias, though.I’d definitely recommend this book for anybody interested in our progress toward genetic information, as long as they’re ready to take some predictions with a grain of salt."

Metzl has written an engaging, fascinating and thought-provoking book that focuses on the fast approaching and inevitable (and exiting) genetic revolution, with clear explanations of the tools involved and the consequences of their use. The writing is clear, explanations accurate and not too technical for the general interested reader.This book covers a vast array of topics that fall under the genetic engineering umbrella. He starts off with the history of genetic research, IVF, genetic screening; and continues with the relationship between genetics, diseases, traits, the environment; AI tools to process complex genetic patters; the pros and cons of the genetic engineering tools; ""designer babies""; stem-cell research; mitochondrial disease; multiple donar babies; gene-editing tools such as CRISPR; gene-therapy; safety issues and challenges to the current technology; chimeras; organ transplants; synthetic biology; aging; the ethics and responsibility of using genetic engineering tool; our relationship with nature; GMOs; the arms race of the human race; and finaly, the furture of humanity.Metzl states that his intent is to inform the public about the genetic revolution so that we can ""make the smartest collective decisions about our war forward... to understand what is happening and what's at stake."" Genetic entineering is a tool. The genetic revolution has the potential to improve lives or do great harm. The future of humanity depends on how we use it. "

Overall, it was an incredibly interesting, insightful, thought-provoking, and well-researched book. There was a lot of information and questions to absorb and think about. As a high school student who is interested in genetics/genetic engineering, Hacking Darwin detailed perspectives, history, and knowledge previously unknown to me and also provided me with countless sources for further reading. Throughout the book, Metzl connects the future ethical, political, and social ramifications of our choices to current issues and topics (like abortion) that made his argument more relatable and heightened the sense of urgency of the situation at hand.Jamie Metzl ultimately tries to create conversation and collaboration over a topic that we cannot afford to ignore. It informs without being overly technical, making it understandable and discussable for the general public. This book is a great thought-provoker for everyday readers and for anyone who wants to learn more about genetic engineering, especially the ethical dilemmas surrounding it. I would recommend it to anyone, especially high school and college students and teachers because it is so important for the future of our species, but also because it brings up important discussions in many subjects.

70,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19258748-feng-ouyang,4,"The topic of this book is how we should deal with the future of manipulating human genes before or after birth to achieve various goals such as better health, more talent, and more desirable personality traits. The first part is an overview of the history and current status with a concise and accessible explanation of genetic science. It is not the best popular science book on the subject. However, it successfully sets the stage for the subsequent discussion. The author points out that currently, with IVF and in some other circumstances, people can screen the potential embryos based on their genes to avoid having children with severe inherited diseases. We are also advancing the science of connecting genes with health factors and personal traits, although we are still at the beginning of such exploration and can only understand the cases involving a small number of genes. At the same time, gene editing techniques have developed quickly, giving us powerful tools to delete and add genes in our DNA.The second part is a discussion on whether we should allow for further manipulation of genes beyond screening and even beyond health reasons. The author argues that such future manipulation is inevitable for three reasons. First, it is a natural continuation of what we do today. People have been manipulating the genes of animals and plants for tens of thousands of years through passive selection in domestication, active cross-breeding, and genetic engineering. We have also accepted the genetic screening of embryos. Therefore, genetic manipulation is not a domain of God. There is no quantum leap in ethics if we go forward with more deliberate and more invasive genetic manipulation of human genes.Second, it is challenging to maintain the “genetic purity” anyway. As long as we cannot stop all countries from human genetic modification, there will be genetically modified humans entering our gene pool and spreading across the world. Therefore, there is no point in resisting the trend.Third, genetic technologies are a power field of international competition, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Therefore, unilaterally banning genetic manipulation hurts a country.Based on these arguments, the author thinks the best way forward is having international cooperation in setting up regulation and monitoring and drawing a clear boundary on the practices. This part of the book is compelling. However, the arguments do not have much direct factorial support. The author relies on analogies and logical extensions to develop his thesis. For example, the book spent much space recounting Chinese history from Mao’s poor society to the second-largest economy in the world. It then describes China’s competitiveness and ambition in various technical areas. This information is relevant to show that we must address the possibility that China will become a leading genetic editing innovator, and that could impact our national interest. However, to convey such a point, the historical narrative can be significantly simplified and compressed. In fact, such a statement is almost self-evident with today’s media reporting.Lastly, the book offers a short discussion about the danger of human genetic modification. Ill-minded people can use it as a powerful weapon not only against their enemies but against humanity itself. The author thus calls again for international cooperation to ban certain practices, just as how we dealt with nuclear prefoliation. Overall, the book raised an interesting topic and provided much food for thought. However, the examination of the subject is incomplete. Two important considerations are missing in the book.First, we need to delve into the philosophy and ethical contemplations. For example, a tenant of Western ethics is that all men are created equal. Therefore, they have equal rights. Any social policy should not discriminate against people with certain inherited traits, because these traits are not under our control and are considered as random. However, if we can “engineer” superb member of the society, should they have a different set of rights? If we engineer people for a specific purpose such as sport, does that mean they are not intended to participate in other social activities such as governing? If others determine people’s traits before their birth, where does free will stand? These questions show that the introduction of human genetic engineering beyond narrow health concerns will have a profound impact on society and culture. It is not an incremental technology advance, as the author portraits.Second, human genetic engineering poses unique and grave danger comparing to other technologies. One reason is we still have a very poor understanding of genetic science. For example, we may know a gene is responsible for (or associated with) a particular disease or trait. But the same gene may play other roles in physiology that we don’t know about. The interactions of genes are even more complex. Therefore, the consequence of gene editing cannot be predicted with high accuracy and confidence. The other reason is that the result of gene editing is irreversible. All gene editing results will be in the human gene pool forever. One may argue that gene mutation has been operating since the beginning, and gene editing is the same. However, the later operates at a much, much higher speed, and we cannot subject all results to natural selection. Therefore, even if we can control the malicious use of gene editing techniques as the author advocates, gene editing can still threaten human wellbeing or even existence. This book broaches an essential topic that most of us managed to avoid so far. It also shows that our contemplation is just beginning. The book offers more questions than answers, which is probably the very intention of the author."

Genetic engineering and bio-hacking are transformative technologies which could change the face of our civilization. Genetic engineering has the potential to make our descendants better(or different) than us, by a wide margin. The Homo Deus , envisioned by Yuval Harari, will be built on the foundations of genetic engineering. But this technology may cause large scale disruptions in society and lead to a large number of ethical and other problems. As we debate over the costs and benfits of this technology, one thing is certain that the decisions we take today to regulate and direct research in genetic engineering will significantly impact the trajectory of our future development."
72,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10496704-robert-kenny,2,"I could have written this book myself, and I have no formal background in genetic engineering. I suppose that’s why I was disappointed. I was hoping to learn more about the science. Instead, the author spends nearly all of his time describing the very obvious ways in which genetic engineering may change our society in the future: longer lives, fewer inherited diseases, increased use of in vitro fertilization, and babies genetically designed by their parents. None of these are new concepts, and all have been explored very thoroughly in science fiction and discussions about the ethics of genetic engineering. We’ve been talking about these things for decades. So why write a new book and simply rehash it all? What’s the point of reading non-fiction and not learning anything new?"
73,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31958906-dhyey-desai,2,"Some of the implications of genetic engineering are pretty scary and unregulated states like China run the risk of pushing the technology to the worst outcome. If the author's aim is to raise alarm and encourage efforts to regulate the technology, the author succeeds. The book lacks on the details of the technology and weighs heavier on thought experiments."
74,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3827299-foggygirl,4,A very interesting read about the possible hurdles and problems that will arise with the future use of human genetic engineering. And they will definitely arise because we humans won't be able to stop ourselves. 
75,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6888651-jenn-adams,2,Reading as many Goodreads Choice Nominees as I can.Not excited to give a harsh rating for a book that I'm sure would be great for many people. But I personally didn't get a lot from it. It felt very surface level and I don't feel like I learned anything.
76,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103056314-herta-elina-jansone,4,"Read this book for my university's Biology book club. Our general consensus was that the first half of the book is rather boring for those who know biology at an undergraduate level, and some comparisons are just ""bullshit"", as said by a professor. The skin color gradient is not comparable by mutations in petal colors in lilies and petunias, no matter how drastic the color change is. Also, comparing gene editing to nuclear energy because of how it was ""stopped before it could do any harm"" - wrong, nuclear energy caused world-changing harm even before it was employed for energy generation. Additionally, nuclear energy requires large funding and the attention of governments. Meanwhile, genetic engineering can be done in rogue mode, as was stated in the book. And nobody, scientist or gardener, has a good enough understanding of the big picture of genome editing yet. Bioterrorism is unequivocally a major global risk, don't get me wrong. Maybe AI development would be a much better comparison to the progress in genetic research. This is an very anthropocentric book. It would have been better to state this early on rather than after rambling about making the essence of your own children ""readable, writeable, hackable"" for 4-5 chapters. Despite this annoying issue, some good points are made, especially near the end of the book when Metzl finally puts his political science knowledge into use when describing trend-setters and their influence on the future course of Biotechnology research and applications, which blends well into the general scene of global politics.While Europe and the USA are bickering about whether any research on genome manipulation is a sensible thing to do, Chinese companies are acquiring Biotech companies in the bickering regions and carry out research, create genetic databases of whole populations and move towards selecting the best individuals for certain purposes to try to be on top of the world in Bioengineering, intelligence and perhaps even sports (although, in some disciplines, African and some Scandinavians might have better genetics to start with, but it'll become irrelevant once they find something beyond the slow and faulty CRISPR-Cas machinery to apply in the future modifications of embryos).According to Metzl in this book, everything eventually boils down to genetics, just give scientists time to decipher the currently still unknown factors in aging, intelligence, emotional intelligence, extra-/introversion etc. Nurture isn't left out entirely but it's as important in this conversation as a footnote that states that the author is just aware that it exists, and that's it.Important questions are nonetheless raised:- Why should we try to engineer people with specific traits when such people already exist but may be considered worthless in whatever field they have been forced into?- Is it really better to create people that are predisposed towards better skills instead of improving the resources for teaching and supporting the society?- With people eventually stepping into the era of engineering their progeny as they see fit, what remains of the engineered person's individuality, opinion and ability to choose their own path in life? - What should be the standard of genetic engineering as a whole? Who should be responsible for setting the standard, and how should it be set?Discussion of the book gives a lot more food for thought than the book itself. Maybe that's what Metzl tries to achieve with this book - to turn us into ""critical catalysts of this dialogue"". Only through education and discussion can we come closer to achieving consensus about the ultimate purpose and application of this emerging technology."

That is the question asked by the author? Little debate (though some) will occur as science uses genetics to cure disease and prevents hereditary transfer of certain diseases to later generations! But, with mass collection of the human races’ genetics and AI’s ability to pattern that data, the capabilities to select desirable(?) traits to the human race will become possible. What policies will be possible to prevent some civilization to try to use that to capitalize on that capability to advantage themselves? Some policy such as the nuclear proliferation treaty will probably be required. The question is: will some sub-national group try to misuse the technology! Access to large data bases and AI will enable highly trained individual(s) to take steps on their own. How will that capability be policed is another question. The human race evolved, so far, by genetic mixing genes randomly. Genetic errors or good fortune created unfortunate diseases and human genius.As a race we have learned through conflict and resolution to progress, though progress has been uneven. The question is: will we be overcome by the incredible pace of coming change? Will progress continue?It will require wise leadership to take advantage of the wondrous possibilities, while avoiding horrendous risk!A must read for our leaders! The changes will be subtle and seen as generally beneficial by the general public. Nuclear Non-proliferation was easier because destruction by those bombs in Japan demonstrated the existential risk.So leaders are going to have to reach treaties and propose regulations and explain the reasons to the public!!! To do that they will have to become students of our impending rapidly changing future!The author recommends a global dialogue to include top scientist, religious leaders, trusted thinkers to conceive and propose the essential questions that require exploration.Metzl’s proposed questions as follows:1. What can be done to ensure the broadest possible access to the health and well-being benefits of genetic technologies?2. Should there be a limit on the application of genetic technologies to treat or eliminate disease? If so, what should they be? 3. Should people have full access to information about their own and their potential children’s genetic makeup or should this access be limited? If limited, what should the restrictions be and why? 4. Should parents be allowed unlimited freedom to select from among their natural embryos during in vitro fertilization? If not, on what basis should limitations be set? Should parents be allowed to select embryos on non-disease-related traits, like height, projected IQ, personality style, etc.?5. If it is proven safe, should precision gene editing be used to eliminate genetic diseases in adult sex cells and pre-implanted embryos in a manner that would be passed to future generations?6. Do we need a global framework to help prevent the worst abuses of human genetic engineering? 7. What long-term institutions do we need to foster an inclusive global dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering that optimizes the benefits of those technologies and minimizes potential harms? 8. What more can be done to help ensure the genetic revolution helps enhance all of our humanity, and how can each of us be better engaged in the process?I recommend reading this book so you are prepared to participate fully in you and your progeny’s future!"

Thankfully, that is precisely what this book is. While I don't really like that all of the books on this subject sound like over-enthusiastic episode titles for some sci-fi series, the message is important; if we are going to move forward as a country and species with the use of this new technology then the public has to be informed to a degree that is currently unimaginable. This book goes a long way toward bridging the gulf between the incredible advances being made right now at unthinkably exponential rates and the intellectual stagnation of the general populace's understanding over the past few decades. Unfortunately, this discussion and the possibility for national advancement are left to intrepid scientists making cases before governmental bodies consisting entirely of lawyers and businessmen who are themselves beholden to the big money of unlettered, reductionist, simpleton-fostering religious organizations who love to talk endlessly about the need for caution in, ""playing god,"" yet remain blissfully ignorant of the entirety of human biomedical science and think it appropriate to quote Bronze-Age idiocy as a rebuttal to the latest developments in the sciences. That, or the epithet of, ""eugenics,"" is just thrown in as Hitler is to every Twitter conversation about anything. Jamie Metzl is very thorough when it comes to the areas where we do have legitimate cause for concern, and others where a certain naturalistic fallacy continues to rot the minds of otherwise sensible people. He does this with an amusing vignette of a visit to a clinic that progressively gets further and further advanced, allowing him to make choices regarding his future offspring that were unimaginable even a few years before when conceiving his previous children. He also deftly handles the competitive atmosphere that will continue to develop among the leading nations harnessing this technology. His sports reference in this section is particularly apt as given just how much time, money, and science is invested in athletic performance for the bizarrely useless purpose of nationalistic chest-beating at the Olympics every two years, the notion of having a populace that, due to the government's grasp and regulatory ability over genetic modification, is biologically more advanced in terms of resistance to disease/aging and further developed for intellect and physical prowess is one that policy-makers need to understand now. The final chapter is full of genuine policy recommendations and recommendations to the scientific community to achieve the type of widespread education I mentioned earlier. Most of these suggestions make total sense, are genuinely unthinkable in a country as stupid as 2020 USA, and require an intellectual investment on the part of the individual that is hard to fathom. However, that so many books are being written for the layperson about this area of science and public policy gives hope that more well-read future leaders might be able to steer the conversation to more rational levels. One can dream..."
79,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"I love science and books about science. I grew up believing that science would lead the way forward to a more peaceful, prosperous, and humanitarian world. Much like flying cars, electricity too cheap to meter, and the cure for the common cold, this future has not materialized in my lifetime.Messing with genes, whether in plants or animals, has always been a part of science that scared me. Nature is incrediblely complex and interactive and it wouldn’t take much to mess up the balance. The Butterfly Effect speaks to the sensitive interdependence of life on Earth. I’m writing this during the Covid-19 outbreak which shows exactly how vulnerable the human race is to even the smallest of changes.My fear and concern about genetic engineering caused me to pick-up and put back Hacking Darwin: Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity by Jamie Metzl several times. I’m glad that I finally decided to read it.Metzl has written an extremely informative, scientific book that is easy to read. He definitely has a personal opinion about how genetic engineering should proceed. I’m sure that the Non-GMO Project, Greenpeace, and others would differ greatly but I think Metzl ties to present a little of “the other side” in his book.Reading Hacking Darwin has given me a lot of new and useful information. I am no less afraid of genetic engineering than I was before but I now feel that my fears have a factual foundation. That said, I definitely also see Metzl’s argument that genetic “tinkering” can have a positive side. Humans have been engaging in genetic engineering for tens of thousands of years. We have bred a lowly grass into maize, a staple food for millions of people. We have bred rice and wheat so that they can grow in a much wider environment and produce significantly more edible food. These agricultural advancements have kept millions of people from starvation.So how is corn domestication and cultivation in the field any different that reorganizing the corn gene in the lab to resist insects, droughts, and increased global temperatures? For me, the heart of the debate is that genetic “tinkering” of crops provides much faster and sweeping changes and, therefore, could produce devastating results before we even become aware of what we have done. With human embryos the debate centers on “tinkering” with the human germline which would result in inheritable changes that could continue forward for generations possibly producing horrific consequences.Human genetic engineering is the ultimate Ying-Yang of contemporary science. On one had we could solve the horrible suffering of millions of people by preventing Sickle Cell Anemia, Tay–Sachs, and Diabetes. We might even be able to rid the human genome of cancer and heart disease. On the other hand we could reduce the diversity of the human race and create a eugenics movement that would make what the nazis did seem like a walk in the park.I highly recommend this book. It may scare you. It may make your head hurt trying to figure out what is the ethically correct road forward. It definitely will inform you that genetic engineering by one or more countries or companies is inevitable. This is definitely a case that forewarned is forearmed."""
80,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59225695-rodney-jehu,4,"“The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born” - indeed. I wore a frown the entire time I read this often deeply unnerving clarion call of a book - not because I did not thoroughly enjoy Jamie Metzl’s book, but rather because my feelings of transhumanistic enthusiasm and (warranted?) neophobia were necessarily in conflict. On one hand, I am inclined to believe that the survival of our progeny (note: I did not say “species”) will continue to be predicated upon our ability to fashion increasingly more effective weapons for our fight against entropy. On the other hand, if Metzl is to be believed, we are at the precipice of an explosion of Cambrian proportions, which will be ignited by our fast approaching competence in genome editing. I wholeheadedly agree with Metzl about the importance of raising public awareness of the issues at hand (everyone should read this book!), not least because I think it is an inexpensive kindness to shout to your neighbors, “brace yourselves!” when not just their minds are about to be blown. I docked a star because of Metzl’s frequent albeit forgivable use of scenarios. While entertaining and doubtless makes such a serious subject more palatable, the discussion of “concrete” scenarios will likely seduce many readers into overestimating the predictability of the future as well as the competence of the prognosticator. At present, we are nowhere near able to enumerate a large enough set of potential outcomes from the genetics revolution, sufficient to inform policies or controls that will help us avoid potholes ahead. This, precisely, is the problem with which we must grapple - and it is a wicked problem. Our present ability to predict the myriad effects of genome editing at the level of the individual is woefully inadequate, to say nothing of our ability to predict broad societal, national or global outcomes. As exceedingly difficult as it is to predict behavior, behavior supervenes on phenotype, and phenotype supervenes on (epi)genotype, and genes, darn them, exhibit pleiotropy. Alas, as Metzl notes, we will likely push forward blindly and with characteristic hubris. Disquietude is visited upon anyone that grasps the full import of the tectonic shifts we will all too soon experience. Reader beware. I am going to be thinking about what I learned in “Hacking Darwin” for a long time, and I am truly grateful to Metzl for writing this book and to the authors of the many bleeding-edge scientific studies cited. I also thank my lucky stars for genes that, at least, make me less susceptible to early-onset glabellar lines."
81,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,5,"An all-encompassing look at the future of gene editing. It covers everything from ancient history, today’s practices, upcoming practices, to possible moral, political, and scientific issues in the coming years. Gene editing is looked at from individual, scientific, governmental, international, and religious viewpoints throughout. War, athletics, space pioneering, individual data protection, and AI are some lenses looked through for speculations on a global scale. The author’s science fiction writing experience shines in a few example scenarios in the book of going to future clinics. One is being put in his character’s shoes and having to face a moral scenario like embryo selection: seeing all of your different potential children on a projected wall, as hundreds of probability statistics, and all of the ethical conflicts that come with it, is very effective at envisioning a similar future reality. While IVF, CRISPR/Cas9, embryo selection, aging, and longevity are thoroughly discussed topics, the author doesn’t lose sight of the importance of keeping our humanity, privacy, and diversity.So much is explored and presented for healthy, proactive discussion. - What if a country has voted on gene editing regulation, but neighboring countries are creating genetically advanced soldiers?- Will empathy and creativity, initially forgotten in the gene editing and AI craze, become increasingly valuable qualities?- Will different races, sexual preferences, and disorders cease to exist?- Will we become more susceptible to natural viruses and germs with a more genetically uniform species?- If you select a male embryo with a genetic proclivity for fast twitch muscles, but he develops an aversion to sports, did you ruin his chances in life? - Will a gap form between enhanced and un-enhanced individuals?""If people have gone ballistic over the environmental, GMO, and abortion debates—if they have manned the barricades and destroyed research centers over genetically modified crops, or attacked abortion clinics and murdered doctors—imagine what they might do when the same diversity of individual, cultural, societal, and governmental views inspires different national approaches to the emerging science of genetically modified people."""
82,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51063190-caden-howlett,5,"In c. 65 AD, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca stated that “…[we] and the things we live amongst are destined to perish.” In rereading Joseph Goldstein’s “Experience of Insight” (1976), I came across this concept eloquently rephrased as a reminder that “…inherent in all things that arise is decay.” Although these are not original ideas of the two men, I thought they served well as representatives of a concern we have had since the beginning of our self-consciousness: mortality.The concept of impermanence is pervasive through all human history, reaching back as far as the earliest surviving work of human literature (the Epic of Gilgamesh). Philosophers, historians, and scientists have always written about death, decay, and mortality as if they were unavoidable universal truths, hence the examples above. Our views on mortality remained constant over thousands of years due to essentially no scientific method and its consequential advances. Only recently has this changed. The unprecedented explosion of technology and scientific ability has profoundly transformed our understanding of life and death and, consequently, we are beginning to question if mortality is indeed a “fundamental truth” of existence. “Hacking Darwin” by Jamie Petzl addresses the current state of genetic engineering. His book makes it crystal clear that biology is no longer what it once was and will continue to change dramatically over the coming decades. Our technology and understanding of human biology are conjoining, and it is possible that within the next 30-50 years we will have the ability to safely alter our genome and greatly prolong our lives. Perhaps more importantly than prolonging our lives, we will be able to selectively choose which genes are present in our children, ultimately allowing us to produce offspring that far exceed us in intelligence, strength, and creativity. Are there limits to this? We will find out. Maybe our period of genetic engineering will only play a minor role between where we are now and the eventual uploading of our consciousness to “the cloud”.I can’t help but wonder what Seneca would think."
83,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16446997-reading,3,"Initially I struggled with this book as the author favoured the techno-utopian perspective, thankfully later chapters brought more balanced alternatives and concerns. Still I do not agree with his conclusions regarding some aspects of genetic engineering and man's apparent omnipresent battle with nature.In presenting humans pursuit of knowledge regarding cancer and domesticing crop's the author seems naive at best and disingenuous at worst when he writes ""...we balanced the costs and benefits and moved forward with imperfect information and a desire to learn and do more."" It's like watching Claude Rains react with feigned shock at witnessing gambling in Rick's, only to moments later surreptitiously receive his winnings. Not including PROFIT as a (if not THE) central motivating factor and therefore criticism, is a critical error in the thinking of all too many techno true believers.The author deserves credit for navigating and studying such a controversial subject that is so fraught with potential for destructive consequences if not applied judiciously. I appreciated observations such as ""Why breed people for superior IQ when we could significantly enhance our society's collective intellectual and problem solving capability by providing real opportunity and better schools to the least advantaged among us?"", and ""Diversity is our species' greatest asset should we chose to embrace it. Reducing our diversity, even with the best of intentions, could become our Achilles' heel."" Of 182Then there are doozies like, ""If we had demanded equal access to smartphones for everyone from the get go, the smartphone industry would never have grown quickly enough to drive down prices to where these phones became accessable to poor people around the world"" huh?! Contradictory and incorrect plus once again it doesn't deal with the inherent problem that capitalism, as presently practiced, perpetuates inequality.Particularly appreciate later chapters 8, 9 as they confront challenges.Author's continuing mantra ""...we are in a perpetual struggle with the cruelty of the natural world."" and his desire ""...to transcend our limited biology and, someday, our time-limited planet."" was impossible to get pay as it colored so many of the author's conclusions and observations."
84,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,3,"Easy-going, broad and largely-nontechnical introduction to human genetic engineering. The first couple of chapters are a tad off-putting as Metzl overindulges in an overt catechism of what is ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, the porous boundaries between disease prevention and enhancement, and the fine lines between eugenics and improvements to well-being. But if you can ignore the polemic that is sprinkled throughout the book there is a fair amount of informative material that is worth knowing. Metzl covers embryo screening, iterative embryo selection, induced pluripotent stem cells, mitochondrial transfer, gene therapy, CRISPR soup (Cas9, Cas12b2, Cas13a…), germline modifications, and life extension research. While he is at it, Metzl also comments on various regulatory regimes (UK, Europe, US, China, Middle East) that accommodate or fail to accommodate various forms of biotechnology. The last couple of chapters switches back to ‘how should we think about this’ mode, but it actually makes for a pretty engaging coda. One of his larger points is that differences in first principles among various nations are irreducible, and while we must strive for a global regulatory framework the challenge of achieving consensus is immense. He suggests that our best hope are categorical negatives which specify blatant red-lines that no biotechnology development should cross. I must admit that a libertarian in me is not unsympathetic to this ‘negative international rights’ idea.His other larger point is that international competition and global interconnectedness are all too likely to blow any good intentions out of the water. For example a country that forbids genetic enhancement and bioengineering out of concern for ‘human dignity’ will be faced with a prospect of being out-competed internationally, won’t be able to prevent its citizens from traveling elsewhere for desired procedures, and will need to forbid genetically-enhanced high-skill immigration from abroad. And if it does, it will end up paying for ‘human dignity’ with a totalitarian regime."

Hacking Darwin gets deep into the potential of genetic engineering and what it could mean for the human race. Hint, things will be much different than they are today. From the book description: “At the dawn of the genetics revolution, our DNA is becoming as readable, writable, and hackable as our information technology. But as humanity starts retooling our own genetic code, the choices we make today will be the difference between realizing breathtaking advances in human well-being and descending into a dangerous and potentially deadly genetic arms race.” Decisions will be made tomorrow that seem impossible today. This book may unsettle some who have rigid beliefs. They may hope to never experience what this book lays out as our likely future. Things like picking your kids traits, upgrading your biology, capabilities, personality, intelligence, strength, curing illnesses/diseases and practically anything you can think of as a genetic trait. No matter how you feel about it, it’s inevitable that things laid out in this book will happen. The author stresses that it’s important to have more discussion about the global implications of humanity’s future when it comes to genetic engineering. He likened it to the 1970 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, where the entire global community recognized both the opportunities and dangers and created standards that major powers agreed on. He states that implications could be just as serious if we don’t get ahead of this emerging field and create global standards that leverage the benefits while limiting the downsides. This is an interesting book that will make you view the world differently. It’s important to understand what’s coming and people who read this will be ahead of most in that regard."

""Hacking Darwin"" discusses the power of genetic technology and its possible future societal and ethical implications. ⁣⁣The book covers numerous topics including gene editing tools such as CRISPR, the future of reproduction and human enhancement, preimplantation genetic screening and editing, mitochondrial replacement therapy, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in gene editing, ageing, etc. An overview of the science and technology of genetic engineering is provided in a very comprehensible way even to readers who do not have a scientific background. ⁣⁣The author elegantly weaves the scientific, social, and ethical perspectives in his analyses and offers balanced views on the positives and negatives based on research. He draws parallels between the future of human enhancement with past and current events, such as the Eugenics movement of the 20th century and the cultural diversity between nations in relation to genetically modified (GM) food and crops. There’s also a very insightful talk about the importance of diversity for human survival. ⁣⁣The author provides future predictions of genetic engineering and possible conversations between parents and doctors about embryo gene editing and enhancement for certain traits. At the moment, there are so many technical and scientific challenges and many undiscovered biological pathways that these future scenarios might seem far-fetched. We might not be there yet, but given the rate at which advancements are being made, this book would definitely make you think deep about these future dilemmas and the need for global regulations.⁣⁣My only one criticism is that discussions sometimes get lengthy and protracted particularly in the final chapters.

87,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38293445-stripe-fisk,4,"This is an interesting book that I think is best read as a way to look at where genetic technology is now, with a more skeptical eye towards where the author thinks it will arrive in the future. Though I agree with some of his predictions, others seem a little outlandish, or at least he is expecting them far too soon.The main thing that irked me about this book is the way that the author will occasionally mention a complication to one of his ideas, explain it, but go on describing his predictions as though that complication doesn’t really matter. For instance, he occasionally references how the human phenotype is affected by much more than just our straight genes due to epigenetic factors (and more!) but not much time is spent on this idea. There’s also a section where, after mentioning how intelligence is hard to define and there are some issues with IQ as a measurement, he marvels at the possibility of a human born with an IQ of 1000. (He also doesn’t acknowledge that there might be some limits to how far we can tweak our genome.) These moments make it a little hard to take some of his other predictions and claims seriously.Still, as I said, the book does a good job in outlining some of the current science on genetic engineering and outlines them in a straightforward but entertaining way. The chapters on aging and the future of fertility clinics were particularly engaging, though admittedly I found my eyes glazing over at his discussion of political movements in the last couple of chapter. That could just be my own bias, though.I’d definitely recommend this book for anybody interested in our progress toward genetic information, as long as they’re ready to take some predictions with a grain of salt."

Metzl has written an engaging, fascinating and thought-provoking book that focuses on the fast approaching and inevitable (and exiting) genetic revolution, with clear explanations of the tools involved and the consequences of their use. The writing is clear, explanations accurate and not too technical for the general interested reader.This book covers a vast array of topics that fall under the genetic engineering umbrella. He starts off with the history of genetic research, IVF, genetic screening; and continues with the relationship between genetics, diseases, traits, the environment; AI tools to process complex genetic patters; the pros and cons of the genetic engineering tools; ""designer babies""; stem-cell research; mitochondrial disease; multiple donar babies; gene-editing tools such as CRISPR; gene-therapy; safety issues and challenges to the current technology; chimeras; organ transplants; synthetic biology; aging; the ethics and responsibility of using genetic engineering tool; our relationship with nature; GMOs; the arms race of the human race; and finaly, the furture of humanity.Metzl states that his intent is to inform the public about the genetic revolution so that we can ""make the smartest collective decisions about our war forward... to understand what is happening and what's at stake."" Genetic entineering is a tool. The genetic revolution has the potential to improve lives or do great harm. The future of humanity depends on how we use it. "

Overall, it was an incredibly interesting, insightful, thought-provoking, and well-researched book. There was a lot of information and questions to absorb and think about. As a high school student who is interested in genetics/genetic engineering, Hacking Darwin detailed perspectives, history, and knowledge previously unknown to me and also provided me with countless sources for further reading. Throughout the book, Metzl connects the future ethical, political, and social ramifications of our choices to current issues and topics (like abortion) that made his argument more relatable and heightened the sense of urgency of the situation at hand.Jamie Metzl ultimately tries to create conversation and collaboration over a topic that we cannot afford to ignore. It informs without being overly technical, making it understandable and discussable for the general public. This book is a great thought-provoker for everyday readers and for anyone who wants to learn more about genetic engineering, especially the ethical dilemmas surrounding it. I would recommend it to anyone, especially high school and college students and teachers because it is so important for the future of our species, but also because it brings up important discussions in many subjects. Among these are biology, medicine, ethics, philosophy, politics, socioeconomics, and law. It’s a fantastic book full of citations and contemplation.(It’s also an excellent resource for research papers.)"

It explains how it works, talks about the philosophical aspect, asks how it’ll impact us as a species, how it’ll affect sex for the purpose of conception (RIP sex to make babies) and much many more questions and important philosophical dilemmas.. The books goal is to provoke thinking and stir the conversation into a field that - in my opinion - is not getting enough attention from the general public yet...I recommend you all to read because I truly believe this will be something that’ll affect us all very soon, so read and get prepped. 4.3 Stars"

Now many oppose application of PGT (pre-implantation genetic testing) i.e. screening of human embryo for gene disorder, however, this will soon be future since it will create human without critical genetic diseases like Huntington’s disease, Down syndrome etc. Author describes the future situation may be fantastic, however not free with danger. This 'genetic enhancement' , through gene splicing by CASPER-CAS9, of human may create a unbridgeable chasm between those who can afford genetic enhancement and those who can't. There may be cold war scenario in creating genetically enhance soldiers who can tolerate any extreme weather or returning of 'eugenic' movement which created Nazi era. Reader can get a flavor of how the entire biology is getting revolutionized in way of advance of synthetic biology (combining machine and life) and development of Senolytic drugs (for expanding life and reducing aging process).

100,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19258748-feng-ouyang,4,"The topic of this book is how we should deal with the future of manipulating human genes before or after birth to achieve various goals such as better health, more talent, and more desirable personality traits. The first part is an overview of the history and current status with a concise and accessible explanation of genetic science. It is not the best popular science book on the subject. However, it successfully sets the stage for the subsequent discussion. The author points out that currently, with IVF and in some other circumstances, people can screen the potential embryos based on their genes to avoid having children with severe inherited diseases. We are also advancing the science of connecting genes with health factors and personal traits, although we are still at the beginning of such exploration and can only understand the cases involving a small number of genes. At the same time, gene editing techniques have developed quickly, giving us powerful tools to delete and add genes in our DNA.The second part is a discussion on whether we should allow for further manipulation of genes beyond screening and even beyond health reasons. The author argues that such future manipulation is inevitable for three reasons. First, it is a natural continuation of what we do today. People have been manipulating the genes of animals and plants for tens of thousands of years through passive selection in domestication, active cross-breeding, and genetic engineering. We have also accepted the genetic screening of embryos. Therefore, genetic manipulation is not a domain of God. There is no quantum leap in ethics if we go forward with more deliberate and more invasive genetic manipulation of human genes.Second, it is challenging to maintain the “genetic purity” anyway. As long as we cannot stop all countries from human genetic modification, there will be genetically modified humans entering our gene pool and spreading across the world. Therefore, there is no point in resisting the trend.Third, genetic technologies are a power field of international competition, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Therefore, unilaterally banning genetic manipulation hurts a country.Based on these arguments, the author thinks the best way forward is having international cooperation in setting up regulation and monitoring and drawing a clear boundary on the practices. This part of the book is compelling. However, the arguments do not have much direct factorial support. The author relies on analogies and logical extensions to develop his thesis. For example, the book spent much space recounting Chinese history from Mao’s poor society to the second-largest economy in the world. It then describes China’s competitiveness and ambition in various technical areas. This information is relevant to show that we must address the possibility that China will become a leading genetic editing innovator, and that could impact our national interest. However, to convey such a point, the historical narrative can be significantly simplified and compressed. In fact, such a statement is almost self-evident with today’s media reporting.Lastly, the book offers a short discussion about the danger of human genetic modification. Ill-minded people can use it as a powerful weapon not only against their enemies but against humanity itself. The author thus calls again for international cooperation to ban certain practices, just as how we dealt with nuclear prefoliation. Overall, the book raised an interesting topic and provided much food for thought. However, the examination of the subject is incomplete. Two important considerations are missing in the book.First, we need to delve into the philosophy and ethical contemplations. For example, a tenant of Western ethics is that all men are created equal. Therefore, they have equal rights. Any social policy should not discriminate against people with certain inherited traits, because these traits are not under our control and are considered as random. However, if we can “engineer” superb member of the society, should they have a different set of rights? If we engineer people for a specific purpose such as sport, does that mean they are not intended to participate in other social activities such as governing? If others determine people’s traits before their birth, where does free will stand? These questions show that the introduction of human genetic engineering beyond narrow health concerns will have a profound impact on society and culture. It is not an incremental technology advance, as the author portraits.Second, human genetic engineering poses unique and grave danger comparing to other technologies. One reason is we still have a very poor understanding of genetic science. For example, we may know a gene is responsible for (or associated with) a particular disease or trait. But the same gene may play other roles in physiology that we don’t know about. The interactions of genes are even more complex. Therefore, the consequence of gene editing cannot be predicted with high accuracy and confidence. The other reason is that the result of gene editing is irreversible. All gene editing results will be in the human gene pool forever. One may argue that gene mutation has been operating since the beginning, and gene editing is the same. However, the later operates at a much, much higher speed, and we cannot subject all results to natural selection. Therefore, even if we can control the malicious use of gene editing techniques as the author advocates, gene editing can still threaten human wellbeing or even existence. This book broaches an essential topic that most of us managed to avoid so far. It also shows that our contemplation is just beginning. The book offers more questions than answers, which is probably the very intention of the author."
101,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9142626-deepak-rao,4,"A good book that could very well have been half the size and still served the purpose. Genetic engineering and bio-hacking are transformative technologies which could change the face of our civilization. Genetic engineering has the potential to make our descendants better(or different) than us, by a wide margin. The Homo Deus , envisioned by Yuval Harari, will be built on the foundations of genetic engineering. But this technology may cause large scale disruptions in society and lead to a large number of ethical and other problems. As we debate over the costs and benfits of this technology, one thing is certain that the decisions we take today to regulate and direct research in genetic engineering will significantly impact the trajectory of our future development."
102,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10496704-robert-kenny,2,"I could have written this book myself, and I have no formal background in genetic engineering. I suppose that’s why I was disappointed. I was hoping to learn more about the science. Instead, the author spends nearly all of his time describing the very obvious ways in which genetic engineering may change our society in the future: longer lives, fewer inherited diseases, increased use of in vitro fertilization, and babies genetically designed by their parents. None of these are new concepts, and all have been explored very thoroughly in science fiction and discussions about the ethics of genetic engineering. We’ve been talking about these things for decades. So why write a new book and simply rehash it all? What’s the point of reading non-fiction and not learning anything new?"
103,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31958906-dhyey-desai,2,"Some of the implications of genetic engineering are pretty scary and unregulated states like China run the risk of pushing the technology to the worst outcome. If the author's aim is to raise alarm and encourage efforts to regulate the technology, the author succeeds. The book lacks on the details of the technology and weighs heavier on thought experiments."

106,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103056314-herta-elina-jansone,4,"Read this book for my university's Biology book club. Our general consensus was that the first half of the book is rather boring for those who know biology at an undergraduate level, and some comparisons are just ""bullshit"", as said by a professor. The skin color gradient is not comparable by mutations in petal colors in lilies and petunias, no matter how drastic the color change is. Also, comparing gene editing to nuclear energy because of how it was ""stopped before it could do any harm"" - wrong, nuclear energy caused world-changing harm even before it was employed for energy generation. Additionally, nuclear energy requires large funding and the attention of governments. Meanwhile, genetic engineering can be done in rogue mode, as was stated in the book. And nobody, scientist or gardener, has a good enough understanding of the big picture of genome editing yet. Bioterrorism is unequivocally a major global risk, don't get me wrong. Maybe AI development would be a much better comparison to the progress in genetic research. This is an very anthropocentric book. It would have been better to state this early on rather than after rambling about making the essence of your own children ""readable, writeable, hackable"" for 4-5 chapters. Despite this annoying issue, some good points are made, especially near the end of the book when Metzl finally puts his political science knowledge into use when describing trend-setters and their influence on the future course of Biotechnology research and applications, which blends well into the general scene of global politics.While Europe and the USA are bickering about whether any research on genome manipulation is a sensible thing to do, Chinese companies are acquiring Biotech companies in the bickering regions and carry out research, create genetic databases of whole populations and move towards selecting the best individuals for certain purposes to try to be on top of the world in Bioengineering, intelligence and perhaps even sports (although, in some disciplines, African and some Scandinavians might have better genetics to start with, but it'll become irrelevant once they find something beyond the slow and faulty CRISPR-Cas machinery to apply in the future modifications of embryos).According to Metzl in this book, everything eventually boils down to genetics, just give scientists time to decipher the currently still unknown factors in aging, intelligence, emotional intelligence, extra-/introversion etc. Nurture isn't left out entirely but it's as important in this conversation as a footnote that states that the author is just aware that it exists, and that's it.Important questions are nonetheless raised:- Why should we try to engineer people with specific traits when such people already exist but may be considered worthless in whatever field they have been forced into?- Is it really better to create people that are predisposed towards better skills instead of improving the resources for teaching and supporting the society?- With people eventually stepping into the era of engineering their progeny as they see fit, what remains of the engineered person's individuality, opinion and ability to choose their own path in life? - What should be the standard of genetic engineering as a whole? Who should be responsible for setting the standard, and how should it be set?Discussion of the book gives a lot more food for thought than the book itself. Maybe that's what Metzl tries to achieve with this book - to turn us into ""critical catalysts of this dialogue"". Only through education and discussion can we come closer to achieving consensus about the ultimate purpose and application of this emerging technology."
107,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74862840-cary-giese,5,"What are the implications of moving from natural selection as the way humans evolve to human control of that evolution? That is the question asked by the author? Little debate (though some) will occur as science uses genetics to cure disease and prevents hereditary transfer of certain diseases to later generations! But, with mass collection of the human races’ genetics and AI’s ability to pattern that data, the capabilities to select desirable(?) traits to the human race will become possible. What policies will be possible to prevent some civilization to try to use that to capitalize on that capability to advantage themselves? Some policy such as the nuclear proliferation treaty will probably be required. The question is: will some sub-national group try to misuse the technology! Access to large data bases and AI will enable highly trained individual(s) to take steps on their own. How will that capability be policed is another question. The human race evolved, so far, by genetic mixing genes randomly. Genetic errors or good fortune created unfortunate diseases and human genius.As a race we have learned through conflict and resolution to progress, though progress has been uneven. The question is: will we be overcome by the incredible pace of coming change? Will progress continue?It will require wise leadership to take advantage of the wondrous possibilities, while avoiding horrendous risk!A must read for our leaders! The changes will be subtle and seen as generally beneficial by the general public. Nuclear Non-proliferation was easier because destruction by those bombs in Japan demonstrated the existential risk.So leaders are going to have to reach treaties and propose regulations and explain the reasons to the public!!! To do that they will have to become students of our impending rapidly changing future!The author recommends a global dialogue to include top scientist, religious leaders, trusted thinkers to conceive and propose the essential questions that require exploration.Metzl’s proposed questions as follows:1. What can be done to ensure the broadest possible access to the health and well-being benefits of genetic technologies?2. Should there be a limit on the application of genetic technologies to treat or eliminate disease? If so, what should they be? 3. Should people have full access to information about their own and their potential children’s genetic makeup or should this access be limited? If limited, what should the restrictions be and why? 4. Should parents be allowed unlimited freedom to select from among their natural embryos during in vitro fertilization? If not, on what basis should limitations be set? Should parents be allowed to select embryos on non-disease-related traits, like height, projected IQ, personality style, etc.?5. If it is proven safe, should precision gene editing be used to eliminate genetic diseases in adult sex cells and pre-implanted embryos in a manner that would be passed to future generations?6. Do we need a global framework to help prevent the worst abuses of human genetic engineering? 7. What long-term institutions do we need to foster an inclusive global dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering that optimizes the benefits of those technologies and minimizes potential harms? 8. What more can be done to help ensure the genetic revolution helps enhance all of our humanity, and how can each of us be better engaged in the process?I recommend reading this book so you are prepared to participate fully in you and your progeny’s future!"

Thankfully, that is precisely what this book is. While I don't really like that all of the books on this subject sound like over-enthusiastic episode titles for some sci-fi series, the message is important; if we are going to move forward as a country and species with the use of this new technology then the public has to be informed to a degree that is currently unimaginable. This book goes a long way toward bridging the gulf between the incredible advances being made right now at unthinkably exponential rates and the intellectual stagnation of the general populace's understanding over the past few decades. Unfortunately, this discussion and the possibility for national advancement are left to intrepid scientists making cases before governmental bodies consisting entirely of lawyers and businessmen who are themselves beholden to the big money of unlettered, reductionist, simpleton-fostering religious organizations who love to talk endlessly about the need for caution in, ""playing god,"" yet remain blissfully ignorant of the entirety of human biomedical science and think it appropriate to quote Bronze-Age idiocy as a rebuttal to the latest developments in the sciences. That, or the epithet of, ""eugenics,"" is just thrown in as Hitler is to every Twitter conversation about anything. Jamie Metzl is very thorough when it comes to the areas where we do have legitimate cause for concern, and others where a certain naturalistic fallacy continues to rot the minds of otherwise sensible people. He does this with an amusing vignette of a visit to a clinic that progressively gets further and further advanced, allowing him to make choices regarding his future offspring that were unimaginable even a few years before when conceiving his previous children. He also deftly handles the competitive atmosphere that will continue to develop among the leading nations harnessing this technology. His sports reference in this section is particularly apt as given just how much time, money, and science is invested in athletic performance for the bizarrely useless purpose of nationalistic chest-beating at the Olympics every two years, the notion of having a populace that, due to the government's grasp and regulatory ability over genetic modification, is biologically more advanced in terms of resistance to disease/aging and further developed for intellect and physical prowess is one that policy-makers need to understand now. The final chapter is full of genuine policy recommendations and recommendations to the scientific community to achieve the type of widespread education I mentioned earlier. Most of these suggestions make total sense, are genuinely unthinkable in a country as stupid as 2020 USA, and require an intellectual investment on the part of the individual that is hard to fathom. However, that so many books are being written for the layperson about this area of science and public policy gives hope that more well-read future leaders might be able to steer the conversation to more rational levels. One can dream..."
109,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"I love science and books about science. I grew up believing that science would lead the way forward to a more peaceful, prosperous, and humanitarian world. Much like flying cars, electricity too cheap to meter, and the cure for the common cold, this future has not materialized in my lifetime.Messing with genes, whether in plants or animals, has always been a part of science that scared me. Nature is incrediblely complex and interactive and it wouldn’t take much to mess up the balance. The Butterfly Effect speaks to the sensitive interdependence of life on Earth. I’m writing this during the Covid-19 outbreak which shows exactly how vulnerable the human race is to even the smallest of changes.My fear and concern about genetic engineering caused me to pick-up and put back Hacking Darwin: Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity by Jamie Metzl several times. I’m glad that I finally decided to read it.Metzl has written an extremely informative, scientific book that is easy to read. He definitely has a personal opinion about how genetic engineering should proceed. I’m sure that the Non-GMO Project, Greenpeace, and others would differ greatly but I think Metzl ties to present a little of “the other side” in his book.Reading Hacking Darwin has given me a lot of new and useful information. I am no less afraid of genetic engineering than I was before but I now feel that my fears have a factual foundation. That said, I definitely also see Metzl’s argument that genetic “tinkering” can have a positive side. Humans have been engaging in genetic engineering for tens of thousands of years. We have bred a lowly grass into maize, a staple food for millions of people. We have bred rice and wheat so that they can grow in a much wider environment and produce significantly more edible food. These agricultural advancements have kept millions of people from starvation.So how is corn domestication and cultivation in the field any different that reorganizing the corn gene in the lab to resist insects, droughts, and increased global temperatures? For me, the heart of the debate is that genetic “tinkering” of crops provides much faster and sweeping changes and, therefore, could produce devastating results before we even become aware of what we have done. With human embryos the debate centers on “tinkering” with the human germline which would result in inheritable changes that could continue forward for generations possibly producing horrific consequences.Human genetic engineering is the ultimate Ying-Yang of contemporary science. On one had we could solve the horrible suffering of millions of people by preventing Sickle Cell Anemia, Tay–Sachs, and Diabetes. We might even be able to rid the human genome of cancer and heart disease. On the other hand we could reduce the diversity of the human race and create a eugenics movement that would make what the nazis did seem like a walk in the park.I highly recommend this book. It may scare you. It may make your head hurt trying to figure out what is the ethically correct road forward. It definitely will inform you that genetic engineering by one or more countries or companies is inevitable. This is definitely a case that forewarned is forearmed."""
110,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59225695-rodney-jehu,4,"“The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born” - indeed. I wore a frown the entire time I read this often deeply unnerving clarion call of a book - not because I did not thoroughly enjoy Jamie Metzl’s book, but rather because my feelings of transhumanistic enthusiasm and (warranted?) neophobia were necessarily in conflict. On one hand, I am inclined to believe that the survival of our progeny (note: I did not say “species”) will continue to be predicated upon our ability to fashion increasingly more effective weapons for our fight against entropy. On the other hand, if Metzl is to be believed, we are at the precipice of an explosion of Cambrian proportions, which will be ignited by our fast approaching competence in genome editing. I wholeheadedly agree with Metzl about the importance of raising public awareness of the issues at hand (everyone should read this book!), not least because I think it is an inexpensive kindness to shout to your neighbors, “brace yourselves!” when not just their minds are about to be blown. I docked a star because of Metzl’s frequent albeit forgivable use of scenarios. While entertaining and doubtless makes such a serious subject more palatable, the discussion of “concrete” scenarios will likely seduce many readers into overestimating the predictability of the future as well as the competence of the prognosticator. At present, we are nowhere near able to enumerate a large enough set of potential outcomes from the genetics revolution, sufficient to inform policies or controls that will help us avoid potholes ahead. This, precisely, is the problem with which we must grapple - and it is a wicked problem. Our present ability to predict the myriad effects of genome editing at the level of the individual is woefully inadequate, to say nothing of our ability to predict broad societal, national or global outcomes. As exceedingly difficult as it is to predict behavior, behavior supervenes on phenotype, and phenotype supervenes on (epi)genotype, and genes, darn them, exhibit pleiotropy. Alas, as Metzl notes, we will likely push forward blindly and with characteristic hubris. Disquietude is visited upon anyone that grasps the full import of the tectonic shifts we will all too soon experience. Reader beware. I am going to be thinking about what I learned in “Hacking Darwin” for a long time, and I am truly grateful to Metzl for writing this book and to the authors of the many bleeding-edge scientific studies cited. I also thank my lucky stars for genes that, at least, make me less susceptible to early-onset glabellar lines."

It covers everything from ancient history, today’s practices, upcoming practices, to possible moral, political, and scientific issues in the coming years. Gene editing is looked at from individual, scientific, governmental, international, and religious viewpoints throughout. War, athletics, space pioneering, individual data protection, and AI are some lenses looked through for speculations on a global scale. The author’s science fiction writing experience shines in a few example scenarios in the book of going to future clinics. One is being put in his character’s shoes and having to face a moral scenario like embryo selection: seeing all of your different potential children on a projected wall, as hundreds of probability statistics, and all of the ethical conflicts that come with it, is very effective at envisioning a similar future reality. While IVF, CRISPR/Cas9, embryo selection, aging, and longevity are thoroughly discussed topics, the author doesn’t lose sight of the importance of keeping our humanity, privacy, and diversity.So much is explored and presented for healthy, proactive discussion. - What if a country has voted on gene editing regulation, but neighboring countries are creating genetically advanced soldiers?- Will empathy and creativity, initially forgotten in the gene editing and AI craze, become increasingly valuable qualities?- Will different races, sexual preferences, and disorders cease to exist?- Will we become more susceptible to natural viruses and germs with a more genetically uniform species?- If you select a male embryo with a genetic proclivity for fast twitch muscles, but he develops an aversion to sports, did you ruin his chances in life? - Will a gap form between enhanced and un-enhanced individuals?""If people have gone ballistic over the environmental, GMO, and abortion debates—if they have manned the barricades and destroyed research centers over genetically modified crops, or attacked abortion clinics and murdered doctors—imagine what they might do when the same diversity of individual, cultural, societal, and governmental views inspires different national approaches to the emerging science of genetically modified people."""
112,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51063190-caden-howlett,5,"In c. 65 AD, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca stated that “…[we] and the things we live amongst are destined to perish.” In rereading Joseph Goldstein’s “Experience of Insight” (1976), I came across this concept eloquently rephrased as a reminder that “…inherent in all things that arise is decay.” Although these are not original ideas of the two men, I thought they served well as representatives of a concern we have had since the beginning of our self-consciousness: mortality.The concept of impermanence is pervasive through all human history, reaching back as far as the earliest surviving work of human literature (the Epic of Gilgamesh). Philosophers, historians, and scientists have always written about death, decay, and mortality as if they were unavoidable universal truths, hence the examples above. Our views on mortality remained constant over thousands of years due to essentially no scientific method and its consequential advances. Only recently has this changed. The unprecedented explosion of technology and scientific ability has profoundly transformed our understanding of life and death and, consequently, we are beginning to question if mortality is indeed a “fundamental truth” of existence. “Hacking Darwin” by Jamie Petzl addresses the current state of genetic engineering. His book makes it crystal clear that biology is no longer what it once was and will continue to change dramatically over the coming decades. Our technology and understanding of human biology are conjoining, and it is possible that within the next 30-50 years we will have the ability to safely alter our genome and greatly prolong our lives. Perhaps more importantly than prolonging our lives, we will be able to selectively choose which genes are present in our children, ultimately allowing us to produce offspring that far exceed us in intelligence, strength, and creativity. Are there limits to this? We will find out. Maybe our period of genetic engineering will only play a minor role between where we are now and the eventual uploading of our consciousness to “the cloud”.I can’t help but wonder what Seneca would think."
113,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16446997-reading,3,"Initially I struggled with this book as the author favoured the techno-utopian perspective, thankfully later chapters brought more balanced alternatives and concerns. Still I do not agree with his conclusions regarding some aspects of genetic engineering and man's apparent omnipresent battle with nature.In presenting humans pursuit of knowledge regarding cancer and domesticing crop's the author seems naive at best and disingenuous at worst when he writes ""...we balanced the costs and benefits and moved forward with imperfect information and a desire to learn and do more."" It's like watching Claude Rains react with feigned shock at witnessing gambling in Rick's, only to moments later surreptitiously receive his winnings. Not including PROFIT as a (if not THE) central motivating factor and therefore criticism, is a critical error in the thinking of all too many techno true believers.The author deserves credit for navigating and studying such a controversial subject that is so fraught with potential for destructive consequences if not applied judiciously. I appreciated observations such as ""Why breed people for superior IQ when we could significantly enhance our society's collective intellectual and problem solving capability by providing real opportunity and better schools to the least advantaged among us?"", and ""Diversity is our species' greatest asset should we chose to embrace it. Reducing our diversity, even with the best of intentions, could become our Achilles' heel."" Of 182Then there are doozies like, ""If we had demanded equal access to smartphones for everyone from the get go, the smartphone industry would never have grown quickly enough to drive down prices to where these phones became accessable to poor people around the world"" huh?! Contradictory and incorrect plus once again it doesn't deal with the inherent problem that capitalism, as presently practiced, perpetuates inequality.Particularly appreciate later chapters 8, 9 as they confront challenges.Author's continuing mantra ""...we are in a perpetual struggle with the cruelty of the natural world."" and his desire ""...to transcend our limited biology and, someday, our time-limited planet."" was impossible to get pay as it colored so many of the author's conclusions and observations."
114,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,3,"Easy-going, broad and largely-nontechnical introduction to human genetic engineering. The first couple of chapters are a tad off-putting as Metzl overindulges in an overt catechism of what is ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, the porous boundaries between disease prevention and enhancement, and the fine lines between eugenics and improvements to well-being. But if you can ignore the polemic that is sprinkled throughout the book there is a fair amount of informative material that is worth knowing. Metzl covers embryo screening, iterative embryo selection, induced pluripotent stem cells, mitochondrial transfer, gene therapy, CRISPR soup (Cas9, Cas12b2, Cas13a…), germline modifications, and life extension research. While he is at it, Metzl also comments on various regulatory regimes (UK, Europe, US, China, Middle East) that accommodate or fail to accommodate various forms of biotechnology. The last couple of chapters switches back to ‘how should we think about this’ mode, but it actually makes for a pretty engaging coda. One of his larger points is that differences in first principles among various nations are irreducible, and while we must strive for a global regulatory framework the challenge of achieving consensus is immense. He suggests that our best hope are categorical negatives which specify blatant red-lines that no biotechnology development should cross. I must admit that a libertarian in me is not unsympathetic to this ‘negative international rights’ idea.His other larger point is that international competition and global interconnectedness are all too likely to blow any good intentions out of the water. For example a country that forbids genetic enhancement and bioengineering out of concern for ‘human dignity’ will be faced with a prospect of being out-competed internationally, won’t be able to prevent its citizens from traveling elsewhere for desired procedures, and will need to forbid genetically-enhanced high-skill immigration from abroad. And if it does, it will end up paying for ‘human dignity’ with a totalitarian regime."

Hacking Darwin gets deep into the potential of genetic engineering and what it could mean for the human race. Hint, things will be much different than they are today. From the book description: “At the dawn of the genetics revolution, our DNA is becoming as readable, writable, and hackable as our information technology. But as humanity starts retooling our own genetic code, the choices we make today will be the difference between realizing breathtaking advances in human well-being and descending into a dangerous and potentially deadly genetic arms race.” Decisions will be made tomorrow that seem impossible today. This book may unsettle some who have rigid beliefs. They may hope to never experience what this book lays out as our likely future. Things like picking your kids traits, upgrading your biology, capabilities, personality, intelligence, strength, curing illnesses/diseases and practically anything you can think of as a genetic trait. No matter how you feel about it, it’s inevitable that things laid out in this book will happen. The author stresses that it’s important to have more discussion about the global implications of humanity’s future when it comes to genetic engineering. He likened it to the 1970 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, where the entire global community recognized both the opportunities and dangers and created standards that major powers agreed on. He states that implications could be just as serious if we don’t get ahead of this emerging field and create global standards that leverage the benefits while limiting the downsides. This is an interesting book that will make you view the world differently. It’s important to understand what’s coming and people who read this will be ahead of most in that regard."

""Hacking Darwin"" discusses the power of genetic technology and its possible future societal and ethical implications. ⁣⁣The book covers numerous topics including gene editing tools such as CRISPR, the future of reproduction and human enhancement, preimplantation genetic screening and editing, mitochondrial replacement therapy, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in gene editing, ageing, etc. An overview of the science and technology of genetic engineering is provided in a very comprehensible way even to readers who do not have a scientific background. ⁣⁣The author elegantly weaves the scientific, social, and ethical perspectives in his analyses and offers balanced views on the positives and negatives based on research. He draws parallels between the future of human enhancement with past and current events, such as the Eugenics movement of the 20th century and the cultural diversity between nations in relation to genetically modified (GM) food and crops. There’s also a very insightful talk about the importance of diversity for human survival. ⁣⁣The author provides future predictions of genetic engineering and possible conversations between parents and doctors about embryo gene editing and enhancement for certain traits. At the moment, there are so many technical and scientific challenges and many undiscovered biological pathways that these future scenarios might seem far-fetched. We might not be there yet, but given the rate at which advancements are being made, this book would definitely make you think deep about these future dilemmas and the need for global regulations.⁣⁣My only one criticism is that discussions sometimes get lengthy and protracted particularly in the final chapters. Nevertheless, I’d definitely recommend this thought-provoking and insightful read.⁣"
117,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38293445-stripe-fisk,4,"This is an interesting book that I think is best read as a way to look at where genetic technology is now, with a more skeptical eye towards where the author thinks it will arrive in the future. Though I agree with some of his predictions, others seem a little outlandish, or at least he is expecting them far too soon.The main thing that irked me about this book is the way that the author will occasionally mention a complication to one of his ideas, explain it, but go on describing his predictions as though that complication doesn’t really matter. For instance, he occasionally references how the human phenotype is affected by much more than just our straight genes due to epigenetic factors (and more!) but not much time is spent on this idea. There’s also a section where, after mentioning how intelligence is hard to define and there are some issues with IQ as a measurement, he marvels at the possibility of a human born with an IQ of 1000. (He also doesn’t acknowledge that there might be some limits to how far we can tweak our genome.) These moments make it a little hard to take some of his other predictions and claims seriously.Still, as I said, the book does a good job in outlining some of the current science on genetic engineering and outlines them in a straightforward but entertaining way. The chapters on aging and the future of fertility clinics were particularly engaging, though admittedly I found my eyes glazing over at his discussion of political movements in the last couple of chapter. That could just be my own bias, though.I’d definitely recommend this book for anybody interested in our progress toward genetic information, as long as they’re ready to take some predictions with a grain of salt."

Metzl has written an engaging, fascinating and thought-provoking book that focuses on the fast approaching and inevitable (and exiting) genetic revolution, with clear explanations of the tools involved and the consequences of their use. The writing is clear, explanations accurate and not too technical for the general interested reader.This book covers a vast array of topics that fall under the genetic engineering umbrella. He starts off with the history of genetic research, IVF, genetic screening; and continues with the relationship between genetics, diseases, traits, the environment; AI tools to process complex genetic patters; the pros and cons of the genetic engineering tools; ""designer babies""; stem-cell research; mitochondrial disease; multiple donar babies; gene-editing tools such as CRISPR; gene-therapy; safety issues and challenges to the current technology; chimeras; organ transplants; synthetic biology; aging; the ethics and responsibility of using genetic engineering tool; our relationship with nature; GMOs; the arms race of the human race; and finaly, the furture of humanity.Metzl states that his intent is to inform the public about the genetic revolution so that we can ""make the smartest collective decisions about our war forward... to understand what is happening and what's at stake."" Genetic entineering is a tool. The genetic revolution has the potential to improve lives or do great harm. The future of humanity depends on how we use it. "

Overall, it was an incredibly interesting, insightful, thought-provoking, and well-researched book. There was a lot of information and questions to absorb and think about. As a high school student who is interested in genetics/genetic engineering, Hacking Darwin detailed perspectives, history, and knowledge previously unknown to me and also provided me with countless sources for further reading. Throughout the book, Metzl connects the future ethical, political, and social ramifications of our choices to current issues and topics (like abortion) that made his argument more relatable and heightened the sense of urgency of the situation at hand.Jamie Metzl ultimately tries to create conversation and collaboration over a topic that we cannot afford to ignore. It informs without being overly technical, making it understandable and discussable for the general public. This book is a great thought-provoker for everyday readers and for anyone who wants to learn more about genetic engineering, especially the ethical dilemmas surrounding it. I would recommend it to anyone, especially high school and college students and teachers because it is so important for the future of our species, but also because it brings up important discussions in many subjects. Among these are biology, medicine, ethics, philosophy, politics, socioeconomics, and law. It’s a fantastic book full of citations and contemplation.(It’s also an excellent resource for research papers.)"

This 'genetic enhancement' , through gene splicing by CASPER-CAS9, of human may create a unbridgeable chasm between those who can afford genetic enhancement and those who can't.

130,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19258748-feng-ouyang,4,"The topic of this book is how we should deal with the future of manipulating human genes before or after birth to achieve various goals such as better health, more talent, and more desirable personality traits. The first part is an overview of the history and current status with a concise and accessible explanation of genetic science. It is not the best popular science book on the subject. However, it successfully sets the stage for the subsequent discussion. The author points out that currently, with IVF and in some other circumstances, people can screen the potential embryos based on their genes to avoid having children with severe inherited diseases. We are also advancing the science of connecting genes with health factors and personal traits, although we are still at the beginning of such exploration and can only understand the cases involving a small number of genes. At the same time, gene editing techniques have developed quickly, giving us powerful tools to delete and add genes in our DNA.The second part is a discussion on whether we should allow for further manipulation of genes beyond screening and even beyond health reasons. The author argues that such future manipulation is inevitable for three reasons. First, it is a natural continuation of what we do today. People have been manipulating the genes of animals and plants for tens of thousands of years through passive selection in domestication, active cross-breeding, and genetic engineering. We have also accepted the genetic screening of embryos. Therefore, genetic manipulation is not a domain of God. There is no quantum leap in ethics if we go forward with more deliberate and more invasive genetic manipulation of human genes.Second, it is challenging to maintain the “genetic purity” anyway. As long as we cannot stop all countries from human genetic modification, there will be genetically modified humans entering our gene pool and spreading across the world. Therefore, there is no point in resisting the trend.Third, genetic technologies are a power field of international competition, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Therefore, unilaterally banning genetic manipulation hurts a country.Based on these arguments, the author thinks the best way forward is having international cooperation in setting up regulation and monitoring and drawing a clear boundary on the practices. This part of the book is compelling. However, the arguments do not have much direct factorial support. The author relies on analogies and logical extensions to develop his thesis. For example, the book spent much space recounting Chinese history from Mao’s poor society to the second-largest economy in the world. It then describes China’s competitiveness and ambition in various technical areas. This information is relevant to show that we must address the possibility that China will become a leading genetic editing innovator, and that could impact our national interest. However, to convey such a point, the historical narrative can be significantly simplified and compressed. In fact, such a statement is almost self-evident with today’s media reporting.Lastly, the book offers a short discussion about the danger of human genetic modification. Ill-minded people can use it as a powerful weapon not only against their enemies but against humanity itself. The author thus calls again for international cooperation to ban certain practices, just as how we dealt with nuclear prefoliation. Overall, the book raised an interesting topic and provided much food for thought. However, the examination of the subject is incomplete. Two important considerations are missing in the book.First, we need to delve into the philosophy and ethical contemplations. For example, a tenant of Western ethics is that all men are created equal. Therefore, they have equal rights. Any social policy should not discriminate against people with certain inherited traits, because these traits are not under our control and are considered as random. However, if we can “engineer” superb member of the society, should they have a different set of rights? If we engineer people for a specific purpose such as sport, does that mean they are not intended to participate in other social activities such as governing? If others determine people’s traits before their birth, where does free will stand? These questions show that the introduction of human genetic engineering beyond narrow health concerns will have a profound impact on society and culture. It is not an incremental technology advance, as the author portraits.Second, human genetic engineering poses unique and grave danger comparing to other technologies. One reason is we still have a very poor understanding of genetic science. For example, we may know a gene is responsible for (or associated with) a particular disease or trait. But the same gene may play other roles in physiology that we don’t know about. The interactions of genes are even more complex. Therefore, the consequence of gene editing cannot be predicted with high accuracy and confidence. The other reason is that the result of gene editing is irreversible. All gene editing results will be in the human gene pool forever. One may argue that gene mutation has been operating since the beginning, and gene editing is the same. However, the later operates at a much, much higher speed, and we cannot subject all results to natural selection. Therefore, even if we can control the malicious use of gene editing techniques as the author advocates, gene editing can still threaten human wellbeing or even existence. This book broaches an essential topic that most of us managed to avoid so far. It also shows that our contemplation is just beginning. The book offers more questions than answers, which is probably the very intention of the author."
131,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9142626-deepak-rao,4,"A good book that could very well have been half the size and still served the purpose. Genetic engineering and bio-hacking are transformative technologies which could change the face of our civilization. Genetic engineering has the potential to make our descendants better(or different) than us, by a wide margin. The Homo Deus , envisioned by Yuval Harari, will be built on the foundations of genetic engineering. But this technology may cause large scale disruptions in society and lead to a large number of ethical and other problems. As we debate over the costs and benfits of this technology, one thing is certain that the decisions we take today to regulate and direct research in genetic engineering will significantly impact the trajectory of our future development."

I suppose that’s why I was disappointed. I was hoping to learn more about the science. Instead, the author spends nearly all of his time describing the very obvious ways in which genetic engineering may change our society in the future: longer lives, fewer inherited diseases, increased use of in vitro fertilization, and babies genetically designed by their parents. None of these are new concepts, and all have been explored very thoroughly in science fiction and discussions about the ethics of genetic engineering. We’ve been talking about these things for decades. So why write a new book and simply rehash it all? What’s the point of reading non-fiction and not learning anything new?"

136,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103056314-herta-elina-jansone,4,"Read this book for my university's Biology book club. Our general consensus was that the first half of the book is rather boring for those who know biology at an undergraduate level, and some comparisons are just ""bullshit"", as said by a professor. The skin color gradient is not comparable by mutations in petal colors in lilies and petunias, no matter how drastic the color change is. Also, comparing gene editing to nuclear energy because of how it was ""stopped before it could do any harm"" - wrong, nuclear energy caused world-changing harm even before it was employed for energy generation. Additionally, nuclear energy requires large funding and the attention of governments. Meanwhile, genetic engineering can be done in rogue mode, as was stated in the book. And nobody, scientist or gardener, has a good enough understanding of the big picture of genome editing yet. Bioterrorism is unequivocally a major global risk, don't get me wrong. Maybe AI development would be a much better comparison to the progress in genetic research. This is an very anthropocentric book. It would have been better to state this early on rather than after rambling about making the essence of your own children ""readable, writeable, hackable"" for 4-5 chapters. Despite this annoying issue, some good points are made, especially near the end of the book when Metzl finally puts his political science knowledge into use when describing trend-setters and their influence on the future course of Biotechnology research and applications, which blends well into the general scene of global politics.While Europe and the USA are bickering about whether any research on genome manipulation is a sensible thing to do, Chinese companies are acquiring Biotech companies in the bickering regions and carry out research, create genetic databases of whole populations and move towards selecting the best individuals for certain purposes to try to be on top of the world in Bioengineering, intelligence and perhaps even sports (although, in some disciplines, African and some Scandinavians might have better genetics to start with, but it'll become irrelevant once they find something beyond the slow and faulty CRISPR-Cas machinery to apply in the future modifications of embryos).According to Metzl in this book, everything eventually boils down to genetics, just give scientists time to decipher the currently still unknown factors in aging, intelligence, emotional intelligence, extra-/introversion etc. Nurture isn't left out entirely but it's as important in this conversation as a footnote that states that the author is just aware that it exists, and that's it.Important questions are nonetheless raised:- Why should we try to engineer people with specific traits when such people already exist but may be considered worthless in whatever field they have been forced into?- Is it really better to create people that are predisposed towards better skills instead of improving the resources for teaching and supporting the society?- With people eventually stepping into the era of engineering their progeny as they see fit, what remains of the engineered person's individuality, opinion and ability to choose their own path in life? - What should be the standard of genetic engineering as a whole? Who should be responsible for setting the standard, and how should it be set?Discussion of the book gives a lot more food for thought than the book itself. Maybe that's what Metzl tries to achieve with this book - to turn us into ""critical catalysts of this dialogue"". Only through education and discussion can we come closer to achieving consensus about the ultimate purpose and application of this emerging technology."

That is the question asked by the author? Little debate (though some) will occur as science uses genetics to cure disease and prevents hereditary transfer of certain diseases to later generations! But, with mass collection of the human races’ genetics and AI’s ability to pattern that data, the capabilities to select desirable(?) traits to the human race will become possible. What policies will be possible to prevent some civilization to try to use that to capitalize on that capability to advantage themselves? Some policy such as the nuclear proliferation treaty will probably be required. The question is: will some sub-national group try to misuse the technology! Access to large data bases and AI will enable highly trained individual(s) to take steps on their own. How will that capability be policed is another question. The human race evolved, so far, by genetic mixing genes randomly. Genetic errors or good fortune created unfortunate diseases and human genius.As a race we have learned through conflict and resolution to progress, though progress has been uneven. The question is: will we be overcome by the incredible pace of coming change? Will progress continue?It will require wise leadership to take advantage of the wondrous possibilities, while avoiding horrendous risk!A must read for our leaders! The changes will be subtle and seen as generally beneficial by the general public. Nuclear Non-proliferation was easier because destruction by those bombs in Japan demonstrated the existential risk.So leaders are going to have to reach treaties and propose regulations and explain the reasons to the public!!! To do that they will have to become students of our impending rapidly changing future!The author recommends a global dialogue to include top scientist, religious leaders, trusted thinkers to conceive and propose the essential questions that require exploration.Metzl’s proposed questions as follows:1. What can be done to ensure the broadest possible access to the health and well-being benefits of genetic technologies?2. Should there be a limit on the application of genetic technologies to treat or eliminate disease? If so, what should they be? 3. Should people have full access to information about their own and their potential children’s genetic makeup or should this access be limited? If limited, what should the restrictions be and why? 4. Should parents be allowed unlimited freedom to select from among their natural embryos during in vitro fertilization? If not, on what basis should limitations be set? Should parents be allowed to select embryos on non-disease-related traits, like height, projected IQ, personality style, etc.?5. If it is proven safe, should precision gene editing be used to eliminate genetic diseases in adult sex cells and pre-implanted embryos in a manner that would be passed to future generations?6. Do we need a global framework to help prevent the worst abuses of human genetic engineering? 7. What long-term institutions do we need to foster an inclusive global dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering that optimizes the benefits of those technologies and minimizes potential harms? 8. What more can be done to help ensure the genetic revolution helps enhance all of our humanity, and how can each of us be better engaged in the process?I recommend reading this book so you are prepared to participate fully in you and your progeny’s future!"
138,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"Having just read Jennifer Doudna's wonderful book, ""A Crack in Creation,"" which detailed the development of CRISPR-cas9, I went to this volume by Jamie Metzl for a broader look at the potential ramifications of the use of this technology and more of a focus on policy. Thankfully, that is precisely what this book is. While I don't really like that all of the books on this subject sound like over-enthusiastic episode titles for some sci-fi series, the message is important; if we are going to move forward as a country and species with the use of this new technology then the public has to be informed to a degree that is currently unimaginable. This book goes a long way toward bridging the gulf between the incredible advances being made right now at unthinkably exponential rates and the intellectual stagnation of the general populace's understanding over the past few decades. Unfortunately, this discussion and the possibility for national advancement are left to intrepid scientists making cases before governmental bodies consisting entirely of lawyers and businessmen who are themselves beholden to the big money of unlettered, reductionist, simpleton-fostering religious organizations who love to talk endlessly about the need for caution in, ""playing god,"" yet remain blissfully ignorant of the entirety of human biomedical science and think it appropriate to quote Bronze-Age idiocy as a rebuttal to the latest developments in the sciences. That, or the epithet of, ""eugenics,"" is just thrown in as Hitler is to every Twitter conversation about anything. Jamie Metzl is very thorough when it comes to the areas where we do have legitimate cause for concern, and others where a certain naturalistic fallacy continues to rot the minds of otherwise sensible people. He does this with an amusing vignette of a visit to a clinic that progressively gets further and further advanced, allowing him to make choices regarding his future offspring that were unimaginable even a few years before when conceiving his previous children. He also deftly handles the competitive atmosphere that will continue to develop among the leading nations harnessing this technology. His sports reference in this section is particularly apt as given just how much time, money, and science is invested in athletic performance for the bizarrely useless purpose of nationalistic chest-beating at the Olympics every two years, the notion of having a populace that, due to the government's grasp and regulatory ability over genetic modification, is biologically more advanced in terms of resistance to disease/aging and further developed for intellect and physical prowess is one that policy-makers need to understand now. The final chapter is full of genuine policy recommendations and recommendations to the scientific community to achieve the type of widespread education I mentioned earlier. Most of these suggestions make total sense, are genuinely unthinkable in a country as stupid as 2020 USA, and require an intellectual investment on the part of the individual that is hard to fathom. However, that so many books are being written for the layperson about this area of science and public policy gives hope that more well-read future leaders might be able to steer the conversation to more rational levels. One can dream..."

I grew up believing that science would lead the way forward to a more peaceful, prosperous, and humanitarian world. Much like flying cars, electricity too cheap to meter, and the cure for the common cold, this future has not materialized in my lifetime.Messing with genes, whether in plants or animals, has always been a part of science that scared me. Nature is incrediblely complex and interactive and it wouldn’t take much to mess up the balance. The Butterfly Effect speaks to the sensitive interdependence of life on Earth. I’m writing this during the Covid-19 outbreak which shows exactly how vulnerable the human race is to even the smallest of changes.My fear and concern about genetic engineering caused me to pick-up and put back Hacking Darwin: Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity by Jamie Metzl several times. I’m glad that I finally decided to read it.Metzl has written an extremely informative, scientific book that is easy to read. He definitely has a personal opinion about how genetic engineering should proceed. I’m sure that the Non-GMO Project, Greenpeace, and others would differ greatly but I think Metzl ties to present a little of “the other side” in his book.Reading Hacking Darwin has given me a lot of new and useful information. I am no less afraid of genetic engineering than I was before but I now feel that my fears have a factual foundation. That said, I definitely also see Metzl’s argument that genetic “tinkering” can have a positive side. Humans have been engaging in genetic engineering for tens of thousands of years. We have bred a lowly grass into maize, a staple food for millions of people. We have bred rice and wheat so that they can grow in a much wider environment and produce significantly more edible food. These agricultural advancements have kept millions of people from starvation.So how is corn domestication and cultivation in the field any different that reorganizing the corn gene in the lab to resist insects, droughts, and increased global temperatures? For me, the heart of the debate is that genetic “tinkering” of crops provides much faster and sweeping changes and, therefore, could produce devastating results before we even become aware of what we have done. With human embryos the debate centers on “tinkering” with the human germline which would result in inheritable changes that could continue forward for generations possibly producing horrific consequences.Human genetic engineering is the ultimate Ying-Yang of contemporary science. On one had we could solve the horrible suffering of millions of people by preventing Sickle Cell Anemia, Tay–Sachs, and Diabetes. We might even be able to rid the human genome of cancer and heart disease. On the other hand we could reduce the diversity of the human race and create a eugenics movement that would make what the nazis did seem like a walk in the park.I highly recommend this book. It may scare you. It may make your head hurt trying to figure out what is the ethically correct road forward. It definitely will inform you that genetic engineering by one or more countries or companies is inevitable. This is definitely a case that forewarned is forearmed."""
140,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59225695-rodney-jehu,4,"“The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born” - indeed. I wore a frown the entire time I read this often deeply unnerving clarion call of a book - not because I did not thoroughly enjoy Jamie Metzl’s book, but rather because my feelings of transhumanistic enthusiasm and (warranted?) neophobia were necessarily in conflict. On one hand, I am inclined to believe that the survival of our progeny (note: I did not say “species”) will continue to be predicated upon our ability to fashion increasingly more effective weapons for our fight against entropy. On the other hand, if Metzl is to be believed, we are at the precipice of an explosion of Cambrian proportions, which will be ignited by our fast approaching competence in genome editing. I wholeheadedly agree with Metzl about the importance of raising public awareness of the issues at hand (everyone should read this book!), not least because I think it is an inexpensive kindness to shout to your neighbors, “brace yourselves!” when not just their minds are about to be blown. I docked a star because of Metzl’s frequent albeit forgivable use of scenarios. While entertaining and doubtless makes such a serious subject more palatable, the discussion of “concrete” scenarios will likely seduce many readers into overestimating the predictability of the future as well as the competence of the prognosticator. At present, we are nowhere near able to enumerate a large enough set of potential outcomes from the genetics revolution, sufficient to inform policies or controls that will help us avoid potholes ahead. This, precisely, is the problem with which we must grapple - and it is a wicked problem. Our present ability to predict the myriad effects of genome editing at the level of the individual is woefully inadequate, to say nothing of our ability to predict broad societal, national or global outcomes. As exceedingly difficult as it is to predict behavior, behavior supervenes on phenotype, and phenotype supervenes on (epi)genotype, and genes, darn them, exhibit pleiotropy. Alas, as Metzl notes, we will likely push forward blindly and with characteristic hubris. Disquietude is visited upon anyone that grasps the full import of the tectonic shifts we will all too soon experience. Reader beware. I am going to be thinking about what I learned in “Hacking Darwin” for a long time, and I am truly grateful to Metzl for writing this book and to the authors of the many bleeding-edge scientific studies cited. I also thank my lucky stars for genes that, at least, make me less susceptible to early-onset glabellar lines."
141,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,5,"An all-encompassing look at the future of gene editing. It covers everything from ancient history, today’s practices, upcoming practices, to possible moral, political, and scientific issues in the coming years. Gene editing is looked at from individual, scientific, governmental, international, and religious viewpoints throughout. War, athletics, space pioneering, individual data protection, and AI are some lenses looked through for speculations on a global scale. The author’s science fiction writing experience shines in a few example scenarios in the book of going to future clinics. One is being put in his character’s shoes and having to face a moral scenario like embryo selection: seeing all of your different potential children on a projected wall, as hundreds of probability statistics, and all of the ethical conflicts that come with it, is very effective at envisioning a similar future reality. While IVF, CRISPR/Cas9, embryo selection, aging, and longevity are thoroughly discussed topics, the author doesn’t lose sight of the importance of keeping our humanity, privacy, and diversity.So much is explored and presented for healthy, proactive discussion. - What if a country has voted on gene editing regulation, but neighboring countries are creating genetically advanced soldiers?- Will empathy and creativity, initially forgotten in the gene editing and AI craze, become increasingly valuable qualities?- Will different races, sexual preferences, and disorders cease to exist?- Will we become more susceptible to natural viruses and germs with a more genetically uniform species?- If you select a male embryo with a genetic proclivity for fast twitch muscles, but he develops an aversion to sports, did you ruin his chances in life? - Will a gap form between enhanced and un-enhanced individuals?""If people have gone ballistic over the environmental, GMO, and abortion debates—if they have manned the barricades and destroyed research centers over genetically modified crops, or attacked abortion clinics and murdered doctors—imagine what they might do when the same diversity of individual, cultural, societal, and governmental views inspires different national approaches to the emerging science of genetically modified people."""
142,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51063190-caden-howlett,5,"In c. 65 AD, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca stated that “…[we] and the things we live amongst are destined to perish.” In rereading Joseph Goldstein’s “Experience of Insight” (1976), I came across this concept eloquently rephrased as a reminder that “…inherent in all things that arise is decay.” Although these are not original ideas of the two men, I thought they served well as representatives of a concern we have had since the beginning of our self-consciousness: mortality.The concept of impermanence is pervasive through all human history, reaching back as far as the earliest surviving work of human literature (the Epic of Gilgamesh). Philosophers, historians, and scientists have always written about death, decay, and mortality as if they were unavoidable universal truths, hence the examples above. Our views on mortality remained constant over thousands of years due to essentially no scientific method and its consequential advances. Only recently has this changed. The unprecedented explosion of technology and scientific ability has profoundly transformed our understanding of life and death and, consequently, we are beginning to question if mortality is indeed a “fundamental truth” of existence. “Hacking Darwin” by Jamie Petzl addresses the current state of genetic engineering. His book makes it crystal clear that biology is no longer what it once was and will continue to change dramatically over the coming decades. Our technology and understanding of human biology are conjoining, and it is possible that within the next 30-50 years we will have the ability to safely alter our genome and greatly prolong our lives. Perhaps more importantly than prolonging our lives, we will be able to selectively choose which genes are present in our children, ultimately allowing us to produce offspring that far exceed us in intelligence, strength, and creativity. Are there limits to this? We will find out. Maybe our period of genetic engineering will only play a minor role between where we are now and the eventual uploading of our consciousness to “the cloud”.I can’t help but wonder what Seneca would think."
143,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16446997-reading,3,"Initially I struggled with this book as the author favoured the techno-utopian perspective, thankfully later chapters brought more balanced alternatives and concerns. Still I do not agree with his conclusions regarding some aspects of genetic engineering and man's apparent omnipresent battle with nature.In presenting humans pursuit of knowledge regarding cancer and domesticing crop's the author seems naive at best and disingenuous at worst when he writes ""...we balanced the costs and benefits and moved forward with imperfect information and a desire to learn and do more."" It's like watching Claude Rains react with feigned shock at witnessing gambling in Rick's, only to moments later surreptitiously receive his winnings. Not including PROFIT as a (if not THE) central motivating factor and therefore criticism, is a critical error in the thinking of all too many techno true believers.The author deserves credit for navigating and studying such a controversial subject that is so fraught with potential for destructive consequences if not applied judiciously. I appreciated observations such as ""Why breed people for superior IQ when we could significantly enhance our society's collective intellectual and problem solving capability by providing real opportunity and better schools to the least advantaged among us?"", and ""Diversity is our species' greatest asset should we chose to embrace it. Reducing our diversity, even with the best of intentions, could become our Achilles' heel."" Of 182Then there are doozies like, ""If we had demanded equal access to smartphones for everyone from the get go, the smartphone industry would never have grown quickly enough to drive down prices to where these phones became accessable to poor people around the world"" huh?! Contradictory and incorrect plus once again it doesn't deal with the inherent problem that capitalism, as presently practiced, perpetuates inequality.Particularly appreciate later chapters 8, 9 as they confront challenges.Author's continuing mantra ""...we are in a perpetual struggle with the cruelty of the natural world."" and his desire ""...to transcend our limited biology and, someday, our time-limited planet."" was impossible to get pay as it colored so many of the author's conclusions and observations."
144,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,3,"Easy-going, broad and largely-nontechnical introduction to human genetic engineering. The first couple of chapters are a tad off-putting as Metzl overindulges in an overt catechism of what is ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, the porous boundaries between disease prevention and enhancement, and the fine lines between eugenics and improvements to well-being. But if you can ignore the polemic that is sprinkled throughout the book there is a fair amount of informative material that is worth knowing. Metzl covers embryo screening, iterative embryo selection, induced pluripotent stem cells, mitochondrial transfer, gene therapy, CRISPR soup (Cas9, Cas12b2, Cas13a…), germline modifications, and life extension research. While he is at it, Metzl also comments on various regulatory regimes (UK, Europe, US, China, Middle East) that accommodate or fail to accommodate various forms of biotechnology. The last couple of chapters switches back to ‘how should we think about this’ mode, but it actually makes for a pretty engaging coda. One of his larger points is that differences in first principles among various nations are irreducible, and while we must strive for a global regulatory framework the challenge of achieving consensus is immense. He suggests that our best hope are categorical negatives which specify blatant red-lines that no biotechnology development should cross. I must admit that a libertarian in me is not unsympathetic to this ‘negative international rights’ idea.His other larger point is that international competition and global interconnectedness are all too likely to blow any good intentions out of the water. For example a country that forbids genetic enhancement and bioengineering out of concern for ‘human dignity’ will be faced with a prospect of being out-competed internationally, won’t be able to prevent its citizens from traveling elsewhere for desired procedures, and will need to forbid genetically-enhanced high-skill immigration from abroad. And if it does, it will end up paying for ‘human dignity’ with a totalitarian regime."

Hacking Darwin gets deep into the potential of genetic engineering and what it could mean for the human race. Hint, things will be much different than they are today. From the book description: “At the dawn of the genetics revolution, our DNA is becoming as readable, writable, and hackable as our information technology. But as humanity starts retooling our own genetic code, the choices we make today will be the difference between realizing breathtaking advances in human well-being and descending into a dangerous and potentially deadly genetic arms race.” Decisions will be made tomorrow that seem impossible today. This book may unsettle some who have rigid beliefs. They may hope to never experience what this book lays out as our likely future. Things like picking your kids traits, upgrading your biology, capabilities, personality, intelligence, strength, curing illnesses/diseases and practically anything you can think of as a genetic trait. No matter how you feel about it, it’s inevitable that things laid out in this book will happen. The author stresses that it’s important to have more discussion about the global implications of humanity’s future when it comes to genetic engineering. He likened it to the 1970 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, where the entire global community recognized both the opportunities and dangers and created standards that major powers agreed on. He states that implications could be just as serious if we don’t get ahead of this emerging field and create global standards that leverage the benefits while limiting the downsides. This is an interesting book that will make you view the world differently. It’s important to understand what’s coming and people who read this will be ahead of most in that regard."

""Hacking Darwin"" discusses the power of genetic technology and its possible future societal and ethical implications. ⁣⁣The book covers numerous topics including gene editing tools such as CRISPR, the future of reproduction and human enhancement, preimplantation genetic screening and editing, mitochondrial replacement therapy, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in gene editing, ageing, etc. An overview of the science and technology of genetic engineering is provided in a very comprehensible way even to readers who do not have a scientific background. ⁣⁣The author elegantly weaves the scientific, social, and ethical perspectives in his analyses and offers balanced views on the positives and negatives based on research. He draws parallels between the future of human enhancement with past and current events, such as the Eugenics movement of the 20th century and the cultural diversity between nations in relation to genetically modified (GM) food and crops. There’s also a very insightful talk about the importance of diversity for human survival. ⁣⁣The author provides future predictions of genetic engineering and possible conversations between parents and doctors about embryo gene editing and enhancement for certain traits. At the moment, there are so many technical and scientific challenges and many undiscovered biological pathways that these future scenarios might seem far-fetched. We might not be there yet, but given the rate at which advancements are being made, this book would definitely make you think deep about these future dilemmas and the need for global regulations.⁣⁣My only one criticism is that discussions sometimes get lengthy and protracted particularly in the final chapters. Nevertheless, I’d definitely recommend this thought-provoking and insightful read.⁣"
147,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38293445-stripe-fisk,4,"This is an interesting book that I think is best read as a way to look at where genetic technology is now, with a more skeptical eye towards where the author thinks it will arrive in the future. Though I agree with some of his predictions, others seem a little outlandish, or at least he is expecting them far too soon.The main thing that irked me about this book is the way that the author will occasionally mention a complication to one of his ideas, explain it, but go on describing his predictions as though that complication doesn’t really matter. For instance, he occasionally references how the human phenotype is affected by much more than just our straight genes due to epigenetic factors (and more!) but not much time is spent on this idea. There’s also a section where, after mentioning how intelligence is hard to define and there are some issues with IQ as a measurement, he marvels at the possibility of a human born with an IQ of 1000. (He also doesn’t acknowledge that there might be some limits to how far we can tweak our genome.) These moments make it a little hard to take some of his other predictions and claims seriously.Still, as I said, the book does a good job in outlining some of the current science on genetic engineering and outlines them in a straightforward but entertaining way. The chapters on aging and the future of fertility clinics were particularly engaging, though admittedly I found my eyes glazing over at his discussion of political movements in the last couple of chapter. That could just be my own bias, though.I’d definitely recommend this book for anybody interested in our progress toward genetic information, as long as they’re ready to take some predictions with a grain of salt."

Metzl has written an engaging, fascinating and thought-provoking book that focuses on the fast approaching and inevitable (and exiting) genetic revolution, with clear explanations of the tools involved and the consequences of their use. The writing is clear, explanations accurate and not too technical for the general interested reader.This book covers a vast array of topics that fall under the genetic engineering umbrella. He starts off with the history of genetic research, IVF, genetic screening; and continues with the relationship between genetics, diseases, traits, the environment; AI tools to process complex genetic patters; the pros and cons of the genetic engineering tools; ""designer babies""; stem-cell research; mitochondrial disease; multiple donar babies; gene-editing tools such as CRISPR; gene-therapy; safety issues and challenges to the current technology; chimeras; organ transplants; synthetic biology; aging; the ethics and responsibility of using genetic engineering tool; our relationship with nature; GMOs; the arms race of the human race; and finaly, the furture of humanity.Metzl states that his intent is to inform the public about the genetic revolution so that we can ""make the smartest collective decisions about our war forward... to understand what is happening and what's at stake."" Genetic entineering is a tool. The genetic revolution has the potential to improve lives or do great harm. The future of humanity depends on how we use it. "

Overall, it was an incredibly interesting, insightful, thought-provoking, and well-researched book. There was a lot of information and questions to absorb and think about. As a high school student who is interested in genetics/genetic engineering, Hacking Darwin detailed perspectives, history, and knowledge previously unknown to me and also provided me with countless sources for further reading. Throughout the book, Metzl connects the future ethical, political, and social ramifications of our choices to current issues and topics (like abortion) that made his argument more relatable and heightened the sense of urgency of the situation at hand.Jamie Metzl ultimately tries to create conversation and collaboration over a topic that we cannot afford to ignore. It informs without being overly technical, making it understandable and discussable for the general public. This book is a great thought-provoker for everyday readers and for anyone who wants to learn more about genetic engineering, especially the ethical dilemmas surrounding it. I would recommend it to anyone, especially high school and college students and teachers because it is so important for the future of our species, but also because it brings up important discussions in many subjects. Among these are biology, medicine, ethics, philosophy, politics, socioeconomics, and law. It’s a fantastic book full of citations and contemplation.(It’s also an excellent resource for research papers.)"

160,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19258748-feng-ouyang,4,"The topic of this book is how we should deal with the future of manipulating human genes before or after birth to achieve various goals such as better health, more talent, and more desirable personality traits. The first part is an overview of the history and current status with a concise and accessible explanation of genetic science. It is not the best popular science book on the subject. However, it successfully sets the stage for the subsequent discussion. The author points out that currently, with IVF and in some other circumstances, people can screen the potential embryos based on their genes to avoid having children with severe inherited diseases. We are also advancing the science of connecting genes with health factors and personal traits, although we are still at the beginning of such exploration and can only understand the cases involving a small number of genes. At the same time, gene editing techniques have developed quickly, giving us powerful tools to delete and add genes in our DNA.The second part is a discussion on whether we should allow for further manipulation of genes beyond screening and even beyond health reasons. The author argues that such future manipulation is inevitable for three reasons. First, it is a natural continuation of what we do today. People have been manipulating the genes of animals and plants for tens of thousands of years through passive selection in domestication, active cross-breeding, and genetic engineering. We have also accepted the genetic screening of embryos. Therefore, genetic manipulation is not a domain of God. There is no quantum leap in ethics if we go forward with more deliberate and more invasive genetic manipulation of human genes.Second, it is challenging to maintain the “genetic purity” anyway. As long as we cannot stop all countries from human genetic modification, there will be genetically modified humans entering our gene pool and spreading across the world. Therefore, there is no point in resisting the trend.Third, genetic technologies are a power field of international competition, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Therefore, unilaterally banning genetic manipulation hurts a country.Based on these arguments, the author thinks the best way forward is having international cooperation in setting up regulation and monitoring and drawing a clear boundary on the practices. This part of the book is compelling. However, the arguments do not have much direct factorial support. The author relies on analogies and logical extensions to develop his thesis. For example, the book spent much space recounting Chinese history from Mao’s poor society to the second-largest economy in the world. It then describes China’s competitiveness and ambition in various technical areas. This information is relevant to show that we must address the possibility that China will become a leading genetic editing innovator, and that could impact our national interest. However, to convey such a point, the historical narrative can be significantly simplified and compressed. In fact, such a statement is almost self-evident with today’s media reporting.Lastly, the book offers a short discussion about the danger of human genetic modification. Ill-minded people can use it as a powerful weapon not only against their enemies but against humanity itself. The author thus calls again for international cooperation to ban certain practices, just as how we dealt with nuclear prefoliation. Overall, the book raised an interesting topic and provided much food for thought. However, the examination of the subject is incomplete. Two important considerations are missing in the book.First, we need to delve into the philosophy and ethical contemplations. For example, a tenant of Western ethics is that all men are created equal. Therefore, they have equal rights. Any social policy should not discriminate against people with certain inherited traits, because these traits are not under our control and are considered as random. However, if we can “engineer” superb member of the society, should they have a different set of rights? If we engineer people for a specific purpose such as sport, does that mean they are not intended to participate in other social activities such as governing? If others determine people’s traits before their birth, where does free will stand? These questions show that the introduction of human genetic engineering beyond narrow health concerns will have a profound impact on society and culture. It is not an incremental technology advance, as the author portraits.Second, human genetic engineering poses unique and grave danger comparing to other technologies. One reason is we still have a very poor understanding of genetic science. For example, we may know a gene is responsible for (or associated with) a particular disease or trait. But the same gene may play other roles in physiology that we don’t know about. The interactions of genes are even more complex. Therefore, the consequence of gene editing cannot be predicted with high accuracy and confidence. The other reason is that the result of gene editing is irreversible. All gene editing results will be in the human gene pool forever. One may argue that gene mutation has been operating since the beginning, and gene editing is the same. However, the later operates at a much, much higher speed, and we cannot subject all results to natural selection. Therefore, even if we can control the malicious use of gene editing techniques as the author advocates, gene editing can still threaten human wellbeing or even existence. This book broaches an essential topic that most of us managed to avoid so far. It also shows that our contemplation is just beginning. The book offers more questions than answers, which is probably the very intention of the author."

Genetic engineering and bio-hacking are transformative technologies which could change the face of our civilization. Genetic engineering has the potential to make our descendants better(or different) than us, by a wide margin. The Homo Deus , envisioned by Yuval Harari, will be built on the foundations of genetic engineering. But this technology may cause large scale disruptions in society and lead to a large number of ethical and other problems. As we debate over the costs and benfits of this technology, one thing is certain that the decisions we take today to regulate and direct research in genetic engineering will significantly impact the trajectory of our future development."
162,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10496704-robert-kenny,2,"I could have written this book myself, and I have no formal background in genetic engineering. I suppose that’s why I was disappointed. I was hoping to learn more about the science. Instead, the author spends nearly all of his time describing the very obvious ways in which genetic engineering may change our society in the future: longer lives, fewer inherited diseases, increased use of in vitro fertilization, and babies genetically designed by their parents. None of these are new concepts, and all have been explored very thoroughly in science fiction and discussions about the ethics of genetic engineering. We’ve been talking about these things for decades. So why write a new book and simply rehash it all? What’s the point of reading non-fiction and not learning anything new?"
163,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31958906-dhyey-desai,2,"Some of the implications of genetic engineering are pretty scary and unregulated states like China run the risk of pushing the technology to the worst outcome. If the author's aim is to raise alarm and encourage efforts to regulate the technology, the author succeeds. The book lacks on the details of the technology and weighs heavier on thought experiments."
164,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3827299-foggygirl,4,A very interesting read about the possible hurdles and problems that will arise with the future use of human genetic engineering. And they will definitely arise because we humans won't be able to stop ourselves. 
165,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6888651-jenn-adams,2,Reading as many Goodreads Choice Nominees as I can.Not excited to give a harsh rating for a book that I'm sure would be great for many people. But I personally didn't get a lot from it. It felt very surface level and I don't feel like I learned anything.
166,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103056314-herta-elina-jansone,4,"Read this book for my university's Biology book club. Our general consensus was that the first half of the book is rather boring for those who know biology at an undergraduate level, and some comparisons are just ""bullshit"", as said by a professor. The skin color gradient is not comparable by mutations in petal colors in lilies and petunias, no matter how drastic the color change is. Also, comparing gene editing to nuclear energy because of how it was ""stopped before it could do any harm"" - wrong, nuclear energy caused world-changing harm even before it was employed for energy generation. Additionally, nuclear energy requires large funding and the attention of governments. Meanwhile, genetic engineering can be done in rogue mode, as was stated in the book. And nobody, scientist or gardener, has a good enough understanding of the big picture of genome editing yet. Bioterrorism is unequivocally a major global risk, don't get me wrong. Maybe AI development would be a much better comparison to the progress in genetic research. This is an very anthropocentric book. It would have been better to state this early on rather than after rambling about making the essence of your own children ""readable, writeable, hackable"" for 4-5 chapters. Despite this annoying issue, some good points are made, especially near the end of the book when Metzl finally puts his political science knowledge into use when describing trend-setters and their influence on the future course of Biotechnology research and applications, which blends well into the general scene of global politics.While Europe and the USA are bickering about whether any research on genome manipulation is a sensible thing to do, Chinese companies are acquiring Biotech companies in the bickering regions and carry out research, create genetic databases of whole populations and move towards selecting the best individuals for certain purposes to try to be on top of the world in Bioengineering, intelligence and perhaps even sports (although, in some disciplines, African and some Scandinavians might have better genetics to start with, but it'll become irrelevant once they find something beyond the slow and faulty CRISPR-Cas machinery to apply in the future modifications of embryos).According to Metzl in this book, everything eventually boils down to genetics, just give scientists time to decipher the currently still unknown factors in aging, intelligence, emotional intelligence, extra-/introversion etc. Nurture isn't left out entirely but it's as important in this conversation as a footnote that states that the author is just aware that it exists, and that's it.Important questions are nonetheless raised:- Why should we try to engineer people with specific traits when such people already exist but may be considered worthless in whatever field they have been forced into?- Is it really better to create people that are predisposed towards better skills instead of improving the resources for teaching and supporting the society?- With people eventually stepping into the era of engineering their progeny as they see fit, what remains of the engineered person's individuality, opinion and ability to choose their own path in life? - What should be the standard of genetic engineering as a whole? Who should be responsible for setting the standard, and how should it be set?Discussion of the book gives a lot more food for thought than the book itself. Maybe that's what Metzl tries to achieve with this book - to turn us into ""critical catalysts of this dialogue"". Only through education and discussion can we come closer to achieving consensus about the ultimate purpose and application of this emerging technology."
167,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74862840-cary-giese,5,"What are the implications of moving from natural selection as the way humans evolve to human control of that evolution? That is the question asked by the author? Little debate (though some) will occur as science uses genetics to cure disease and prevents hereditary transfer of certain diseases to later generations! But, with mass collection of the human races’ genetics and AI’s ability to pattern that data, the capabilities to select desirable(?) traits to the human race will become possible. What policies will be possible to prevent some civilization to try to use that to capitalize on that capability to advantage themselves? Some policy such as the nuclear proliferation treaty will probably be required. The question is: will some sub-national group try to misuse the technology! Access to large data bases and AI will enable highly trained individual(s) to take steps on their own. How will that capability be policed is another question. The human race evolved, so far, by genetic mixing genes randomly. Genetic errors or good fortune created unfortunate diseases and human genius.As a race we have learned through conflict and resolution to progress, though progress has been uneven. The question is: will we be overcome by the incredible pace of coming change? Will progress continue?It will require wise leadership to take advantage of the wondrous possibilities, while avoiding horrendous risk!A must read for our leaders! The changes will be subtle and seen as generally beneficial by the general public. Nuclear Non-proliferation was easier because destruction by those bombs in Japan demonstrated the existential risk.So leaders are going to have to reach treaties and propose regulations and explain the reasons to the public!!! To do that they will have to become students of our impending rapidly changing future!The author recommends a global dialogue to include top scientist, religious leaders, trusted thinkers to conceive and propose the essential questions that require exploration.Metzl’s proposed questions as follows:1. What can be done to ensure the broadest possible access to the health and well-being benefits of genetic technologies?2. Should there be a limit on the application of genetic technologies to treat or eliminate disease? If so, what should they be? 3. Should people have full access to information about their own and their potential children’s genetic makeup or should this access be limited? If limited, what should the restrictions be and why? 4. Should parents be allowed unlimited freedom to select from among their natural embryos during in vitro fertilization? If not, on what basis should limitations be set? Should parents be allowed to select embryos on non-disease-related traits, like height, projected IQ, personality style, etc.?5. If it is proven safe, should precision gene editing be used to eliminate genetic diseases in adult sex cells and pre-implanted embryos in a manner that would be passed to future generations?6. Do we need a global framework to help prevent the worst abuses of human genetic engineering? 7. What long-term institutions do we need to foster an inclusive global dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering that optimizes the benefits of those technologies and minimizes potential harms? 8. What more can be done to help ensure the genetic revolution helps enhance all of our humanity, and how can each of us be better engaged in the process?I recommend reading this book so you are prepared to participate fully in you and your progeny’s future!"

Thankfully, that is precisely what this book is. While I don't really like that all of the books on this subject sound like over-enthusiastic episode titles for some sci-fi series, the message is important; if we are going to move forward as a country and species with the use of this new technology then the public has to be informed to a degree that is currently unimaginable. This book goes a long way toward bridging the gulf between the incredible advances being made right now at unthinkably exponential rates and the intellectual stagnation of the general populace's understanding over the past few decades. Unfortunately, this discussion and the possibility for national advancement are left to intrepid scientists making cases before governmental bodies consisting entirely of lawyers and businessmen who are themselves beholden to the big money of unlettered, reductionist, simpleton-fostering religious organizations who love to talk endlessly about the need for caution in, ""playing god,"" yet remain blissfully ignorant of the entirety of human biomedical science and think it appropriate to quote Bronze-Age idiocy as a rebuttal to the latest developments in the sciences. That, or the epithet of, ""eugenics,"" is just thrown in as Hitler is to every Twitter conversation about anything. Jamie Metzl is very thorough when it comes to the areas where we do have legitimate cause for concern, and others where a certain naturalistic fallacy continues to rot the minds of otherwise sensible people. He does this with an amusing vignette of a visit to a clinic that progressively gets further and further advanced, allowing him to make choices regarding his future offspring that were unimaginable even a few years before when conceiving his previous children. He also deftly handles the competitive atmosphere that will continue to develop among the leading nations harnessing this technology. His sports reference in this section is particularly apt as given just how much time, money, and science is invested in athletic performance for the bizarrely useless purpose of nationalistic chest-beating at the Olympics every two years, the notion of having a populace that, due to the government's grasp and regulatory ability over genetic modification, is biologically more advanced in terms of resistance to disease/aging and further developed for intellect and physical prowess is one that policy-makers need to understand now. The final chapter is full of genuine policy recommendations and recommendations to the scientific community to achieve the type of widespread education I mentioned earlier. Most of these suggestions make total sense, are genuinely unthinkable in a country as stupid as 2020 USA, and require an intellectual investment on the part of the individual that is hard to fathom. However, that so many books are being written for the layperson about this area of science and public policy gives hope that more well-read future leaders might be able to steer the conversation to more rational levels. One can dream..."
169,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"I love science and books about science. I grew up believing that science would lead the way forward to a more peaceful, prosperous, and humanitarian world. Much like flying cars, electricity too cheap to meter, and the cure for the common cold, this future has not materialized in my lifetime.Messing with genes, whether in plants or animals, has always been a part of science that scared me. Nature is incrediblely complex and interactive and it wouldn’t take much to mess up the balance. The Butterfly Effect speaks to the sensitive interdependence of life on Earth. I’m writing this during the Covid-19 outbreak which shows exactly how vulnerable the human race is to even the smallest of changes.My fear and concern about genetic engineering caused me to pick-up and put back Hacking Darwin: Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity by Jamie Metzl several times. I’m glad that I finally decided to read it.Metzl has written an extremely informative, scientific book that is easy to read. He definitely has a personal opinion about how genetic engineering should proceed. I’m sure that the Non-GMO Project, Greenpeace, and others would differ greatly but I think Metzl ties to present a little of “the other side” in his book.Reading Hacking Darwin has given me a lot of new and useful information. I am no less afraid of genetic engineering than I was before but I now feel that my fears have a factual foundation. That said, I definitely also see Metzl’s argument that genetic “tinkering” can have a positive side. Humans have been engaging in genetic engineering for tens of thousands of years. We have bred a lowly grass into maize, a staple food for millions of people. We have bred rice and wheat so that they can grow in a much wider environment and produce significantly more edible food. These agricultural advancements have kept millions of people from starvation.So how is corn domestication and cultivation in the field any different that reorganizing the corn gene in the lab to resist insects, droughts, and increased global temperatures? For me, the heart of the debate is that genetic “tinkering” of crops provides much faster and sweeping changes and, therefore, could produce devastating results before we even become aware of what we have done. With human embryos the debate centers on “tinkering” with the human germline which would result in inheritable changes that could continue forward for generations possibly producing horrific consequences.Human genetic engineering is the ultimate Ying-Yang of contemporary science. On one had we could solve the horrible suffering of millions of people by preventing Sickle Cell Anemia, Tay–Sachs, and Diabetes. We might even be able to rid the human genome of cancer and heart disease. On the other hand we could reduce the diversity of the human race and create a eugenics movement that would make what the nazis did seem like a walk in the park.I highly recommend this book. It may scare you. It may make your head hurt trying to figure out what is the ethically correct road forward. It definitely will inform you that genetic engineering by one or more countries or companies is inevitable. This is definitely a case that forewarned is forearmed."""
170,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59225695-rodney-jehu,4,"“The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born” - indeed. I wore a frown the entire time I read this often deeply unnerving clarion call of a book - not because I did not thoroughly enjoy Jamie Metzl’s book, but rather because my feelings of transhumanistic enthusiasm and (warranted?) neophobia were necessarily in conflict. On one hand, I am inclined to believe that the survival of our progeny (note: I did not say “species”) will continue to be predicated upon our ability to fashion increasingly more effective weapons for our fight against entropy. On the other hand, if Metzl is to be believed, we are at the precipice of an explosion of Cambrian proportions, which will be ignited by our fast approaching competence in genome editing. I wholeheadedly agree with Metzl about the importance of raising public awareness of the issues at hand (everyone should read this book!), not least because I think it is an inexpensive kindness to shout to your neighbors, “brace yourselves!” when not just their minds are about to be blown. I docked a star because of Metzl’s frequent albeit forgivable use of scenarios. While entertaining and doubtless makes such a serious subject more palatable, the discussion of “concrete” scenarios will likely seduce many readers into overestimating the predictability of the future as well as the competence of the prognosticator. At present, we are nowhere near able to enumerate a large enough set of potential outcomes from the genetics revolution, sufficient to inform policies or controls that will help us avoid potholes ahead. This, precisely, is the problem with which we must grapple - and it is a wicked problem. Our present ability to predict the myriad effects of genome editing at the level of the individual is woefully inadequate, to say nothing of our ability to predict broad societal, national or global outcomes. As exceedingly difficult as it is to predict behavior, behavior supervenes on phenotype, and phenotype supervenes on (epi)genotype, and genes, darn them, exhibit pleiotropy. Alas, as Metzl notes, we will likely push forward blindly and with characteristic hubris. Disquietude is visited upon anyone that grasps the full import of the tectonic shifts we will all too soon experience. Reader beware. I am going to be thinking about what I learned in “Hacking Darwin” for a long time, and I am truly grateful to Metzl for writing this book and to the authors of the many bleeding-edge scientific studies cited. I also thank my lucky stars for genes that, at least, make me less susceptible to early-onset glabellar lines."
171,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,5,"An all-encompassing look at the future of gene editing. It covers everything from ancient history, today’s practices, upcoming practices, to possible moral, political, and scientific issues in the coming years. Gene editing is looked at from individual, scientific, governmental, international, and religious viewpoints throughout. War, athletics, space pioneering, individual data protection, and AI are some lenses looked through for speculations on a global scale. The author’s science fiction writing experience shines in a few example scenarios in the book of going to future clinics. One is being put in his character’s shoes and having to face a moral scenario like embryo selection: seeing all of your different potential children on a projected wall, as hundreds of probability statistics, and all of the ethical conflicts that come with it, is very effective at envisioning a similar future reality. While IVF, CRISPR/Cas9, embryo selection, aging, and longevity are thoroughly discussed topics, the author doesn’t lose sight of the importance of keeping our humanity, privacy, and diversity.So much is explored and presented for healthy, proactive discussion. - What if a country has voted on gene editing regulation, but neighboring countries are creating genetically advanced soldiers?- Will empathy and creativity, initially forgotten in the gene editing and AI craze, become increasingly valuable qualities?- Will different races, sexual preferences, and disorders cease to exist?- Will we become more susceptible to natural viruses and germs with a more genetically uniform species?- If you select a male embryo with a genetic proclivity for fast twitch muscles, but he develops an aversion to sports, did you ruin his chances in life? - Will a gap form between enhanced and un-enhanced individuals?""If people have gone ballistic over the environmental, GMO, and abortion debates—if they have manned the barricades and destroyed research centers over genetically modified crops, or attacked abortion clinics and murdered doctors—imagine what they might do when the same diversity of individual, cultural, societal, and governmental views inspires different national approaches to the emerging science of genetically modified people."""
172,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51063190-caden-howlett,5,"In c. 65 AD, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca stated that “…[we] and the things we live amongst are destined to perish.” In rereading Joseph Goldstein’s “Experience of Insight” (1976), I came across this concept eloquently rephrased as a reminder that “…inherent in all things that arise is decay.” Although these are not original ideas of the two men, I thought they served well as representatives of a concern we have had since the beginning of our self-consciousness: mortality.The concept of impermanence is pervasive through all human history, reaching back as far as the earliest surviving work of human literature (the Epic of Gilgamesh). Philosophers, historians, and scientists have always written about death, decay, and mortality as if they were unavoidable universal truths, hence the examples above. Our views on mortality remained constant over thousands of years due to essentially no scientific method and its consequential advances. Only recently has this changed. The unprecedented explosion of technology and scientific ability has profoundly transformed our understanding of life and death and, consequently, we are beginning to question if mortality is indeed a “fundamental truth” of existence. “Hacking Darwin” by Jamie Petzl addresses the current state of genetic engineering. His book makes it crystal clear that biology is no longer what it once was and will continue to change dramatically over the coming decades. Our technology and understanding of human biology are conjoining, and it is possible that within the next 30-50 years we will have the ability to safely alter our genome and greatly prolong our lives. Perhaps more importantly than prolonging our lives, we will be able to selectively choose which genes are present in our children, ultimately allowing us to produce offspring that far exceed us in intelligence, strength, and creativity. Are there limits to this? We will find out. Maybe our period of genetic engineering will only play a minor role between where we are now and the eventual uploading of our consciousness to “the cloud”.I can’t help but wonder what Seneca would think."
173,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16446997-reading,3,"Initially I struggled with this book as the author favoured the techno-utopian perspective, thankfully later chapters brought more balanced alternatives and concerns. Still I do not agree with his conclusions regarding some aspects of genetic engineering and man's apparent omnipresent battle with nature.In presenting humans pursuit of knowledge regarding cancer and domesticing crop's the author seems naive at best and disingenuous at worst when he writes ""...we balanced the costs and benefits and moved forward with imperfect information and a desire to learn and do more."" It's like watching Claude Rains react with feigned shock at witnessing gambling in Rick's, only to moments later surreptitiously receive his winnings. Not including PROFIT as a (if not THE) central motivating factor and therefore criticism, is a critical error in the thinking of all too many techno true believers.The author deserves credit for navigating and studying such a controversial subject that is so fraught with potential for destructive consequences if not applied judiciously. I appreciated observations such as ""Why breed people for superior IQ when we could significantly enhance our society's collective intellectual and problem solving capability by providing real opportunity and better schools to the least advantaged among us?"", and ""Diversity is our species' greatest asset should we chose to embrace it. Reducing our diversity, even with the best of intentions, could become our Achilles' heel."" Of 182Then there are doozies like, ""If we had demanded equal access to smartphones for everyone from the get go, the smartphone industry would never have grown quickly enough to drive down prices to where these phones became accessable to poor people around the world"" huh?! Contradictory and incorrect plus once again it doesn't deal with the inherent problem that capitalism, as presently practiced, perpetuates inequality.Particularly appreciate later chapters 8, 9 as they confront challenges.Author's continuing mantra ""...we are in a perpetual struggle with the cruelty of the natural world."" and his desire ""...to transcend our limited biology and, someday, our time-limited planet."" was impossible to get pay as it colored so many of the author's conclusions and observations."
174,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,3,"Easy-going, broad and largely-nontechnical introduction to human genetic engineering. The first couple of chapters are a tad off-putting as Metzl overindulges in an overt catechism of what is ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, the porous boundaries between disease prevention and enhancement, and the fine lines between eugenics and improvements to well-being. But if you can ignore the polemic that is sprinkled throughout the book there is a fair amount of informative material that is worth knowing. Metzl covers embryo screening, iterative embryo selection, induced pluripotent stem cells, mitochondrial transfer, gene therapy, CRISPR soup (Cas9, Cas12b2, Cas13a…), germline modifications, and life extension research. While he is at it, Metzl also comments on various regulatory regimes (UK, Europe, US, China, Middle East) that accommodate or fail to accommodate various forms of biotechnology. The last couple of chapters switches back to ‘how should we think about this’ mode, but it actually makes for a pretty engaging coda. One of his larger points is that differences in first principles among various nations are irreducible, and while we must strive for a global regulatory framework the challenge of achieving consensus is immense. He suggests that our best hope are categorical negatives which specify blatant red-lines that no biotechnology development should cross. I must admit that a libertarian in me is not unsympathetic to this ‘negative international rights’ idea.His other larger point is that international competition and global interconnectedness are all too likely to blow any good intentions out of the water. For example a country that forbids genetic enhancement and bioengineering out of concern for ‘human dignity’ will be faced with a prospect of being out-competed internationally, won’t be able to prevent its citizens from traveling elsewhere for desired procedures, and will need to forbid genetically-enhanced high-skill immigration from abroad. And if it does, it will end up paying for ‘human dignity’ with a totalitarian regime."

Hacking Darwin gets deep into the potential of genetic engineering and what it could mean for the human race. Hint, things will be much different than they are today. From the book description: “At the dawn of the genetics revolution, our DNA is becoming as readable, writable, and hackable as our information technology. But as humanity starts retooling our own genetic code, the choices we make today will be the difference between realizing breathtaking advances in human well-being and descending into a dangerous and potentially deadly genetic arms race.” Decisions will be made tomorrow that seem impossible today. This book may unsettle some who have rigid beliefs. They may hope to never experience what this book lays out as our likely future. Things like picking your kids traits, upgrading your biology, capabilities, personality, intelligence, strength, curing illnesses/diseases and practically anything you can think of as a genetic trait. No matter how you feel about it, it’s inevitable that things laid out in this book will happen. The author stresses that it’s important to have more discussion about the global implications of humanity’s future when it comes to genetic engineering. He likened it to the 1970 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, where the entire global community recognized both the opportunities and dangers and created standards that major powers agreed on. He states that implications could be just as serious if we don’t get ahead of this emerging field and create global standards that leverage the benefits while limiting the downsides. This is an interesting book that will make you view the world differently. It’s important to understand what’s coming and people who read this will be ahead of most in that regard."

""Hacking Darwin"" discusses the power of genetic technology and its possible future societal and ethical implications. ⁣⁣The book covers numerous topics including gene editing tools such as CRISPR, the future of reproduction and human enhancement, preimplantation genetic screening and editing, mitochondrial replacement therapy, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in gene editing, ageing, etc. An overview of the science and technology of genetic engineering is provided in a very comprehensible way even to readers who do not have a scientific background. ⁣⁣The author elegantly weaves the scientific, social, and ethical perspectives in his analyses and offers balanced views on the positives and negatives based on research. He draws parallels between the future of human enhancement with past and current events, such as the Eugenics movement of the 20th century and the cultural diversity between nations in relation to genetically modified (GM) food and crops. There’s also a very insightful talk about the importance of diversity for human survival. ⁣⁣The author provides future predictions of genetic engineering and possible conversations between parents and doctors about embryo gene editing and enhancement for certain traits. At the moment, there are so many technical and scientific challenges and many undiscovered biological pathways that these future scenarios might seem far-fetched. We might not be there yet, but given the rate at which advancements are being made, this book would definitely make you think deep about these future dilemmas and the need for global regulations.⁣⁣My only one criticism is that discussions sometimes get lengthy and protracted particularly in the final chapters. Nevertheless, I’d definitely recommend this thought-provoking and insightful read.⁣"
177,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38293445-stripe-fisk,4,"This is an interesting book that I think is best read as a way to look at where genetic technology is now, with a more skeptical eye towards where the author thinks it will arrive in the future. Though I agree with some of his predictions, others seem a little outlandish, or at least he is expecting them far too soon.The main thing that irked me about this book is the way that the author will occasionally mention a complication to one of his ideas, explain it, but go on describing his predictions as though that complication doesn’t really matter. For instance, he occasionally references how the human phenotype is affected by much more than just our straight genes due to epigenetic factors (and more!) but not much time is spent on this idea. There’s also a section where, after mentioning how intelligence is hard to define and there are some issues with IQ as a measurement, he marvels at the possibility of a human born with an IQ of 1000. (He also doesn’t acknowledge that there might be some limits to how far we can tweak our genome.) These moments make it a little hard to take some of his other predictions and claims seriously.Still, as I said, the book does a good job in outlining some of the current science on genetic engineering and outlines them in a straightforward but entertaining way. The chapters on aging and the future of fertility clinics were particularly engaging, though admittedly I found my eyes glazing over at his discussion of political movements in the last couple of chapter. That could just be my own bias, though.I’d definitely recommend this book for anybody interested in our progress toward genetic information, as long as they’re ready to take some predictions with a grain of salt."

Metzl has written an engaging, fascinating and thought-provoking book that focuses on the fast approaching and inevitable (and exiting) genetic revolution, with clear explanations of the tools involved and the consequences of their use. The writing is clear, explanations accurate and not too technical for the general interested reader.This book covers a vast array of topics that fall under the genetic engineering umbrella. He starts off with the history of genetic research, IVF, genetic screening; and continues with the relationship between genetics, diseases, traits, the environment; AI tools to process complex genetic patters; the pros and cons of the genetic engineering tools; ""designer babies""; stem-cell research; mitochondrial disease; multiple donar babies; gene-editing tools such as CRISPR; gene-therapy; safety issues and challenges to the current technology; chimeras; organ transplants; synthetic biology; aging; the ethics and responsibility of using genetic engineering tool; our relationship with nature; GMOs; the arms race of the human race; and finaly, the furture of humanity.Metzl states that his intent is to inform the public about the genetic revolution so that we can ""make the smartest collective decisions about our war forward... to understand what is happening and what's at stake."" Genetic entineering is a tool. The genetic revolution has the potential to improve lives or do great harm. The future of humanity depends on how we use it. "

Overall, it was an incredibly interesting, insightful, thought-provoking, and well-researched book. There was a lot of information and questions to absorb and think about. As a high school student who is interested in genetics/genetic engineering, Hacking Darwin detailed perspectives, history, and knowledge previously unknown to me and also provided me with countless sources for further reading. Throughout the book, Metzl connects the future ethical, political, and social ramifications of our choices to current issues and topics (like abortion) that made his argument more relatable and heightened the sense of urgency of the situation at hand.Jamie Metzl ultimately tries to create conversation and collaboration over a topic that we cannot afford to ignore. It informs without being overly technical, making it understandable and discussable for the general public. This book is a great thought-provoker for everyday readers and for anyone who wants to learn more about genetic engineering, especially the ethical dilemmas surrounding it. I would recommend it to anyone, especially high school and college students and teachers because it is so important for the future of our species, but also because it brings up important discussions in many subjects. Among these are biology, medicine, ethics, philosophy, politics, socioeconomics, and law. It’s a fantastic book full of citations and contemplation.(It’s also an excellent resource for research papers.)"

It explains how it works, talks about the philosophical aspect, asks how it’ll impact us as a species, how it’ll affect sex for the purpose of conception (RIP sex to make babies) and much many more questions and important philosophical dilemmas.. The books goal is to provoke thinking and stir the conversation into a field that - in my opinion - is not getting enough attention from the general public yet...I recommend you all to read because I truly believe this will be something that’ll affect us all very soon, so read and get prepped. 4.3 Stars"

Now many oppose application of PGT (pre-implantation genetic testing) i.e. screening of human embryo for gene disorder, however, this will soon be future since it will create human without critical genetic diseases like Huntington’s disease, Down syndrome etc. Author describes the future situation may be fantastic, however not free with danger. This 'genetic enhancement' , through gene splicing by CASPER-CAS9, of human may create a unbridgeable chasm between those who can afford genetic enhancement and those who can't. There may be cold war scenario in creating genetically enhance soldiers who can tolerate any extreme weather or returning of 'eugenic' movement which created Nazi era. Reader can get a flavor of how the entire biology is getting revolutionized in way of advance of synthetic biology (combining machine and life) and development of Senolytic drugs (for expanding life and reducing aging process).

190,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19258748-feng-ouyang,4,"The topic of this book is how we should deal with the future of manipulating human genes before or after birth to achieve various goals such as better health, more talent, and more desirable personality traits. The first part is an overview of the history and current status with a concise and accessible explanation of genetic science. It is not the best popular science book on the subject. However, it successfully sets the stage for the subsequent discussion. The author points out that currently, with IVF and in some other circumstances, people can screen the potential embryos based on their genes to avoid having children with severe inherited diseases. We are also advancing the science of connecting genes with health factors and personal traits, although we are still at the beginning of such exploration and can only understand the cases involving a small number of genes. At the same time, gene editing techniques have developed quickly, giving us powerful tools to delete and add genes in our DNA.The second part is a discussion on whether we should allow for further manipulation of genes beyond screening and even beyond health reasons. The author argues that such future manipulation is inevitable for three reasons. First, it is a natural continuation of what we do today. People have been manipulating the genes of animals and plants for tens of thousands of years through passive selection in domestication, active cross-breeding, and genetic engineering. We have also accepted the genetic screening of embryos. Therefore, genetic manipulation is not a domain of God. There is no quantum leap in ethics if we go forward with more deliberate and more invasive genetic manipulation of human genes.Second, it is challenging to maintain the “genetic purity” anyway. As long as we cannot stop all countries from human genetic modification, there will be genetically modified humans entering our gene pool and spreading across the world. Therefore, there is no point in resisting the trend.Third, genetic technologies are a power field of international competition, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Therefore, unilaterally banning genetic manipulation hurts a country.Based on these arguments, the author thinks the best way forward is having international cooperation in setting up regulation and monitoring and drawing a clear boundary on the practices. This part of the book is compelling. However, the arguments do not have much direct factorial support. The author relies on analogies and logical extensions to develop his thesis. For example, the book spent much space recounting Chinese history from Mao’s poor society to the second-largest economy in the world. It then describes China’s competitiveness and ambition in various technical areas. This information is relevant to show that we must address the possibility that China will become a leading genetic editing innovator, and that could impact our national interest. However, to convey such a point, the historical narrative can be significantly simplified and compressed. In fact, such a statement is almost self-evident with today’s media reporting.Lastly, the book offers a short discussion about the danger of human genetic modification. Ill-minded people can use it as a powerful weapon not only against their enemies but against humanity itself. The author thus calls again for international cooperation to ban certain practices, just as how we dealt with nuclear prefoliation. Overall, the book raised an interesting topic and provided much food for thought. However, the examination of the subject is incomplete. Two important considerations are missing in the book.First, we need to delve into the philosophy and ethical contemplations. For example, a tenant of Western ethics is that all men are created equal. Therefore, they have equal rights. Any social policy should not discriminate against people with certain inherited traits, because these traits are not under our control and are considered as random. However, if we can “engineer” superb member of the society, should they have a different set of rights? If we engineer people for a specific purpose such as sport, does that mean they are not intended to participate in other social activities such as governing? If others determine people’s traits before their birth, where does free will stand? These questions show that the introduction of human genetic engineering beyond narrow health concerns will have a profound impact on society and culture. It is not an incremental technology advance, as the author portraits.Second, human genetic engineering poses unique and grave danger comparing to other technologies. One reason is we still have a very poor understanding of genetic science. For example, we may know a gene is responsible for (or associated with) a particular disease or trait. But the same gene may play other roles in physiology that we don’t know about. The interactions of genes are even more complex. Therefore, the consequence of gene editing cannot be predicted with high accuracy and confidence. The other reason is that the result of gene editing is irreversible. All gene editing results will be in the human gene pool forever. One may argue that gene mutation has been operating since the beginning, and gene editing is the same. However, the later operates at a much, much higher speed, and we cannot subject all results to natural selection. Therefore, even if we can control the malicious use of gene editing techniques as the author advocates, gene editing can still threaten human wellbeing or even existence. This book broaches an essential topic that most of us managed to avoid so far. It also shows that our contemplation is just beginning. The book offers more questions than answers, which is probably the very intention of the author."
191,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9142626-deepak-rao,4,"A good book that could very well have been half the size and still served the purpose. Genetic engineering and bio-hacking are transformative technologies which could change the face of our civilization. Genetic engineering has the potential to make our descendants better(or different) than us, by a wide margin. The Homo Deus , envisioned by Yuval Harari, will be built on the foundations of genetic engineering. But this technology may cause large scale disruptions in society and lead to a large number of ethical and other problems. As we debate over the costs and benfits of this technology, one thing is certain that the decisions we take today to regulate and direct research in genetic engineering will significantly impact the trajectory of our future development."
192,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10496704-robert-kenny,2,"I could have written this book myself, and I have no formal background in genetic engineering. I suppose that’s why I was disappointed. I was hoping to learn more about the science. Instead, the author spends nearly all of his time describing the very obvious ways in which genetic engineering may change our society in the future: longer lives, fewer inherited diseases, increased use of in vitro fertilization, and babies genetically designed by their parents. None of these are new concepts, and all have been explored very thoroughly in science fiction and discussions about the ethics of genetic engineering. We’ve been talking about these things for decades. So why write a new book and simply rehash it all? What’s the point of reading non-fiction and not learning anything new?"
193,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31958906-dhyey-desai,2,"Some of the implications of genetic engineering are pretty scary and unregulated states like China run the risk of pushing the technology to the worst outcome. If the author's aim is to raise alarm and encourage efforts to regulate the technology, the author succeeds. The book lacks on the details of the technology and weighs heavier on thought experiments."

196,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103056314-herta-elina-jansone,4,"Read this book for my university's Biology book club. Our general consensus was that the first half of the book is rather boring for those who know biology at an undergraduate level, and some comparisons are just ""bullshit"", as said by a professor. The skin color gradient is not comparable by mutations in petal colors in lilies and petunias, no matter how drastic the color change is. Also, comparing gene editing to nuclear energy because of how it was ""stopped before it could do any harm"" - wrong, nuclear energy caused world-changing harm even before it was employed for energy generation. Additionally, nuclear energy requires large funding and the attention of governments. Meanwhile, genetic engineering can be done in rogue mode, as was stated in the book. And nobody, scientist or gardener, has a good enough understanding of the big picture of genome editing yet. Bioterrorism is unequivocally a major global risk, don't get me wrong. Maybe AI development would be a much better comparison to the progress in genetic research. This is an very anthropocentric book. It would have been better to state this early on rather than after rambling about making the essence of your own children ""readable, writeable, hackable"" for 4-5 chapters. Despite this annoying issue, some good points are made, especially near the end of the book when Metzl finally puts his political science knowledge into use when describing trend-setters and their influence on the future course of Biotechnology research and applications, which blends well into the general scene of global politics.While Europe and the USA are bickering about whether any research on genome manipulation is a sensible thing to do, Chinese companies are acquiring Biotech companies in the bickering regions and carry out research, create genetic databases of whole populations and move towards selecting the best individuals for certain purposes to try to be on top of the world in Bioengineering, intelligence and perhaps even sports (although, in some disciplines, African and some Scandinavians might have better genetics to start with, but it'll become irrelevant once they find something beyond the slow and faulty CRISPR-Cas machinery to apply in the future modifications of embryos).According to Metzl in this book, everything eventually boils down to genetics, just give scientists time to decipher the currently still unknown factors in aging, intelligence, emotional intelligence, extra-/introversion etc. Nurture isn't left out entirely but it's as important in this conversation as a footnote that states that the author is just aware that it exists, and that's it.Important questions are nonetheless raised:- Why should we try to engineer people with specific traits when such people already exist but may be considered worthless in whatever field they have been forced into?- Is it really better to create people that are predisposed towards better skills instead of improving the resources for teaching and supporting the society?- With people eventually stepping into the era of engineering their progeny as they see fit, what remains of the engineered person's individuality, opinion and ability to choose their own path in life? - What should be the standard of genetic engineering as a whole? Who should be responsible for setting the standard, and how should it be set?Discussion of the book gives a lot more food for thought than the book itself. Maybe that's what Metzl tries to achieve with this book - to turn us into ""critical catalysts of this dialogue"". Only through education and discussion can we come closer to achieving consensus about the ultimate purpose and application of this emerging technology."
197,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74862840-cary-giese,5,"What are the implications of moving from natural selection as the way humans evolve to human control of that evolution? That is the question asked by the author? Little debate (though some) will occur as science uses genetics to cure disease and prevents hereditary transfer of certain diseases to later generations! But, with mass collection of the human races’ genetics and AI’s ability to pattern that data, the capabilities to select desirable(?) traits to the human race will become possible. What policies will be possible to prevent some civilization to try to use that to capitalize on that capability to advantage themselves? Some policy such as the nuclear proliferation treaty will probably be required. The question is: will some sub-national group try to misuse the technology! Access to large data bases and AI will enable highly trained individual(s) to take steps on their own. How will that capability be policed is another question. The human race evolved, so far, by genetic mixing genes randomly. Genetic errors or good fortune created unfortunate diseases and human genius.As a race we have learned through conflict and resolution to progress, though progress has been uneven. The question is: will we be overcome by the incredible pace of coming change? Will progress continue?It will require wise leadership to take advantage of the wondrous possibilities, while avoiding horrendous risk!A must read for our leaders! The changes will be subtle and seen as generally beneficial by the general public. Nuclear Non-proliferation was easier because destruction by those bombs in Japan demonstrated the existential risk.So leaders are going to have to reach treaties and propose regulations and explain the reasons to the public!!! To do that they will have to become students of our impending rapidly changing future!The author recommends a global dialogue to include top scientist, religious leaders, trusted thinkers to conceive and propose the essential questions that require exploration.Metzl’s proposed questions as follows:1. What can be done to ensure the broadest possible access to the health and well-being benefits of genetic technologies?2. Should there be a limit on the application of genetic technologies to treat or eliminate disease? If so, what should they be? 3. Should people have full access to information about their own and their potential children’s genetic makeup or should this access be limited? If limited, what should the restrictions be and why? 4. Should parents be allowed unlimited freedom to select from among their natural embryos during in vitro fertilization? If not, on what basis should limitations be set? Should parents be allowed to select embryos on non-disease-related traits, like height, projected IQ, personality style, etc.?5. If it is proven safe, should precision gene editing be used to eliminate genetic diseases in adult sex cells and pre-implanted embryos in a manner that would be passed to future generations?6. Do we need a global framework to help prevent the worst abuses of human genetic engineering? 7. What long-term institutions do we need to foster an inclusive global dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering that optimizes the benefits of those technologies and minimizes potential harms? 8. What more can be done to help ensure the genetic revolution helps enhance all of our humanity, and how can each of us be better engaged in the process?I recommend reading this book so you are prepared to participate fully in you and your progeny’s future!"

Thankfully, that is precisely what this book is. While I don't really like that all of the books on this subject sound like over-enthusiastic episode titles for some sci-fi series, the message is important; if we are going to move forward as a country and species with the use of this new technology then the public has to be informed to a degree that is currently unimaginable. This book goes a long way toward bridging the gulf between the incredible advances being made right now at unthinkably exponential rates and the intellectual stagnation of the general populace's understanding over the past few decades. Unfortunately, this discussion and the possibility for national advancement are left to intrepid scientists making cases before governmental bodies consisting entirely of lawyers and businessmen who are themselves beholden to the big money of unlettered, reductionist, simpleton-fostering religious organizations who love to talk endlessly about the need for caution in, ""playing god,"" yet remain blissfully ignorant of the entirety of human biomedical science and think it appropriate to quote Bronze-Age idiocy as a rebuttal to the latest developments in the sciences. That, or the epithet of, ""eugenics,"" is just thrown in as Hitler is to every Twitter conversation about anything. Jamie Metzl is very thorough when it comes to the areas where we do have legitimate cause for concern, and others where a certain naturalistic fallacy continues to rot the minds of otherwise sensible people. He does this with an amusing vignette of a visit to a clinic that progressively gets further and further advanced, allowing him to make choices regarding his future offspring that were unimaginable even a few years before when conceiving his previous children. He also deftly handles the competitive atmosphere that will continue to develop among the leading nations harnessing this technology. His sports reference in this section is particularly apt as given just how much time, money, and science is invested in athletic performance for the bizarrely useless purpose of nationalistic chest-beating at the Olympics every two years, the notion of having a populace that, due to the government's grasp and regulatory ability over genetic modification, is biologically more advanced in terms of resistance to disease/aging and further developed for intellect and physical prowess is one that policy-makers need to understand now. The final chapter is full of genuine policy recommendations and recommendations to the scientific community to achieve the type of widespread education I mentioned earlier. Most of these suggestions make total sense, are genuinely unthinkable in a country as stupid as 2020 USA, and require an intellectual investment on the part of the individual that is hard to fathom. However, that so many books are being written for the layperson about this area of science and public policy gives hope that more well-read future leaders might be able to steer the conversation to more rational levels. One can dream..."
199,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"I love science and books about science. I grew up believing that science would lead the way forward to a more peaceful, prosperous, and humanitarian world. Much like flying cars, electricity too cheap to meter, and the cure for the common cold, this future has not materialized in my lifetime.Messing with genes, whether in plants or animals, has always been a part of science that scared me. Nature is incrediblely complex and interactive and it wouldn’t take much to mess up the balance. The Butterfly Effect speaks to the sensitive interdependence of life on Earth. I’m writing this during the Covid-19 outbreak which shows exactly how vulnerable the human race is to even the smallest of changes.My fear and concern about genetic engineering caused me to pick-up and put back Hacking Darwin: Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity by Jamie Metzl several times. I’m glad that I finally decided to read it.Metzl has written an extremely informative, scientific book that is easy to read. He definitely has a personal opinion about how genetic engineering should proceed. I’m sure that the Non-GMO Project, Greenpeace, and others would differ greatly but I think Metzl ties to present a little of “the other side” in his book.Reading Hacking Darwin has given me a lot of new and useful information. I am no less afraid of genetic engineering than I was before but I now feel that my fears have a factual foundation. That said, I definitely also see Metzl’s argument that genetic “tinkering” can have a positive side. Humans have been engaging in genetic engineering for tens of thousands of years. We have bred a lowly grass into maize, a staple food for millions of people. We have bred rice and wheat so that they can grow in a much wider environment and produce significantly more edible food. These agricultural advancements have kept millions of people from starvation.So how is corn domestication and cultivation in the field any different that reorganizing the corn gene in the lab to resist insects, droughts, and increased global temperatures? For me, the heart of the debate is that genetic “tinkering” of crops provides much faster and sweeping changes and, therefore, could produce devastating results before we even become aware of what we have done. With human embryos the debate centers on “tinkering” with the human germline which would result in inheritable changes that could continue forward for generations possibly producing horrific consequences.Human genetic engineering is the ultimate Ying-Yang of contemporary science. On one had we could solve the horrible suffering of millions of people by preventing Sickle Cell Anemia, Tay–Sachs, and Diabetes. We might even be able to rid the human genome of cancer and heart disease. On the other hand we could reduce the diversity of the human race and create a eugenics movement that would make what the nazis did seem like a walk in the park.I highly recommend this book. It may scare you. It may make your head hurt trying to figure out what is the ethically correct road forward. It definitely will inform you that genetic engineering by one or more countries or companies is inevitable. This is definitely a case that forewarned is forearmed."""
200,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59225695-rodney-jehu,4,"“The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born” - indeed. I wore a frown the entire time I read this often deeply unnerving clarion call of a book - not because I did not thoroughly enjoy Jamie Metzl’s book, but rather because my feelings of transhumanistic enthusiasm and (warranted?) neophobia were necessarily in conflict. On one hand, I am inclined to believe that the survival of our progeny (note: I did not say “species”) will continue to be predicated upon our ability to fashion increasingly more effective weapons for our fight against entropy. On the other hand, if Metzl is to be believed, we are at the precipice of an explosion of Cambrian proportions, which will be ignited by our fast approaching competence in genome editing. I wholeheadedly agree with Metzl about the importance of raising public awareness of the issues at hand (everyone should read this book!), not least because I think it is an inexpensive kindness to shout to your neighbors, “brace yourselves!” when not just their minds are about to be blown. I docked a star because of Metzl’s frequent albeit forgivable use of scenarios. While entertaining and doubtless makes such a serious subject more palatable, the discussion of “concrete” scenarios will likely seduce many readers into overestimating the predictability of the future as well as the competence of the prognosticator. At present, we are nowhere near able to enumerate a large enough set of potential outcomes from the genetics revolution, sufficient to inform policies or controls that will help us avoid potholes ahead. This, precisely, is the problem with which we must grapple - and it is a wicked problem. Our present ability to predict the myriad effects of genome editing at the level of the individual is woefully inadequate, to say nothing of our ability to predict broad societal, national or global outcomes. As exceedingly difficult as it is to predict behavior, behavior supervenes on phenotype, and phenotype supervenes on (epi)genotype, and genes, darn them, exhibit pleiotropy. Alas, as Metzl notes, we will likely push forward blindly and with characteristic hubris. Disquietude is visited upon anyone that grasps the full import of the tectonic shifts we will all too soon experience. Reader beware. I am going to be thinking about what I learned in “Hacking Darwin” for a long time, and I am truly grateful to Metzl for writing this book and to the authors of the many bleeding-edge scientific studies cited. I also thank my lucky stars for genes that, at least, make me less susceptible to early-onset glabellar lines."
201,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,5,"An all-encompassing look at the future of gene editing. It covers everything from ancient history, today’s practices, upcoming practices, to possible moral, political, and scientific issues in the coming years. Gene editing is looked at from individual, scientific, governmental, international, and religious viewpoints throughout. War, athletics, space pioneering, individual data protection, and AI are some lenses looked through for speculations on a global scale. The author’s science fiction writing experience shines in a few example scenarios in the book of going to future clinics. One is being put in his character’s shoes and having to face a moral scenario like embryo selection: seeing all of your different potential children on a projected wall, as hundreds of probability statistics, and all of the ethical conflicts that come with it, is very effective at envisioning a similar future reality. While IVF, CRISPR/Cas9, embryo selection, aging, and longevity are thoroughly discussed topics, the author doesn’t lose sight of the importance of keeping our humanity, privacy, and diversity.So much is explored and presented for healthy, proactive discussion. - What if a country has voted on gene editing regulation, but neighboring countries are creating genetically advanced soldiers?- Will empathy and creativity, initially forgotten in the gene editing and AI craze, become increasingly valuable qualities?- Will different races, sexual preferences, and disorders cease to exist?- Will we become more susceptible to natural viruses and germs with a more genetically uniform species?- If you select a male embryo with a genetic proclivity for fast twitch muscles, but he develops an aversion to sports, did you ruin his chances in life? - Will a gap form between enhanced and un-enhanced individuals?""If people have gone ballistic over the environmental, GMO, and abortion debates—if they have manned the barricades and destroyed research centers over genetically modified crops, or attacked abortion clinics and murdered doctors—imagine what they might do when the same diversity of individual, cultural, societal, and governmental views inspires different national approaches to the emerging science of genetically modified people."""
202,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51063190-caden-howlett,5,"In c. 65 AD, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca stated that “…[we] and the things we live amongst are destined to perish.” In rereading Joseph Goldstein’s “Experience of Insight” (1976), I came across this concept eloquently rephrased as a reminder that “…inherent in all things that arise is decay.” Although these are not original ideas of the two men, I thought they served well as representatives of a concern we have had since the beginning of our self-consciousness: mortality.The concept of impermanence is pervasive through all human history, reaching back as far as the earliest surviving work of human literature (the Epic of Gilgamesh). Philosophers, historians, and scientists have always written about death, decay, and mortality as if they were unavoidable universal truths, hence the examples above. Our views on mortality remained constant over thousands of years due to essentially no scientific method and its consequential advances. Only recently has this changed. The unprecedented explosion of technology and scientific ability has profoundly transformed our understanding of life and death and, consequently, we are beginning to question if mortality is indeed a “fundamental truth” of existence. “Hacking Darwin” by Jamie Petzl addresses the current state of genetic engineering. His book makes it crystal clear that biology is no longer what it once was and will continue to change dramatically over the coming decades. Our technology and understanding of human biology are conjoining, and it is possible that within the next 30-50 years we will have the ability to safely alter our genome and greatly prolong our lives. Perhaps more importantly than prolonging our lives, we will be able to selectively choose which genes are present in our children, ultimately allowing us to produce offspring that far exceed us in intelligence, strength, and creativity. Are there limits to this? We will find out. Maybe our period of genetic engineering will only play a minor role between where we are now and the eventual uploading of our consciousness to “the cloud”.I can’t help but wonder what Seneca would think."
203,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16446997-reading,3,"Initially I struggled with this book as the author favoured the techno-utopian perspective, thankfully later chapters brought more balanced alternatives and concerns. Still I do not agree with his conclusions regarding some aspects of genetic engineering and man's apparent omnipresent battle with nature.In presenting humans pursuit of knowledge regarding cancer and domesticing crop's the author seems naive at best and disingenuous at worst when he writes ""...we balanced the costs and benefits and moved forward with imperfect information and a desire to learn and do more."" It's like watching Claude Rains react with feigned shock at witnessing gambling in Rick's, only to moments later surreptitiously receive his winnings. Not including PROFIT as a (if not THE) central motivating factor and therefore criticism, is a critical error in the thinking of all too many techno true believers.The author deserves credit for navigating and studying such a controversial subject that is so fraught with potential for destructive consequences if not applied judiciously. I appreciated observations such as ""Why breed people for superior IQ when we could significantly enhance our society's collective intellectual and problem solving capability by providing real opportunity and better schools to the least advantaged among us?"", and ""Diversity is our species' greatest asset should we chose to embrace it. Reducing our diversity, even with the best of intentions, could become our Achilles' heel."" Of 182Then there are doozies like, ""If we had demanded equal access to smartphones for everyone from the get go, the smartphone industry would never have grown quickly enough to drive down prices to where these phones became accessable to poor people around the world"" huh?! Contradictory and incorrect plus once again it doesn't deal with the inherent problem that capitalism, as presently practiced, perpetuates inequality.Particularly appreciate later chapters 8, 9 as they confront challenges.Author's continuing mantra ""...we are in a perpetual struggle with the cruelty of the natural world."" and his desire ""...to transcend our limited biology and, someday, our time-limited planet."" was impossible to get pay as it colored so many of the author's conclusions and observations."
204,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,3,"Easy-going, broad and largely-nontechnical introduction to human genetic engineering. The first couple of chapters are a tad off-putting as Metzl overindulges in an overt catechism of what is ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, the porous boundaries between disease prevention and enhancement, and the fine lines between eugenics and improvements to well-being. But if you can ignore the polemic that is sprinkled throughout the book there is a fair amount of informative material that is worth knowing. Metzl covers embryo screening, iterative embryo selection, induced pluripotent stem cells, mitochondrial transfer, gene therapy, CRISPR soup (Cas9, Cas12b2, Cas13a…), germline modifications, and life extension research. While he is at it, Metzl also comments on various regulatory regimes (UK, Europe, US, China, Middle East) that accommodate or fail to accommodate various forms of biotechnology. The last couple of chapters switches back to ‘how should we think about this’ mode, but it actually makes for a pretty engaging coda. One of his larger points is that differences in first principles among various nations are irreducible, and while we must strive for a global regulatory framework the challenge of achieving consensus is immense. He suggests that our best hope are categorical negatives which specify blatant red-lines that no biotechnology development should cross. I must admit that a libertarian in me is not unsympathetic to this ‘negative international rights’ idea.His other larger point is that international competition and global interconnectedness are all too likely to blow any good intentions out of the water. For example a country that forbids genetic enhancement and bioengineering out of concern for ‘human dignity’ will be faced with a prospect of being out-competed internationally, won’t be able to prevent its citizens from traveling elsewhere for desired procedures, and will need to forbid genetically-enhanced high-skill immigration from abroad. And if it does, it will end up paying for ‘human dignity’ with a totalitarian regime."

Hacking Darwin gets deep into the potential of genetic engineering and what it could mean for the human race. Hint, things will be much different than they are today. From the book description: “At the dawn of the genetics revolution, our DNA is becoming as readable, writable, and hackable as our information technology. But as humanity starts retooling our own genetic code, the choices we make today will be the difference between realizing breathtaking advances in human well-being and descending into a dangerous and potentially deadly genetic arms race.” Decisions will be made tomorrow that seem impossible today. This book may unsettle some who have rigid beliefs. They may hope to never experience what this book lays out as our likely future. Things like picking your kids traits, upgrading your biology, capabilities, personality, intelligence, strength, curing illnesses/diseases and practically anything you can think of as a genetic trait. No matter how you feel about it, it’s inevitable that things laid out in this book will happen. The author stresses that it’s important to have more discussion about the global implications of humanity’s future when it comes to genetic engineering. He likened it to the 1970 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, where the entire global community recognized both the opportunities and dangers and created standards that major powers agreed on. He states that implications could be just as serious if we don’t get ahead of this emerging field and create global standards that leverage the benefits while limiting the downsides. This is an interesting book that will make you view the world differently. It’s important to understand what’s coming and people who read this will be ahead of most in that regard."

""Hacking Darwin"" discusses the power of genetic technology and its possible future societal and ethical implications. ⁣⁣The book covers numerous topics including gene editing tools such as CRISPR, the future of reproduction and human enhancement, preimplantation genetic screening and editing, mitochondrial replacement therapy, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in gene editing, ageing, etc. An overview of the science and technology of genetic engineering is provided in a very comprehensible way even to readers who do not have a scientific background. ⁣⁣The author elegantly weaves the scientific, social, and ethical perspectives in his analyses and offers balanced views on the positives and negatives based on research. He draws parallels between the future of human enhancement with past and current events, such as the Eugenics movement of the 20th century and the cultural diversity between nations in relation to genetically modified (GM) food and crops. There’s also a very insightful talk about the importance of diversity for human survival. ⁣⁣The author provides future predictions of genetic engineering and possible conversations between parents and doctors about embryo gene editing and enhancement for certain traits. At the moment, there are so many technical and scientific challenges and many undiscovered biological pathways that these future scenarios might seem far-fetched. We might not be there yet, but given the rate at which advancements are being made, this book would definitely make you think deep about these future dilemmas and the need for global regulations.⁣⁣My only one criticism is that discussions sometimes get lengthy and protracted particularly in the final chapters. Nevertheless, I’d definitely recommend this thought-provoking and insightful read.⁣"
207,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38293445-stripe-fisk,4,"This is an interesting book that I think is best read as a way to look at where genetic technology is now, with a more skeptical eye towards where the author thinks it will arrive in the future. Though I agree with some of his predictions, others seem a little outlandish, or at least he is expecting them far too soon.The main thing that irked me about this book is the way that the author will occasionally mention a complication to one of his ideas, explain it, but go on describing his predictions as though that complication doesn’t really matter. For instance, he occasionally references how the human phenotype is affected by much more than just our straight genes due to epigenetic factors (and more!) but not much time is spent on this idea. There’s also a section where, after mentioning how intelligence is hard to define and there are some issues with IQ as a measurement, he marvels at the possibility of a human born with an IQ of 1000. (He also doesn’t acknowledge that there might be some limits to how far we can tweak our genome.) These moments make it a little hard to take some of his other predictions and claims seriously.Still, as I said, the book does a good job in outlining some of the current science on genetic engineering and outlines them in a straightforward but entertaining way. The chapters on aging and the future of fertility clinics were particularly engaging, though admittedly I found my eyes glazing over at his discussion of political movements in the last couple of chapter. That could just be my own bias, though.I’d definitely recommend this book for anybody interested in our progress toward genetic information, as long as they’re ready to take some predictions with a grain of salt."

Metzl has written an engaging, fascinating and thought-provoking book that focuses on the fast approaching and inevitable (and exiting) genetic revolution, with clear explanations of the tools involved and the consequences of their use. The writing is clear, explanations accurate and not too technical for the general interested reader.This book covers a vast array of topics that fall under the genetic engineering umbrella. He starts off with the history of genetic research, IVF, genetic screening; and continues with the relationship between genetics, diseases, traits, the environment; AI tools to process complex genetic patters; the pros and cons of the genetic engineering tools; ""designer babies""; stem-cell research; mitochondrial disease; multiple donar babies; gene-editing tools such as CRISPR; gene-therapy; safety issues and challenges to the current technology; chimeras; organ transplants; synthetic biology; aging; the ethics and responsibility of using genetic engineering tool; our relationship with nature; GMOs; the arms race of the human race; and finaly, the furture of humanity.Metzl states that his intent is to inform the public about the genetic revolution so that we can ""make the smartest collective decisions about our war forward... to understand what is happening and what's at stake."" Genetic entineering is a tool. The genetic revolution has the potential to improve lives or do great harm. The future of humanity depends on how we use it. "

Overall, it was an incredibly interesting, insightful, thought-provoking, and well-researched book. There was a lot of information and questions to absorb and think about. As a high school student who is interested in genetics/genetic engineering, Hacking Darwin detailed perspectives, history, and knowledge previously unknown to me and also provided me with countless sources for further reading. Throughout the book, Metzl connects the future ethical, political, and social ramifications of our choices to current issues and topics (like abortion) that made his argument more relatable and heightened the sense of urgency of the situation at hand.Jamie Metzl ultimately tries to create conversation and collaboration over a topic that we cannot afford to ignore. It informs without being overly technical, making it understandable and discussable for the general public. This book is a great thought-provoker for everyday readers and for anyone who wants to learn more about genetic engineering, especially the ethical dilemmas surrounding it. I would recommend it to anyone, especially high school and college students and teachers because it is so important for the future of our species, but also because it brings up important discussions in many subjects. Among these are biology, medicine, ethics, philosophy, politics, socioeconomics, and law. It’s a fantastic book full of citations and contemplation.(It’s also an excellent resource for research papers.)"

220,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19258748-feng-ouyang,4,"The topic of this book is how we should deal with the future of manipulating human genes before or after birth to achieve various goals such as better health, more talent, and more desirable personality traits. The first part is an overview of the history and current status with a concise and accessible explanation of genetic science. It is not the best popular science book on the subject. However, it successfully sets the stage for the subsequent discussion. The author points out that currently, with IVF and in some other circumstances, people can screen the potential embryos based on their genes to avoid having children with severe inherited diseases. We are also advancing the science of connecting genes with health factors and personal traits, although we are still at the beginning of such exploration and can only understand the cases involving a small number of genes. At the same time, gene editing techniques have developed quickly, giving us powerful tools to delete and add genes in our DNA.The second part is a discussion on whether we should allow for further manipulation of genes beyond screening and even beyond health reasons. The author argues that such future manipulation is inevitable for three reasons. First, it is a natural continuation of what we do today. People have been manipulating the genes of animals and plants for tens of thousands of years through passive selection in domestication, active cross-breeding, and genetic engineering. We have also accepted the genetic screening of embryos. Therefore, genetic manipulation is not a domain of God. There is no quantum leap in ethics if we go forward with more deliberate and more invasive genetic manipulation of human genes.Second, it is challenging to maintain the “genetic purity” anyway. As long as we cannot stop all countries from human genetic modification, there will be genetically modified humans entering our gene pool and spreading across the world. Therefore, there is no point in resisting the trend.Third, genetic technologies are a power field of international competition, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Therefore, unilaterally banning genetic manipulation hurts a country.Based on these arguments, the author thinks the best way forward is having international cooperation in setting up regulation and monitoring and drawing a clear boundary on the practices. This part of the book is compelling. However, the arguments do not have much direct factorial support. The author relies on analogies and logical extensions to develop his thesis. For example, the book spent much space recounting Chinese history from Mao’s poor society to the second-largest economy in the world. It then describes China’s competitiveness and ambition in various technical areas. This information is relevant to show that we must address the possibility that China will become a leading genetic editing innovator, and that could impact our national interest. However, to convey such a point, the historical narrative can be significantly simplified and compressed. In fact, such a statement is almost self-evident with today’s media reporting.Lastly, the book offers a short discussion about the danger of human genetic modification. Ill-minded people can use it as a powerful weapon not only against their enemies but against humanity itself. The author thus calls again for international cooperation to ban certain practices, just as how we dealt with nuclear prefoliation. Overall, the book raised an interesting topic and provided much food for thought. However, the examination of the subject is incomplete. Two important considerations are missing in the book.First, we need to delve into the philosophy and ethical contemplations. For example, a tenant of Western ethics is that all men are created equal. Therefore, they have equal rights. Any social policy should not discriminate against people with certain inherited traits, because these traits are not under our control and are considered as random. However, if we can “engineer” superb member of the society, should they have a different set of rights? If we engineer people for a specific purpose such as sport, does that mean they are not intended to participate in other social activities such as governing? If others determine people’s traits before their birth, where does free will stand? These questions show that the introduction of human genetic engineering beyond narrow health concerns will have a profound impact on society and culture. It is not an incremental technology advance, as the author portraits.Second, human genetic engineering poses unique and grave danger comparing to other technologies. One reason is we still have a very poor understanding of genetic science. For example, we may know a gene is responsible for (or associated with) a particular disease or trait. But the same gene may play other roles in physiology that we don’t know about. The interactions of genes are even more complex. Therefore, the consequence of gene editing cannot be predicted with high accuracy and confidence. The other reason is that the result of gene editing is irreversible. All gene editing results will be in the human gene pool forever. One may argue that gene mutation has been operating since the beginning, and gene editing is the same. However, the later operates at a much, much higher speed, and we cannot subject all results to natural selection. Therefore, even if we can control the malicious use of gene editing techniques as the author advocates, gene editing can still threaten human wellbeing or even existence. This book broaches an essential topic that most of us managed to avoid so far. It also shows that our contemplation is just beginning. The book offers more questions than answers, which is probably the very intention of the author."

Genetic engineering and bio-hacking are transformative technologies which could change the face of our civilization. Genetic engineering has the potential to make our descendants better(or different) than us, by a wide margin. The Homo Deus , envisioned by Yuval Harari, will be built on the foundations of genetic engineering. But this technology may cause large scale disruptions in society and lead to a large number of ethical and other problems. As we debate over the costs and benfits of this technology, one thing is certain that the decisions we take today to regulate and direct research in genetic engineering will significantly impact the trajectory of our future development."

I suppose that’s why I was disappointed. I was hoping to learn more about the science. Instead, the author spends nearly all of his time describing the very obvious ways in which genetic engineering may change our society in the future: longer lives, fewer inherited diseases, increased use of in vitro fertilization, and babies genetically designed by their parents. None of these are new concepts, and all have been explored very thoroughly in science fiction and discussions about the ethics of genetic engineering. We’ve been talking about these things for decades. So why write a new book and simply rehash it all? What’s the point of reading non-fiction and not learning anything new?"

Our general consensus was that the first half of the book is rather boring for those who know biology at an undergraduate level, and some comparisons are just ""bullshit"", as said by a professor. The skin color gradient is not comparable by mutations in petal colors in lilies and petunias, no matter how drastic the color change is. Also, comparing gene editing to nuclear energy because of how it was ""stopped before it could do any harm"" - wrong, nuclear energy caused world-changing harm even before it was employed for energy generation. Additionally, nuclear energy requires large funding and the attention of governments. Meanwhile, genetic engineering can be done in rogue mode, as was stated in the book. And nobody, scientist or gardener, has a good enough understanding of the big picture of genome editing yet. Bioterrorism is unequivocally a major global risk, don't get me wrong. Maybe AI development would be a much better comparison to the progress in genetic research. This is an very anthropocentric book. It would have been better to state this early on rather than after rambling about making the essence of your own children ""readable, writeable, hackable"" for 4-5 chapters. Despite this annoying issue, some good points are made, especially near the end of the book when Metzl finally puts his political science knowledge into use when describing trend-setters and their influence on the future course of Biotechnology research and applications, which blends well into the general scene of global politics.While Europe and the USA are bickering about whether any research on genome manipulation is a sensible thing to do, Chinese companies are acquiring Biotech companies in the bickering regions and carry out research, create genetic databases of whole populations and move towards selecting the best individuals for certain purposes to try to be on top of the world in Bioengineering, intelligence and perhaps even sports (although, in some disciplines, African and some Scandinavians might have better genetics to start with, but it'll become irrelevant once they find something beyond the slow and faulty CRISPR-Cas machinery to apply in the future modifications of embryos).According to Metzl in this book, everything eventually boils down to genetics, just give scientists time to decipher the currently still unknown factors in aging, intelligence, emotional intelligence, extra-/introversion etc. Nurture isn't left out entirely but it's as important in this conversation as a footnote that states that the author is just aware that it exists, and that's it.Important questions are nonetheless raised:- Why should we try to engineer people with specific traits when such people already exist but may be considered worthless in whatever field they have been forced into?- Is it really better to create people that are predisposed towards better skills instead of improving the resources for teaching and supporting the society?- With people eventually stepping into the era of engineering their progeny as they see fit, what remains of the engineered person's individuality, opinion and ability to choose their own path in life? - What should be the standard of genetic engineering as a whole? Who should be responsible for setting the standard, and how should it be set?Discussion of the book gives a lot more food for thought than the book itself. Maybe that's what Metzl tries to achieve with this book - to turn us into ""critical catalysts of this dialogue"". Only through education and discussion can we come closer to achieving consensus about the ultimate purpose and application of this emerging technology."

That is the question asked by the author? Little debate (though some) will occur as science uses genetics to cure disease and prevents hereditary transfer of certain diseases to later generations! But, with mass collection of the human races’ genetics and AI’s ability to pattern that data, the capabilities to select desirable(?) traits to the human race will become possible. What policies will be possible to prevent some civilization to try to use that to capitalize on that capability to advantage themselves? Some policy such as the nuclear proliferation treaty will probably be required. The question is: will some sub-national group try to misuse the technology! Access to large data bases and AI will enable highly trained individual(s) to take steps on their own. How will that capability be policed is another question. The human race evolved, so far, by genetic mixing genes randomly. Genetic errors or good fortune created unfortunate diseases and human genius.As a race we have learned through conflict and resolution to progress, though progress has been uneven. The question is: will we be overcome by the incredible pace of coming change? Will progress continue?It will require wise leadership to take advantage of the wondrous possibilities, while avoiding horrendous risk!A must read for our leaders! The changes will be subtle and seen as generally beneficial by the general public. Nuclear Non-proliferation was easier because destruction by those bombs in Japan demonstrated the existential risk.So leaders are going to have to reach treaties and propose regulations and explain the reasons to the public!!! To do that they will have to become students of our impending rapidly changing future!The author recommends a global dialogue to include top scientist, religious leaders, trusted thinkers to conceive and propose the essential questions that require exploration.Metzl’s proposed questions as follows:1. What can be done to ensure the broadest possible access to the health and well-being benefits of genetic technologies?2. Should there be a limit on the application of genetic technologies to treat or eliminate disease? If so, what should they be? 3. Should people have full access to information about their own and their potential children’s genetic makeup or should this access be limited? If limited, what should the restrictions be and why? 4. Should parents be allowed unlimited freedom to select from among their natural embryos during in vitro fertilization? If not, on what basis should limitations be set? Should parents be allowed to select embryos on non-disease-related traits, like height, projected IQ, personality style, etc.?5. If it is proven safe, should precision gene editing be used to eliminate genetic diseases in adult sex cells and pre-implanted embryos in a manner that would be passed to future generations?6. Do we need a global framework to help prevent the worst abuses of human genetic engineering? 7. What long-term institutions do we need to foster an inclusive global dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering that optimizes the benefits of those technologies and minimizes potential harms? 8. What more can be done to help ensure the genetic revolution helps enhance all of our humanity, and how can each of us be better engaged in the process?I recommend reading this book so you are prepared to participate fully in you and your progeny’s future!"
228,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"Having just read Jennifer Doudna's wonderful book, ""A Crack in Creation,"" which detailed the development of CRISPR-cas9, I went to this volume by Jamie Metzl for a broader look at the potential ramifications of the use of this technology and more of a focus on policy. Thankfully, that is precisely what this book is. While I don't really like that all of the books on this subject sound like over-enthusiastic episode titles for some sci-fi series, the message is important; if we are going to move forward as a country and species with the use of this new technology then the public has to be informed to a degree that is currently unimaginable. This book goes a long way toward bridging the gulf between the incredible advances being made right now at unthinkably exponential rates and the intellectual stagnation of the general populace's understanding over the past few decades. Unfortunately, this discussion and the possibility for national advancement are left to intrepid scientists making cases before governmental bodies consisting entirely of lawyers and businessmen who are themselves beholden to the big money of unlettered, reductionist, simpleton-fostering religious organizations who love to talk endlessly about the need for caution in, ""playing god,"" yet remain blissfully ignorant of the entirety of human biomedical science and think it appropriate to quote Bronze-Age idiocy as a rebuttal to the latest developments in the sciences. That, or the epithet of, ""eugenics,"" is just thrown in as Hitler is to every Twitter conversation about anything. Jamie Metzl is very thorough when it comes to the areas where we do have legitimate cause for concern, and others where a certain naturalistic fallacy continues to rot the minds of otherwise sensible people. He does this with an amusing vignette of a visit to a clinic that progressively gets further and further advanced, allowing him to make choices regarding his future offspring that were unimaginable even a few years before when conceiving his previous children. He also deftly handles the competitive atmosphere that will continue to develop among the leading nations harnessing this technology. His sports reference in this section is particularly apt as given just how much time, money, and science is invested in athletic performance for the bizarrely useless purpose of nationalistic chest-beating at the Olympics every two years, the notion of having a populace that, due to the government's grasp and regulatory ability over genetic modification, is biologically more advanced in terms of resistance to disease/aging and further developed for intellect and physical prowess is one that policy-makers need to understand now. The final chapter is full of genuine policy recommendations and recommendations to the scientific community to achieve the type of widespread education I mentioned earlier. Most of these suggestions make total sense, are genuinely unthinkable in a country as stupid as 2020 USA, and require an intellectual investment on the part of the individual that is hard to fathom. However, that so many books are being written for the layperson about this area of science and public policy gives hope that more well-read future leaders might be able to steer the conversation to more rational levels. One can dream..."
229,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"I love science and books about science. I grew up believing that science would lead the way forward to a more peaceful, prosperous, and humanitarian world. Much like flying cars, electricity too cheap to meter, and the cure for the common cold, this future has not materialized in my lifetime.Messing with genes, whether in plants or animals, has always been a part of science that scared me. Nature is incrediblely complex and interactive and it wouldn’t take much to mess up the balance. The Butterfly Effect speaks to the sensitive interdependence of life on Earth. I’m writing this during the Covid-19 outbreak which shows exactly how vulnerable the human race is to even the smallest of changes.My fear and concern about genetic engineering caused me to pick-up and put back Hacking Darwin: Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity by Jamie Metzl several times. I’m glad that I finally decided to read it.Metzl has written an extremely informative, scientific book that is easy to read. He definitely has a personal opinion about how genetic engineering should proceed. I’m sure that the Non-GMO Project, Greenpeace, and others would differ greatly but I think Metzl ties to present a little of “the other side” in his book.Reading Hacking Darwin has given me a lot of new and useful information. I am no less afraid of genetic engineering than I was before but I now feel that my fears have a factual foundation. That said, I definitely also see Metzl’s argument that genetic “tinkering” can have a positive side. Humans have been engaging in genetic engineering for tens of thousands of years. We have bred a lowly grass into maize, a staple food for millions of people. We have bred rice and wheat so that they can grow in a much wider environment and produce significantly more edible food. These agricultural advancements have kept millions of people from starvation.So how is corn domestication and cultivation in the field any different that reorganizing the corn gene in the lab to resist insects, droughts, and increased global temperatures? For me, the heart of the debate is that genetic “tinkering” of crops provides much faster and sweeping changes and, therefore, could produce devastating results before we even become aware of what we have done. With human embryos the debate centers on “tinkering” with the human germline which would result in inheritable changes that could continue forward for generations possibly producing horrific consequences.Human genetic engineering is the ultimate Ying-Yang of contemporary science. On one had we could solve the horrible suffering of millions of people by preventing Sickle Cell Anemia, Tay–Sachs, and Diabetes. We might even be able to rid the human genome of cancer and heart disease. On the other hand we could reduce the diversity of the human race and create a eugenics movement that would make what the nazis did seem like a walk in the park.I highly recommend this book. It may scare you. It may make your head hurt trying to figure out what is the ethically correct road forward. It definitely will inform you that genetic engineering by one or more countries or companies is inevitable. This is definitely a case that forewarned is forearmed."""
230,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59225695-rodney-jehu,4,"“The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born” - indeed. I wore a frown the entire time I read this often deeply unnerving clarion call of a book - not because I did not thoroughly enjoy Jamie Metzl’s book, but rather because my feelings of transhumanistic enthusiasm and (warranted?) neophobia were necessarily in conflict. On one hand, I am inclined to believe that the survival of our progeny (note: I did not say “species”) will continue to be predicated upon our ability to fashion increasingly more effective weapons for our fight against entropy. On the other hand, if Metzl is to be believed, we are at the precipice of an explosion of Cambrian proportions, which will be ignited by our fast approaching competence in genome editing. I wholeheadedly agree with Metzl about the importance of raising public awareness of the issues at hand (everyone should read this book!), not least because I think it is an inexpensive kindness to shout to your neighbors, “brace yourselves!” when not just their minds are about to be blown. I docked a star because of Metzl’s frequent albeit forgivable use of scenarios. While entertaining and doubtless makes such a serious subject more palatable, the discussion of “concrete” scenarios will likely seduce many readers into overestimating the predictability of the future as well as the competence of the prognosticator. At present, we are nowhere near able to enumerate a large enough set of potential outcomes from the genetics revolution, sufficient to inform policies or controls that will help us avoid potholes ahead. This, precisely, is the problem with which we must grapple - and it is a wicked problem. Our present ability to predict the myriad effects of genome editing at the level of the individual is woefully inadequate, to say nothing of our ability to predict broad societal, national or global outcomes. As exceedingly difficult as it is to predict behavior, behavior supervenes on phenotype, and phenotype supervenes on (epi)genotype, and genes, darn them, exhibit pleiotropy. Alas, as Metzl notes, we will likely push forward blindly and with characteristic hubris. Disquietude is visited upon anyone that grasps the full import of the tectonic shifts we will all too soon experience. Reader beware. I am going to be thinking about what I learned in “Hacking Darwin” for a long time, and I am truly grateful to Metzl for writing this book and to the authors of the many bleeding-edge scientific studies cited. I also thank my lucky stars for genes that, at least, make me less susceptible to early-onset glabellar lines."
231,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,5,"An all-encompassing look at the future of gene editing. It covers everything from ancient history, today’s practices, upcoming practices, to possible moral, political, and scientific issues in the coming years. Gene editing is looked at from individual, scientific, governmental, international, and religious viewpoints throughout. War, athletics, space pioneering, individual data protection, and AI are some lenses looked through for speculations on a global scale. The author’s science fiction writing experience shines in a few example scenarios in the book of going to future clinics. One is being put in his character’s shoes and having to face a moral scenario like embryo selection: seeing all of your different potential children on a projected wall, as hundreds of probability statistics, and all of the ethical conflicts that come with it, is very effective at envisioning a similar future reality. While IVF, CRISPR/Cas9, embryo selection, aging, and longevity are thoroughly discussed topics, the author doesn’t lose sight of the importance of keeping our humanity, privacy, and diversity.So much is explored and presented for healthy, proactive discussion. - What if a country has voted on gene editing regulation, but neighboring countries are creating genetically advanced soldiers?- Will empathy and creativity, initially forgotten in the gene editing and AI craze, become increasingly valuable qualities?- Will different races, sexual preferences, and disorders cease to exist?- Will we become more susceptible to natural viruses and germs with a more genetically uniform species?- If you select a male embryo with a genetic proclivity for fast twitch muscles, but he develops an aversion to sports, did you ruin his chances in life? - Will a gap form between enhanced and un-enhanced individuals?""If people have gone ballistic over the environmental, GMO, and abortion debates—if they have manned the barricades and destroyed research centers over genetically modified crops, or attacked abortion clinics and murdered doctors—imagine what they might do when the same diversity of individual, cultural, societal, and governmental views inspires different national approaches to the emerging science of genetically modified people."""
232,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51063190-caden-howlett,5,"In c. 65 AD, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca stated that “…[we] and the things we live amongst are destined to perish.” In rereading Joseph Goldstein’s “Experience of Insight” (1976), I came across this concept eloquently rephrased as a reminder that “…inherent in all things that arise is decay.” Although these are not original ideas of the two men, I thought they served well as representatives of a concern we have had since the beginning of our self-consciousness: mortality.The concept of impermanence is pervasive through all human history, reaching back as far as the earliest surviving work of human literature (the Epic of Gilgamesh). Philosophers, historians, and scientists have always written about death, decay, and mortality as if they were unavoidable universal truths, hence the examples above. Our views on mortality remained constant over thousands of years due to essentially no scientific method and its consequential advances. Only recently has this changed. The unprecedented explosion of technology and scientific ability has profoundly transformed our understanding of life and death and, consequently, we are beginning to question if mortality is indeed a “fundamental truth” of existence. “Hacking Darwin” by Jamie Petzl addresses the current state of genetic engineering. His book makes it crystal clear that biology is no longer what it once was and will continue to change dramatically over the coming decades. Our technology and understanding of human biology are conjoining, and it is possible that within the next 30-50 years we will have the ability to safely alter our genome and greatly prolong our lives. Perhaps more importantly than prolonging our lives, we will be able to selectively choose which genes are present in our children, ultimately allowing us to produce offspring that far exceed us in intelligence, strength, and creativity. Are there limits to this? We will find out. Maybe our period of genetic engineering will only play a minor role between where we are now and the eventual uploading of our consciousness to “the cloud”.I can’t help but wonder what Seneca would think."
233,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16446997-reading,3,"Initially I struggled with this book as the author favoured the techno-utopian perspective, thankfully later chapters brought more balanced alternatives and concerns. Still I do not agree with his conclusions regarding some aspects of genetic engineering and man's apparent omnipresent battle with nature.In presenting humans pursuit of knowledge regarding cancer and domesticing crop's the author seems naive at best and disingenuous at worst when he writes ""...we balanced the costs and benefits and moved forward with imperfect information and a desire to learn and do more."" It's like watching Claude Rains react with feigned shock at witnessing gambling in Rick's, only to moments later surreptitiously receive his winnings. Not including PROFIT as a (if not THE) central motivating factor and therefore criticism, is a critical error in the thinking of all too many techno true believers.The author deserves credit for navigating and studying such a controversial subject that is so fraught with potential for destructive consequences if not applied judiciously. I appreciated observations such as ""Why breed people for superior IQ when we could significantly enhance our society's collective intellectual and problem solving capability by providing real opportunity and better schools to the least advantaged among us?"", and ""Diversity is our species' greatest asset should we chose to embrace it. Reducing our diversity, even with the best of intentions, could become our Achilles' heel."" Of 182Then there are doozies like, ""If we had demanded equal access to smartphones for everyone from the get go, the smartphone industry would never have grown quickly enough to drive down prices to where these phones became accessable to poor people around the world"" huh?! Contradictory and incorrect plus once again it doesn't deal with the inherent problem that capitalism, as presently practiced, perpetuates inequality.Particularly appreciate later chapters 8, 9 as they confront challenges.Author's continuing mantra ""...we are in a perpetual struggle with the cruelty of the natural world."" and his desire ""...to transcend our limited biology and, someday, our time-limited planet."" was impossible to get pay as it colored so many of the author's conclusions and observations."
234,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,3,"Easy-going, broad and largely-nontechnical introduction to human genetic engineering. The first couple of chapters are a tad off-putting as Metzl overindulges in an overt catechism of what is ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, the porous boundaries between disease prevention and enhancement, and the fine lines between eugenics and improvements to well-being. But if you can ignore the polemic that is sprinkled throughout the book there is a fair amount of informative material that is worth knowing. Metzl covers embryo screening, iterative embryo selection, induced pluripotent stem cells, mitochondrial transfer, gene therapy, CRISPR soup (Cas9, Cas12b2, Cas13a…), germline modifications, and life extension research. While he is at it, Metzl also comments on various regulatory regimes (UK, Europe, US, China, Middle East) that accommodate or fail to accommodate various forms of biotechnology. The last couple of chapters switches back to ‘how should we think about this’ mode, but it actually makes for a pretty engaging coda. One of his larger points is that differences in first principles among various nations are irreducible, and while we must strive for a global regulatory framework the challenge of achieving consensus is immense. He suggests that our best hope are categorical negatives which specify blatant red-lines that no biotechnology development should cross. I must admit that a libertarian in me is not unsympathetic to this ‘negative international rights’ idea.His other larger point is that international competition and global interconnectedness are all too likely to blow any good intentions out of the water. For example a country that forbids genetic enhancement and bioengineering out of concern for ‘human dignity’ will be faced with a prospect of being out-competed internationally, won’t be able to prevent its citizens from traveling elsewhere for desired procedures, and will need to forbid genetically-enhanced high-skill immigration from abroad. And if it does, it will end up paying for ‘human dignity’ with a totalitarian regime."

Hacking Darwin gets deep into the potential of genetic engineering and what it could mean for the human race. Hint, things will be much different than they are today. From the book description: “At the dawn of the genetics revolution, our DNA is becoming as readable, writable, and hackable as our information technology. But as humanity starts retooling our own genetic code, the choices we make today will be the difference between realizing breathtaking advances in human well-being and descending into a dangerous and potentially deadly genetic arms race.” Decisions will be made tomorrow that seem impossible today. This book may unsettle some who have rigid beliefs. They may hope to never experience what this book lays out as our likely future. Things like picking your kids traits, upgrading your biology, capabilities, personality, intelligence, strength, curing illnesses/diseases and practically anything you can think of as a genetic trait. No matter how you feel about it, it’s inevitable that things laid out in this book will happen. The author stresses that it’s important to have more discussion about the global implications of humanity’s future when it comes to genetic engineering. He likened it to the 1970 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, where the entire global community recognized both the opportunities and dangers and created standards that major powers agreed on. He states that implications could be just as serious if we don’t get ahead of this emerging field and create global standards that leverage the benefits while limiting the downsides. This is an interesting book that will make you view the world differently. It’s important to understand what’s coming and people who read this will be ahead of most in that regard."

""Hacking Darwin"" discusses the power of genetic technology and its possible future societal and ethical implications. ⁣⁣The book covers numerous topics including gene editing tools such as CRISPR, the future of reproduction and human enhancement, preimplantation genetic screening and editing, mitochondrial replacement therapy, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in gene editing, ageing, etc. An overview of the science and technology of genetic engineering is provided in a very comprehensible way even to readers who do not have a scientific background. ⁣⁣The author elegantly weaves the scientific, social, and ethical perspectives in his analyses and offers balanced views on the positives and negatives based on research. He draws parallels between the future of human enhancement with past and current events, such as the Eugenics movement of the 20th century and the cultural diversity between nations in relation to genetically modified (GM) food and crops. There’s also a very insightful talk about the importance of diversity for human survival. ⁣⁣The author provides future predictions of genetic engineering and possible conversations between parents and doctors about embryo gene editing and enhancement for certain traits. At the moment, there are so many technical and scientific challenges and many undiscovered biological pathways that these future scenarios might seem far-fetched. We might not be there yet, but given the rate at which advancements are being made, this book would definitely make you think deep about these future dilemmas and the need for global regulations.⁣⁣My only one criticism is that discussions sometimes get lengthy and protracted particularly in the final chapters. Nevertheless, I’d definitely recommend this thought-provoking and insightful read.⁣"
237,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38293445-stripe-fisk,4,"This is an interesting book that I think is best read as a way to look at where genetic technology is now, with a more skeptical eye towards where the author thinks it will arrive in the future. Though I agree with some of his predictions, others seem a little outlandish, or at least he is expecting them far too soon.The main thing that irked me about this book is the way that the author will occasionally mention a complication to one of his ideas, explain it, but go on describing his predictions as though that complication doesn’t really matter. For instance, he occasionally references how the human phenotype is affected by much more than just our straight genes due to epigenetic factors (and more!) but not much time is spent on this idea. There’s also a section where, after mentioning how intelligence is hard to define and there are some issues with IQ as a measurement, he marvels at the possibility of a human born with an IQ of 1000. (He also doesn’t acknowledge that there might be some limits to how far we can tweak our genome.) These moments make it a little hard to take some of his other predictions and claims seriously.Still, as I said, the book does a good job in outlining some of the current science on genetic engineering and outlines them in a straightforward but entertaining way. The chapters on aging and the future of fertility clinics were particularly engaging, though admittedly I found my eyes glazing over at his discussion of political movements in the last couple of chapter. That could just be my own bias, though.I’d definitely recommend this book for anybody interested in our progress toward genetic information, as long as they’re ready to take some predictions with a grain of salt."

Metzl has written an engaging, fascinating and thought-provoking book that focuses on the fast approaching and inevitable (and exiting) genetic revolution, with clear explanations of the tools involved and the consequences of their use. The writing is clear, explanations accurate and not too technical for the general interested reader.This book covers a vast array of topics that fall under the genetic engineering umbrella. He starts off with the history of genetic research, IVF, genetic screening; and continues with the relationship between genetics, diseases, traits, the environment; AI tools to process complex genetic patters; the pros and cons of the genetic engineering tools; ""designer babies""; stem-cell research; mitochondrial disease; multiple donar babies; gene-editing tools such as CRISPR; gene-therapy; safety issues and challenges to the current technology; chimeras; organ transplants; synthetic biology; aging; the ethics and responsibility of using genetic engineering tool; our relationship with nature; GMOs; the arms race of the human race; and finaly, the furture of humanity.Metzl states that his intent is to inform the public about the genetic revolution so that we can ""make the smartest collective decisions about our war forward... to understand what is happening and what's at stake."" Genetic entineering is a tool. The genetic revolution has the potential to improve lives or do great harm. The future of humanity depends on how we use it. "

Overall, it was an incredibly interesting, insightful, thought-provoking, and well-researched book. There was a lot of information and questions to absorb and think about. As a high school student who is interested in genetics/genetic engineering, Hacking Darwin detailed perspectives, history, and knowledge previously unknown to me and also provided me with countless sources for further reading. Throughout the book, Metzl connects the future ethical, political, and social ramifications of our choices to current issues and topics (like abortion) that made his argument more relatable and heightened the sense of urgency of the situation at hand.Jamie Metzl ultimately tries to create conversation and collaboration over a topic that we cannot afford to ignore. It informs without being overly technical, making it understandable and discussable for the general public. This book is a great thought-provoker for everyday readers and for anyone who wants to learn more about genetic engineering, especially the ethical dilemmas surrounding it. I would recommend it to anyone, especially high school and college students and teachers because it is so important for the future of our species, but also because it brings up important discussions in many subjects. Among these are biology, medicine, ethics, philosophy, politics, socioeconomics, and law. It’s a fantastic book full of citations and contemplation.(It’s also an excellent resource for research papers.)"

250,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19258748-feng-ouyang,4,"The topic of this book is how we should deal with the future of manipulating human genes before or after birth to achieve various goals such as better health, more talent, and more desirable personality traits. The first part is an overview of the history and current status with a concise and accessible explanation of genetic science. It is not the best popular science book on the subject. However, it successfully sets the stage for the subsequent discussion. The author points out that currently, with IVF and in some other circumstances, people can screen the potential embryos based on their genes to avoid having children with severe inherited diseases. We are also advancing the science of connecting genes with health factors and personal traits, although we are still at the beginning of such exploration and can only understand the cases involving a small number of genes. At the same time, gene editing techniques have developed quickly, giving us powerful tools to delete and add genes in our DNA.The second part is a discussion on whether we should allow for further manipulation of genes beyond screening and even beyond health reasons. The author argues that such future manipulation is inevitable for three reasons. First, it is a natural continuation of what we do today. People have been manipulating the genes of animals and plants for tens of thousands of years through passive selection in domestication, active cross-breeding, and genetic engineering. We have also accepted the genetic screening of embryos. Therefore, genetic manipulation is not a domain of God. There is no quantum leap in ethics if we go forward with more deliberate and more invasive genetic manipulation of human genes.Second, it is challenging to maintain the “genetic purity” anyway. As long as we cannot stop all countries from human genetic modification, there will be genetically modified humans entering our gene pool and spreading across the world. Therefore, there is no point in resisting the trend.Third, genetic technologies are a power field of international competition, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Therefore, unilaterally banning genetic manipulation hurts a country.Based on these arguments, the author thinks the best way forward is having international cooperation in setting up regulation and monitoring and drawing a clear boundary on the practices. This part of the book is compelling. However, the arguments do not have much direct factorial support. The author relies on analogies and logical extensions to develop his thesis. For example, the book spent much space recounting Chinese history from Mao’s poor society to the second-largest economy in the world. It then describes China’s competitiveness and ambition in various technical areas. This information is relevant to show that we must address the possibility that China will become a leading genetic editing innovator, and that could impact our national interest. However, to convey such a point, the historical narrative can be significantly simplified and compressed. In fact, such a statement is almost self-evident with today’s media reporting.Lastly, the book offers a short discussion about the danger of human genetic modification. Ill-minded people can use it as a powerful weapon not only against their enemies but against humanity itself. The author thus calls again for international cooperation to ban certain practices, just as how we dealt with nuclear prefoliation. Overall, the book raised an interesting topic and provided much food for thought. However, the examination of the subject is incomplete. Two important considerations are missing in the book.First, we need to delve into the philosophy and ethical contemplations. For example, a tenant of Western ethics is that all men are created equal. Therefore, they have equal rights. Any social policy should not discriminate against people with certain inherited traits, because these traits are not under our control and are considered as random. However, if we can “engineer” superb member of the society, should they have a different set of rights? If we engineer people for a specific purpose such as sport, does that mean they are not intended to participate in other social activities such as governing? If others determine people’s traits before their birth, where does free will stand? These questions show that the introduction of human genetic engineering beyond narrow health concerns will have a profound impact on society and culture. It is not an incremental technology advance, as the author portraits.Second, human genetic engineering poses unique and grave danger comparing to other technologies. One reason is we still have a very poor understanding of genetic science. For example, we may know a gene is responsible for (or associated with) a particular disease or trait. But the same gene may play other roles in physiology that we don’t know about. The interactions of genes are even more complex. Therefore, the consequence of gene editing cannot be predicted with high accuracy and confidence. The other reason is that the result of gene editing is irreversible. All gene editing results will be in the human gene pool forever. One may argue that gene mutation has been operating since the beginning, and gene editing is the same. However, the later operates at a much, much higher speed, and we cannot subject all results to natural selection. Therefore, even if we can control the malicious use of gene editing techniques as the author advocates, gene editing can still threaten human wellbeing or even existence. This book broaches an essential topic that most of us managed to avoid so far. It also shows that our contemplation is just beginning. The book offers more questions than answers, which is probably the very intention of the author."
251,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9142626-deepak-rao,4,"A good book that could very well have been half the size and still served the purpose. Genetic engineering and bio-hacking are transformative technologies which could change the face of our civilization. Genetic engineering has the potential to make our descendants better(or different) than us, by a wide margin. The Homo Deus , envisioned by Yuval Harari, will be built on the foundations of genetic engineering. But this technology may cause large scale disruptions in society and lead to a large number of ethical and other problems. As we debate over the costs and benfits of this technology, one thing is certain that the decisions we take today to regulate and direct research in genetic engineering will significantly impact the trajectory of our future development."
252,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10496704-robert-kenny,2,"I could have written this book myself, and I have no formal background in genetic engineering. I suppose that’s why I was disappointed. I was hoping to learn more about the science. Instead, the author spends nearly all of his time describing the very obvious ways in which genetic engineering may change our society in the future: longer lives, fewer inherited diseases, increased use of in vitro fertilization, and babies genetically designed by their parents. None of these are new concepts, and all have been explored very thoroughly in science fiction and discussions about the ethics of genetic engineering. We’ve been talking about these things for decades. So why write a new book and simply rehash it all? What’s the point of reading non-fiction and not learning anything new?"
253,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31958906-dhyey-desai,2,"Some of the implications of genetic engineering are pretty scary and unregulated states like China run the risk of pushing the technology to the worst outcome. If the author's aim is to raise alarm and encourage efforts to regulate the technology, the author succeeds. The book lacks on the details of the technology and weighs heavier on thought experiments."
254,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3827299-foggygirl,4,A very interesting read about the possible hurdles and problems that will arise with the future use of human genetic engineering. And they will definitely arise because we humans won't be able to stop ourselves. 
255,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6888651-jenn-adams,2,Reading as many Goodreads Choice Nominees as I can.Not excited to give a harsh rating for a book that I'm sure would be great for many people. But I personally didn't get a lot from it. It felt very surface level and I don't feel like I learned anything.
256,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103056314-herta-elina-jansone,4,"Read this book for my university's Biology book club. Our general consensus was that the first half of the book is rather boring for those who know biology at an undergraduate level, and some comparisons are just ""bullshit"", as said by a professor. The skin color gradient is not comparable by mutations in petal colors in lilies and petunias, no matter how drastic the color change is. Also, comparing gene editing to nuclear energy because of how it was ""stopped before it could do any harm"" - wrong, nuclear energy caused world-changing harm even before it was employed for energy generation. Additionally, nuclear energy requires large funding and the attention of governments. Meanwhile, genetic engineering can be done in rogue mode, as was stated in the book. And nobody, scientist or gardener, has a good enough understanding of the big picture of genome editing yet. Bioterrorism is unequivocally a major global risk, don't get me wrong. Maybe AI development would be a much better comparison to the progress in genetic research. This is an very anthropocentric book. It would have been better to state this early on rather than after rambling about making the essence of your own children ""readable, writeable, hackable"" for 4-5 chapters. Despite this annoying issue, some good points are made, especially near the end of the book when Metzl finally puts his political science knowledge into use when describing trend-setters and their influence on the future course of Biotechnology research and applications, which blends well into the general scene of global politics.While Europe and the USA are bickering about whether any research on genome manipulation is a sensible thing to do, Chinese companies are acquiring Biotech companies in the bickering regions and carry out research, create genetic databases of whole populations and move towards selecting the best individuals for certain purposes to try to be on top of the world in Bioengineering, intelligence and perhaps even sports (although, in some disciplines, African and some Scandinavians might have better genetics to start with, but it'll become irrelevant once they find something beyond the slow and faulty CRISPR-Cas machinery to apply in the future modifications of embryos).According to Metzl in this book, everything eventually boils down to genetics, just give scientists time to decipher the currently still unknown factors in aging, intelligence, emotional intelligence, extra-/introversion etc. Nurture isn't left out entirely but it's as important in this conversation as a footnote that states that the author is just aware that it exists, and that's it.Important questions are nonetheless raised:- Why should we try to engineer people with specific traits when such people already exist but may be considered worthless in whatever field they have been forced into?- Is it really better to create people that are predisposed towards better skills instead of improving the resources for teaching and supporting the society?- With people eventually stepping into the era of engineering their progeny as they see fit, what remains of the engineered person's individuality, opinion and ability to choose their own path in life? - What should be the standard of genetic engineering as a whole? Who should be responsible for setting the standard, and how should it be set?Discussion of the book gives a lot more food for thought than the book itself. Maybe that's what Metzl tries to achieve with this book - to turn us into ""critical catalysts of this dialogue"". Only through education and discussion can we come closer to achieving consensus about the ultimate purpose and application of this emerging technology."
257,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74862840-cary-giese,5,"What are the implications of moving from natural selection as the way humans evolve to human control of that evolution? That is the question asked by the author? Little debate (though some) will occur as science uses genetics to cure disease and prevents hereditary transfer of certain diseases to later generations! But, with mass collection of the human races’ genetics and AI’s ability to pattern that data, the capabilities to select desirable(?) traits to the human race will become possible. What policies will be possible to prevent some civilization to try to use that to capitalize on that capability to advantage themselves? Some policy such as the nuclear proliferation treaty will probably be required. The question is: will some sub-national group try to misuse the technology! Access to large data bases and AI will enable highly trained individual(s) to take steps on their own. How will that capability be policed is another question. The human race evolved, so far, by genetic mixing genes randomly. Genetic errors or good fortune created unfortunate diseases and human genius.As a race we have learned through conflict and resolution to progress, though progress has been uneven. The question is: will we be overcome by the incredible pace of coming change? Will progress continue?It will require wise leadership to take advantage of the wondrous possibilities, while avoiding horrendous risk!A must read for our leaders! The changes will be subtle and seen as generally beneficial by the general public. Nuclear Non-proliferation was easier because destruction by those bombs in Japan demonstrated the existential risk.So leaders are going to have to reach treaties and propose regulations and explain the reasons to the public!!! To do that they will have to become students of our impending rapidly changing future!The author recommends a global dialogue to include top scientist, religious leaders, trusted thinkers to conceive and propose the essential questions that require exploration.Metzl’s proposed questions as follows:1. What can be done to ensure the broadest possible access to the health and well-being benefits of genetic technologies?2. Should there be a limit on the application of genetic technologies to treat or eliminate disease? If so, what should they be? 3. Should people have full access to information about their own and their potential children’s genetic makeup or should this access be limited? If limited, what should the restrictions be and why? 4. Should parents be allowed unlimited freedom to select from among their natural embryos during in vitro fertilization? If not, on what basis should limitations be set? Should parents be allowed to select embryos on non-disease-related traits, like height, projected IQ, personality style, etc.?5. If it is proven safe, should precision gene editing be used to eliminate genetic diseases in adult sex cells and pre-implanted embryos in a manner that would be passed to future generations?6. Do we need a global framework to help prevent the worst abuses of human genetic engineering? 7. What long-term institutions do we need to foster an inclusive global dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering that optimizes the benefits of those technologies and minimizes potential harms? 8. What more can be done to help ensure the genetic revolution helps enhance all of our humanity, and how can each of us be better engaged in the process?I recommend reading this book so you are prepared to participate fully in you and your progeny’s future!"

Thankfully, that is precisely what this book is. While I don't really like that all of the books on this subject sound like over-enthusiastic episode titles for some sci-fi series, the message is important; if we are going to move forward as a country and species with the use of this new technology then the public has to be informed to a degree that is currently unimaginable. This book goes a long way toward bridging the gulf between the incredible advances being made right now at unthinkably exponential rates and the intellectual stagnation of the general populace's understanding over the past few decades. Unfortunately, this discussion and the possibility for national advancement are left to intrepid scientists making cases before governmental bodies consisting entirely of lawyers and businessmen who are themselves beholden to the big money of unlettered, reductionist, simpleton-fostering religious organizations who love to talk endlessly about the need for caution in, ""playing god,"" yet remain blissfully ignorant of the entirety of human biomedical science and think it appropriate to quote Bronze-Age idiocy as a rebuttal to the latest developments in the sciences. That, or the epithet of, ""eugenics,"" is just thrown in as Hitler is to every Twitter conversation about anything. Jamie Metzl is very thorough when it comes to the areas where we do have legitimate cause for concern, and others where a certain naturalistic fallacy continues to rot the minds of otherwise sensible people. He does this with an amusing vignette of a visit to a clinic that progressively gets further and further advanced, allowing him to make choices regarding his future offspring that were unimaginable even a few years before when conceiving his previous children. He also deftly handles the competitive atmosphere that will continue to develop among the leading nations harnessing this technology. His sports reference in this section is particularly apt as given just how much time, money, and science is invested in athletic performance for the bizarrely useless purpose of nationalistic chest-beating at the Olympics every two years, the notion of having a populace that, due to the government's grasp and regulatory ability over genetic modification, is biologically more advanced in terms of resistance to disease/aging and further developed for intellect and physical prowess is one that policy-makers need to understand now. The final chapter is full of genuine policy recommendations and recommendations to the scientific community to achieve the type of widespread education I mentioned earlier. Most of these suggestions make total sense, are genuinely unthinkable in a country as stupid as 2020 USA, and require an intellectual investment on the part of the individual that is hard to fathom. However, that so many books are being written for the layperson about this area of science and public policy gives hope that more well-read future leaders might be able to steer the conversation to more rational levels. One can dream..."
259,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"I love science and books about science. I grew up believing that science would lead the way forward to a more peaceful, prosperous, and humanitarian world. Much like flying cars, electricity too cheap to meter, and the cure for the common cold, this future has not materialized in my lifetime.Messing with genes, whether in plants or animals, has always been a part of science that scared me. Nature is incrediblely complex and interactive and it wouldn’t take much to mess up the balance. The Butterfly Effect speaks to the sensitive interdependence of life on Earth. I’m writing this during the Covid-19 outbreak which shows exactly how vulnerable the human race is to even the smallest of changes.My fear and concern about genetic engineering caused me to pick-up and put back Hacking Darwin: Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity by Jamie Metzl several times. I’m glad that I finally decided to read it.Metzl has written an extremely informative, scientific book that is easy to read. He definitely has a personal opinion about how genetic engineering should proceed. I’m sure that the Non-GMO Project, Greenpeace, and others would differ greatly but I think Metzl ties to present a little of “the other side” in his book.Reading Hacking Darwin has given me a lot of new and useful information. I am no less afraid of genetic engineering than I was before but I now feel that my fears have a factual foundation. That said, I definitely also see Metzl’s argument that genetic “tinkering” can have a positive side. Humans have been engaging in genetic engineering for tens of thousands of years. We have bred a lowly grass into maize, a staple food for millions of people. We have bred rice and wheat so that they can grow in a much wider environment and produce significantly more edible food. These agricultural advancements have kept millions of people from starvation.So how is corn domestication and cultivation in the field any different that reorganizing the corn gene in the lab to resist insects, droughts, and increased global temperatures? For me, the heart of the debate is that genetic “tinkering” of crops provides much faster and sweeping changes and, therefore, could produce devastating results before we even become aware of what we have done. With human embryos the debate centers on “tinkering” with the human germline which would result in inheritable changes that could continue forward for generations possibly producing horrific consequences.Human genetic engineering is the ultimate Ying-Yang of contemporary science. On one had we could solve the horrible suffering of millions of people by preventing Sickle Cell Anemia, Tay–Sachs, and Diabetes. We might even be able to rid the human genome of cancer and heart disease. On the other hand we could reduce the diversity of the human race and create a eugenics movement that would make what the nazis did seem like a walk in the park.I highly recommend this book. It may scare you. It may make your head hurt trying to figure out what is the ethically correct road forward. It definitely will inform you that genetic engineering by one or more countries or companies is inevitable. This is definitely a case that forewarned is forearmed."""
260,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59225695-rodney-jehu,4,"“The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born” - indeed. I wore a frown the entire time I read this often deeply unnerving clarion call of a book - not because I did not thoroughly enjoy Jamie Metzl’s book, but rather because my feelings of transhumanistic enthusiasm and (warranted?) neophobia were necessarily in conflict. On one hand, I am inclined to believe that the survival of our progeny (note: I did not say “species”) will continue to be predicated upon our ability to fashion increasingly more effective weapons for our fight against entropy. On the other hand, if Metzl is to be believed, we are at the precipice of an explosion of Cambrian proportions, which will be ignited by our fast approaching competence in genome editing. I wholeheadedly agree with Metzl about the importance of raising public awareness of the issues at hand (everyone should read this book!), not least because I think it is an inexpensive kindness to shout to your neighbors, “brace yourselves!” when not just their minds are about to be blown. I docked a star because of Metzl’s frequent albeit forgivable use of scenarios. While entertaining and doubtless makes such a serious subject more palatable, the discussion of “concrete” scenarios will likely seduce many readers into overestimating the predictability of the future as well as the competence of the prognosticator. At present, we are nowhere near able to enumerate a large enough set of potential outcomes from the genetics revolution, sufficient to inform policies or controls that will help us avoid potholes ahead. This, precisely, is the problem with which we must grapple - and it is a wicked problem. Our present ability to predict the myriad effects of genome editing at the level of the individual is woefully inadequate, to say nothing of our ability to predict broad societal, national or global outcomes. As exceedingly difficult as it is to predict behavior, behavior supervenes on phenotype, and phenotype supervenes on (epi)genotype, and genes, darn them, exhibit pleiotropy. Alas, as Metzl notes, we will likely push forward blindly and with characteristic hubris. Disquietude is visited upon anyone that grasps the full import of the tectonic shifts we will all too soon experience. Reader beware. I am going to be thinking about what I learned in “Hacking Darwin” for a long time, and I am truly grateful to Metzl for writing this book and to the authors of the many bleeding-edge scientific studies cited. I also thank my lucky stars for genes that, at least, make me less susceptible to early-onset glabellar lines."

It covers everything from ancient history, today’s practices, upcoming practices, to possible moral, political, and scientific issues in the coming years. Gene editing is looked at from individual, scientific, governmental, international, and religious viewpoints throughout. War, athletics, space pioneering, individual data protection, and AI are some lenses looked through for speculations on a global scale. The author’s science fiction writing experience shines in a few example scenarios in the book of going to future clinics. One is being put in his character’s shoes and having to face a moral scenario like embryo selection: seeing all of your different potential children on a projected wall, as hundreds of probability statistics, and all of the ethical conflicts that come with it, is very effective at envisioning a similar future reality. While IVF, CRISPR/Cas9, embryo selection, aging, and longevity are thoroughly discussed topics, the author doesn’t lose sight of the importance of keeping our humanity, privacy, and diversity.So much is explored and presented for healthy, proactive discussion. - What if a country has voted on gene editing regulation, but neighboring countries are creating genetically advanced soldiers?- Will empathy and creativity, initially forgotten in the gene editing and AI craze, become increasingly valuable qualities?- Will different races, sexual preferences, and disorders cease to exist?- Will we become more susceptible to natural viruses and germs with a more genetically uniform species?- If you select a male embryo with a genetic proclivity for fast twitch muscles, but he develops an aversion to sports, did you ruin his chances in life? - Will a gap form between enhanced and un-enhanced individuals?""If people have gone ballistic over the environmental, GMO, and abortion debates—if they have manned the barricades and destroyed research centers over genetically modified crops, or attacked abortion clinics and murdered doctors—imagine what they might do when the same diversity of individual, cultural, societal, and governmental views inspires different national approaches to the emerging science of genetically modified people."""
262,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51063190-caden-howlett,5,"In c. 65 AD, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca stated that “…[we] and the things we live amongst are destined to perish.” In rereading Joseph Goldstein’s “Experience of Insight” (1976), I came across this concept eloquently rephrased as a reminder that “…inherent in all things that arise is decay.” Although these are not original ideas of the two men, I thought they served well as representatives of a concern we have had since the beginning of our self-consciousness: mortality.The concept of impermanence is pervasive through all human history, reaching back as far as the earliest surviving work of human literature (the Epic of Gilgamesh). Philosophers, historians, and scientists have always written about death, decay, and mortality as if they were unavoidable universal truths, hence the examples above. Our views on mortality remained constant over thousands of years due to essentially no scientific method and its consequential advances. Only recently has this changed. The unprecedented explosion of technology and scientific ability has profoundly transformed our understanding of life and death and, consequently, we are beginning to question if mortality is indeed a “fundamental truth” of existence. “Hacking Darwin” by Jamie Petzl addresses the current state of genetic engineering. His book makes it crystal clear that biology is no longer what it once was and will continue to change dramatically over the coming decades. Our technology and understanding of human biology are conjoining, and it is possible that within the next 30-50 years we will have the ability to safely alter our genome and greatly prolong our lives. Perhaps more importantly than prolonging our lives, we will be able to selectively choose which genes are present in our children, ultimately allowing us to produce offspring that far exceed us in intelligence, strength, and creativity. Are there limits to this? We will find out. Maybe our period of genetic engineering will only play a minor role between where we are now and the eventual uploading of our consciousness to “the cloud”.I can’t help but wonder what Seneca would think."
263,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16446997-reading,3,"Initially I struggled with this book as the author favoured the techno-utopian perspective, thankfully later chapters brought more balanced alternatives and concerns. Still I do not agree with his conclusions regarding some aspects of genetic engineering and man's apparent omnipresent battle with nature.In presenting humans pursuit of knowledge regarding cancer and domesticing crop's the author seems naive at best and disingenuous at worst when he writes ""...we balanced the costs and benefits and moved forward with imperfect information and a desire to learn and do more."" It's like watching Claude Rains react with feigned shock at witnessing gambling in Rick's, only to moments later surreptitiously receive his winnings. Not including PROFIT as a (if not THE) central motivating factor and therefore criticism, is a critical error in the thinking of all too many techno true believers.The author deserves credit for navigating and studying such a controversial subject that is so fraught with potential for destructive consequences if not applied judiciously. I appreciated observations such as ""Why breed people for superior IQ when we could significantly enhance our society's collective intellectual and problem solving capability by providing real opportunity and better schools to the least advantaged among us?"", and ""Diversity is our species' greatest asset should we chose to embrace it. Reducing our diversity, even with the best of intentions, could become our Achilles' heel."" Of 182Then there are doozies like, ""If we had demanded equal access to smartphones for everyone from the get go, the smartphone industry would never have grown quickly enough to drive down prices to where these phones became accessable to poor people around the world"" huh?! Contradictory and incorrect plus once again it doesn't deal with the inherent problem that capitalism, as presently practiced, perpetuates inequality.Particularly appreciate later chapters 8, 9 as they confront challenges.Author's continuing mantra ""...we are in a perpetual struggle with the cruelty of the natural world."" and his desire ""...to transcend our limited biology and, someday, our time-limited planet."" was impossible to get pay as it colored so many of the author's conclusions and observations."
264,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,3,"Easy-going, broad and largely-nontechnical introduction to human genetic engineering. The first couple of chapters are a tad off-putting as Metzl overindulges in an overt catechism of what is ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, the porous boundaries between disease prevention and enhancement, and the fine lines between eugenics and improvements to well-being. But if you can ignore the polemic that is sprinkled throughout the book there is a fair amount of informative material that is worth knowing. Metzl covers embryo screening, iterative embryo selection, induced pluripotent stem cells, mitochondrial transfer, gene therapy, CRISPR soup (Cas9, Cas12b2, Cas13a…), germline modifications, and life extension research. While he is at it, Metzl also comments on various regulatory regimes (UK, Europe, US, China, Middle East) that accommodate or fail to accommodate various forms of biotechnology. The last couple of chapters switches back to ‘how should we think about this’ mode, but it actually makes for a pretty engaging coda. One of his larger points is that differences in first principles among various nations are irreducible, and while we must strive for a global regulatory framework the challenge of achieving consensus is immense. He suggests that our best hope are categorical negatives which specify blatant red-lines that no biotechnology development should cross. I must admit that a libertarian in me is not unsympathetic to this ‘negative international rights’ idea.His other larger point is that international competition and global interconnectedness are all too likely to blow any good intentions out of the water. For example a country that forbids genetic enhancement and bioengineering out of concern for ‘human dignity’ will be faced with a prospect of being out-competed internationally, won’t be able to prevent its citizens from traveling elsewhere for desired procedures, and will need to forbid genetically-enhanced high-skill immigration from abroad. And if it does, it will end up paying for ‘human dignity’ with a totalitarian regime."

Hacking Darwin gets deep into the potential of genetic engineering and what it could mean for the human race. Hint, things will be much different than they are today. From the book description: “At the dawn of the genetics revolution, our DNA is becoming as readable, writable, and hackable as our information technology. But as humanity starts retooling our own genetic code, the choices we make today will be the difference between realizing breathtaking advances in human well-being and descending into a dangerous and potentially deadly genetic arms race.” Decisions will be made tomorrow that seem impossible today. This book may unsettle some who have rigid beliefs. They may hope to never experience what this book lays out as our likely future. Things like picking your kids traits, upgrading your biology, capabilities, personality, intelligence, strength, curing illnesses/diseases and practically anything you can think of as a genetic trait. No matter how you feel about it, it’s inevitable that things laid out in this book will happen. The author stresses that it’s important to have more discussion about the global implications of humanity’s future when it comes to genetic engineering. He likened it to the 1970 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, where the entire global community recognized both the opportunities and dangers and created standards that major powers agreed on. He states that implications could be just as serious if we don’t get ahead of this emerging field and create global standards that leverage the benefits while limiting the downsides. This is an interesting book that will make you view the world differently. It’s important to understand what’s coming and people who read this will be ahead of most in that regard."

""Hacking Darwin"" discusses the power of genetic technology and its possible future societal and ethical implications. ⁣⁣The book covers numerous topics including gene editing tools such as CRISPR, the future of reproduction and human enhancement, preimplantation genetic screening and editing, mitochondrial replacement therapy, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in gene editing, ageing, etc. An overview of the science and technology of genetic engineering is provided in a very comprehensible way even to readers who do not have a scientific background. ⁣⁣The author elegantly weaves the scientific, social, and ethical perspectives in his analyses and offers balanced views on the positives and negatives based on research. He draws parallels between the future of human enhancement with past and current events, such as the Eugenics movement of the 20th century and the cultural diversity between nations in relation to genetically modified (GM) food and crops. There’s also a very insightful talk about the importance of diversity for human survival. ⁣⁣The author provides future predictions of genetic engineering and possible conversations between parents and doctors about embryo gene editing and enhancement for certain traits. At the moment, there are so many technical and scientific challenges and many undiscovered biological pathways that these future scenarios might seem far-fetched. We might not be there yet, but given the rate at which advancements are being made, this book would definitely make you think deep about these future dilemmas and the need for global regulations.⁣⁣My only one criticism is that discussions sometimes get lengthy and protracted particularly in the final chapters. Nevertheless, I’d definitely recommend this thought-provoking and insightful read.⁣"
267,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38293445-stripe-fisk,4,"This is an interesting book that I think is best read as a way to look at where genetic technology is now, with a more skeptical eye towards where the author thinks it will arrive in the future. Though I agree with some of his predictions, others seem a little outlandish, or at least he is expecting them far too soon.The main thing that irked me about this book is the way that the author will occasionally mention a complication to one of his ideas, explain it, but go on describing his predictions as though that complication doesn’t really matter. For instance, he occasionally references how the human phenotype is affected by much more than just our straight genes due to epigenetic factors (and more!) but not much time is spent on this idea. There’s also a section where, after mentioning how intelligence is hard to define and there are some issues with IQ as a measurement, he marvels at the possibility of a human born with an IQ of 1000. (He also doesn’t acknowledge that there might be some limits to how far we can tweak our genome.) These moments make it a little hard to take some of his other predictions and claims seriously.Still, as I said, the book does a good job in outlining some of the current science on genetic engineering and outlines them in a straightforward but entertaining way. The chapters on aging and the future of fertility clinics were particularly engaging, though admittedly I found my eyes glazing over at his discussion of political movements in the last couple of chapter. That could just be my own bias, though.I’d definitely recommend this book for anybody interested in our progress toward genetic information, as long as they’re ready to take some predictions with a grain of salt."
268,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,5,"Hacking Darwin takes a look at the current status of genetic engineering, as well as the possible and probable future uses of these tools, ethics, and the future of humanity. Metzl has written an engaging, fascinating and thought-provoking book that focuses on the fast approaching and inevitable (and exiting) genetic revolution, with clear explanations of the tools involved and the consequences of their use. The writing is clear, explanations accurate and not too technical for the general interested reader.This book covers a vast array of topics that fall under the genetic engineering umbrella. He starts off with the history of genetic research, IVF, genetic screening; and continues with the relationship between genetics, diseases, traits, the environment; AI tools to process complex genetic patters; the pros and cons of the genetic engineering tools; ""designer babies""; stem-cell research; mitochondrial disease; multiple donar babies; gene-editing tools such as CRISPR; gene-therapy; safety issues and challenges to the current technology; chimeras; organ transplants; synthetic biology; aging; the ethics and responsibility of using genetic engineering tool; our relationship with nature; GMOs; the arms race of the human race; and finaly, the furture of humanity.Metzl states that his intent is to inform the public about the genetic revolution so that we can ""make the smartest collective decisions about our war forward... to understand what is happening and what's at stake."" Genetic entineering is a tool. The genetic revolution has the potential to improve lives or do great harm. The future of humanity depends on how we use it. "
269,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99031173-joan-hibbard,5,"Hacking Darwin discusses the morally charged topic of genetic engineering while making it easily understandable to the general public. Overall, it was an incredibly interesting, insightful, thought-provoking, and well-researched book. There was a lot of information and questions to absorb and think about. As a high school student who is interested in genetics/genetic engineering, Hacking Darwin detailed perspectives, history, and knowledge previously unknown to me and also provided me with countless sources for further reading. Throughout the book, Metzl connects the future ethical, political, and social ramifications of our choices to current issues and topics (like abortion) that made his argument more relatable and heightened the sense of urgency of the situation at hand.Jamie Metzl ultimately tries to create conversation and collaboration over a topic that we cannot afford to ignore. It informs without being overly technical, making it understandable and discussable for the general public. This book is a great thought-provoker for everyday readers and for anyone who wants to learn more about genetic engineering, especially the ethical dilemmas surrounding it. I would recommend it to anyone, especially high school and college students and teachers because it is so important for the future of our species, but also because it brings up important discussions in many subjects. Among these are biology, medicine, ethics, philosophy, politics, socioeconomics, and law. It’s a fantastic book full of citations and contemplation.(It’s also an excellent resource for research papers.)"

This 'genetic enhancement' , through gene splicing by CASPER-CAS9, of human may create a unbridgeable chasm between those who can afford genetic enhancement and those who can't. There may be cold war scenario in creating genetically enhance soldiers who can tolerate any extreme weather or returning of 'eugenic' movement which created Nazi era.

I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in the topic.Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book via Netgalley for review purposes."
280,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19258748-feng-ouyang,4,"The topic of this book is how we should deal with the future of manipulating human genes before or after birth to achieve various goals such as better health, more talent, and more desirable personality traits. The first part is an overview of the history and current status with a concise and accessible explanation of genetic science. It is not the best popular science book on the subject. However, it successfully sets the stage for the subsequent discussion. The author points out that currently, with IVF and in some other circumstances, people can screen the potential embryos based on their genes to avoid having children with severe inherited diseases. We are also advancing the science of connecting genes with health factors and personal traits, although we are still at the beginning of such exploration and can only understand the cases involving a small number of genes. At the same time, gene editing techniques have developed quickly, giving us powerful tools to delete and add genes in our DNA.The second part is a discussion on whether we should allow for further manipulation of genes beyond screening and even beyond health reasons. The author argues that such future manipulation is inevitable for three reasons. First, it is a natural continuation of what we do today. People have been manipulating the genes of animals and plants for tens of thousands of years through passive selection in domestication, active cross-breeding, and genetic engineering. We have also accepted the genetic screening of embryos. Therefore, genetic manipulation is not a domain of God. There is no quantum leap in ethics if we go forward with more deliberate and more invasive genetic manipulation of human genes.Second, it is challenging to maintain the “genetic purity” anyway. As long as we cannot stop all countries from human genetic modification, there will be genetically modified humans entering our gene pool and spreading across the world. Therefore, there is no point in resisting the trend.Third, genetic technologies are a power field of international competition, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Therefore, unilaterally banning genetic manipulation hurts a country.Based on these arguments, the author thinks the best way forward is having international cooperation in setting up regulation and monitoring and drawing a clear boundary on the practices. This part of the book is compelling. However, the arguments do not have much direct factorial support. The author relies on analogies and logical extensions to develop his thesis. For example, the book spent much space recounting Chinese history from Mao’s poor society to the second-largest economy in the world. It then describes China’s competitiveness and ambition in various technical areas. This information is relevant to show that we must address the possibility that China will become a leading genetic editing innovator, and that could impact our national interest. However, to convey such a point, the historical narrative can be significantly simplified and compressed. In fact, such a statement is almost self-evident with today’s media reporting.Lastly, the book offers a short discussion about the danger of human genetic modification. Ill-minded people can use it as a powerful weapon not only against their enemies but against humanity itself. The author thus calls again for international cooperation to ban certain practices, just as how we dealt with nuclear prefoliation. Overall, the book raised an interesting topic and provided much food for thought. However, the examination of the subject is incomplete. Two important considerations are missing in the book.First, we need to delve into the philosophy and ethical contemplations. For example, a tenant of Western ethics is that all men are created equal. Therefore, they have equal rights. Any social policy should not discriminate against people with certain inherited traits, because these traits are not under our control and are considered as random. However, if we can “engineer” superb member of the society, should they have a different set of rights? If we engineer people for a specific purpose such as sport, does that mean they are not intended to participate in other social activities such as governing? If others determine people’s traits before their birth, where does free will stand? These questions show that the introduction of human genetic engineering beyond narrow health concerns will have a profound impact on society and culture. It is not an incremental technology advance, as the author portraits.Second, human genetic engineering poses unique and grave danger comparing to other technologies. One reason is we still have a very poor understanding of genetic science. For example, we may know a gene is responsible for (or associated with) a particular disease or trait. But the same gene may play other roles in physiology that we don’t know about. The interactions of genes are even more complex. Therefore, the consequence of gene editing cannot be predicted with high accuracy and confidence. The other reason is that the result of gene editing is irreversible. All gene editing results will be in the human gene pool forever. One may argue that gene mutation has been operating since the beginning, and gene editing is the same. However, the later operates at a much, much higher speed, and we cannot subject all results to natural selection. Therefore, even if we can control the malicious use of gene editing techniques as the author advocates, gene editing can still threaten human wellbeing or even existence. This book broaches an essential topic that most of us managed to avoid so far. It also shows that our contemplation is just beginning. The book offers more questions than answers, which is probably the very intention of the author."
281,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9142626-deepak-rao,4,"A good book that could very well have been half the size and still served the purpose. Genetic engineering and bio-hacking are transformative technologies which could change the face of our civilization. Genetic engineering has the potential to make our descendants better(or different) than us, by a wide margin. The Homo Deus , envisioned by Yuval Harari, will be built on the foundations of genetic engineering. But this technology may cause large scale disruptions in society and lead to a large number of ethical and other problems. As we debate over the costs and benfits of this technology, one thing is certain that the decisions we take today to regulate and direct research in genetic engineering will significantly impact the trajectory of our future development."
282,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10496704-robert-kenny,2,"I could have written this book myself, and I have no formal background in genetic engineering. I suppose that’s why I was disappointed. I was hoping to learn more about the science. Instead, the author spends nearly all of his time describing the very obvious ways in which genetic engineering may change our society in the future: longer lives, fewer inherited diseases, increased use of in vitro fertilization, and babies genetically designed by their parents. None of these are new concepts, and all have been explored very thoroughly in science fiction and discussions about the ethics of genetic engineering. We’ve been talking about these things for decades. So why write a new book and simply rehash it all? What’s the point of reading non-fiction and not learning anything new?"

286,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103056314-herta-elina-jansone,4,"Read this book for my university's Biology book club. Our general consensus was that the first half of the book is rather boring for those who know biology at an undergraduate level, and some comparisons are just ""bullshit"", as said by a professor. The skin color gradient is not comparable by mutations in petal colors in lilies and petunias, no matter how drastic the color change is. Also, comparing gene editing to nuclear energy because of how it was ""stopped before it could do any harm"" - wrong, nuclear energy caused world-changing harm even before it was employed for energy generation. Additionally, nuclear energy requires large funding and the attention of governments. Meanwhile, genetic engineering can be done in rogue mode, as was stated in the book. And nobody, scientist or gardener, has a good enough understanding of the big picture of genome editing yet. Bioterrorism is unequivocally a major global risk, don't get me wrong. Maybe AI development would be a much better comparison to the progress in genetic research. This is an very anthropocentric book. It would have been better to state this early on rather than after rambling about making the essence of your own children ""readable, writeable, hackable"" for 4-5 chapters. Despite this annoying issue, some good points are made, especially near the end of the book when Metzl finally puts his political science knowledge into use when describing trend-setters and their influence on the future course of Biotechnology research and applications, which blends well into the general scene of global politics.While Europe and the USA are bickering about whether any research on genome manipulation is a sensible thing to do, Chinese companies are acquiring Biotech companies in the bickering regions and carry out research, create genetic databases of whole populations and move towards selecting the best individuals for certain purposes to try to be on top of the world in Bioengineering, intelligence and perhaps even sports (although, in some disciplines, African and some Scandinavians might have better genetics to start with, but it'll become irrelevant once they find something beyond the slow and faulty CRISPR-Cas machinery to apply in the future modifications of embryos).According to Metzl in this book, everything eventually boils down to genetics, just give scientists time to decipher the currently still unknown factors in aging, intelligence, emotional intelligence, extra-/introversion etc. Nurture isn't left out entirely but it's as important in this conversation as a footnote that states that the author is just aware that it exists, and that's it.Important questions are nonetheless raised:- Why should we try to engineer people with specific traits when such people already exist but may be considered worthless in whatever field they have been forced into?- Is it really better to create people that are predisposed towards better skills instead of improving the resources for teaching and supporting the society?- With people eventually stepping into the era of engineering their progeny as they see fit, what remains of the engineered person's individuality, opinion and ability to choose their own path in life? - What should be the standard of genetic engineering as a whole? Who should be responsible for setting the standard, and how should it be set?Discussion of the book gives a lot more food for thought than the book itself. Maybe that's what Metzl tries to achieve with this book - to turn us into ""critical catalysts of this dialogue"". Only through education and discussion can we come closer to achieving consensus about the ultimate purpose and application of this emerging technology."

That is the question asked by the author? Little debate (though some) will occur as science uses genetics to cure disease and prevents hereditary transfer of certain diseases to later generations! But, with mass collection of the human races’ genetics and AI’s ability to pattern that data, the capabilities to select desirable(?) traits to the human race will become possible. What policies will be possible to prevent some civilization to try to use that to capitalize on that capability to advantage themselves? Some policy such as the nuclear proliferation treaty will probably be required. The question is: will some sub-national group try to misuse the technology! Access to large data bases and AI will enable highly trained individual(s) to take steps on their own. How will that capability be policed is another question. The human race evolved, so far, by genetic mixing genes randomly. Genetic errors or good fortune created unfortunate diseases and human genius.As a race we have learned through conflict and resolution to progress, though progress has been uneven. The question is: will we be overcome by the incredible pace of coming change? Will progress continue?It will require wise leadership to take advantage of the wondrous possibilities, while avoiding horrendous risk!A must read for our leaders! The changes will be subtle and seen as generally beneficial by the general public. Nuclear Non-proliferation was easier because destruction by those bombs in Japan demonstrated the existential risk.So leaders are going to have to reach treaties and propose regulations and explain the reasons to the public!!! To do that they will have to become students of our impending rapidly changing future!The author recommends a global dialogue to include top scientist, religious leaders, trusted thinkers to conceive and propose the essential questions that require exploration.Metzl’s proposed questions as follows:1. What can be done to ensure the broadest possible access to the health and well-being benefits of genetic technologies?2. Should there be a limit on the application of genetic technologies to treat or eliminate disease? If so, what should they be? 3. Should people have full access to information about their own and their potential children’s genetic makeup or should this access be limited? If limited, what should the restrictions be and why? 4. Should parents be allowed unlimited freedom to select from among their natural embryos during in vitro fertilization? If not, on what basis should limitations be set? Should parents be allowed to select embryos on non-disease-related traits, like height, projected IQ, personality style, etc.?5. If it is proven safe, should precision gene editing be used to eliminate genetic diseases in adult sex cells and pre-implanted embryos in a manner that would be passed to future generations?6. Do we need a global framework to help prevent the worst abuses of human genetic engineering? 7. What long-term institutions do we need to foster an inclusive global dialogue on the future of human genetic engineering that optimizes the benefits of those technologies and minimizes potential harms? 8. What more can be done to help ensure the genetic revolution helps enhance all of our humanity, and how can each of us be better engaged in the process?I recommend reading this book so you are prepared to participate fully in you and your progeny’s future!"
288,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"Having just read Jennifer Doudna's wonderful book, ""A Crack in Creation,"" which detailed the development of CRISPR-cas9, I went to this volume by Jamie Metzl for a broader look at the potential ramifications of the use of this technology and more of a focus on policy. Thankfully, that is precisely what this book is. While I don't really like that all of the books on this subject sound like over-enthusiastic episode titles for some sci-fi series, the message is important; if we are going to move forward as a country and species with the use of this new technology then the public has to be informed to a degree that is currently unimaginable. This book goes a long way toward bridging the gulf between the incredible advances being made right now at unthinkably exponential rates and the intellectual stagnation of the general populace's understanding over the past few decades. Unfortunately, this discussion and the possibility for national advancement are left to intrepid scientists making cases before governmental bodies consisting entirely of lawyers and businessmen who are themselves beholden to the big money of unlettered, reductionist, simpleton-fostering religious organizations who love to talk endlessly about the need for caution in, ""playing god,"" yet remain blissfully ignorant of the entirety of human biomedical science and think it appropriate to quote Bronze-Age idiocy as a rebuttal to the latest developments in the sciences. That, or the epithet of, ""eugenics,"" is just thrown in as Hitler is to every Twitter conversation about anything. Jamie Metzl is very thorough when it comes to the areas where we do have legitimate cause for concern, and others where a certain naturalistic fallacy continues to rot the minds of otherwise sensible people. He does this with an amusing vignette of a visit to a clinic that progressively gets further and further advanced, allowing him to make choices regarding his future offspring that were unimaginable even a few years before when conceiving his previous children. He also deftly handles the competitive atmosphere that will continue to develop among the leading nations harnessing this technology. His sports reference in this section is particularly apt as given just how much time, money, and science is invested in athletic performance for the bizarrely useless purpose of nationalistic chest-beating at the Olympics every two years, the notion of having a populace that, due to the government's grasp and regulatory ability over genetic modification, is biologically more advanced in terms of resistance to disease/aging and further developed for intellect and physical prowess is one that policy-makers need to understand now. The final chapter is full of genuine policy recommendations and recommendations to the scientific community to achieve the type of widespread education I mentioned earlier. Most of these suggestions make total sense, are genuinely unthinkable in a country as stupid as 2020 USA, and require an intellectual investment on the part of the individual that is hard to fathom. However, that so many books are being written for the layperson about this area of science and public policy gives hope that more well-read future leaders might be able to steer the conversation to more rational levels. One can dream..."
289,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"I love science and books about science. I grew up believing that science would lead the way forward to a more peaceful, prosperous, and humanitarian world. Much like flying cars, electricity too cheap to meter, and the cure for the common cold, this future has not materialized in my lifetime.Messing with genes, whether in plants or animals, has always been a part of science that scared me. Nature is incrediblely complex and interactive and it wouldn’t take much to mess up the balance. The Butterfly Effect speaks to the sensitive interdependence of life on Earth. I’m writing this during the Covid-19 outbreak which shows exactly how vulnerable the human race is to even the smallest of changes.My fear and concern about genetic engineering caused me to pick-up and put back Hacking Darwin: Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity by Jamie Metzl several times. I’m glad that I finally decided to read it.Metzl has written an extremely informative, scientific book that is easy to read. He definitely has a personal opinion about how genetic engineering should proceed. I’m sure that the Non-GMO Project, Greenpeace, and others would differ greatly but I think Metzl ties to present a little of “the other side” in his book.Reading Hacking Darwin has given me a lot of new and useful information. I am no less afraid of genetic engineering than I was before but I now feel that my fears have a factual foundation. That said, I definitely also see Metzl’s argument that genetic “tinkering” can have a positive side. Humans have been engaging in genetic engineering for tens of thousands of years. We have bred a lowly grass into maize, a staple food for millions of people. We have bred rice and wheat so that they can grow in a much wider environment and produce significantly more edible food. These agricultural advancements have kept millions of people from starvation.So how is corn domestication and cultivation in the field any different that reorganizing the corn gene in the lab to resist insects, droughts, and increased global temperatures? For me, the heart of the debate is that genetic “tinkering” of crops provides much faster and sweeping changes and, therefore, could produce devastating results before we even become aware of what we have done. With human embryos the debate centers on “tinkering” with the human germline which would result in inheritable changes that could continue forward for generations possibly producing horrific consequences.Human genetic engineering is the ultimate Ying-Yang of contemporary science. On one had we could solve the horrible suffering of millions of people by preventing Sickle Cell Anemia, Tay–Sachs, and Diabetes. We might even be able to rid the human genome of cancer and heart disease. On the other hand we could reduce the diversity of the human race and create a eugenics movement that would make what the nazis did seem like a walk in the park.I highly recommend this book. It may scare you. It may make your head hurt trying to figure out what is the ethically correct road forward. It definitely will inform you that genetic engineering by one or more countries or companies is inevitable. This is definitely a case that forewarned is forearmed."""
290,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59225695-rodney-jehu,4,"“The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born” - indeed. I wore a frown the entire time I read this often deeply unnerving clarion call of a book - not because I did not thoroughly enjoy Jamie Metzl’s book, but rather because my feelings of transhumanistic enthusiasm and (warranted?) neophobia were necessarily in conflict. On one hand, I am inclined to believe that the survival of our progeny (note: I did not say “species”) will continue to be predicated upon our ability to fashion increasingly more effective weapons for our fight against entropy. On the other hand, if Metzl is to be believed, we are at the precipice of an explosion of Cambrian proportions, which will be ignited by our fast approaching competence in genome editing. I wholeheadedly agree with Metzl about the importance of raising public awareness of the issues at hand (everyone should read this book!), not least because I think it is an inexpensive kindness to shout to your neighbors, “brace yourselves!” when not just their minds are about to be blown. I docked a star because of Metzl’s frequent albeit forgivable use of scenarios. While entertaining and doubtless makes such a serious subject more palatable, the discussion of “concrete” scenarios will likely seduce many readers into overestimating the predictability of the future as well as the competence of the prognosticator. At present, we are nowhere near able to enumerate a large enough set of potential outcomes from the genetics revolution, sufficient to inform policies or controls that will help us avoid potholes ahead. This, precisely, is the problem with which we must grapple - and it is a wicked problem. Our present ability to predict the myriad effects of genome editing at the level of the individual is woefully inadequate, to say nothing of our ability to predict broad societal, national or global outcomes. As exceedingly difficult as it is to predict behavior, behavior supervenes on phenotype, and phenotype supervenes on (epi)genotype, and genes, darn them, exhibit pleiotropy. Alas, as Metzl notes, we will likely push forward blindly and with characteristic hubris. Disquietude is visited upon anyone that grasps the full import of the tectonic shifts we will all too soon experience. Reader beware. I am going to be thinking about what I learned in “Hacking Darwin” for a long time, and I am truly grateful to Metzl for writing this book and to the authors of the many bleeding-edge scientific studies cited. I also thank my lucky stars for genes that, at least, make me less susceptible to early-onset glabellar lines."
291,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131259-taylor,5,"An all-encompassing look at the future of gene editing. It covers everything from ancient history, today’s practices, upcoming practices, to possible moral, political, and scientific issues in the coming years. Gene editing is looked at from individual, scientific, governmental, international, and religious viewpoints throughout. War, athletics, space pioneering, individual data protection, and AI are some lenses looked through for speculations on a global scale. The author’s science fiction writing experience shines in a few example scenarios in the book of going to future clinics. One is being put in his character’s shoes and having to face a moral scenario like embryo selection: seeing all of your different potential children on a projected wall, as hundreds of probability statistics, and all of the ethical conflicts that come with it, is very effective at envisioning a similar future reality. While IVF, CRISPR/Cas9, embryo selection, aging, and longevity are thoroughly discussed topics, the author doesn’t lose sight of the importance of keeping our humanity, privacy, and diversity.So much is explored and presented for healthy, proactive discussion. - What if a country has voted on gene editing regulation, but neighboring countries are creating genetically advanced soldiers?- Will empathy and creativity, initially forgotten in the gene editing and AI craze, become increasingly valuable qualities?- Will different races, sexual preferences, and disorders cease to exist?- Will we become more susceptible to natural viruses and germs with a more genetically uniform species?- If you select a male embryo with a genetic proclivity for fast twitch muscles, but he develops an aversion to sports, did you ruin his chances in life? - Will a gap form between enhanced and un-enhanced individuals?""If people have gone ballistic over the environmental, GMO, and abortion debates—if they have manned the barricades and destroyed research centers over genetically modified crops, or attacked abortion clinics and murdered doctors—imagine what they might do when the same diversity of individual, cultural, societal, and governmental views inspires different national approaches to the emerging science of genetically modified people."""
292,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51063190-caden-howlett,5,"In c. 65 AD, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca stated that “…[we] and the things we live amongst are destined to perish.” In rereading Joseph Goldstein’s “Experience of Insight” (1976), I came across this concept eloquently rephrased as a reminder that “…inherent in all things that arise is decay.” Although these are not original ideas of the two men, I thought they served well as representatives of a concern we have had since the beginning of our self-consciousness: mortality.The concept of impermanence is pervasive through all human history, reaching back as far as the earliest surviving work of human literature (the Epic of Gilgamesh). Philosophers, historians, and scientists have always written about death, decay, and mortality as if they were unavoidable universal truths, hence the examples above. Our views on mortality remained constant over thousands of years due to essentially no scientific method and its consequential advances. Only recently has this changed. The unprecedented explosion of technology and scientific ability has profoundly transformed our understanding of life and death and, consequently, we are beginning to question if mortality is indeed a “fundamental truth” of existence. “Hacking Darwin” by Jamie Petzl addresses the current state of genetic engineering. His book makes it crystal clear that biology is no longer what it once was and will continue to change dramatically over the coming decades. Our technology and understanding of human biology are conjoining, and it is possible that within the next 30-50 years we will have the ability to safely alter our genome and greatly prolong our lives. Perhaps more importantly than prolonging our lives, we will be able to selectively choose which genes are present in our children, ultimately allowing us to produce offspring that far exceed us in intelligence, strength, and creativity. Are there limits to this? We will find out. Maybe our period of genetic engineering will only play a minor role between where we are now and the eventual uploading of our consciousness to “the cloud”.I can’t help but wonder what Seneca would think."
293,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16446997-reading,3,"Initially I struggled with this book as the author favoured the techno-utopian perspective, thankfully later chapters brought more balanced alternatives and concerns. Still I do not agree with his conclusions regarding some aspects of genetic engineering and man's apparent omnipresent battle with nature.In presenting humans pursuit of knowledge regarding cancer and domesticing crop's the author seems naive at best and disingenuous at worst when he writes ""...we balanced the costs and benefits and moved forward with imperfect information and a desire to learn and do more."" It's like watching Claude Rains react with feigned shock at witnessing gambling in Rick's, only to moments later surreptitiously receive his winnings. Not including PROFIT as a (if not THE) central motivating factor and therefore criticism, is a critical error in the thinking of all too many techno true believers.The author deserves credit for navigating and studying such a controversial subject that is so fraught with potential for destructive consequences if not applied judiciously. I appreciated observations such as ""Why breed people for superior IQ when we could significantly enhance our society's collective intellectual and problem solving capability by providing real opportunity and better schools to the least advantaged among us?"", and ""Diversity is our species' greatest asset should we chose to embrace it. Reducing our diversity, even with the best of intentions, could become our Achilles' heel."" Of 182Then there are doozies like, ""If we had demanded equal access to smartphones for everyone from the get go, the smartphone industry would never have grown quickly enough to drive down prices to where these phones became accessable to poor people around the world"" huh?! Contradictory and incorrect plus once again it doesn't deal with the inherent problem that capitalism, as presently practiced, perpetuates inequality.Particularly appreciate later chapters 8, 9 as they confront challenges.Author's continuing mantra ""...we are in a perpetual struggle with the cruelty of the natural world."" and his desire ""...to transcend our limited biology and, someday, our time-limited planet."" was impossible to get pay as it colored so many of the author's conclusions and observations."
294,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,3,"Easy-going, broad and largely-nontechnical introduction to human genetic engineering. The first couple of chapters are a tad off-putting as Metzl overindulges in an overt catechism of what is ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’, the porous boundaries between disease prevention and enhancement, and the fine lines between eugenics and improvements to well-being. But if you can ignore the polemic that is sprinkled throughout the book there is a fair amount of informative material that is worth knowing. Metzl covers embryo screening, iterative embryo selection, induced pluripotent stem cells, mitochondrial transfer, gene therapy, CRISPR soup (Cas9, Cas12b2, Cas13a…), germline modifications, and life extension research. While he is at it, Metzl also comments on various regulatory regimes (UK, Europe, US, China, Middle East) that accommodate or fail to accommodate various forms of biotechnology. The last couple of chapters switches back to ‘how should we think about this’ mode, but it actually makes for a pretty engaging coda. One of his larger points is that differences in first principles among various nations are irreducible, and while we must strive for a global regulatory framework the challenge of achieving consensus is immense. He suggests that our best hope are categorical negatives which specify blatant red-lines that no biotechnology development should cross. I must admit that a libertarian in me is not unsympathetic to this ‘negative international rights’ idea.His other larger point is that international competition and global interconnectedness are all too likely to blow any good intentions out of the water. For example a country that forbids genetic enhancement and bioengineering out of concern for ‘human dignity’ will be faced with a prospect of being out-competed internationally, won’t be able to prevent its citizens from traveling elsewhere for desired procedures, and will need to forbid genetically-enhanced high-skill immigration from abroad. And if it does, it will end up paying for ‘human dignity’ with a totalitarian regime."
295,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36683426-matt-cannon,4,"Wonder what it’s like to read a Sci-Fi book that’s actually non-fiction? Check out this book and see the two genres collide. Hacking Darwin gets deep into the potential of genetic engineering and what it could mean for the human race. Hint, things will be much different than they are today. From the book description: “At the dawn of the genetics revolution, our DNA is becoming as readable, writable, and hackable as our information technology. But as humanity starts retooling our own genetic code, the choices we make today will be the difference between realizing breathtaking advances in human well-being and descending into a dangerous and potentially deadly genetic arms race.” Decisions will be made tomorrow that seem impossible today. This book may unsettle some who have rigid beliefs. They may hope to never experience what this book lays out as our likely future. Things like picking your kids traits, upgrading your biology, capabilities, personality, intelligence, strength, curing illnesses/diseases and practically anything you can think of as a genetic trait. No matter how you feel about it, it’s inevitable that things laid out in this book will happen. The author stresses that it’s important to have more discussion about the global implications of humanity’s future when it comes to genetic engineering. He likened it to the 1970 Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, where the entire global community recognized both the opportunities and dangers and created standards that major powers agreed on. He states that implications could be just as serious if we don’t get ahead of this emerging field and create global standards that leverage the benefits while limiting the downsides. This is an interesting book that will make you view the world differently. It’s important to understand what’s coming and people who read this will be ahead of most in that regard."
296,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59563411-dima-yousef-jadaan,4,"Here's another great book about genetic engineering with a futuristic focus. ""Hacking Darwin"" discusses the power of genetic technology and its possible future societal and ethical implications. ⁣⁣The book covers numerous topics including gene editing tools such as CRISPR, the future of reproduction and human enhancement, preimplantation genetic screening and editing, mitochondrial replacement therapy, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in gene editing, ageing, etc. An overview of the science and technology of genetic engineering is provided in a very comprehensible way even to readers who do not have a scientific background. ⁣⁣The author elegantly weaves the scientific, social, and ethical perspectives in his analyses and offers balanced views on the positives and negatives based on research. He draws parallels between the future of human enhancement with past and current events, such as the Eugenics movement of the 20th century and the cultural diversity between nations in relation to genetically modified (GM) food and crops. There’s also a very insightful talk about the importance of diversity for human survival. ⁣⁣The author provides future predictions of genetic engineering and possible conversations between parents and doctors about embryo gene editing and enhancement for certain traits. At the moment, there are so many technical and scientific challenges and many undiscovered biological pathways that these future scenarios might seem far-fetched. We might not be there yet, but given the rate at which advancements are being made, this book would definitely make you think deep about these future dilemmas and the need for global regulations.⁣⁣My only one criticism is that discussions sometimes get lengthy and protracted particularly in the final chapters. Nevertheless, I’d definitely recommend this thought-provoking and insightful read.⁣"
297,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38293445-stripe-fisk,4,"This is an interesting book that I think is best read as a way to look at where genetic technology is now, with a more skeptical eye towards where the author thinks it will arrive in the future. Though I agree with some of his predictions, others seem a little outlandish, or at least he is expecting them far too soon.The main thing that irked me about this book is the way that the author will occasionally mention a complication to one of his ideas, explain it, but go on describing his predictions as though that complication doesn’t really matter. For instance, he occasionally references how the human phenotype is affected by much more than just our straight genes due to epigenetic factors (and more!) but not much time is spent on this idea. There’s also a section where, after mentioning how intelligence is hard to define and there are some issues with IQ as a measurement, he marvels at the possibility of a human born with an IQ of 1000. (He also doesn’t acknowledge that there might be some limits to how far we can tweak our genome.) These moments make it a little hard to take some of his other predictions and claims seriously.Still, as I said, the book does a good job in outlining some of the current science on genetic engineering and outlines them in a straightforward but entertaining way. The chapters on aging and the future of fertility clinics were particularly engaging, though admittedly I found my eyes glazing over at his discussion of political movements in the last couple of chapter. That could just be my own bias, though.I’d definitely recommend this book for anybody interested in our progress toward genetic information, as long as they’re ready to take some predictions with a grain of salt."
298,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,5,"Hacking Darwin takes a look at the current status of genetic engineering, as well as the possible and probable future uses of these tools, ethics, and the future of humanity. Metzl has written an engaging, fascinating and thought-provoking book that focuses on the fast approaching and inevitable (and exiting) genetic revolution, with clear explanations of the tools involved and the consequences of their use. The writing is clear, explanations accurate and not too technical for the general interested reader.This book covers a vast array of topics that fall under the genetic engineering umbrella. He starts off with the history of genetic research, IVF, genetic screening; and continues with the relationship between genetics, diseases, traits, the environment; AI tools to process complex genetic patters; the pros and cons of the genetic engineering tools; ""designer babies""; stem-cell research; mitochondrial disease; multiple donar babies; gene-editing tools such as CRISPR; gene-therapy; safety issues and challenges to the current technology; chimeras; organ transplants; synthetic biology; aging; the ethics and responsibility of using genetic engineering tool; our relationship with nature; GMOs; the arms race of the human race; and finaly, the furture of humanity.Metzl states that his intent is to inform the public about the genetic revolution so that we can ""make the smartest collective decisions about our war forward... to understand what is happening and what's at stake."" Genetic entineering is a tool. The genetic revolution has the potential to improve lives or do great harm. The future of humanity depends on how we use it. "
299,149267009X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99031173-joan-hibbard,5,"Hacking Darwin discusses the morally charged topic of genetic engineering while making it easily understandable to the general public. Overall, it was an incredibly interesting, insightful, thought-provoking, and well-researched book. There was a lot of information and questions to absorb and think about. As a high school student who is interested in genetics/genetic engineering, Hacking Darwin detailed perspectives, history, and knowledge previously unknown to me and also provided me with countless sources for further reading. Throughout the book, Metzl connects the future ethical, political, and social ramifications of our choices to current issues and topics (like abortion) that made his argument more relatable and heightened the sense of urgency of the situation at hand.Jamie Metzl ultimately tries to create conversation and collaboration over a topic that we cannot afford to ignore. It informs without being overly technical, making it understandable and discussable for the general public. This book is a great thought-provoker for everyday readers and for anyone who wants to learn more about genetic engineering, especially the ethical dilemmas surrounding it. I would recommend it to anyone, especially high school and college students and teachers because it is so important for the future of our species, but also because it brings up important discussions in many subjects. Among these are biology, medicine, ethics, philosophy, politics, socioeconomics, and law. It’s a fantastic book full of citations and contemplation.(It’s also an excellent resource for research papers.)"
