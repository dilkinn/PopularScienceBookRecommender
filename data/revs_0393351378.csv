Astonishing reading!

HOW CAN BE REAL THE SCIENCE ON INTERSTELLAR?
If you watched the film (that definitely I recommend to do before of reading this research book), you may wonder how they can explain some key details that it seemed to be kinda farfetched on the movie.Since it does not matter how absurd it may be seemed some of the phenomena or technologies presented in the film, just think how the things were just 200 years ago......there were no telephones, televisions, cinema (where the three have also evolved since its conception), neither were airplanes, automobiles, space shuttles, computers, internet, x-rays, for not to say any control over electricity, which allowed all this possible; could certainly be absurd and impossible to believe for anyone who had been alive 200 years ago.So, who can tell what kind of technology will be in 200 years in the future, that today it may seem absurd and impossible to believe for us?
HARDCORE SCIENCE
Don't be mistaken, while the commercial appeal of the book is to be a tie-in product to the film ""Interstellar"", this is without a doubt a real book about hardcore space science that it can be used as reference to any real study.In this book, it's explained as accessible as possible for the general audience (but still is really deep to digest), astronomical aspects, spatial phenomena and advanced technology that arise during the film's plot of ""Interstellar"".Explaining which ones were based on proven true scientific facts, which ones on educated guesses and which ones on speculation. But always, without leaving anything to chance or without, at least, an accepted theory by the scientific community as possible.
WHO IS KIP THORNE?
Kip Thorne is a graduate scientist at Caltech and later professor there too, specializing in the field of theoretical physics and gravitational physics and astrophysics.He has also conducted research on topics such as Black Holes, Wormholes, Gravitational Waves and Theories about Time Travel.Honored with many awards throughout his long career, also his work has been published in various scientific magazines.Counting among his personal friends, there are colleagues such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, and even his mentor was John Wheeler (who was the one who ""baptized"" the Black Holes with that name).He also participated as scientific consultant previously in the adaptation of the film ""Contact"" whose original novel was written by Carl Sagan.And finally Kip Throne was the scientific consultant behind the film ""Interstellar"", contributing with his knowledge to support all the scientific elements presented in this film."

“The overriding question, ‘What might we build tomorrow?’ blinds us to questions of our ongoing responsibilitiesfor what we built yesterday.”~ Paul Dourish

THE FUTURE

Scenario
Interstellar is about mankind’s future and about the options we face. It challenges us to think about how we should react to that future.It starts from the premise that the Earth has been wrecked.We have become a largely agrarian society, struggling to feed and shelter ourselves. But ours is not a dystopia. Life is still tolerable and in some ways pleasant, with little amenities such as baseball continuing. However, we no longer think big. We no longer aspire to great things. We aspire to little more than just keeping life going.Humans have coped with their sudden tragedy by shutting down technology, engineering, research and all the marvels of science. This was the only option left to them.But why this extreme reaction by a species that was not frightened even by Frankenstein’s monster? Presumably science/progress had something to do with unleashing the blight? My guess would be too much monoculture.Most of them seem to think that the catastrophes are finished, that we humans are securing ourselves in this new world and things may start improving. But in reality the blight is so lethal, and leaps so quickly from crop to crop (there is also a bit of unscientific nonsense about Nitrogen versus Oxygen, but let us not be too critical), that the human race is doomed within the lifetime of Cooper’s grandchildren. The only hope is to start dreaming again. To get back on the Science Bandwagon.And (thankfully?) there are dreamers, who refuse to give up to this sub-par, non-imaginative existence.We are explorers, we are adventurers. Humanity is not meant to give up like this, Nolan tells us. And uses Dylan to drive the point home (too many times!).The prevailing attitude of stopping progress and just focussing on ‘surviving’ is seen to be a regressive step by our intrepid explorers.Instead our heroes decide to risk it all on a cross-galaxy exploration. To find a new home for humanity, out among the stars.In the process Nolan also attempts to reverse the message of Kubrick’s Space Odyssey and portray technology as a friend to humanity (TARS), instead of an unknown and volatile threat (as embodied by HAL).
Commentary
This is an eminently plausible future. It is also an eminent plausible reaction to such a future. In face it is very close to what Naomi Oreskes  imagines in her own Near-future scenario: Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future. A dictatorial regime, community-based (communist, in fact), strictly controlled, paranoid. We have seen these things before in history, during the dark ages. It is one of our worst nightmares.A totalitarian govt is pretty much what would be in store in such a future. Freedom comes with trade-offs — the more we can indulge now, the more we restrict humanity later.The only problem is that by the time we have had time to degrade so much, to feel the hopelessness, to tighten control over a society so much with so less technology, it would probably be too late to be even thinking of interstellar travel.And that is where the Future that is shown to us breaks down. It shows us an agrarian world that is still capable of inter-planetary travel. That would require a very fast breakdown of things. Fast enough to not let the technology or the knowledge wither away. One bad generation would enough to lose the skills that were required for the Exodus. The plot had to assume an almost impossible fast degeneration and a lot of coincidental happenings in that very small window allowed even in such a world. That is not very realistic.Lucky we had a miracle to bail us out.An illustrative chart of Fictional Futures: See high-res Here: http://goo.gl/x0eoa
THE SCIENCE

Soft Science
This is where science comes in. Under what scientific capacity we have, and with what technology we can reasonably expect in the near future, we cannot really travel inter-galactic distances in a time span that is remotely realistic, at least for current generations. Nor do we have the cryopreservation methods to take any live humans across such time spans.And if we were capable of sacrificing our present for the future generations...? Well. Umm. We wouldn’t be in a fix in the first place, would we?The nearest star (other than our Sun) thought to have a habitable planet is Tau Ceti, 11.9 light-years from Earth, so traveling at light speed you would need 11.9 years to reach it. If there are any habitable planets closer than that, they can’t be much closer.Voyager 1 is traveling out of the solar system at 17 kilometers per second, having been boosted by gravitational slingshots around Jupiter and Saturn. In Interstellar, the Endurance travels from Earth to Saturn in two years, at an average speed of about 20 kilometers per second.Even if we imagine an extreme 300 kilometers per second, we would need 5000 years to reach Proxima Centauri (nearest star to earth) and 13,000 years to reach Tau Ceti. Not a pleasant prospect!Using twenty-first-century technology, we are stuck with thousands of years to reach other solar systems. The only hope (an exceedingly faint hope) for faster interstellar travel, in the event of an earthly disaster, is a wormhole like that in Interstellar, or some other extreme form of spacetime warp.So a major inter-galactic, centuries-spanning exploration is out of the question.What then?Luckily we have the Gods helping us (well, 5 dimensional beings - “them” for short) out.They make our job a lot easier with a strategically placed wormhole - not too near to rip earth apart, but not so far that we don’t notice it, or will have to spend too much time reaching it. And it takes us to a place with multiple earth-like planets. And we go there on LAZARUS missions (Get it? Christ will walk amongst us at The End of Days — as Technology!). Resurrection itself, no less, is on display here!Talk about miracles.“And whoever They are, They appear to be looking out for us. That wormhole lets us travel to other stars. It came along right as we needed it.”Well, what do you know, we are a lucky species.
Hard Science
I have heard a lot of people criticizing the science behind the movie. To me that is the most acceptable part in the movie. The science mostly makes good sense, except for a few artistic liberties here and there. Also the story was written first and the science was made-to-order. But despite that, it hangs together well.The movie is exclusively based on a String Theory interpretation of the universe. Most of it won’t make sense unless you accept all the premises required under String Theory.So we live in a “Brane” inside a “Bulk”. Our universe is the Brane and the Bulk Beings live in higher dimension, in the Bulk. The movie simplifies matters a bit by assuming the Bulk to be in only 1 dimension more than ours, while String Theorists tend to assume 5-6 extra dimensions in the Bulk. Also they are supposed to be curled-up microscopic dimensions, certainly not big enough for Cooper to be floating around in. Nolan didn’t want to confuse a mass audience. Let us accept that as fair.All this is beautifully explained in the book and reading it will make you respect the rigor and faithfulness to scientific principles that is on view in the movie. Everything (including all those stunning visuals) is modeled based on equations and backed by scientific possibility (speculation at best). The movie allows us to visualize what a wormhole, black-hole, accretion disks, tesseract, world-tubes, etc. would look like IF they were real. And they allow us to do so with scientific rigor. Nolan brings String Theory to spectacular life. So this movie sets a pretty high standard as far as fidelity to science is concerned. Let us give full points for that.I am wiling to defend most of the science on display in the movie. Please feel free to fire away in the comment section.They even use realistic equations in the movie. Gotta give points for that too.Even when the equation is attempting to “solve gravity”. *chuckles*In short, it is easy to be skeptical of the science, but this companion book does a good job of shooting down most objections you might have and proves how well-founded most o the exotic stuff in the movie is. The really exotic things turn out to be closer to home, in the Future that is depicted and in the Dreams we are being asked to nurture! I started this book being very critical of the movie, looking for weapons to bludgeon it with, but the constant doses of science has softened me up. Reading this book will probably make you respect the movie much more too. Highly recommended.
Artistic Licences
That said, Nolan does take many liberties with science in the movie, but mostly they are for visual effect.As Kip says, If Chris had followed the dictates of Einstein’s laws, it would have spoiled his movie. So Chris consciously invoked artistic license at some points. Although I’m a scientist and aspire to science accuracy in science fiction, I can’t blame Chris at all. I would have done the same, had I been making the decision. And you’d have thanked me for it.
Truth, Educated Guesses, and Speculations
The science of Interstellar lies in all four domains: Newtonian, relativistic, quantum, and quantum gravity. Correspondingly, some of the science is known to be true, some is an educated guess, and some is speculation.That is why throughout this book, when discussing the science of Interstellar, Kip has to explain the status of that science—truth, educated guess, or speculation—and he label it so at the beginning of a chapter or section with a symbol:
TO SUM UP
The thing is that a wormhole cant work (they are just not stable enough to be traversable, even if they actually exist — admitted freely in the book, in fact Kip goes so far as to almost admit that Wormholes are the most impossible outrageous idea in the book, and he was also the one responsible for introducing a wormhole into Contact and thus into mass consciousness!), time can’t be fixed, and if you have enough energy/tech to make a new planet habitable, you will definitely have enough to make earth re-habitable!So we will never actually face a choice — either we will be capable of saving the earth AND colonizing a new planet. Or we will be incapable of both. And if the earth is in a bad enough condition it is unlikely that a true centuries-spanning mission is going to get funding anyway. And if we can fix the planet, how can we choose to leave all the other species behind? (Diversity being so important, as mentioned in the movie — and true genetic diversity should also include species diversity.)The Science in the Movie DOES NOT matter. Because it is not a question of what is possible, but of what we want to believe in.
Cooper = Christ
This movie is about Miracles & Dreams, not of Science. And, to drive it home, religious hints litter the movie, as pointed out with the Lazarus missions above.We thus have Cooper in a double role, as a Christ figure who brings God’s message to a Prophet, and also as an Apostle-Prime, who alone has experienced divinity, who is convinced that the miracles are being performed by The Children of Men. That men will become Gods one day, capable of miracles. Get it? The Bulk-beings, the 5-Dimensional Gods are nothing but the Children of Men, conceived immaculately through a Technology-Mary)“Not yet,” Cooper says, “but one day. Not you and me but people, people who’ve evolved beyond the four dimensions we know.”Traditionally, when you fall into a black hole, you should get pulled apart, instead the movie itself gets pulled apart by its seams. It was a plot necessity. Of course, our new understanding of singularities allow a slim chance of survival, but certainly not for the Nolan-esque climax. It’s a brave plunge, either way.
THE DREAMS
The real message of the movie might very well be to show how difficult it would be to find an inhabitable planet and get to it, even with plenty of miraculous deus ex machinas thrown in. And we still need to have an infinite source of energy — gravity itself — to have any shot at a humane solution (of transporting everyone instead of having to deal with the rough job of choosing WHO gets to go!)In the move, it all ends in an optimistic note in COOPER STATION, but what of the Earth? Kip admits in the book that to “harness gravity” to get off the earth would probably require a complete destruction of the planet (through extreme compression).If they had access to enormous energy, through “solving gravity”, then surely they could have fixed Earth instead? Given the choice between a beautiful Earth and an artificially recreated station (limited by man’s imagination, even if by the imagination of the most brilliant among us), where would you choose to live? What would you choose for your child? Even today, would you rather stay in a magnificently designed IT park imitation or actually go and visit the original? And what of the history, architecture and ecology we have to leave behind? I know what choice I will make. I might make a visit, but I would want come back to earth.
A Cut-And-Run Theme
As an article puts it:At first glance, Interstellar does seem to have a green message, warning that climate change could make the world uninhabitable for humans (and, presumably, other species). Yet there's an odd twist. The tag line for the film is, ""The end of the Earth will not be the end of us."" And the lead scientist, played by Michael Caine (no longer Alfred the Butler), says at one point: ""We are not meant to save the world. We are meant to leave it."" In other words, if humans do trash the planet, don't worry, some super-smart folks will help us make a nice get-away somewhere else in this swell and expanding universe. Given that Grinspoon researches life and planetary development, I wondered what he thought of this cut-and-run theme.Once we cut out all the fantasy elements, Interstellar has this dire projection for us:1. We are ruining the planet2. We need to look for options to save ourselves.Now, I have no objection to Humans leaving the Planet. Best case might even be that Humans leave the Planet to save the Planet.3. But, whatever solutions we want to imagine/implement, we need to do it before it is too late.By the time it is too late for the planet, it is bound to be too late for our technology too.Cut-And-Run is not a feasible option. Deus Ex Machina happens only in movies.As I have repeated many times by now The Science of Interstellar is the least questionable aspect of the movie. Its core premise (the Future & The Dreams) is what is really questionable.Interstellar operates from a premise that it is never too late as long we keep the flame of exploration and technology alive. It ignores the ethical dilemmas of leaving a planet and most of its inhabitants (including humans) to die. It also ignores the more present question of how to avert a cut-and-run scenario from ever manifesting itself. That is the real question in front of humanity today. By skipping ahead and showing us an imaginary solution to present day problems, Nolan is indulging in a sort of escapism.Let us just deal with it:The right dream to have might just be of saving the planet and thus ourselves, and not of leaving it.The movie was good entertainment and the book does a wonderful job of backing it up scientifically. But having the right dream is important too, to direct Science, which is merely a tool.Humanity was not meant to die on Earth. Earth was not meant to die of Humanity either.
VERDICT: THE SCIENCE IS SOLID. THE FUTURE IS SHAKY. AND THE DREAM IS JUST PLAIN STUPID.
Arthur C. Clarke took us on a similar journey in 2001: A Space Odyssey, but he asked us uncomfortable questions: Where are we headed? Are we ready to rely on Technology? What hidden dangers lurk in the Highway of Progress?Nolan instead chooses to allay most of those uncomfortable questions and leaves us with a too simple an answer: Trust in technology, keep the spirit alive and everything will be fine.I am not sure that is the right message for our times. It needs to be examined, and hence the review. I have done a shoddy job of it, but it is something.All this is not to indulge in technology-bashing. Our scientific knowledge and our capacity for improvement are still our best bets to continuing survival. But “Solutionism” is not the answer.This is how “Solutionism” is defined:
“‘Solutionism’ interprets issues as puzzles to which there is a solution, rather than problems to which there may be a response.”~ Gilles Paquet
We should be optimistic, but only cautiously so. We should not ride headlong into a future we don’t want, expecting a miracle at the end of the lane to bail us out. We should respect science and trust in it, and expect it to not only be a miracle, but also a path-finder. Science should show us the way, it should show us the means to avoid the unwanted future. It should be a companion, not a god-of-last-resort, to which we turn only once we have ruined ourselves by ignoring it.Let us use science to chart the best course. Let us respect what our scientists tell us instead of allowing our politicians and our run-away consumerist economy to take us to a cliff from which even Science cannot be expected to work a Miracle.Even though the movie was supposed to be a powerful message about Man’s power, in the end it turns out to be about man’s desperate need for miracles, for easy answers. That is its failure. "

I live for stories about our great unknown universe, far away stars and planets and everything ""astro-physicsy"". Especially if they hold some truth and real, actual science in them. When the movie Interstellar came out, I was intrigued with the science of it. Fast forward several years and I find out that most of it is actually accurate?! MIND. BLOWN.  Kip Thorne's  Science of Interstellar answers just about every question one could possibly have after seeing Christopher Nolan's incredible movie. From the simple law of gravity, to some insanely complex ideas of space time warping and singularities, as well as gravitational anomalies, Kip takes his incredible knowledge of the universes and translates it into language that we can all understand. Throughout the book, Thorne states which facts are true, speculated or which ones are an educated guess. The discussions on the anatomy of black holes, wormholes, the bulk and the 5th dimension are all wonderful, concise and very understandable. I also loved the fact that the book does not get into the math behind some of the concepts and yet Professor Throne does tell you where to find it if you're interested. The book also has tons of incredible illustrations that help you understand everything even better. If you saw the movie and walked away with questions, this is the road to enlightenment."
3,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,0,"We were lured by the advance hype into watching this extremely disappointing movie. Don't be fooled like we were: this is no 2001.Yes, they have maybe got all the science right, but that's not the most important thing in what's supposed to be a piece of entertainment. The story is stiff, awkward and sometimes just plain embarrassing. The characters are uninteresting. Oh, how we missed HAL! The visuals are okay, but nothing special compared to Kubrick's astonishing cinematography. Above all, they've completely forgotten the principle of show, don't tell. There were sequences where people would go on telling you things for minutes at a time; it was worse than George Bernard Shaw. The movie is interminably long. And I will never again be able to listen to Dylan Thomas's ""Do not go gentle..."" without cringing.I honestly do not understand how this turkey can currently be running a 9.0 rating on IMDB."
4,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14811808-liz,5,"Before the review: I know that there were plenty of aspects in the movie inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey. I know it, but I still cannot stand the ""2001"" movie. Watched it four times, each time was worse than the prior. There had never been another movie in my life which I found as boring as ""2001"" and the Soundtrack still makes me cringe. However, I loved Interstellar. Just saying. The scientific insights into the movie are splendid. Not only are they accessibly written so that even a person who has never dealt with astrophysics or physics in general can understand what is happening in the movie and why, but there is also a great deal of humour and some insights into how exactly the movie came into being, which was rather interesting as well.Okay, I admit, it might take a bit to understand certain chapters, and I had to re-read one or two twice or even thrice in order to follow and connect the ideas, but it's worth it. Without any doubts. The most exciting chapters for me were on Black Holes (haha, yeah, it takes up the biggest part of the book), their Singularities, since the last time I read about more than one Singularitie was a while ago and in a rather badly written book on physics, and Wormholes. Regardless of how unrealistic the idea of artificially produced Wormholes may be, I still love it. The idea of multiple Singularities is one I personally find mind-blowing. Totally incredible, and it was a delight to read how they were successfully used for the movie. Then, there are several chapters which concern themselves with the Dimensions and their probability (say nine dimensions, or five like in the movie), another brilliant topic, as well as Gravitation anomalies and the specifics of the planets of Gargantua's system. From the perspective of a normal human being I have to admit that a planet's orbit around a fast-spinning black hole blew my mind. It demanded a lot of creativity from my side to even imagine that. Since I watched the movie for its scientific accuracy and my love for astrophysics this book was in a way even better than the movie, hardcore science explained by Kip Thorne and put into a movie by the brilliant Nolan, what more do I need? Correct, nothing. I loved it from page one and until the last one. Highly recommended if you loved the movie and want to understand the topics behind it and if you are into science/astrophysics. For the rest - think twice before reading because it really is very complex. "
5,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2765658-steve-walker,5,"First things first. I loved the movie. Nice to see a thoughtful SF movie. I am amazed at the amount of ink, virtual and other otherwise, being spilled about ""What is wrong with this movie"" or ""What is wrong with Chris Nolan"". I am delighted that Prof. Kip Thorne was involved with this film. His book,""Black Holes and Time Warps"" is one of the best ""popular"" science books available. If you have not read it,do so. if you have seen the movie and have not read it,do so.No, ""Interstellar"" is not 2001. It pays homage to 2001. 2001 was the result of one the greatest directors, and one of the greatest SF writers coming together to make a very unique film at a critical junction of human history. ""The Science of Interstellar"" gives a good back ground to some of the thinking behind the movie. And,like ""Black Holes and Time Warps"", Prof. Thorne gives the reader an excellent bibliography for further exploration of one of the ""hot"" fields of astrophysics. For all the arm chair physicists out there flipping out about the movie, I have advice from from my favorite computer; ""...sit down calmly,take a stress pill and think things over."""
6,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7416346-gerhard,4,"While it takes a book like this to remind us how cutting-edge and accurate Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar really was, author Kip S. Thorne (predictably) ignores what is perhaps the biggest idea of the movie.This idea has also proved the most polarising, with a range of critics and viewers labelling Nolan as sentimental, goofy and on a New Age trip as a result. I am, of course, referring to Dr Amelia Brand’s Big Speech near the end (played with deadpan earnestness by Anne Hathaway):Love isn’t something we invented. It’s observable, powerful, it has to mean something... Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space.Many critics have commented that the strong father-daughter relationship that drives the emotional engine of Interstellar is a vestige of the script/story when Steven Spielberg was still on board to direct it, as far back as 2006.The only time that Thorne refers to the human elements of the movie is when he talks about Mann’s planet and the explosion of Endurance, adding (apologetically) that Dr Mann’s murderous actions lie outside the remit of science (instead of a mad robot as in 2001, Nolan presents us with a ... mad scientist. Gee, how original.) Thorne then launches into a detailed, gleeful account of the Endurance explosion and how accurate it is, as enamoured as a Boy Scout with a ball of string.Of course, the first time that Hollywood tried to depict a black hole was Disney’s 1979 movie, prosaically entitled The Black Hole. Thorne gives a compact account of how much our knowledge has changed in the interim.The first time that the concept of a wormhole entered Hollywood as an SF staple of time/space travel was Robert Zemeckis’s Contact (1997), starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey (John Lithgow in Interstellar was also in 2010), based on the book by Carl Sagan (Thorne worked with both Sagan and Zemeckis on the science).Flash-forward to 2014 and Nolan’s answer to Stanley Kubrick: a rigorously scientific and accurate SF movie, based upon (and extrapolated from) the latest research and data. Everything from Dr Brand’s equations on the blackboard to what Cooper sees within Gargantua, from the crop blight which decimates the earth at the beginning to the space colonies at the end, is either plausible or completely accurate.Apart from Thorne himself, a crop of eminent scientists, theoreticians and academics were called upon for their two cents’ worth (though the final decision always lay with Nolan, Thorne points out constantly, especially when he has a quibble or two with the director’s artistic licence).Needless to say, you should only read this book after you have seen the movie. If you attempt to read this first, I think you will have no desire whatsoever to see the movie, because it sounds like a graduate-level quantum physics lecture.If you have seen the movie and then read a book like this, you will be amazed (as I was) at the amount of science you would have absorbed. And quite painlessly, all with state-of-the-art CGI and a truly thunderous Hans Zimmer score to boot.My only quibble is that Thorne is a much better teacher than he is a writer – there are some wince-inducing instances here that could have used an editor’s cudgel. Apart from that, Thorne’s enthusiasm for his subject matter shines through every page, making this a truly memorable companion piece to a great movie.Is it the greatest SF movie ever made? I would have to say it is probably the best American SF movie ever made, as the idea that the whole concept of space travel is simply to replicate the American Dream among the stars is singularly depressing.There is no inkling here that base-line humanity will have to change; that evolution and transformation go hand in hand. One only has to look to great SF writers like Paul McAuley and Stephen Baxter to read what lies in store for us; hopefully Hollywood catches up soon."
7,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5320908-karen,5,"Considering the complexity of the topic, this was a surprisingly interesting and accessible read for a non-science geek like me. This book is part ""behind the scenes of the making of Interstellar,"" part science textbook, and wholly enjoyable. Kip Thorne has a knack for making what could be very confusing concepts easily understood -- he truly has the soul of a teacher. Reading this book made Interstellar even more interesting to me. Highly recommended for fans of Interstellar, or others simply interested in our universe and beyond."

9,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Flying along the perils of a black hole In a recent 2019 paper published in journal Nature, astronomers glimpsed the blackness of a black hole with an event horizon, the perilous edge against a backdrop of swirling light. This is the gate of hell and the end of spacetime. At a distance from the event horizon, the radio waves emitted by plasma of matter spiraling towards the black hole bends while orbiting the black hole. The resulting light ring is referred to as ‘photon ring’. This is very exciting about a black hole, and you will learn from the best, Caltech Professor Kip Thorne who won the 2018 Nobel prize in physics for his work on gravitational waves. When the movie Interstellar was released in 2014, this book was also published on the same day. But many physicists rushed to comment on the movie erroneously. Looking back at their comments, I wished they read the book first. Author Kip Thorne discusses the physics behind the path to black hole, Gargantua. Warping of space is the key in the story. The existence of the wormhole connecting the solar system to the far reaches of the universe where Gargantua exist. The distortion of space around the wormhole and Gargantua creates a path for the flight to the distant part of the universe.Black holes can spin just like earth, and a spinning hole drags space around it into a vortex-type, whirling motion. Like the air in a tornado, space whirls fastest near the hole's center, and the whirl slows as one moves outward, away from the hole. Anything that falls toward the hole's horizon gets dragged, by the whirl of space. But where does space bend to in a black hole? Physicists conjecture that space bends inside a higher-dimensional hyperspace called ""the bulk,"" which is not part of our universe! How do we visualize this? Suppose if we look horizontally along the Sun's equatorial plane, it would appear as a two-dimensional surface, a two-dimensional membrane (brane), and at Sun’s core space bends slightly downward in a higher-dimensional bulk. This is extremely small for a star like Sun but very large for a black hole. When Professor Brand works with equations of relativity, he discovers the possibility of gravitational anomalies triggered by physical fields that reside in the bulk. In fact, the bulk is known to contain much of the gravity that belongs to our universe. The Tesseract is an enormous, hyper-cubic, grid-like structure and a means of communication for the bulk beings to express action through gravity with Earth. Copper lands in tesseract that is placed by bulk beings near Gargantua, and he is carried into the bulk. The bulk beings can perceive five dimensions including the time dimension; every moment in the past, present, and future. They can influence gravity within any of those time frames. Director Christopher Nolan wanted the Miller's planet circling Gargantua where one hour is seven years on Earth. Thorne figured out a way out, a black hole can have a maximum spin rate. When a black hole spin is one part in 100trillion smaller than the maximum possible, then that black hole has difficulty capturing objects that orbit in the same direction as the hole rotates. This will get the extreme slowing of time on nearby Miller's planet and such a black hole will not have any harmful jets of radiation streaming through the sky. In addition, the Ranger spacecraft gets a gravitational slingshot maneuver at such an extreme gravity to fly toward Edmund planet.Life is made of atoms and molecules. Atomic structure evolved in three-spatial dimensions to create specific atomic orbitals in space that leads to the valence structure, like carbon has sp, sp2 and sp3 hybridizations that result in specific spatial orientation leading to various molecular structures. Exposing atoms to four-spatial dimension will destroy the three-dimensional molecular and atomic shapes, and instantly collapses life in the a four-space world. Kip Thorne argues that Cooper is confined to reside in one of the tesseract's three-space-dimensional faces, and he does not experience the tesseract's fourth spatial dimension. This is highly speculative!Another interesting fact you will learn is that If it is not possible to go backward in time. But you can only do so by traveling outward in space and then returning to spacetime at starting point before you left. You cannot go backward in time at some fixed location, while watching others go forward in time. You can’t engineer your own salvation or exclude your existence by causing the demise of your parents before you were born. That physical reality is strongly favored by the existing laws of physics. Thorne is a top-notch writer and a narrator of the physics behind the movie “Interstellar.” This book is highly engaging, but some segments may be rough going. That's the nature of real science, it requires thought, but thinking is rewarding, or you may skip rough parts. Thorne explains the fact of this book in three parts, some are science-truths, others are educated guess, and some speculation. The 2019 Nature paper essentially confirms the black hole we saw in the movie Interstellar, and this is described in significant detail in this book."

I personally wasn't as hooked by it as I should have been, considering it was a carefully crafted intergalactic space journey set in an apocalyptic future made by a creative crew featuring a talented cast (all of which usually tends to be just my thing). What bugged me was the science. For somebody with an interest in the field of physics, I stumbled upon various maddening plot-holes that I just couldn't take my mind off. Would The Science of Interstellar put my mind at ease regarding at least a few of them? I was willing to find out. Kip Thorne is an American theoretical physicist who is active in the field of gravitational physics and astrophysics. He does scientific consulting as well, most notably for (take a guess) Interstellar. The first surprise of the book came only a few pages in, when I realised how important for the film-makers it was to build a story around science and not do it the other way around. 
""Most important to me was our vision for a blockbuster movie grounded from the outset in real science. Science at and just beyond the frontiers of human knowledge. A film in which the director, screenwriters, and producers respect the science, take inspiration from it and weave it into the movie's fabric, thoroughly and compelling.""
The book starts off with a few tidbits about how the movie came about (which will be interesting to read for fans and the curious - Steven Spielberg was to direct the film at first for example and Matthew McConaughey seems to be an absolute pleasure to work with), before launching into the meaty bits. The Science of Interstellar is divided into different sections, with Thorne taking time first to explain some of the foundations (our universe, warped time, tidal gravity, black holes) that will be relevant later as he goes on tying the knowledge into the film's context and taking everything to a more speculative level. Kip Thorne does a good job at explaining things, he writes in a compelling and chatty way, that's easy to read and enjoyable to follow. The book features loads of illustrations and annotations as well, which were fantastic! It made things a lot easier to understand, as the information load is immense. There are quite a lot of things covered on these pages and while it's not enough to make you an expert, it's actually a nice book to gather some basic knowledge on the subject. However, this book is still strictly centred around the movie, so on various occasions Thorne doesn't go into as much detail as it would have been interesting for him to, solely because more knowledge isn't required to make sense of what happens in Interstellar. Speaking of the film - my frustration with it only partially eased away. While Christopher Nolan did think about the science of his movie a lot, on various occasions he deliberately ignored or changed things to make it more accessible for a mass audience.It's definitely a good book and if you enjoy physics and enjoyed Interstellar, this is a beautiful and highly recommended read. If the movie didn't do much for you, than this publication certainly won't change your mind about it though."
11,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24085098-mike,3,"I had trouble following a lot of Thorne's explanations, particularly the subjects of 'brane' and 'bulk'. He doesnt clearly explain these concepts. He mentions that there may be 'membranes' and we exist in a 3-dimensional membrane or 'brane', and there are separate branes above and below us like a sandwich. Im not an astrophysicist so this concept completely flew over my mind, is this brane made out of dark matter like the rest of our universe? I understand these are heavy concepts based on decades of physics and math research but it would be nice if they were broken down a bit more.Thorne's pictures did help to some extent but when we are talking about dealing with concepts like multi-dimensional 'branes' and beings, time stretching and spacetime folding, its very hard to visualize and understand even the most basic of concepts. I had to google the word 'tesseract' to fully understand what Thorne was talking about, he never explains the basic concepts. Things like 'singularity' are never fully explained so you will need to do a lot of additional googling outside the book (not a big deal but worth mentioning)I would give this book at least 3 stars though because its absolutely mind bending and makes you visualize the entire universe in a different way, it was very exciting to read. To imagine our 3D selves living in a universe with multiple other dimensions and spacetime folding is absolutely incredible. I would definitely recommend this to people looking for answers to the movie.One thing the book did not answer; in the movie Cooper lands on Millers planet, then leaves when the waves are about to hit them. The characters mention that both Millers and Mann planets are roughly 80% of Earth size and have similar gravity pull (we know this because Brand and the robot are walking 'normally' on Millers sufrace so the gravity looks very Earth like.My question is why did the Ranger lift off Millers planet so easily (when the waves hit) yet back on Earth they need massive booster rockets to put payload into orbit? It makes no sense technologically, if Ranger can leave Millers gravitational pull just using its own engines, why are they using booster rockets back on earth?"

He apologized and said he understood. At least these cutting-edge physicists are more understanding than usual about retroactive alterations to reality."

14,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56062649-raviteja-vangara,5,"I would have given 10 stars out of 5 for this book. Though I m reading this book late, this is one of the brilliant masterpieces I have read. Interstellar is one of my favorite movies as it is one of the very few movies that use Einstein's relativity laws and you digest them with the flow of the movie. Kip Thorne wrote this book as an introductory textbook to interstellar science. Higher dimensionality, the science of black holes and worm holes, tidal gravity, Gargantua simulations, bulk beings, gravitational anomalies - presented in the easiest way with illustrations and detailed explanations. I bet you 'll learn loads. Also, this book frankly exposes Nolan's exaggerations (in terms of science vs Art) and corresponding justifications. This was one of the best books I have read. If you liked the movie Interstellar - don't miss to read this book. If you just read the book, watch the movie again. "
15,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-shakespeareandspice,2,I was self-indulging.
16,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3831795-nelson-zagalo,4,"The physicist Kip Thorne is the scientific mind behind the science of ""Interstellar"", thus if you want to know anything related to the astrophysics discussed in the movie, this is the book to read. Thorne introduces us to the beginning of the idea, when the movie was still to be directed by Steven Spielberg, and then moves to discussing in detail all the science present in the movie. Thorne does good a job in communicating complex concepts, however don't expect this book to be as easy as ""Interstellar"", because if you really want to understand what is being discussed, you'll have to put your mind to work. The book is challenging but Thorne works hard to make it accessible using lots of pictures to help us visualise the most difficult ideas. I just don't give the 5 stars because the book is organised only around the film, lacking a structure of itself, failing to build its own narrative. But it serves very well the purpose, to enlarge the scope of the discussion started by Interstellar."
17,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6763122-tarin-bansal,4,"This one is a must read if Interstellar made you least bit curious about a multi-dimensional universe. The book practically enhances the movie experience by delving into the depths of the scientific concepts used in the movie, which otherwise were not discussed in detail in the movie keeping in mind the diverse audience. If you really want to tear apart the science used in Interstellar and find flaws or inconsistencies, better refer to this honest scientific explanation written by the theoretical physicist who designed this sci-fi movie's 'Sci' part. Much more credible and reasonable than BuzzFeed articles or random blogs. "
18,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54135119-bogdan-teodorescu,5,"This book was just amazing. Kip Thorne is talking about just EVERYTHING that happened in the record-braking and Oscar-winner movie. If you really want to understand exactly all the cool stuff that happened through the movie, just read this :))"
19,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,5,"Interstellar is one of my favorite movies so when I saw the book The Science of Interstellar at Barnes and Noble and noticed it was written by the great theoretical physicist Kip Thorne I bought it right away. Thorne was the science adviser and executive producer of Interstellar which was directed by Christopher Nolan and starred Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Casey Affleck, and Michael Caine. Chrisopher Nolan wrote the Forward to the book. In Kip Thorne's preface to The Science of Interstellar he states that the science in the movie is at or just beyond today's frontiers of human understanding and in the body he explains what we know about the phenomena seen in the movie (black holes, wormholes, singularities, the fifth dimension, etc.) and finally he interprets from a scientists viewpoint what we are seeing in the movie. He admits that some of the book requires deep thought and will be hard to understand and confesses ""if your struggle to understand is fruitless, then that's my fault, not yours, and I apologize."" The book is chock full of movie and scientific goodness. There are fantastic photos and interesting scientific illustrations throughout. My favorite photo happens to be of Kip writing the insanely complex equations on Professor Brands sixteen blackboards. He relates anecdotes of meeting and teaching the actors and talks in depth about his disagreements with Nolan about how the science should be portrayed in the movie. The behind the scenes ""making of"" parts were enthralling. The book does not skimp on the science. For each particular scientific phenomena Kip addresses he takes a deep dive in to the hard science behind it, and much of this hurt my head very much. It reminded me of reading the books by Kip's friend, Stephen Hawking. In addition to all the interesting movie and science talk the book contains a section called ""Where Can You Learn More?"" in which Kip lists a number of books and websites to read to learn more about the science covered in each particular chapter. And if your brain was not completely melted by the science in the main text he includes a ""Some Technical Notes"" chapter with contains even more mind-numbing scientific information for some of the chapters. The book also contains an extensive bibliography, and separate indexes of people and subjects. I think I saw Interstellar four times in the theater including two times in IMAX - I now want to see it again! If you saw and enjoyed Interstellar I can't recommend this book highly enough. If you haven't seen the movie yet don't read this book until you have. There is even a sticker on the outside of the book warning: ""SPOILER ALERT: This book explains the fantastic climax and ending of Interstellar."" I loved everything about his book. My second read for #ScienceSeptember."
20,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83248543-sara-morelli,5,"Phenomenal. Mind-boggling but easily digestible even though I'm a total layman (but aficionado) when it comes to astrophysics. It covers every piece of science that is mentioned/hinted/unsaid in Interstellar, and well beyond that. Kip Thorne, producer-consultant-Nobel-prize-winner, is amazing at talking about difficult topics in a way that is easy to follow; I’ll surely check out other books from him.Highly recommend it if you loved Interstellar and you’re curious about what actually went on behind the scenes physics-wise."
21,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12542379-samuel-maina,3,"Wow! I have to admit I read this after watching the movie because I wanted to understand all that lingo that was going on in the movie. I had a rough idea but Thorne has done a good job expounding on it through the book.Amazing how many challenges the team had to go through in the making of the movie and you have to give it to them. A lot of physics is explained in the book and I can assure you most of it is Einsteinian. For someone who was reading Issac Asimov and Robert Heinlein as a child.... you have got to believe they would end up as very thorough Theoretical Physicists.Much of Interstellar’s science is beyond our realms... I would like to call it imaginative....that is why it is science fiction and not Science fantasy. How would you perceive of a guy that thought about black holes, wormholes, singularities, the fifth dimension, Gargantua,...The cast had to immerse themselves into a lot of science and with good reason. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain all did a fantastic work! Some of the assumptions in the book are written as fact....e.g Big BangVery interesting facts to boot: “The distance to the nearest star other than the Sun, Proxima Centauri, is 4.24 light-years, 2500 times farther than the distance across the solar system!” “The solar system is a thousand times bigger than the Sun itself; light needs eleven hours to travel across it ““A black hole’s circumference is proportional to its mass: the heavier it is, the bigger it is.”There is much difference between an educated guess and truth I guess.Kip also recommends a book Flatland…..will definitely look into it.In one line Kip states a very heavy statement “By 1957 it became evident that the relativistic laws and the quantum laws are fundamentally incompatible.” That is quite something because the science of Interstellar lies in all four domains: Newtonian, relativistic, quantum, and quantum gravity balancing them all out was quite a humongous task.Some segments of the book are pure physics and require thought. Seems like a lifetime achievement for Thorne. Amazing how Jonathan Nolan works with his brother after losing legendary director Steven Spielberg.While trying to stay firmly within the laws of physics, some things seem abstract and that is exactly why you needed a director who thinks outside the box.Shout out to all the theoretical physicists out there. Stephen W. Hawking…… I see you!A very technical book that explains the movie."
22,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51068795-arwendeluhtiene,5,"I found this book engaging and interesting to read, both as an astrophysicist and a sci-fi fan. Also, my current field of study is more about stars and less about other areas such as galaxies, black holes or cosmology, so it was also a nice way to brush up a bit on those areas :)From a feminist point of view, while there are a couple of phrases I found a bit cringy (for ex, referring to a female scientist as 'a beautiful redhead' - alongside Jessica Chastain-. while not referring to the physical appearance of any of the (way more) male physicists), I really liked the fact that masculine generics were nowhere to be found and the language was non-sexist overall. The author actually used 'she/her' as a generic in some of his science examples, which was pretty refreshing."
23,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6008998-kiril-kirilov,4,"I’ve read A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking. Gah, I’m smart.I’ve read The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow. So smart.For the time reading ‘The Science of Interstellar’ by Kip S. Thorne I was feeling. Wut. I’m so dumb. I’m like… rudimentary simpleton. I’m like the main character of ‘Бахти големите ръки, чуек. Бахти туй аз ли съм? Уродска работа'.So, I’m not so smart after all.First, I’m a huge fan of the movie. During the movie I was like: “There can not be a planet with a ‘slowed’ time, without the planet moving at speeds close to that of light”, “Why the ship travels so fast in the Gargantua star system, but it traveled so slow in the solar system”, “Entering a black hole is impossible, that part is nonsense”.Slowly and methodically, Kip Thorne shredded my elementary knowledge about physics. Few examples: The Miller’s planet - it is actually possible, if the planet is close enough to a ultra-fast spinning black hole and the planet axis is coplanar to planet’s orbit (and a long list of other very specific conditions).For the fast travel one: They are harnessing a navigational technique called ‘Gravitational slingshot’. Currently, NASA uses the same exploit with moderate success.Can a human being enter a black hole. The wide adopted belief states: IMPOSSIBLE! But, after a row of educated guesses and speculations, Kip states the opposite (I can’t retell this one, read a book for once).So, most of the movie impossible stunts are actually achievable, under very specific conditions. Mindblown.P.S. The kindle edition is black and white, but most of the images in the book are colored. Example: ‘The blue lines are the planet’s orbit, the red lines are gravitational waves, and the green lines are ...’. RRRrrr, I can not distinguish them, everything is black and white."

I am generally quite cynical but there are moments where I felt transported from my earthly habitat and daily rigmorale and genuinely felt liberated from any constaints I would normally succomb to in my average, routine, conventional, bustling coffee shop, dreary bus riding, loud mouthed customers as I do my grocery shopping in my local human trough distribution center. Kipp Thorne in no doubt a genius and his contributions are only positive. Whilst only some of the science is factual, it's no fault to expose potential theories, in an honest way, to make us comprehend all the possibilities the universe has to offer.God I love life, I really do. I am honestly grateful for the daily polluted air I breathe but this book along with the film which, despite the faults with the script, allows me to transcend, if only for a moment, to a chaotic cosmological playground that's unspoilt by the fat human sausage fingers and one that is full of positivity and hope and discovery. I can only commend Kipp AND Nolan in providing this dreamboat of a journey for me. You know what, I think i'm going to watch Interstellar right now. All this talk is making me grin like a deranged but happy man-child. Once again, thank you Kipp AND thank you Nolan."

This book is not just a companion to a wonderful movie, the best of our generation (IMO), it is also a stepping stone towards a layman's understanding of the universe and the new ideas which are shaping our world. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to explore the movie further, who wants to know the ideas and effort put by Kip and the director behind the movie, and to someone who wants to explore the realm of astrophysics usually unknown to a common man. It is explained in a way anyone with the rudimentary knowledge of physics and understand. NOTE: DO WATCH THE MOVIE BEFORE READING THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS ABOUT THE MOVIE.

He provides a good amount of sources at the end of the book for anyone who wishes to learn more or who would like more details. There were parts of this book where I sometimes had to read it two or three times, then put the book away for a while and think to fully understand what he was talking about. While that made reading the book a little difficult, I found it immensely satisfying.I would recommend that this book should be read after watching the movie. For me at least it increased my appreciation for the movie and for all the people that worked hard to incorporate real science when it could have been easier to ignore it."

It is much easier to get through than Thorne's Black Holes and Time Warps but still not for the faint of heart, I think. One of my favorite aspects of the book was that Thorne labeled each section as Truth, Educated Guess, or Speculation, and through this the reader can gain a clearer picture as to how much of the movie is scientifically plausible (and it's a lot). And I love that Thorne and the world of physics actually learned new information about black holes as a result of the graphics created for the film."

The author ensures explaining the topic keeping both technical and non-technical audiences in mind. This book makes you pause in between and wonder with awe how great laws of nature are and we as readers are on a journey in this book to understand how Cooper (the movie protagonist) must have acted upon these laws while maneuvering Endurance (space ship) through the black hole, Gargantua.The book starts with a chapter detailing how the idea of the movie came into fruition and roadblocks the movie faced before getting directed by Christopher Nolan. A science-fiction movie adhering to principles of scientific laws and whenever there has to be a speculation, it should be based on the expertise of current scientists in that area. This book has certainly helped me answer some of the questions I had after watching the movie like why they are not trying to save the earth in the first place or is the maneuvering shown of Endurance accurate representation of how real interstellar travel if possible should look like. I am also left with more questions than what I had before reading book, author does provide related books at end for each chapter you liked. I hope you guys also enjoy reading this book like I did and become curious to look for more answers in this universe as I am optimistic that just like in the movie, we as humans should be able to solve even more challenges."

The means to get this PDF is mentioned in the first chapter.I ended up getting the book as well. Beautiful illustrations! The concept of five dimensions and of the structure of a tesseract is a hard one to wrap your brain around at the beginning, but follow along; read more about it, watch some videos online and it will start making sense.I personally think the emergence of such concepts is part of our evolution towards what we COULD become.

And my answer was always, ""Well, they'd have to consult a guy like Kip Thorne."" Roll credits. Then, Kip's name was there with 3 other Exec. Producers. Not merely scientific consultant but Exec. Producer.OK, so a couple decades back I purchased a copy of Gravitation, aka MTW (Goodreads only notes lead author), and a close friend was his first grad student along with Feynman and Wheeler (a fellow whose estate I'm discussing with Kip right now).This book explains Kip's involvement with this film, and he tries in each chapter to explain those parts of gravitation, cosmology, and physics which most of the rest of society much less parts of physics can't follow. Kip nicely illustrates those parts of the text (and film) which was fact, generally thought well, and speculation on his part as a scientist in the field. This is not may area of science, but I can gloss over the hard bits. And Thorne in his book credits also glosses over the really hard bits; and he's honest about this. This is Kip's Contact.This is not an Alan Dean Foster novelization. This won't be an easy text to follow. It will have helped to have certain elements of harder math.Part of my thinking was that this was a film that Kubrick would have wanted to film were he alive.

I tried reading some sci-fi space opera books, but due to my weak science vocabulary I could not finish a few of them because there was too much science involved.The main purpose of reading this book was that I have already visualized a movie (which I loved it btw) and now reading about the science behind it will be easy and enhance my knowledge on the subject.Though I learnt a many new things from the book but it didn't impress me a lot. The writer wasted so much time on the design & look of blackholes & wormholes. The book is interesting in parts like in places where Kip describes his interactions with Nolan. Like in one instance where Nolan asks Kip that he wants 7 years per hour time dilation, Kip was shocked. He tries everything to check feasibility of this exaggerated event. He made the black hole spinning to increase it's gravitational power, then he made the Miller's planet as close as possible to black hole, but the time dilation didn't seem achievable. So he just wrote- okay! but it is possible somewhere in the universe.The last few chapters of the book involving the discussion of tesseract seemed unreal since it is all based on speculation, so I found them boring.3 stars for the book & 5 stars for the movie."
39,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17830966-annelise,5,"I picked this up when Kip Thorne was speaking at my school, and it was one of the best choices I've made this year. I almost changed my major to physics. The Science of Interstellar not only explained the science behind the movie, but really how the universe works or might work. Each chapter is labelled as either truth, educated guess, or speculation, and each provides insight into one element of the film. I would recommend this book to anyone, regardless of physics background, because it's so accessible and fun to read."
40,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50140129-zouina-sid-ahmed,5,"I have devoured this book in two days? I didn't even bother to put in my currently-reading list because I couldn't put my phone away because of it.I love how simple Mr. Thorne's writing style is, I understand it's a science book so it had to be, but I think the author tried to put himself in the shoes of the average reader which is appreciated.I recommend this book to anyone who has interest in astrophysics and space science, or who simply didn't get enough of the original movie!"
41,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33276635-chaunceton-bird,5,"Kip Thorne explains the incredibly complex science in Interstellar with simplicity and patience for the layman. He's honest about where reality ends and speculation begins, and he uses indicators to signal the level of speculation versus reality. This is an excellent accompaniment to one of the greatest films ever made–I certainly recommend them both. "
42,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31956229-lucia-montes,5,Definitely a must read for anyone who loved the movie and would like to know more about the physics behind it. Very insightful and well explained for people who don't have a background in science but not for people who want an easy read. 
43,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38338144-somebody,5,This is amazing! I knew there was a lot of science behind Interstellar but I didn't realize there was so much to learn. Big thank you to Kip Throne and Christopher Nolan! Great book and great movie.
44,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6849833-nathan-miller,5,"Those of us who've seen the movie ""Interstellar"" found ourselves dazzled by some pretty mind-bendy imagery and challenged by some slippery science. And of course, I think we all know by now that Hollywood is notorious for bending, if not outright ignoring, technical accuracy--be it historical or scientific. Apparently, director Christopher Nolan (who directed the most recent ""Batman"" series starring Christian Bale), made a serious effort to get the science right on this one!Thorne, one of Nolan's main consultants on the movie, presents a readable exploration of the science underlying what happens in the movie, and he does it in a way that's accessible to viewers/readers without a strong science background, or who haven't taken a science class in (mumble) years. But don't expect to just coast along. The author encourages the reader to flex those mental muscles, even to the point of periodically inviting and challenging us to connect the dots ourselves following a presentation of a particular concept. But with clear writing and effective diagrams, that's more than doable.While the book focuses on black holes and gravity, it also addresses relativity, time-travel, and inter-specific crop blight. And all in short, easily-digestible chapters and sub-chapters. Even if you have to put the book down to let things percolate--because, let's face it, this is all pretty heavy stuff. For those of us who either do have a science background, or are nerdy enough to want to do more digging, Thorne includes two appendices: one with a plethora of sources for further reading; and some technical notes.It left me saying, ""Dude...the universe is WEIRD!"""
45,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25852459-deanna,5,"I loved this to pieces. You need to be in science geek mode and have a fondness for black holes and extreme science, or really like the movie interstellar. With that out of the way, this does not disappoint. Accessible even if you aren't a scientist, but you need to be not new to popular writing about physics, perhaps from sci fi or science writing. Consistently fascinating. Includes Thorne's stories of being involved, as a physicist, with Hollywood writing, including a description of telling Carl Sagan, decades ago, he couldn't send the heroine of Cosmos into a black hole and have her survive, but having a different answer now for the writers of Interstellar. "
46,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102879399-kate-bennett,0,"Just saw Interstellar for the first time last night and it was absolutely brilliant, so much so that I can't even begin to explain how wonderful it was. However, as much as it fascinates me, I don't know much about the science that the movie dealt with. I thought it was such a fantastic movie (definitely a new favorite), and everything was just so fascinating that I will definitely be reading this ASAP to hopefully understand the concepts in it and in other things as well 🥰"
47,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5428810-justohidalgo,5,"While not a perfect movie to me, Interstellar is one of those movies I go back to once in a while and never fails me. It has action, some emotional stuff, and, obviously, a quite serious approach to science in the context of its science-fiction premise. This book is the “second screen” many movies should have. It explains the science behind the decisions made in the movie. It clearly explains the theory, and then it differentiates when the director made a visual-focused decision. I think people interested in astronomy and physics are really lucky as there is a plethora of great great books to read and enjoy. I think this is one of them."
48,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74382844-filip-gorzelak,4,A very good book with scientific explanations of the phenomena shown in the 'Interstellar' movie. There are moments when you have to strain your brain quite enough to keep up with the author's explanations. I recommend this book to everyone who liked the movie and would like to learn a bit more about the scientific side.
49,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17754981-stephen-yoder,4,"Finally got in some pleasure reading and it involves references to serious math and lots of wacky illustrations involving higher-dimensional travel, black holes, intense gravity, crazy orbital paths, and all sorts of other crazy things that happen in Interstellar. I can't pretend that I could understand the pure science here, but Thorne strips things down to a level understandable by me, a tired parent. Quite nifty."
50,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33196884-jenn,4,He does a good job of making everything understandable. It would have been better if I saw the movie more recently.

52,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36069918-ramon-van-dam,4,"I was very impressed by Interstellar and this is the perfect companion for everybody that is both into that movie and the subject of astrophysics. Kip Thorne clearly explains the concepts of the various mysteries of the universe that we encounter in the story, including descriptions of the discussions he had with director Christopher Nolan that led to specific choices in the script.Thorne is very honest about how conceivable each used concept is and clearly labels them as either “Truth”, an “Educated Guess” or “Speculation” (but still with some scientific base). Such honesty should be expected from a scientist, but I was still very happy to encounter it in a physics book that is also marketed to a broader audience.The book goes deeper into some concepts than I expected and often gives the reader additional challenges without explicitly stating the answers. This gives people with more knowledge the option to delve even deeper into the material, without alienating the rest who can simply continue.This probably does not contain any new information about physics for people who have read a lot of similar books, but even for them this is a recommendation because of the way it ties in with the movie. It still amazes me that a big Hollywood production has actually led to revolutionary simulations of black holes. In an age where pure spectacle is usually the main goal that should be applauded."
53,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33646931-987643467881,1,"I didn't enjoy the film and I was disappointed to see that Kip Thorne had been involved in it - I formed a good impression of him from one of his other popular science books, so out of curiosity, I decided to give this one a try. While I didn't expect Thorne to trash a film that he had been the “executive producer” of, I didn't expect him to glorify it either (considering how it turned out). I thought he would simply focus on the scientific theories that parts of the film were supposed to be based on, but this proved to be too high of an expectation.The book fit perfectly with the message and style of film. It read like a marketing ploy full of forced scientific excuses for what was ultimately a plothole-ridden, anti-science film filled with (as Thorne himself put it) “Conceivable […] but highly improbable” scientific hypotheticals. Many sections seemed as though the book was just a way for Thorne to cover all his bases – to make excuses to the science-literate audience, to convince them that Interstellar was something that it was not, while at the same time bringing in the science-illiterate audience by bribing them with emails that he received from Hollywood stars, and trying to convince them that after watching the film they too now know “science”!! And actually... they knew it all all along!! They just had to look inside themselves and trust their feelings!! … The excuses begin right from the preface:“Some segments of this book may be rough going. That’s the nature of real science. It requires thought. Sometimes deep thought. But thinking can be rewarding [You don't say?!]. You can just skip the rough parts, or you can struggle to understand. If your struggle is fruitless, then that’s my fault, not yours, and I apologize.” The fact that many of the “rough parts” are so poorly written (unlike his other book that I've read), revealed (to me at least) what Thorne really thought of his new audience – he was probably certain that some sections would simply be skimmed through anyway. Many of the lines seem like they were skillfully designed to be easy to remember and clever enough sounding for some readers to use in conversation in order to awe fellow science-illiterate people, and annoying enough for science-literate people not to bother starting a conversation about – in other words, it's the perfect “feel-good” (or in this case “feel-intellectual”) book (which compliments the film perfectly).Perhaps the oddest parts of the book were the sections in which Thorne simultaneously admits some scientifically implausible aspects of the film and then proceeds to defend them. To give one of the many examples: the “disaster on earth” situation: ""Jonathan Nolan [...] set the movie in an era when human civilization is a pale remnant of today’s and is being dealt a final blow by blight. […] But [...] I worried a bit about the scientific plausibility of Cooper’s world, as envisioned by Jonah: How could human civilization decline so far, yet seem so normal in many respects? And is it scientifically possible that a blight could wipe out all edible crops? […] we turned to experts for advice. […] Our final consensus, easily reached, is that Cooper’s world is scientifically possible, but not very likely. It is very unlikely to happen, but it could. That’s why I labeled this chapter “S” for speculative.”If the aim was for the film to be as scientifically plausible as possible for maximum effect (or at least to appear that way - otherwise why consult so many experts?) why then, even after consulting the expects, choose to go for a scenario that they all agree is “scientifically possible, but not very likely”? Were they too lazy to think of anything else that could be more plausible? Or were the experts simply ornamental and only there to make the movie seem more credible? The scientists were forced to make bizarre speculative explanations for Nolan's choice of scenario; for example: “Ultraviolet light […] could mutate your enormous bloom of algae so it creates new pathogens. These pathogens could wipe out plants in the ocean, and then jump to land and start wiping out crops.”The Earth isn't short of any real environmental problems; there are countless other realistic routes the film could have taken (the decline of arable land, the effects of climate change on agriculture, etc.) but why focus on real, current problems when we can think up some “possible, but improbable” ones? Why make the audience have to think about real problems that they could be contributing to - or even worse: problems that they have the power to change if they were willing to make some principle-based sacrifices. We can't have an uncomfortable audience now can we. (As a side note, I was infuriated by what I saw as the character assassination of farmers, who were portrayed as some kind of passive imbeciles in need of saving because they're just too “simple” and backward to ever think about scientific things - they simply wait around and “hope for next year”. The fact that farmers routinely have to experiment and be aware of countless scientific processes or risk losing what is often their only source of livelihood is completely ignored. Since this is something I often notice other mainstream films, I have a “conspiracy theory” that this is part of a bigger scheme to make the public more complacent with either large scale farming or the outsourcing of agriculture to other (often poorer) countries (where various quality, health and work laws and regulations are often more lax) – but anyway, that's besides the point of this review.)Another example is in the chapter “Bulk Beings” in which Thorne has the audacity to compare Interstellar's character's interactions with the “They” to the interactions between the characters in Edwin Abbott's “Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions”! “One of Christopher Nolan’s clever and intriguing ideas is to imagine that They are actually our descendants: humans who, in the far future, evolve to acquire an additional space dimension and live in the bulk. Late in the movie, Cooper says to TARS, “Don’t you get it yet, TARS? They aren’t beings. They’re us, trying to help, just like I tried to help Murph.” TARS responds, “People didn’t build this tesseract” (in which Cooper is riding; Chapter 29). “Not yet,” Cooper says, “but one day. Not you and me but people, people who’ve evolved beyond the four dimensions we know.””The message here (unlike in Flatland) isn't that real scientific phenomena can be spooky/surreal (which they definitely can be), it's that spooky/supernatural-seeming things can be treated as scientific phenomena without any need for explanation and can be left at that – if we feel it, that's real enough for it to be considered real science and therefore should be treated as such.The film is essentially a hymn to the triumph of base instincts above all else and the book basically confirms that. I thought it was a very symbolic moment when Cooper is behind the bookshelf and is sending a message through the books to Murph – the message here was: the books (symbols for science, history, education, knowledge) are irrelevant, unimportant and won't help you, break through them to see what is behind them, and what is behind them is an abstract notion of “love” (code for base instincts) which is “too complex” to ever understand and explain so don't bother – and if that in turn is code for something else more practical, it's for never-ending growth and expansion (including mindless procreation) which is the only way to save humanity and to essentially become omnipotent gods in our own right. The appeals to base instincts were further encouraged by the blurring the already relatively ambiguous moral lines between “selfish” versus “selfless” acts both on a personal level (within the father-daughter relationship of Cooper and Murph, or Brand and her father), or on a grander scale, by framing the greed for constant growth and expansion in a more positive light as: pioneering spirit, ambition and innovation.In the end of the book Thorne says:“More than anything, I’m moved by Interstellar’s underlying, optimistic message: We live in a universe governed by physical laws. By laws that we humans are capable of discovering, deciphering, mastering, and using to control our own fate. Even without bulk beings to help us, we humans are capable of dealing with most any catastrophe the universe may throw at us, and even those catastrophes we throw at ourselves.”For me this was a completely pessimistic and profoundly disturbing film. Under the guise of concern for the planet, what the film really seems to be saying is: “this planet is not worth the effort of saving, lets just milk it for all its worth and put our resources into looking elsewhere and if we mess up, never mind, our distant descendants will sort it all out”. Cooper sums it up well in the end when he says: “I don't care much for this pretending we're back where we started, I want to know where we are, where we're going” – it's not about learning from history and humanity's mistakes, it's all about the next big thing and nothing is ever enough."
54,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36666705-karie-luidens,5,"To clarify, this is a book review, not a movie review. I was quite vocal about my concerns with Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar in the lobby of the Cinemark where I saw it last December, but I won’t rehash them again here. (Okay, but why would they need Cooper to pilot the Endurance at the last minute? We’ve seen him fly precisely one time, and he crashed, and since then he’s been a farmer who suffers from PTSD-style nightmares about said plane crash. Are you sure he’s the best choice? Are there truly no competent experienced pilots to be found? No? So you were just going to send up a crew you didn’t have faith in? Even if Cooper’s piloting skills are actually as sharp as his cheekbones, he did not know that NASA still exists until thirty minutes ago. He is so out of the loop that his fellow astronauts have to spend their first few hours in space explaining the mission’s basic parameters to him. I’ve heard enough Chris Hadfield talks to know this would never fly, surely not even at a post-apocalyptic NASA. And they’re trusting Cooper to pilot the ship into a wormhole when he doesn’t even know what a wormhole is? Seriously, they’re not gonna tell him what a wormhole is until after he’s in space? Seriously, they’re gonna reuse Dennis Quaid’s wormhole demonstration from Event Horizon?? The movie’s barely started, and I can’t even—no—) Sorry, I said I wouldn’t do this. Long story short, I left wishing the movie’s 169 minutes were all just Double Negative’s visual effects. Forget all these dumb characters and their personal problems. More wormhole! More black hole! Give me long sweeping glamour shots of a faraway galaxy being gravitationally lensed by spinning singularities! And keep the deafening organ soundtrack. Well, as long as you provide your own music for dramatic effect, Kip Thorne’s book satisfies this yen. Its substance and logic are gratifying to the frustrated soul, and it’s every bit as breathtaking as the movie could’ve been without the plot issues. Thorne is a theoretical physicist known for his work with astrophysics and gravitational physics. He works at Caltech and didn’t have any significant Hollywood affiliations until he was drafted by producer and long-time friend Lynda Obst to work as the scientific consultant for the project that would become Interstellar. His book’s selling point is of course its tie-in with the film, and it opens with an interesting account of how the concept and the team came together. But its real value lies in Thorne’s intelligible explanations of nearly incomprehensible cosmological concepts. The Science of Interstellar discusses it all, from black holes’ spinning and vibrating to the dynamics of gravitational slingshots and tidal waves to the reasoning behind the theoretical fifth dimension. Prepare for some whimsy as well, my favorite phrase being a subtitle on page 200: “DANGER: The Sandwich Is Unstable.” I was particularly fascinated by demonstrations of how light is intricately redirected by the warped space around singularities, resulting in layers of iterative images whose patterns defy intuition—and yet make perfect sense when explained. Rare is the individual who can thrive in the field of astrophysics. Rarer still is the astrophysicist who can write about the field in prose so crystal clear that the rest of us not only understand it, but enjoy it. Kip Thorne is one such individual. If you like reading Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, or Brian Greene—if you like watching Neil deGrasse Tyson or Brian Cox—add Thorne to your reading list. And if you’re still in the mood to watch Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway bicker, sweat, and panic in spacesuits, by all means rent the movie. But first pop some Redenbacher, put on some Hans Zimmer, and enjoy Thorne’s book for an evening. It’ll help you appreciate those gorgeous mathematically accurate special effects (and wish all the more that they were the film’s real focus). "
55,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73619519-diego-ramirez,5,"What a great to opportunity to learn more about space and interstellar travel! As a big fan of the movie, this is a great addition to the film. Indeed, after you read this book, you will like the movie more and more. The prose and correct word choice is perfect for the non-physicists scientists."
56,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3959348-ru,4,"Kip Thorne is an world-renowned astrophysicist, who, along with a partner, set out to have Hollywood create a science fiction film based very much on real science. No less than Steven Spielberg took a strong interest, but years passed, a writer's union strike ensued, and the project lost its director to other pursuits. Christopher Nolan jumped on board and never looked back. That film is the breathtaking and highly-successful ""Interstellar"", and this book is something of a labor of love for Thorne, as he provides an exposition on the vast scientific world the movie reveals before the eyes of the audience.To clarify, the movie can be confusing at times, but not overwhelmingly so, and never detracts from enjoyment. It's not for dummies, of course, nor is this book. Thorne expounds on theories and facts found in the movie here, but this is by no means a book that provides a ""simplification"" of the film. If anything, the ideas on the pages of this book are astoundingly complex. Astoundingly complex. Admittedly, some of it went right over my head. There are hundreds of diagrams and photos of just what Thorne is trying to explain, and while it isn't always crystal clear, it does become clearer, even if you couldn't explain it back.The best way to view this book is as a supplement for people captivated by the literal science of ""Interstellar"". It also pulls back the curtain a bit on what the Nolan brothers, the actors, and special effects crew do with the integration of hard space science into the movie, and especially what is done with the theoretical aspects. It would be so much easier to just make a straightforward science fiction movie where everything is made up and unbelievable, but it's all the more admirable that you do get the feeling as a viewer that an extremely high percentage of what you are watching is possible.I loved ""Interstellar"" and was thrilled to find another of my favorite movies, 1997's ""Contact"" starring Jodie Foster, and, ironically, Matthew McConaughey as well, referenced often in this book. That movie was based on a Carl Sagan novel and while it it plays much more fast and loose with real science, it also injects genuine concepts into itself. I found the two movies shared a similarity beyond McConaughey, so to read about some of the astrophysical dimensions involved in that film was a tremendous bonus for me.Hard to recommend this book as it's truly not easy to digest, but if you take your time with it after seeing ""Interstellar"", and re-read parts a few times, you may surprise yourself, as I did, when its lessons would suddenly make more sense to me hours or days later. Nonetheless, a great textbook that compliments a great movie."
57,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3246379-j-d,5,"Hidden within the label “you saw the movie, now see the science” this is one of the heftiest science-loaded books of the year. I congratulate Thorne for not pulling punches and getting so much crammed into this beautifully illustrated book of what—just by watching the movie over and over—you’ll never guess was part of it.I couldn’t believe how much thinking—and even true research—has gone into producing Interstellar. It’s probably the most ground-breaking introduction of high-level physical ideas to the general public ever attempted (“Contact”? “2001”? They are child’s play). I do have a Ph.D. in sciences, and years as college professor in Biophysics, including reading hundreds of books about contemporary Physics. Still, some of the ideas expressed in the story’s framework are so advanced I’ve lost some of them in a first reading, and they will be invisible to the casual spectator.Thorne labels only some sections of his book as ‘speculative’ but the whole book can be considered speculation—and that’s fine with me. The fifth dimension gets a lot of play—Stephen Hawkins might jump on his chair at that—and aliens (or us?) get to live there. No particular reason, but travel might be swifter. Some amazing new depictions of black holes are a consequence (rather than background work) of creating this movie. And a controversial view of the end of our work by various blights is advanced and I’m sure will show up in several dystopias soon to be filmed. Let’s just don’t go to the connections between landing space stations and changing Earth’s gravity (that still sounds weird after reading the book).“2001” had an ending that confused a great deal of people, set in a place with time distortions and abnormal worlds. It seemed (at the time) closer to magic (and LSD) than to any foreseeable reality. It’s a testament to the great progress of science in half-a-century that a world as fantastic as the one now purported in “Interstellar” doesn’t seem magical but just a speculative extrapolation of our current knowledge.Soon, in a not so distant future, the magic might become reality."
58,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35623333-kaiielle,5,"I've seen Interstellar over 5 times now. I never thought in my life that I would be able to say that I have a ""favorite movie of all time"" until I saw Interstellar, though it wasn't until the second time I watched it that I realized it was my favorite. You definitely need to see the movie and understand it pretty well before reading this book.Kip Thorne does a great job of explaining the science behind the movie. He labels everything throughout the book as ""Truth"", ""Educated Guess"", and ""Speculation"" so you know what is what. Reading the true science was interesting and entertaining; for me, reading about relativity was my favorite part. However, the educated guesses and speculations took the win for me. I feel like those who have seen this movie who decide to criticize the science behind it should perhaps read this book. Kip acknowledges everything that was a speculation or an educated guess and goes into depth the science behind those. I love that Interstellar was a sci-fi backed by science, and was not a movie that lead more towards science fantasy.For the most part, Kip explains all of the science in easy-to-understand terms and includes helpful drawings to help with the understanding, which is great for someone like me who doesn't have any science education whatsoever and doesn't understand large science words, but just happens to have a kick and love for science related things. There was one topic in the book where he went really in depth, bringing out equations and calculations, and was a section that I very quickly skimmed over. I knew it was coming too as Kip wrote that he was going to be getting into the nitty-gritty numbers and suggests that the audience can skip that part if they like.The most enjoyable parts of this book for me was reading the speculations and educated guesses behind the blight situation on Earth, and all of the information, from the truth all the way through to speculations, about the black hole Gargantua. I learned so much from both this book and the movie about black holes. Absolutely loved the movie, loved this book. Adding to my ""to-read again"" list and may have to watch the movie again this weekend."
59,0393351378,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5926719-patrick,4,"Blinded by The Science of InterstellarAfter seeing Interstellar, I was interested to know how realistic some of the scenarios in the film were. For example, why did the black hole (""Gargantua"") look as it did in the film? Or, could someone survive travel through a wormhole? Or, why would planets orbiting a black hole be a good option for colonization? This book goes into excruciating detail about those scenarios. The author, Kip Thorne, was a scientific advisor on the film, and consulted Christopher Nolan and his brother on the science behind the story. The explanations are deep but short, and so I gave this book a favorable rating. But at the end of reading this book, I couldn't help thinking that all the scientific realism that Thorne tried so hard to convey was not really necessary in what I felt was more of a human story. In science fiction, just give me something realistic enough to advance the plot; it doesn't have to be spot-on, and more realism may actually make things more confusing. For example, I may not know or care about the scientific details about gravitational waves, but I can relate to a man who wants to communicate with his daughter using them.To me, the best instance of this in the book was when Thorne explained that to achieve the desired deceleration close to Miller's planet, Cooper should slingshot the Ranger around a small black hole. Christopher Nolan changed this to a neutron star in the film, since more than one black hole would be confusing to the audience. From anecdotes like this, I gained a greater respect for Christopher Nolan as a director (although I already admired his work).In closing, this book is a great explanation of the scientific realism that may or may not have been necessary in the film. It would make a great foundation for a college physics course or a MOOC."
