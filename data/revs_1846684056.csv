While the premise is interesting - scientists are human too, but science has missold itself as somehow a more perfect way - few if any of the example scientists Brooks cites as 'anarchists' were anything of the sort. He uses the term 'anarchist' to loosely collect together young people in the 70s who dabbled in LSD, scheming Renaissance italians, doctors who experimented on themselves, people who had flashes of inspiration, feuding scientists who did their best to damage each other's reputations and so on - all described as anarchists. Well, gosh, students in the 70s doing drugs? Shurely not. And people scheming and being political in Renaissance italy - anyone for the Borgias? Similarly, claiming Einstein was an anarchist because he had a flash of inspiration, well that just annoyed me. The guy had been thinking about relativity for months if not years, so having a dream or a sudden inexplicable idea - hardly a surprise. Thats how minds work. Finally - sorry but the chapter suggesting peer review was bad was just muddle headed. For sure its not perfect and some people use their influence inappropriately. But thats the fault of journal editors for not properly weighting opinions (for example downweighting a rival who is known to favour an alternate theory or is working on thte same topic), not the process. If he'd said nonconformist or political I'd have been happier, but I guess 'the secret nonconformity and politics of science; isn't so snapppy. "
1,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9952662-margaret,3,"I enjoyed this book. The author discusses the way that science is ACTUALLY conducted. Gone are the white coats and the methodical approach replete with orderly trial and error. Instead we have stories of top academics ingesting psychoactive drugs, fist fighting in hospital hallways, and experimenting on themselves when they cannot get permission to test their theories on others. The author shares these stories in the hopes that the public will see that true innovation comes at the price of messiness. Although I enjoyed this book I gave it three stars. I felt like the author had a clear bias while writing it and that it read more like a persuasive paper than an unbiased anything. I also felt that sometimes the sensationalism used in the story didn't always match up with the argument the author was making. Lastly, although I enjoyed many of the stories and I found the book incredibly thought provoking I felt that my somewhat limited scientific background made it difficult to truly absorb some of what the author was saying. My limited background is not the author's fault, but I thought it might be useful for other readers to think about before starting the book."
2,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4250854-susan,2,"Although this book had a fair number of interesting tidbits of information, the way it was written annoyed me. First of all, to quote my husband, the author ""uses the term anarchy the way the Smurfs use the word smurf"" so that it kind of lost meaning. He used anarchy to mean not following protocol, just plain being mean, and so on. One of my major complaints about this book is how the author stressed how a lot of ideas ""just came to"" the scientists as a result of dreams, drug use or almost magic. I'm sure that many scientists work on things for years, seemingly without results, and then have an ""Ah-ha"" moment as described by the author. However, that ""ah-ha"" is due to years of study, work, and pure talent. It's not like I, with very little background, would all of a sudden have an idea on, let's say, a medical cure come to me out of nowhere. I think the author deemphasizes the sheer drudgery that is needed before a discovery or invention comes about.I am already all too aware of the competition and pettiness that comes with academia. These are usually even more intense in the hard sciences than in social science and humanities. If people aren't aware of the intellectual thievery, deceit and so forth that occurs in high level science, they might find this part of the book interesting. I just found it depressing. "

4,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16515235-neal-alexander,3,"The original title of this book was ‘Free Radicals’ so the ‘Anarchy’ shouldn’t be taken seriously. Doubtless via hasty editing, some supposedly ‘anarchic’ behaviours, such as belonging to a North American labour union, clearly are not.Still, the book has a point. Some scientists insist we follow, or should follow, ‘the’ scientific method even though they can’t say what it is. Experiments, for example, are not vital to all sciences, such as astronomy. The book gives deserved mileage to Feyerabend’s ‘anything goes’ assessment. Although Feynman is quoted a few times, his description of science as ‘organised scepticism’ isn’t mentioned, perhaps for fear of making the book seem verbose and superfluous.At school I was taught the ‘tongue map’ of flavour zones. In fact, if memory serves, I got different substances dropped onto my tongue and was asked to affirm the theory: doubtless I obliged. The trouble is that there’s no evidence for this theory. At least, that’s what Wikipedia says. No, I haven’t checked the primary sources: no-one can do that for everything they rely on, so there are always likely to be some false ‘facts’ circulating. One of the book’s examples is Watson and Crick being misled by incorrect textbooks, with Crick concluding that he shouldn’t ‘place too much reliance on any single piece of experimental evidence’. We’d like to think that scepticism will self-correct such errors, although this may be far from reliable (see eg last year’s ‘Trouble at the Lab’ article in The Economist).The book’s serious and valid points are cheapened by its bluster, for example introducing a chapter on scientific rivalries by way of a bridge-blowing scene from For Whom the Bell Tolls."
5,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34985713-louis,2,"Easy pop-science read with some interesting titbits. I read it only because it was on the shelf and I wanted a pop-science book and this satisfied that in the moment. As another review said the book ""uses the term anarchy the way the Smurfs use the word smurf"", which was a pretty transparent and often shoehorned attempt to unify the books anecdotes around a theme. It would have read better as just a ""interesting science anecdotes"" book with a concluding essay that concealed the books message.Not to say the overall message, that science isn't an organized, uniformly progressing, perfectly implemented Method, isn't interesting or a message that should be made easily understood in the form of a pop science book. Only to say that the moments I actually enjoyed from this book were the bits that made me go ""oo thats a fun anecdote"" and the rest wasn't enough of an Argument for me to accept it's thesis."

7,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87272673-ave-mets,4,"A lot of interesting cases are presented in the book. There is no deep analysis however, and the author jumps from one case to another and that confused me a bit. Also I cannot agree with his conclusions that contemporary science is all dull and boring, and most of all that fraud and bullying are praiseworthy comportments and should be a part of science. Science changes, i.a. with technology (such as big data and its obtaining and processing methods), and this should be taken into account when giving norms of how to do science."

9,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"One of the best books I have read in a while. There is no need to have a firm understanding of science to enjoy this book. Sometimes sensational but always entertaining, Brooks take on the scientific community is thoughtful and necessary. I highly recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in the history of science, how ego affects science, how drugs helped some scientists make discoveries, or why we we make our kids hate science and promote sports culture (this last point is in epilogue and is fantastic.) This books provides an easy, fast paced, light (yet comprehensive) read. Bravo Michael Brooks. Well done! "
10,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5370063-hannah,4,"An enjoyable peak into the politics of science they don't tell you about at school or at university. Apparently the world of scientists is not a noble as they would have us believe. This book is an interesting read full of great statistics, stories and anecdotes that you wouldn't have thought scientists would be capable of. It also confirms what i have begun to suspect recently, that scientists don't really play by the rules they're supposed to at all which is kind of funny given that they invented them."
11,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6798013-marjolein,0,I have not read this book yet. Brainpickings reviewed it though. Sounds interesting: http://www.brainpickings.org/index.ph...
12,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21700348-beatrix-tung,3,Ugh. Bad arguments. But excellent trove of anecdotes for use in essays.
13,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15947308-haider-hussain,4,"""Science is a quest to convince yourself and others of something you only guess to be true. That's a hard task, and requires tenacity and ingenuity - and, occasionally, questionable tactics.""  Science is by nature free spirited. Greatest discoveries, breakthroughs and achievements of the past were the result of one single thing: human curiosity. To satisfy scientific curiosity, rules hardly work. What we know as Science today is the post-war rebranded version of science in which it is presented as a straightforward, systematic journey. Brand Science presents scientists to be rational, robotic and disciplined investigators who proceed methodically from emergence of ideas to carefully testing them with microscopic precision and then coming up with a working theory. This is hardly so.This publicized version of Brand Science conveniently overlooks pumped up egos, fudged data (or at least cherry-picked data), discredited juniors, side-lined outsiders, furious infighting among peers, scientists risking their own lives, drug use, deception, superstitions and whatnot. Brooks argues that some of the greatest scientific discoveries had a more sinister side to them, covered up or overlooked. Book is filled with such examples ranging from all major branches of science and involving Nobel laureates and people as prominent as Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein.However, despite these shenanigans, Brooks argues that this is real science as done by human beings, and this is good science: torments, dreams, visions, restlessness, lying, cheating, despair, brawling, bullying, desperation and - in the end when everything works out - the euphoria that makes it all worthwhile. Brooks does not offer any moral defense of scientists' behavior (there can hardly be any, unless you are a die hard Utilitarian), but argues that this is the way progress has happened. Too many regulations and ethics boards have slowed down the progress of science.Brooks argues that post-war rebranding of Science has turned scientists into docile workers on a production line, rather than what they know themselves to be: curious and creative. Ethics boards, strict (and too many) regulations and peer reviews have turned wolves into domesticated dogs. As a consequence, they only advise, not influence.Finally, Brooks opine that our children are being taught the letter, but not spirit, of science. Class room practical emphasize on getting the right results, instead of teachers using this experience to explain the challenges and rewards involved in making breakthroughs. Brooks says that we need to change this; ""if we want more scientific progress, we need to release more rebels, more outlaws and more anarchists. The time has come to celebrate the anarchy, not conceal it."""
14,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8060858-david-abigt,3,Interesting history behind some discoveries but he seems to be saying and in fact advocating that all scientific progress is based on flawed data filtered to prove someone's theory. Climate change deniers would have a field day with this book.
15,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"Unfortunately, scientists and researchers are people who have egos and a tendency to stick with the status quo. This book explores how science can be held back for by the very people whose job it is to lead us into the future. Very insightful."
16,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78236767-petar-vrgoc,5,"Through our education we build picture on how things happen. After reading this book, Free Radicals, one may change the picture, things or solutions are coming in one, slightly, different way. Michael Brooks has stile that makes reading exciting."
17,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52508910-lu-s-caparroz,4," Michael Brooks did a good job on gathering anecdotes that really expose the human side of scientists and try to deconstruct the very wrong image most lay people have about science and its methods. Logical reasoning and explicit step-by-step proofs are not always the most valuable skills a researcher has to thrive in competitive environment. The book is divided in 8 chapters that not necessarily build one on top of the another but that are presented in a nice sequence, you can connect the dots and previous information as you read.It starts on how scientists get their inspirations, through drugs, dreams, visions and religion. This is not to be oversimplified: they don't just get high on some LSD and all of a sudden make a breakthrough, it's not what the author says ow wants to mean, one must be really naive to think like this.The book then follows on how scientists cheat on their own theories to make them acceptable, through fudge factor, cherry picking and confirmation bias and a chapter on ideas that got accepted after much marketing, even though the theories were not really confirmed.The fourth chapter is dedicated on how researchers will not always play by the rules and even ignore ethics to test their ideas. This includes putting other people lives at risk, but most of the times they are not that reckless and will just test on their own. The next chapter explores some ideas that defied the common sense and the ""religious authorities,"" mainly on human conception, and discusses a bit of how  Brave New World shaped the way we view reproduction technologies.The last three chapters talk about how scientists fight to each other to be the first to make a discovery or to delay others to do it before, how they will do their best to protect the hierarchical position towards the top and how sometimes they will need to fight to prove their theories to the whole world, even when facts are so compelling and are right. Some researchers got their ideas rejected for a long time just because they defied the predominant school of thought or because they were considered outsiders in a field, not having ""formal education.""The author really makes a point on the way science is really done: it is not ideal but major breakthroughs are being done this like this for at least 500 years or so. So, from the author's point of view, I think  Michael Brooks did a great job. However, he fails on using the word anarchy to describe scientists' behavior when they not follow the rules or disregard ethics, it sounds like a vulgar and immature way to talk about something full of historical and political sense. This is the only reason not give it five stars. Nevertheless, an enjoyable and eye-opening reading."
18,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52931852-abraham-lewik,4,"Rather good, to be honest, not flawless. Some really frustrating inconsistencies diminish the case the author builds, nevertheless he delivers. Very enjoyable anecdotes and the specific skeletons, once closeted, have room enough to dance along these pages. Be warned that science is a nebulous concept in these pages, it does not always mean the method (predictability, records etc.) nor individuals.An example of failure is using the frequency of publication as a standard to defend Mr. Sagan, whilst later attacking that very standard as stifling progress. Also, a few pages prior mentioning his wide margin of error in a study, which is less predictive and so less valuable when measured with the scientific method. Also on that, in the last chapter, mentioning a study of Mr. Sagan's of which he himself is dubious. All this undermines a certain expectation of consistency, that a critic will have a superior alternative in mind (constructive criticism) as well as hurting trust that Mr. Sagan is more scientist than demagogue (I use the word aware of the negative connotations).What I want to change though is simple. Put a bloody asterisk when there are notes in the rear pages. Those notes are extra chips in bag, so to speak, and had cooled, gone gross, when I turned the final page and found them there."
19,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,3,"Reading this was a very strange experience. The opening two or three chapters really irritated me with the extent to which the author spouted inaccuracy and hypocrisy, and focussed on random 'inspiration' as being most important in science (when in truth 99% of it is hard work and experimentation) and criticised the 'cherry-picking' of researchers choosing data that backs up their argument, ignoring evidence which doesn't - the author himself cherry-picking a number of examples to back up his assertion, ignoring many examples which don't.The remainder of the book was a lot less annoying, and more honestly and straightforwardly discussed many aspects of the scientific field which the casual reader might find surprising. There was a lot of credit given to scientists who were denied their rightful appreciation earlier on, there was a lot of discussion of ethics which was interesting, there were examples of researchers (including a former lecturer of mine who infected himself with parasitic worms!) that made for quirky examples. So yes, a funny mixture. I'd recommend it to anyone willing to skip the opening two or three chapters, with several caveats of me understanding the subject might not be interesting to everyone."
20,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52055900-timothy-burbage,4,"I enjoyed this non-fiction book. It took a look at scientists to show that they are not mindless robots, but emotional human beings capable of breaking the rules.This goes through how IVF broke taboos, how a heart surgeon performed surgery on himself as he couldn't find volunteers, how the scientific establishment ignored facts and data, and the ""normal misbehaviours"" that scientists do every day. As a former scientist (and not a very good one) I especially understood the normal misbehaviours.The only thing stopping this from being 5 stars was the open and close. The opening pushed the fact that people had creative ideas as rebellious anarchists, while the last chapter pushed a personal agenda on peer reviews.Not only did I learn a lot (especially about Stanford Ovshinsky - legend) but I also enjoyed the writing style."
21,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3130468-linne,4,"I'm not sure that everyone would rate this one five stars, but I found Michael Brook's arguments eloquent and convincing. This book highlights the importance of being open minded to new knowledge and ideas in a world where the historical or political context might not necessarily support them. Through examples like Copernicus' theory of the earth moving around the sun (and not the other way round), and the environmental calamity caused by CFCs in the 70s and 80s, the importance of overcoming ignorance in order to innovate is made clear. After reading this book I feel grateful to the many great thinkers who took their social responsibility to communicate their expertise on certain subjects to the public seriously, often at great personal cost to themselves. Highly recommended!"
22,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167923-patrick,3,"amazon review:The thrilling exploration of the secret side of scientific discovery --proving that some rules were meant to be broken scientists have colluded in the most successful cover-up of modern times. They present themselves as cool, logical, and level-headed, when the truth is that they will do anything --take drugs, follow mystical visions, lie and even cheat --to make a discovery. They are often more interested in starting revolutions than in playing by the rules. In Free Radicals, bestselling author Michael Brooks reveals the extreme lengths some of our most celebrated scientists --such as Newton, Einstein, and Watson and Crick --are willing to go to, from fraud to reckless, unethical experiments, in order to make new discoveries and bring them to the world's attention."
23,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15083967-max,4,"A really eye-opening insight into the modus operandi of modern scientist and how they interact with science. This book, though definitely not watered down, is never too dense to properly understand, even with a very basic understanding of science. Michael Brooks uses several interesting examples to illustrate each of his points (anarchy of scientists etc.), but what I found most interesting was each of the examples themselves- I learned a lot of things about both science and scientists while just reading this book- call me impressionable, but I found my appetite for science rekindled. Overall, an fascinating, well researched book that I learned a lot from"
24,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10494517-mary-baldwin,3,"This book won't be for everyone, and will no doubt have already pissed off several scientists. The content isn't thrilling but you're left with a new angle on the science world; a take that's less science-y and more human-y. So that said, you don't need to be experienced in the fields of science to get something out of it.The books highlights the artistic side of science, and that the rules of a 'fair test' we all had to recite over and over to pass school exams, aren't as important as we'd think when it comes to qualitative discoveries. Don't judge a scientist 'til you've given this a go."
25,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914661-jason-yang,4,"Science as a profession is many things: creative, inventive, scholarly. But one thing it is not is impartial and impersonal. In Free Radicals, Michael Brooks makes the case that some of the most influential minds in human history behaved with unglamorous, human depravity: cheats, frauds, back-stabbers, anarchists. Perhaps that's a bit extreme, but those who stand out were definitely those who cut against the grain. It's pretty fascinating to read this little biographical vignettes about some folks got ahead, or what some scientists had to do to get recognized. Definitely a fun and interesting read. Would highly recommend."
26,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6343042-sam-randall,3,"Quite an interesting read, it's refreshing to know that some of the most intelligent people in the world are still quintessentially normal human beings. The book is written well and I never found myself getting bored, which is more than can be said for some other books in the popular science genre. Readers new to science should have no problem with this book as few complex concepts are discussed in detail. The primary focus is on the minds of scientists behind the discoveries, the 'secret anarchists' as the author describes them. Science may not be as boring as you first thought."
27,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5600022-dan,4,"Machiavelli would be proud.This was very entertaining. Scientists are human, and they sometimes behave badly. I especially liked the story of the discovery of H. Pylori, the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers. (That story included the grossest true event that I've ever read.) The political infighting and backstabbing in academia is no better than what we deal with in the private sector.This book is not science -- it's a series of narrative insights into scientists. It's not overly technical. It's an entertaining read, for fans of popular science, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
28,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22239497-danu-poyner,4,"It's a bit glowing and gushing at times, but Brooks' book makes an important point - the most interesting and important achievements of science have never been a result of closely following the sacred 'Scientific Method'. In the creative search for deeper understanding, rules are made to be broken, and the golden rule is anything goes. Brooks wants to convince us that brand Science obscures what science really is – anarchy. The last chapters on what Science's staid timidity means politically are by far the best."
29,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31905880-laurentk,3," I get what this book is trying to say by how bureaucracy and human flaw impedes knowledge and inspiration for answers to difficult questions, whether it be extremely technical or just inspiration for unlocking answers can come from things such as the unconscious, drug use, and a non-formal education it still doesn't address if structuring knowledge is a truly useless endeavor. Would like to do more extensive reading to understand why Feyreband's brand of epistemological anarchism was so controversial."
30,1846684056,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5957642-jani-petri,4,"  This is fantastic. The book gives a human face to scientific endeavour and this face isn't always pretty. Authors also discusses problems with the extremely specialized and ""sterile"" way science is usually done as well as about the role scientists should play as advocates also when their science gives reasons for it. Scientists should not be like monks in a monastery. Quite true, quite true."

Authors also discusses problems with the extremely specialized and ""sterile"" way science is usually done as well as about the role scientists should play as advocates also when their science gives reasons for it. Scientists should not be like monks in a monastery. Quite true, quite true."
