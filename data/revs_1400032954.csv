0,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66799591-amit-mishra,4,It was a pleasure reading this book. the book has given an eneormous amount of information about the great name Newton. I can say before reading this book the man I knew but the story I didn't. 
1,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,2,"I read this to compliment my reading of Quiet by Susan Cain, thinking that studying the life of one of the most famous introverts will give me greater insight.But all James Gleick provides is a cursory summary of Newton's work and hardly touches on his personal life and not at all on his character or personality. The book is also a history of the enlightenment age, the growth of the Royal Society, of the rivalries that drove its growth, and the role they played in transmission of information.How can one understand a man willing to fill millions of words worth of pages with new and imaginative thrusts into the unknown, with no intention to publish and only giving them away in reluctant small portions; a man who took 30 years to publish his greatest work. Even after he became famous, he resorted to publishing under the cloak of anonymity about his own works as well as his critics.Newton was told by his well-wishers that this withholding of his work only helped in losing recognition for himself and benefit for others. This was sadly illustrated when Leibniz published his own version of Calculus - this prompted Newton to finally bring out his own better and earlier version and start a fiery rivalry which overshadowed their achievements and constricted the growth of mathematics for almost a decade. But one good thing did came out of this - Newton started bringing out texts that he had kept hidden till then.He was also a dedicated pursuer of biblical and ancient texts, convinced that the ancients knew secrets hidden in these symbolisms. Another strange fact was that Newton made more money from being in charge of the public money minting office than from his scientific enquiries - He was the one who standardized England’s currency and made major contributions to economics and public policy too.The most intriguing part of the book is when Gleick details out Newton - The Alchemist, probably the greatest of the esoteric order. It was another of the various facets of his life and enquiry that he never made public and came to light only years after his death. This was in fact the cause of his death - the mercury poisoning that resulted from his fascinated constant handling of ‘quicksilver’ which he believed to be the essence of all metals.While I cannot say that the book was of much use in aiding an understanding of Newton, the man, or that it was a detailed history of his thoughts and works, at the very least, I will never talk about how modern science killed Newtonian Physics. His vision of the universe was as metaphysical as the latest quantum advances, even though the most critics he ever had in his life was for these very metaphysical elements in his ‘Optics’.He was careful to only present to the public those ideas which he could back up by experimentation, but this does not mean that this powerful mind did not explore and push the same boundaries that we now grapple with in the vast eternities of his solitude.He was a scientist, alchemist, philosopher, epistemologist, economist, a theologian, and the last of the magicians; combining and distilling all of this vast knowledge into the simple truths that we all know today. Newton was a great of the modern age, not of a quaint age which we have surpassed as we like to imagine. I would like to agree with Byron as he sang, ""Man fell with apples; and with apples rose."""

At that point it was mostly calculations that I was hardly interested in and there was little about how Newton actually lived his life. I’m glad that I did keep reading because I found myself enjoying much of the later parts. He was celibate and he possibly never saw the ocean, yet he could understand the universe like no one before him. Newton was a genius and, because of him, it is hard to imagine how humans thought before him. "
3,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,4,"Isaac Newton was a wizard?!* I love that there was a time, only just a few hundred years ago, in which men attempted wizardy-like experiments, working magic if you will, in their attempts to turn lead into gold and what have you. That's awesome. As a nice ""getting to know you"" leaping off point, Gleick's book is a good starter bio about Newton's life in general. It gives summary details of his theories and work without bogging the reader down too much. Anyone looking to do a study on Newton will need to dig a bit deeper than this. * I stand by my comment, because if women could be condemned as witches and put to death for it, grown men who dabble in alchemy, revered as they may be, can and should be made to withstand the ""wizard"" label, for better or worse."
4,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,4,"'Though Newton is no physicist, his book is very interesting...'This quote from Newton's contemporary Nicolas Malebranche sums up much of Gleick's excellent biography. Newton is to us a towering figure, arguably the single greatest scientist who ever lived - in fact he was so influential that science as we know it owes an incalculable debt to his vision. He didn't so much invent the modern way of looking at the world as he tore down the existing worldview, categorically proved it to be lacking, and then single-handedly constructed a new view. To people like Malebranche, speaking of Newton's masterwork the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, this change was simply too much - Newton wasn't a scientist because he so radically redefined what the term even meant.Gleick captures this cataclysm and rebirth in a way that is elegant, engaging, and entertaining. His prose is almost poetic in how much meaning is conveyed per word, and the book has the feel of a finely crafted work of art. It reads very easily while simultaneously communicating a huge amount of information - truly the holy grail of science communication.The book provides a chronological biography of Newton, focusing less on the man himself and instead on his work - his letters, mathematics, and publications - letting the words speak for his personality. As is often the case with great scientists, it turns out that Newton was a bit of a dick. In corresponding with several recurring characters he shows himself to be cold, ruthless, and brilliant. A deep psychological analysis of his character is avoided here because that is available in other, weightier tomes that frankly after this I have no interest in reading. But enough is shown to convince at least this reviewer that Newton was a truly unique, strange individual.This brings me to the best comparison I can make to this book - the excellent The Strangest Man by Graham Farmelo about Paul Dirac. Newton and Dirac were similar in many ways, and so are their biographies. Where Farmelo succeeds compared to Gleick however is that he introduces an overarching theme or narrative to the book, namely Dirac's relationship with his father. Such a narrative thread is rather lacking from Gleick's biography, which might be a consequence of trying to condense things down to a brief format. This does mean the book doesn't live up to it's full potential, but it's not far short.A great biography, meticulously researched, beautifully written."
5,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1852826-g-brett,4,"After reading Quicksilver, the first book in Neal Stephenson’s Baroque Cycle, I became very interested to learn more about some the historical figures around whom the story revolved – Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle, John Wilkens, Christopher Wren, …, and Isaac Newton, the founders and early members of the Royal Society. Given my interest in physics, optics, and math, especially Isaac Newton.Fortunately for me, James Gleick’s biography of Newton, simply titled 
Isaac Newton
, was published earlier that year (2003). Gleick was not new to me – both Chaos: Making a New Science and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman, have a place on my bookshelves – so I had high hopes for his biography of Newton. I was not disappointed.Chances are you’ve heard of Isaac Newton, if for nothing else than the fact that he came up with the idea of gravity when he saw an apple fall from a tree. (Which, by the way, is a vast oversimplification.) You may have even heard of his 3 laws of motion or that he invented – some might say discovered – the calculus. You may even think that he invented calculus so he could figure out his laws of motion. (As it turns out, he used geometry.)Newton didn’t actually publish – or care to publish – his work in mathematics, or anything else, until someone else published similar work. Unlike the rest of the fellows of the Royal Society, who were interested in sharing their new found knowledge as much as possible, Newton experimented and discovered and wrote to satisfy his own curiosity, not that of anyone else. Only in the very recent past have the many documents of Newton come to light, and it is through these many documents that Gleick tells this unique story of arguably the greatest mind ever.Considering the subject, the book is relatively short with just under 200 pages of main text and about 50 pages of notes. It is a pretty quick read, though I did find that flipping back and forth to the end notes tended to slow me down. And if you are looking for detailed discussion and analysis of the actual content of Newton’s various writings, this is not your book.If, however, you want to gain an understanding of what drove Newton, of why he wanted to figure things out, and get a glimpse into his incredible mind, this is an excellent book with which to begin."
6,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53179837-george,3,"Previous biographies I read have spoiled me, so that I can only say that this book is a competent little introduction to the life and work of Isaac Newton, that leaves me hungry for more. And I hear that ""Never at rest"" by Richard S. Westfall is excellent. This is perfect light reading for these times. "
7,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4475418-howl-of-minerva,4,"Crisp, concise, a great introduction that leaves you wanting to know more. Others seem to have found it dry, I found it gripping. Given that Newton had little or nothing by way of what we'd normally consider a 'personal life' I suspect a much longer biography would be tedious. "
8,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294729-ben-siems,4,"This is a very compelling look at the life of an extraordinarily brilliant and complex man who profoundly influenced the course of modern history. Living as we do in an era when science and religion tend to be seen as fundamentally contradictory, it is fascinating to read of the curious young theologian who truly believed God's greatest wish was for humanity to discover the mechanisms that drive the movements of the universe—to, as Newton described it, transcend the finite boundaries of our being and reach toward infinity itself.As in all writings on Newton, there is the requisite clarification of the mythology surrounding him—yes, he did spend much time in his uncle's apple orchard during his early twenties, when he began developing the new mathematics that would come be known as the calculus, and no, he did not ""discover"" gravity or incur any apple-induced head injuries. But mostly, Gleick's biography is a look at Newton's humanity, and the sometimes intriguing, sometimes revolting contradictions that defined his charismatic personality. One sees, for instance, Newton's all but pathological paranoia over others stealing his ideas, and then the disturbing irony that several of the most famous quotes attributed to him—indeed, those usually presented as evidence of his humility and nobility of spirit—were, in fact, almost entirely plagiarized from his predecessors.Being a biography, this book is not primarily aimed at exploring the specifics of Newton's scientific or mathematical discoveries. However, one could no more write a biography of Newton without some discussion of mathematics than one could explain Mozart without reference to music. It is therefore helpful to have a small amount of familiarity with calculus and physics. That being said, there were scientific matters in the book that I didn't understand, and I didn't find that to be a problem.Truly a fascinating story of an incredibly influential historical figure."
9,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16404987-john-behle,3,"This is a fair, standard recap of Issac Newton's life. Gleick gives each discovered scientific principle its due. Newton's long career is documented well. He was Master of The Royal Mint for 30 years. Also on his extensive resume is President of The Royal Society. Newton wrote endlessly--most of his writings survive, even his first childhood notebook, with drawings. He bought it with his own money. His father died before Newton was born. His mother left the three year old Issac to her mother so she could remarry more easily.What you know about Newton is true--his massive intelligence removed him from most joys and foibles of everyday life. In all the various meeting minutes and diary entries from associates, it is recorded that he laughed but once. The apple falling from his garden tree story that prompted Newton to devise the equations for gravity is here too. Heck with apples, Newton quickly went on to crack the code of the gravity that holds the planets in orbit. This is the bio of someone living inside his mind--a tremendously gifted, extreme mind. Newton was not a people person. Confronting Newton on science, or even daily business, would anger him.The book is popular length--this is not a 750 page treatise. I listened to the audiobook read by British actor Allan Corduner. At five CDs total, it is just long enough to do justice to this genius and does not wear out its welcome. "
10,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4631512-kirsty-darbyshire,2,"I was enjoying this book, but it slowly bored me to death. Newton's work is (to put it very very mildly) really interesting and terribly significant. And there's lots of it. But writing about it without ever writing an equation makes it tedious to read. I just got bored.And he had an interesting life too - rags to riches fairytale stuff. But we know so little about most of it and Gleick's made it so heavy with notes-at-the-back that I care less now than I did when I started the book.Not enough detail in the science to make it worth reading for that; and not enough of the in depth biography style anecdote and intimate stuff to make it worth reading for that. I should have left it on the library shelf."
11,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Newton was a very odd man. He once said that his greatest achievement was his lifetime of celibacy. An achievement indeed, but perhaps his optics and laws of motion have had a more lasting impact on the world.Newton is without doubt one of the greatest geniuses of all time. But he was also more than a little eccentric. The warning, don't try this at home, clearly applies to his sticking things into his eye to see how it worked.This book gives a very brief, but fascinating insight into the life of a man who quite literally changed the world."
12,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16896341-sotiris-makrygiannis,3,"Is a brief summary of his work and timeline, not much in details but here and there...on his wonderful achievements. "
13,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555413-vishy,4,"When I was wondering which book to read next, James Gleick's biography of Isaac Newton leapt at me. At less than 200 pages, it wasn't too long, and so I read it in a couple of days. This book covers all the important events in Isaac Newton's life, starting from his birth in a farm, when his father was no more, how he ended up in school, how he went to Cambridge University, how his career progressed from there, how he discovered the law of gravitation and the three laws of motion, how he invented Calculus, his spats with famous scientists of his time including Robert Hooke and Gottfried Leibniz, how he became the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and later became a member of the Royal Society, how he later got the King's patronage and headed the Mint, and what happened after that. James Gleick's style is natural and breezy and the book moves at an easy pace. It is very accessible to readers who find books on science challenging or who avoid such books. If I remember right, there is not a single equation in the book. I loved the depiction of the intellectual fights that Isaac Newton had with Robert Hooke and Gottfried Leibniz. My teenage self hated Robert Hooke and backed Newton in the first fight. But my teenage self also backed Leibniz against Newton in the second fight 😁 (Mostly because Leibniz' system of Calculus is what we use now, because it is far superior to Newton's system, which is cumbersome.) After reading this book now, I find my older and more mature self backing Newton in both the disputes. I don't know whether it is because Newton was the aggrieved party in both the disputes, or whether it is because the book is biased and leans towards Newton. I need to read more on this. The book also doesn't shy away from describing Newton's adventures in alchemy, and also some of the darker sides of Newton, like when he becomes the head of the Royal Society, and he runs it like an autocrat. An interesting thing in the book which I couldn't stop thinking about was Newton's relationship with his mother. When Newton was born his father was no more and his mother was a widow. When he was three years old, his mother married a rich man. This rich man wanted a wife, but didn't want an add-on kid. So according to the arrangements made, Newton was left with his grandmother who brought him up, while his mother went to live with her new husband. Years later, when Newton was ten years old, the rich man died, and Newton's mother returned back. She was wealthy now as she had inherited her husband's money. The first thing she did after coming back was send Newton to school which was in a nearby town. Newton ended up boarding with the apothecary in that town and worked part-time there, while in school. When Newton was sixteen, his mother summoned him back home, and asked him to get started on his work as a farmer. Newton hated farm-related work and did badly. Then his mother's brother stepped in and helped Newton get into Cambridge. Even there, Newton's mother refused to sponsor Newton's education properly - he joined as a student in the lowest category. The students in this category 'earned their keep by menial service to other students, running errands, waiting on them at meals, and eating their leftovers'. Later, it appears that Newton and his mother kept up a correspondence which was polite and familial, and when his mother suffered from a serious illness, Newton left his work and came back home, and stayed with her till the end. It is a very interesting story of a family. Newton's mother doesn't come through with flying colours at all, in that story, because she avoided taking care of him when he was a child, but tried to make him take up responsibility and become a farmer when he became a teenager. This probably led to Newton being introverted, solitary and reclusive all his life - he was never attracted to women, he never married, and he never had close friends, except maybe one or two people in his later life. But his mother also sent him to school and later sent him to Cambridge. If she hadn't done that, Newton would have stayed in the farm and would have been a careless, below-average farmer. One of the greatest scientists of all time would have been lost in the depths of an English farm. So was Newton's mother a good parent or a bad parent? What do you think? One of the amazing things that we discover through the book is that Isaac Newton was an ordinary person with respect to socio-economic circumstances. His father was an illiterate farmer. He was expected to become a farmer too. He didn't have access to books the way we do. Even when he joined Cambridge, he had one notebook. In those days, paper was valuable, because it was probably handmade, and it was a luxury, if you had one notebook. This was the world that the young Isaac Newton lived in. Living in this world, Newton discovered gravity and invented the beautiful, complex field of Calculus. Calculus was so far ahead of its time that most people didn't understand it. It is a challenging subject even today, nearly 350 years later - I struggled with Calculus when I first encountered it. As James Gleick describes at the beginning of the book - ""I don't know what I may seem to the world, "" Newton said before he died, ""but, as to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."" An evocative simile, much quoted in the centuries that followed, but Newton never played in the seashore, boy or man. Born in a remote country village, the son of an illiterate farmer, he lived in an island nation and explained how the moon and the sun tug at the seas to create tides, but he probably never set eyes on the ocean. He understood the sea by abstraction and computation."" It is amazing how someone who had so little could accomplish so much. It is so inspiring. It offers hope for the rest of us - that we don't need so much. We need just one or two fresh notebooks, some pens and pencils, some textbooks, some solitude and quiet, lots of intellectual curiosity and passion, and an inclination to work hard. If we have this, we can accomplish one or two things. I get goosebumps just thinking about this.I loved James Gleick's biography of Isaac Newton. It is written in spare and breezy prose, the technical content is not too challenging, and the book is very accessible for a general reader.Have you read this book? What do you think about it?"
14,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072527-nicholas,3,"Perhaps I'm predisposed, keeping figures like Einstein and Feynman in mind, to the idea that great minds are inherently liberal. Not in politics necessarily, but in personality. It's hard to imagine someone of the intellectual stature of the inventor of the calculus and modern mechanics not being magnanimous, generous, giving and wanting to share his success with the world; being encouraging to fellows pursuing difficult questions and charitable in his political stances toward the accumulation and practice of new scientific knowledge. Gleick's cutting biography of Newton has disabused me of this notion. Revealed through Mr. Newton's own personal correspondence and notes comes to light a figure that is craven, withdrawn, and as petty and vindictive as he was absolutely, stunningly, incomprehensibly brilliant. His mind and his achievements put into perspective what we might call ""genius"" by modern standards and force us to see how short that term falls. Around his work is built the edifice of modern science, a three hundred year quest formulated and enabled by the ""tools"" Newton created mostly in seclusion during the plague years 1665-1666 from his family home in Woolsthorpe. A more brooding significant historical figure can hardly be imagined, except perhaps for some of the later histories and accounts of the life of Lincoln. I'd read some spurious anecdotes about Newton's proclivities form other historians of science, mainly Bill Bryson in his Brief History of Nearly Everything that created some cracks in the lustrous portrait we've painted of the legend since the time of his death, but Gleick's account delves much further to reveal just how unstable and truly friendless Newton was. Not that he was without admirers, though perhaps he accumulated those in far greater numbers after he was dead and not around to harangue, cajole, manipulate and condescend to them any more. He spent thirty-five years at Cambridge, most of them as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and in the entire time there, produced not a single friend. He was introspective and fearful of the judgment of others to the point of hysteria at times, and his writings, painstakingly collected and organized by Gleick reveal it. Gleick is a phenomenal historian of science in that he is perfectly comfortable with the ideas he is trying to convey as well as the historical impact of the ideas themselves. His prose fluctuates from the intimidatingly terse, in a Cormac McCarthy style of recounting, to the lofty and eloquent, elevating the figures of his narrative and their achievements to awe-inspring status. It's at once revelatory and myth-making - a balance of the real and pragmatic and the idyllic and I like it a lot. That being said, I think that the book's narrative also fluctuates between really captivating anecdotes and analysis to pages of quotations from Newton or his contemporaries that attempt to let them tell the story themselves with little analysis in between on the historical import of such events or happenings. Having read The Information first, I can clearly see this book as a period of gestation for those later themes and ideas, particularly the role that information and it's effective communication was going to have on the technological and scientific developments that were to come. Of particular interest to Gleick again in this work is symbology - the connection between words, symbols and ideas and the literal things they represent. It's difficult to imagine talking about things like Newton's laws of mechanics without the proper terminology, which he had to invent, or re-appropriate from their common usage. Words like force, mass, gravity, all had to be redefined to fit into a new paradigm of motion broken free from the millennia long grip of Aristotelean philosophy. But whereas The Information had a unifying theme, this book does not. Granted, it is biography, the objective of which is to tell a life story. Perhaps it's a wonderful conceit that Gleick avoids making judgments on Newton and lets the man speak for himself across the centuries, but at the same time, I was hoping for more. What do we make of Newton? What place does he hold in history? Is he a fundamental figure that defines the beginning of the modern era in reason, science and mathematics? Was he the last of a line of animists who believed in magic and superstition (he was a devoted and secretive alchemist most of his life as well)? Was he a bridge between? The reader is left free to interpret his life on its own, but as such it feels more like an encyclopedic entry, or a tome of primary source material than an historical analysis. Think this one is about three and a half stars for me, but I'll choose to be conservative and round down. I guess that makes it 3.4999. Still, a great book if all you know about Newton is what your math or physics teacher told you about in passing and the amount of work put in to the research for this book is no laughing matter at all. Gleick's bibliography and notes run almost seventy pages. He knows his stuff and he knows how to organize it and he's definitely cemented himself in my opinion is the finest science historian and commentator of the present era, a true successor to people like Thomas Khun."
15,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25108-andy,3,"A nondescript biography of Isaac Newton that nearly exemplifies what I'd consider to be an average book. There's no particular focus on one aspect of his life or another; it's a fairly straightforward treatment, almost like a long Wikipedia article, with many tidbits brought up here and there but no particular facet explored too deeply. This is not in and of itself a problem but I think that if a writer wants to take this approach, he has to do a really good job of grabbing the reader by the collar and making his subject compelling. I don't think Gleick does this consistently. Occasionally promising items, such as his adversarial relationships with Hooke and Leibniz, his tendency towards secretiveness to the point of ciphering his findings in his correspondences, or his internal struggles with the doctrine of the Trinity, are too often briefly discussed and put aside. If you're going to take this approach, you need to make every anecdote and every remark memorable, lest you fall into a laundry-list pattern. If I were Gleick, I would have focused around a really interesting idea that (like too many other things) he only mentions briefly, which is John Maynard Keynes's quotation that ""Newton was not the first of the age of reason.... He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago."" This is a great central theme - not merely Newton as the bridge between magic and science, but Newton himself belonging clearly on the ancients' side of that bridge. Subjects like Newton's intense religious struggles, his practice of alchemy, and the incipient disentanglement between philosophical metaphysics and modern physics would branch nicely from this idea. Perhaps this biography has already been written by someone prior to Gleick, but if it hasn't, it unfortunately wasn't written by him either. "
16,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26573870-feisty-harriet,3,"Prior to reading this book the only things I knew (or thought I knew) about Newton was that he ""discovered gravity"" when an apple hit him in the head, and that he was knighted by the British Empire, and that he probably figured out a lot of other math and science things. So, two of the three are right. Gravity wasn't ""discovered"" by anyone, it was just defined, and Newton himself refuted the apple story in his lifetime. So much for science according to Saturday morning cartoons. I also didn't realize how long ago Newton lived, people were still debating whether the earth was round or flat in the 1600's (er, and in the 2000-teens...ahem) and didn't know that the tides and the moon were linked, or about any kind of waves other than the ones on the seashore (light waves, radio waves, sound waves, etc). Newton was a scary-smart genius who was self-taught, he was also the first of the Smart Dead Guys to acknowledge that his progress in philosophy, math, and science was due to studying those who came before him. The quote about ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" is from him."
17,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2310818-peter,2,"Information was not communicated well (midway through what I consider a normally attentive reading I was unable to answer questions about what his stepfather did and whether he had siblings). It wasn't clear what were his major accomplishments - nowhere does it say ""first optics, then calculus, now gravity"" (are those them? Did I get them in the right order?) The book reads too much like a journal, ""in the shit"" the whole time with little attention to the past and future. I feel like the author hasn't mastered the material. Then again maybe I just don't read well."
18,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,3,"Newton is not much less of a cypher to me after reading this than he was before, which is unfortunate, because what I really wanted was insight into his character. I'm left with the impression of a man with a big, fragile ego, much less a scientist in the modern sense than I expected because of his reluctance to publish his results, despite his obvious genius, which has come to shape our modern world philosophically and technologically.I don't know if Gleick chose not to focus on character or if there isn't much evidence, but if you want the bare facts of Newton's life and what he acheived, then this book will give you them in a compact, digestible form."
19,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/433768-colin,4,"Newton is such a foundational figure for physicists that it’s difficult to imagine him as an actual human being. The paucity of biographical documents and his own reclusiveness and penchant for secrecy exacerbate this problem. Then there’s the centuries-long poetic redefinition of who he was and what he meant to human knowledge that further obscures things; the story of the apple (which isn’t true) illustrates how the real man is now all but obliterated by the myth.Gleick, as usual, does an excellent job of cutting through to what we actually know about the situation. It’s not a coincidence that this is a small book; the story of Isaac’s childhood is over in the first twenty pages since we know so little about it. He was incredibly curious and precocious, trying to ferret out knowledge for himself and given to measuring anything he could get his hands on. He was born to be a farmer, but through lucky interventions by adults he was sent to Cambridge to study, something that must have been a rare privilege for his place and time.It’s worth pausing here to mention comparisons with another foundational figure, George Washington. Both men were born into farming but became vastly more than that, revolutionizing their (professional) fields and later, the entire world. Fruit trees figure prominently and falsely in the myths of both men. Renouncing the world and rejecting public honors are strong themes in the lives of both — Newton’s refusal to publish his work for years, Washington’s resignation and refusal to become a king — although both later came to positions of great power, as president of the Royal Society and the United States, respectively. A strange but compelling connection.Newton’s middle years seem to mostly be a story of extreme social isolation — he was a reclusive and secretive figure even in his cloistered Trinity College — peppered with irregular correspondence with other scientists (a term that hadn’t been invented yet) and mathematicians that he seems to have largely regretted. He was completely intolerant of disagreements with his scientific conclusions and hated being challenged or drawn into disputes; his hatred for many other prominent scientists of his day (particularly Hooke and Leibnitz) seems pathological even compared to the pettiness of modern academia.But despite those frustrations, he also never fully withdrew and cut off ties with the wider research community. He seems to have actively teased other researchers by saying that he had solved important mathematical problems that were bedeviling them, but not revealing the solution. He must have known that this would only invite more scrutiny, not less, but he kept doing it. Something in him hungered for honors and recognition at the same time as something else wanted nothing to do with other people, whom he generally seems to have felt were inferior. Not a single person appears to have won his open intellectual respect, which is unjustified given how many other brilliant minds were at work during his lifetime, whom he knew.He clearly played dirty when it suited his purposes. He pried loose astronomical observational data from John Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, and later published it without approval very much against Flamsteed’s wishes. Given Newton’s refusal to publish his own work, this seems particularly unfair. He wrote anonymous review articles trashing Leibnitz and glorifying himself (although that was going on in reverse as well) and refused to accept that Leibnitz had done any original work on the calculus, contrary to what modern historians of science now believe. He also seemed extremely talented at making enemies; more or less everyone who dealt with him wound up in conflict with him. Although he defined our modern concept of rational scientific inquiry, his pattern of intellectual effort was profoundly emotional, anti-social and self-glorifying. He might possibly be the worst research collaborator in history.Gleick lays out the story of the writing and publication of the Principia in some satisfying detail. Halley was the key figure in making it actually happen. After the first book (of three) was published, a characteristic Newton-esque battle erupted when Hooke suggested he deserved some credit for the inverse-square law, which he had contemplated, without any evidence or mathematical rigor, a few years earlier. Newton flew off the handle, and deleted any mention of Hooke from the later books. (He nursed this fury for years, and mostly refused to have anything to do with the Royal Society so long as Hooke remained president.)Halley meanwhile had gotten himself in a bit of a strange position by getting the Royal Society to agree to sponsor the publication of the Principia, but without paying for it. The Society had only published one book before this, the History of Fishes (you can’t make this stuff up) which had been a commercial disaster. Halley would have to front the money for the Principia and get paid in unsold copies of History of Fishes. (For those who complain about excessively-specialized scientific research journals today, this is what the other extreme looks like!)Lurking behind the weird publication history is a point about language that deserves some closer attention. We take for granted today that words like gravity and momentum are straightforward, and we use them instinctively in many more contexts than pure physics (“I’m going to keep working on this draft because I’ve got some good momentum”). But those words didn’t have clear or fixed meanings in Newton’s day, and the physical concepts he was struggling to articulate remained out of reach of understanding so long as he couldn’t name them.There’s a powerful whiff of Whorfianism in this — until and unless you can build a vocabulary for physical concepts like gravity and momentum, you can’t fully conceive of them. In part what Newton contributed through Principia is the vocabulary for classical physics/mechanics, which was just as important as the mathematical structure underneath those concepts.Newton’s contribution to this specific scientific vocabulary also set a profound precedent, namely that a vital part of the process of scientific inquiry is to name or label physical phenomena that we don’t fully understand, and capture the thing in a word. That has been at the absolute heart of scientific progress ever since: a modern physics example is the word “quantum”, which was appropriated and used to define a physical phenomenon still poorly understood when the naming occurred, but which could not be productively investigated and analyzed without a clear and unique name.Other examples run the gamut from “evolution” to “virus” to “radiation” — all scientific discoveries that had to be encapsulated in language before human minds could truly grasp, analyze and understand them. We think of Newton as bringing us the mathematics behind foundational physics, but we should thank him equally for establishing the core tenet that language must be at the heart of scientific inquiry, regardless of the specific subfield of science.In his 50s, Newton gave up Cambridge and his monastic academic life for good (he “left no friends behind” as Gleick notes) to take up the post of the head of the national Mint. He oversaw a standardization and improvement of coins, aggressively pursuing counterfeiters, all the way to executions in some cases (it was a capital offense). This transition is strange and confusing to the modern understanding of Newton, dealing as it does with such practical and applied problems as standard coinage. He also made a huge amount of money (in the sense of acquisition, as well as manufacturing) for the first time in his life. This Newton is almost unrecognizable as the progenitor of the laws of motion, but he poured himself into the work and made a serious contribution to the national economy. This is the period when he received his knighthood, a world away from his cloistered ivory tower.Gleick concludes with Newton’s final days, when he was still concealing much of his writing on alchemy and other highly non-scientific topics. He died very wealthy (and old: eighty-four) but left no will. His papers were scattered into various private collections, with Keynes recovering some of them in the 1930s. As he put it, Newton was the “last of the magicians”, not truly of the Age of Reason despite his profound role in launching it. This is a sobering thought for a physicist, to see such scientific genius accompanied by irrationality and pre-modern thinking that we would laugh at today. We will have more scientific revolutions in the future, no doubt, but probably none will be sparked by a person of such deeply unscientific bent, regardless of what later ages tried to shape him to be.Cross-posted from Medium."
20,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"At the end of this short, competent, thought not overly analytical biography, James Gleick teases out the great irony of William Blake's portrayal of Newton as a cold, godless rationalist. Newton was anything but: a crank and a religious esotericist, he spent much of his life studying alchemy and biblical conspiracy theories, and the reason that he refused to take religious vows as part of his role as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge was not that he thought science and theology ought to be separated, but rather because he fervently believed in the fourth-century Arianist heresy (namely, that the Son possessed more corporeal qualities than were accepted by the Council of Nicaea). I read this because I really enjoyed Gleick's The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood, and this one is similarly blessed with lucid and thorough explanations of the technical stuff. Newton's Principia was famously (and intentionally) difficult, but Gleick guides the reader with a sure hand through the underlying breakthroughs in optics, the Laws of Motion, and the invention of differential calculus. He also places the insights into their proper context of history, both intellectual (the sea change of the Age of Reason initiated by Descartes' investigations) and social (the petty, entertaining spats Newton had with interlocutors such as Robert Hooke and Leibniz). It took two centuries until Einstein overturned some of the Newtonian system's assumptions, but Newton's laws and his method of scientific inquiry remain the way we think about the world - rational, disinterested, quantitative. After John Maynard Keynes bought some of Newton's papers at an auction, he said: ""Newton was not the first of the Age of Reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes that began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than `10,000 years ago."" True as that may be, the change which he affected ushered in the world of modern science. "
21,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5590114-greg,1,"I listened to this on audiobook, and no amount of appealing British accent on the recording could hide the fact that this is an unconscionable abbreviation of the life of Isaac Newton. It's a high-flying overview of the things that Newton was interested in and a shallow, superficial pass over his personal life and tendencies. How could the author have done this little with so much subject matter to work with? The issue is called into sharp relief when I'm reading Janet Browne's biography of Charles Darwin. Hers is long, yes, but it shows and teaches a deep understanding of the times, life, and mind of its subject. One can feel the confusion, excitement, and fear in Darwin's mind, and trace the steps that lead him up and through his discoveries and professional life. Compare with Gleick's picture of Newton--a single-minded hermit of a man who, broadly speaking, could be characterized as ""English"" in all of the varied interpretations of that word.Reading this book feels like when you're flying over Arizona on your way to LA, and the pilot comes on the intercom and tells you that you can see the Grand Canyon off the right side of the airplane. It was carved out by erosion over millions of years. My reaction is ""Yes, it's true, but isn't there...more? Something more interesting?"""
22,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"A first rate biography of Isaac Newton. The biography is a relatively short, standard cradle-to-grave account, with significant discussions of Newton's scientific thinking and discoveries, starting with mathematics, then optics, and finally physics -- not counting alchemy, biblical studies, and his role as master of the mint.James Gleick puts you directly into Newton's life and world through extensive quotations from letters and other documents, all with the original spellings. In some cases, like Newton's playing with infinite sums, Gleick reproduces a facsimile of the document itself.No scientific life I know is as full of bitter rivalries, secrecy, and a continuum from the ultra-rational to the completely irrational. Towards the end of the book Gleick quotes Keynes' apt description of Newton: ""Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago."""
23,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1274359-bradley,5,"Very fine introduction (or refresher) on the life of Isaac Newton. As a boy, my conception of Newton was of a man heroically revealing Truth to an awestruck world. This, of course, was a myth, made up in the years after Newton's death. The real Newton was far more interesting. Though perhaps we moderns obssess, without justice, over the darker aspects of his life, they are fascinating. The best parts of Gleick's treatment revolved around the gravity of Newton's alchemical pursuits: his feverish and secretive quest hunched over his furnace to discover what he thought were the real secrets of the Universe; the clandestine meetings, the pseudonyms, all were dark but pleasant surprises.Somehow, despite all his secrecy and feuding, Newton appears as a sympathetic figure in Gleick's book."
24,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,3,"John Maynard Keynes described Newton as the ""last of the magicians"" in 1942. This brief biography demonstrates some of that magic, exploring investigations into prisms, gravity, and mathematics, without delving deeply into his early life or posthumous influences.The focus here is not just on the discovery but the conflict - Hooke in the case of the Laws of Motion and Leibniz in the case of Calculus. It is perhaps telling that Calculus was Leibniz' term for this type of mathematics. Aspects of his life related to both discovery and conflict are also covered, especially his time at Cambridge and his Mastery of the Royal Mint.For many reviewers, this biography was too brief. More of a 30,000 foot view, I found it a good read but not great."
25,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87531-benebean,2,too technical-- if I wanted to know about more of the scientific specifics of how he formed his theories and the details of what they implied I'd read a a technical book not a bio. It seems this book is a summary of Newton's scientific work with a little bio instead of the other way around. It also doesn't help that I'm listening to this as an audiobook.
26,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,5,"I very much enjoyed learning about the struggles Newton went through growing up. The words we use today (Force, Energy, Momentum) had no connection in his day to those concepts, so it was very difficult to put his ideas into words. I'm a physics teacher, so I greatly appreciated this in-depth look at this giant in the field."
27,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,1,Gleick can write well. So how did this book turn out to be such a dim bulb?
28,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27632222-sjors,1,"A very little book about a very great man. A lazy effort, unworthy of the writer of 'Chaos'. A cash-grab. If you want to know more about Newton, read his Wikipedia entry instead of this.I picked up this book because I wanted to know more about the man behind the one of the most impressive scientific achievements of all time, but reading it left me disappointed. This book offers little (new) information for the readers, despite the fact that a very large part of Newton's energies were directed at alchemy and perfecting his personal version of the Arian heresy. I would think that the millions of words he devoted to these subjects should have merited something more that about 10 pages of description. Even the scientific discoveries / syntheses made by Newton are described very flatly and in no appreciable detail.Nor do we learn more about the personal life of the genius. He was a celibate all his life, although he went through a period of personal struggle in that respect when in his forties. Did he ever give it up? Gleick does not inquire. He never travelled more that 150 miles from where he was born. He was seen laughing only on one occasion. So what did he like? Gleick never lets us know. Newton really disliked public argument, but he still had nasty small-minded arguments with Hooke (who apparently suggested the inverse square law for gravity) and Leibnitz (who independently invented calculus but published first and deployed a much more useful notation) about precedence. Despite his lifelong reticence, he became Chairman of the Royal Society and Master of the Mint (and rich in the process). Gleick makes no effort to cast any light on Newton the man.The longer I think about this book, the more negative I become about it. Don't buy it!"
29,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27495132-godfrey,4,"I really enjoyed this biography of Isaac Newton. The author, James Gleick, in his often lyrical style of writing, draws a portrait of Newton based on the correspondences and journals of the Englishman and other biographies of him. For sure you will learn about the history of scientific thought from this book. More interestingly, you will learn about Newton the man. And the man who emerges I was surprised to meet. Newton is obsessive. A secretive and celibate recluse, he is at all points focused and at work; at work on experimenting, measuring, studying, and describing nearly all things. He wrote millions of words in journals that never saw publication, such as his ironically named “Waste Book” in which he essentially invented calculus. Beyond natural philosophy, i.e., what we today call science, he is also unexpectedly obsessed with alchemy and theology, spending countless hours experimenting with metallurgy and studying biblical scholarship. What drives the plot of this biography, though, is less Newton's intellectual passions and witnessing his developing “strength of mind”, but his social battles. The Newton we meet is “unsocial”, “competitive”, and “ruthless” in besting contemporary thinkers of his day vying for the acclaim and giant-hood of which he thought himself singularly worthy. This aspect of his personality I had not known before. In his searing intellectual “duels” with Hooke and Leibniz we see Newton more fully. It seems only because of his faithful disciple Edmond Halley (the mathematician and astronomer famous for using Newton’s math to predict the path of a comet), is Newton coaxed out of his unsmiling seclusion into publishing his works and beginning to join society more fully. He eventually became Master of the Mint for England, essentially in charge of printing coin for the kingdom; a position he held until his death and which made him a fortune he bequeathed to no one. A fascinating, well-crafted biography of a man, his time, and the world he wrought. "
30,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49404199-abbas,5,"Standing on the shoulders of giants.This book has brought to light many of Newton's personality characteristics. Not many details were mentioned on Newton's life and interactions, which is to be expected from a person living in the 17th century. This has made this biography relatively short. However, it is entertaining and pleasing."
31,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65334322-j-jones,0,Excellent historical work. Learned so much about Newton.
32,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55558982-zack-dixon,5,AudiobookAn excellent overview of Newton’s scientific contributions. The author did a very good job of describing these in a way that would not deter those with arithmophobia but also captivate those with a love of math. 
33,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4587507-ash,4,"Sir Isaac Newton is regarded as a genius. I recently got hold of his biography written by James Gleick, who has also authored Genius and Chaos. I always wanted to know more about Newton’s life. Having known Einstein’s biography, I was curious to know how Newton’s life was. “Newton was not a pleasant man“, is a statement about him that always comes to my mind, after having read Stephen Hawking’s review about Isaac Newton. He had too many adversaries and never had any friends. He was very lonely in his life ever since he was born. He was fatherless and his mother never wanted him. He neither got married nor did he ever involve in any relationship with any woman. His life is really intriguing.After knowing such less facts about his life, I always wanted to read more about his life. This book is very small and gives a brief overview of Newton’s life. It is not very technical with too many details. I found it little disappointing since it is written in a layman language, helpful for non-science students. There is no mathematics at all in it, which is what I expected to find. But still it mentions all the concepts in Mathematics that Newton came up with, starting with Differential and Integral calculus to Binomial theorems, Ellipses, curves, centre of curvature, radius of curvature, cycloid etc. Even though I knew about some of his works, I never knew that Newton has contributed so much to Science and Mathematics, until I read the book. I am really in awe of this man.He truly is a genius. I cannot think of another scientist who can be of match to him. No wonder he was the first scientist to receive Knighthood. It also talks about all the arguments that Newton got involved into. The famous one with Leibniz over calculus, the hatredness that Hooke and he had for each other. It also speaks of how he took Flamsteed’s findings and published them even though Flamsteed did not approve of it. It also talks about Newton’s interests in alchemy and his work on element Mercury, which I did not have much idea about. It also talks about Newton’s interest in Biblical matters. His contributions to time, space and motion, his findings on planetary motion, movement of the moon, tides, comets are commendable. He invented the reflecting telescope (one of which I own).Now that gravity is like a matter of common sense these days, it is interesting to know what people felt back then. How people thought it was something supernatural or magical and how they condemned Newton for that. I loved the lines which Newton had written and the author has quoted where he says that he did not care about what others thought and that he was satisfied that it had a mathematical backing And like I had read earlier that the apple falling on the head did not lead him to find out gravity, the author confirms this theory saying Newton never mentioned that in any of his notebooks.One of the most interesting facts about Newton that I learned was that Newton never did any kind of research to get acclaim. He worked on problems and came up with solutions only for “himself”. He always wanted to learn the ways of nature and it was his thirst for knowledge that made him explore more. Another interesting fact about him was that even though he had done lot of work on light and color, only after others forced him, he published his work after thirty years. He never published his findings, he liked to keep them to himself. The author says a lot about Newton’s involvement with Royal society and how he ended up becoming the president of it later on.What I liked in the book were the quotes, statements, figures drawn/written by Newton himself that the author has quoted. It feels good to read what Newton had written in letters to other scientists or the notes that he took in his book about his findings. Because of the presence of such authentic writings, you tend to believe in everything the author says about Newton. A thorough research about his life has been done by James Gleick and he needs to be praised for that.However not much light has been cast on some of the important phases of Newton’s life. He had a nervous breakdown at the age of fifty or so and I really wanted to know more about how he recovered from it, but it has been very briefly mentioned. Even though the author has mentioned lines from letters that Newton wrote to other scientists, it still felt incomplete.Overall: It is a great book if you want to know more about Newton’s life. A very interesting read and because of its size, does not take much time to complete it. I would give this book 4/5."
34,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40946339-francesca,2,"Newton is great, this biography not so much"
35,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4669367-william,4,"With Isaac Newton, James Gleick once again reasserts his credentials as a scientific historian and writer of the first rank, as well as winning the National Book Award, and as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. But rather than concentrate on the likes of the father of Quantum Electrodynamics, the late Richard Feynman, or the originator of fractal geometry, Benoît Mandelbrot, Gleick's focus in this book is on Sir Isaac Newton, whose works on optics, and the creation of differential and integral calculus, allowed scientists to accurately describe and predict the motion of the planets in our solar system through the force of gravity. The mechanics of gravity as described by Newton are the foundation for physics and natural philosophy.Gleick, with great erudition and clarity on his subject, but unlike his other works, with tremendous conciseness, presents Newton's nearly impoverished upbringing, early schooling, and his transformation from a reclusive and excentric observational scientist and theoretician, to a single force and beast that transformed the Royal Society, and later by appointment from the King of England, the Royal Mint. We also see the range of Newton's personal relationships with colleagues, supporters and rivals, from the likes of Sir Edmond Halley, to the reluctant correspondences with compatriot Robert Hooke, and fierce exchanges with the co-creator of calculus, Gottfried Leibniz. The portrait of Newton penned by Gleick is not one that casts Newton in a distorted forward-looking and modern scientist, but as an individual obsessed with the pursuits and techniques of alchemy of the ancients. Also illustrated is Newton as a philosopher and scholar of theology of great earnestness, who undertook with tremendous scrutiny, a rigorous review of early manuscripts of both the Old and New Testament to form an unorthodox and borderline heretical view of the trinity in Christianity. In this masterfully crafted biography, Gleick makes accessible and understandable one of the intellectual giants in the history of science a compelling read."
36,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15900418-randy,4,"A short book (200 pages), replete with quotes from Newton and contemporaries that I found so oblique as to be incomprehensible. Could no one then speak plainly? Certainly any man as tight-lipped as Newton is a tough nut to unfurl, having interacted personably with so few and having lived when the written word was tiresomely formal and indirect. Inevitably, anyone a sphinx then shall remain one forever, despite the picklocks of able biographers such as Gleick.In the end, the book was unsatisfying. I felt I never understood Newton at all as a man. What drove him? What led him to gain the audience that his ideas needed to propagate? Was it only his mastery of mathematics, or did his arguments somehow resonate with and satisfy the inquiring minds of his day in a way that no one before had for millenia? When a revolutionary like Newton arises, the first question must be, ""How was this man so exceptional?"" Aside from Newton's astonishing degree of independence, both socially and intellectually, I can't guess why 2000 years had to pass before this guy overshadowed Aristotle -- by obscuring him rather than standing on his shoulders. If Gleick fails anywhere, it's in setting the social and intellectual stage for Newton's arrival and the positive reception of his ideas among peers. Why was 1642-1727 so ripe for such a man as Newton?I know other books delve more into the rise of the enlightenment era (Boorstein, Pagden, Gottlieb). Maybe Gleick just didn't want his book to wander as afar as that inquiry would demand."
37,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780263-ken,3,"Isaac Newton was born January 4, in 1643. He was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and natural philosopher. He was also an alchemist and theologian.Newton is considered by many scholars and members of the general public to be one of the most influential people in human history.His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"" and usually called the Principia), published in 1687, is probably the most important scientific book ever written.The book lays the groundwork for most of classical mechanics. Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation.I have always found it very interesting that Newton was also highly religious. He was an unorthodox Christian, and during his lifetime actually wrote more on Biblical hermeneutics and occult studies than on science and mathematics."
38,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,4,"It's really astonishing what Isaac Newton did for the world. He applied mathematics to the problems of nature, and through it, created an order that defined physics without modification for 300 years, and is invaluable to this day. Furthermore, he was the son of a poor farmer, defining the tides, despite probably never actually seeing the ocean. Writing about the life of such a man is no easy undertaking. And yet Gleick does such a fantastic job of outlining the times, events, and accomplishments of this man in less than 200 pages. Here, Gleick describes Newton from his birth on a farm to his works as a young college student at Cambridge. During Newton's formative years, we find that he did not just work in mathematics and physics, but also in alchemy and theology, even going as far as to deny the Trinity. Newton was also notoriously withdrawn as a young man, never even bothering to publish most of his discoveries until much later in his career. Gleick also does a great job of describing the origins of many of Newton's legends (the apple, the ""shoulders of giants"", etc.). I probably would have rated it higher if I didn't know some of this stuff about Newton already. However, through beautiful prose and solid research, Gleick shows how, indeed, ""...we are all Newtonians""."
39,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375171-joseph,4,"For such an interesting figure, I knew remarkably little about Isaac Newton, which is what led me to this book in the first place. In truth, I'm not sure how much there is to know; I assume his personal life is better documented than some of his contemporaries (I'm thinking predominantly of Shakespeare), but by how much, frankly, I'm still unsure.Gleick, to be fair, doesn't seem particularly interested in details outside of what Newton accomplished, but he still manages to impart a sense of Newton, the man, in addition to the scientist. His obsessions, idiosyncrasies, and feuds help to flesh out a rather interesting story.Gleick does a great job of documenting his subject's accomplishments, presenting them in such a way as to remind us how firmly they've been ensconced in the realm of modern thought. And while I would have appreciated a greater sense of the world in which he lived, if only to provide a better context for what he achieved, Gleick deserves credit for a great biography of both the man and the birth of modern scientific thought."
40,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010687-steven-dzwonczyk,3,"This book taught me that Isaac Newton was not a one trick pony as many tend to describe him. He was influential in many realms including physics, philosophy, and the monetary system of England, for which he was knighted. While he essentially invented the modern formula for scientific thought, reasoning, and experimentation, he was a human who was subject to petty competition with colleagues and a propensity to cling to beliefs that were not supported by his observations.A contemporary of Edmund Haley, it is interesting to see how the ideas of one man were advanced by the other. It is unlikely that Newton would have thoroughly characterized gravity without Haley's astronomical observations, nor is it likely that Haley would have been able to predict the paths of comets without Newton's ideas of gravity.The last 20% of this book was a bit dry, but the first 80% was top notch and inspiring to me as a scientist. It makes me what to seek out biographies of other great scientists like Max Plank, Christiaan Huygens, and others. I identify with them in my daily work."
41,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10857670-troy-mattila,2,"Before saying anything I must admit I knew very little about Newton before reading this book, but I don't feel like I know much more after. There is certainly plenty of information in the book, but the timeline is not very fluid and often Gleick veers of topic to talk about the events surrounding Newton that seem to have no relevance to Newton. The Information is the only other Gleick book I have read, and this was written before it. In it you can tell that Gleick takes an interest in the advances in information transmission and retention, which is where he seems to go off topic. That being said, it is a very short book and inspired me to find a more detailed biography of Newton because Gleick does present him as a very interesting individual. Also, as far as I know there is not enough information about Newton to present a detailed biography and Gleick may have made due with what was available. I guess I will know once I decide to look further. All in all, worth the read but don't set high expectations."
42,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/176618-noiresque,3,"I listened to this book on CD over the last week.I found the reader's crisp, Jeremy Irons-like British accent to be helpful sometimes, but distracting an equal amount of the time.For a James Gleick book, I found this to be lacking in the insightful science that I'm used to from him.That being said, this was a good biography. Engaging, interesting, and at times, entertaining. This book does give you a true sense of the absolutely fundamental nature of Newton's discoveries to our current world. It's almost inconceivable.But this bio lacked the personal insights, to some extent, that make the person accessible.If you've already read some biographies of Newton, consider skipping this one. If not, this seems to be a good, solid tome on Sir Isaac.I read this simultaneously with Neal Stephenson's fictional account of Newton's time (which I'm still tackling). Stephenson's mostly factual accounts of Newton's experiments are far more entertaining and enlightening."
43,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2825576-andy,3,"A far more thorough account of the life of Newton than I had seen previously, this book certainly accomplished the task sought after by all authors of nonfiction - that of inspiring greater curiosity in the reader. After finishing, I feel like I've only scratched the surface of all there is to know about the complicated world of philosophy, politics, and science which existed during Newton's life.This biography details the work of Newton and places it all within the context of his connection to other great thinkers in Europe at the time, particularly the Royal Society of England. He is shown to be both enormously innovative and deeply flawed.

62,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55558982-zack-dixon,5,AudiobookAn excellent overview of Newton’s scientific contributions. The author did a very good job of describing these in a way that would not deter those with arithmophobia but also captivate those with a love of math. 
63,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4587507-ash,4,"Sir Isaac Newton is regarded as a genius. I recently got hold of his biography written by James Gleick, who has also authored Genius and Chaos. I always wanted to know more about Newton’s life. Having known Einstein’s biography, I was curious to know how Newton’s life was. “Newton was not a pleasant man“, is a statement about him that always comes to my mind, after having read Stephen Hawking’s review about Isaac Newton. He had too many adversaries and never had any friends. He was very lonely in his life ever since he was born. He was fatherless and his mother never wanted him. He neither got married nor did he ever involve in any relationship with any woman. His life is really intriguing.After knowing such less facts about his life, I always wanted to read more about his life. This book is very small and gives a brief overview of Newton’s life. It is not very technical with too many details. I found it little disappointing since it is written in a layman language, helpful for non-science students. There is no mathematics at all in it, which is what I expected to find. But still it mentions all the concepts in Mathematics that Newton came up with, starting with Differential and Integral calculus to Binomial theorems, Ellipses, curves, centre of curvature, radius of curvature, cycloid etc. Even though I knew about some of his works, I never knew that Newton has contributed so much to Science and Mathematics, until I read the book. I am really in awe of this man.He truly is a genius. I cannot think of another scientist who can be of match to him. No wonder he was the first scientist to receive Knighthood. It also talks about all the arguments that Newton got involved into. The famous one with Leibniz over calculus, the hatredness that Hooke and he had for each other. It also speaks of how he took Flamsteed’s findings and published them even though Flamsteed did not approve of it. It also talks about Newton’s interests in alchemy and his work on element Mercury, which I did not have much idea about. It also talks about Newton’s interest in Biblical matters. His contributions to time, space and motion, his findings on planetary motion, movement of the moon, tides, comets are commendable. He invented the reflecting telescope (one of which I own).Now that gravity is like a matter of common sense these days, it is interesting to know what people felt back then. How people thought it was something supernatural or magical and how they condemned Newton for that. I loved the lines which Newton had written and the author has quoted where he says that he did not care about what others thought and that he was satisfied that it had a mathematical backing And like I had read earlier that the apple falling on the head did not lead him to find out gravity, the author confirms this theory saying Newton never mentioned that in any of his notebooks.One of the most interesting facts about Newton that I learned was that Newton never did any kind of research to get acclaim. He worked on problems and came up with solutions only for “himself”. He always wanted to learn the ways of nature and it was his thirst for knowledge that made him explore more. Another interesting fact about him was that even though he had done lot of work on light and color, only after others forced him, he published his work after thirty years. He never published his findings, he liked to keep them to himself. The author says a lot about Newton’s involvement with Royal society and how he ended up becoming the president of it later on.What I liked in the book were the quotes, statements, figures drawn/written by Newton himself that the author has quoted. It feels good to read what Newton had written in letters to other scientists or the notes that he took in his book about his findings. Because of the presence of such authentic writings, you tend to believe in everything the author says about Newton. A thorough research about his life has been done by James Gleick and he needs to be praised for that.However not much light has been cast on some of the important phases of Newton’s life. He had a nervous breakdown at the age of fifty or so and I really wanted to know more about how he recovered from it, but it has been very briefly mentioned. Even though the author has mentioned lines from letters that Newton wrote to other scientists, it still felt incomplete.Overall: It is a great book if you want to know more about Newton’s life. A very interesting read and because of its size, does not take much time to complete it. I would give this book 4/5."

65,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4669367-william,4,"With Isaac Newton, James Gleick once again reasserts his credentials as a scientific historian and writer of the first rank, as well as winning the National Book Award, and as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. But rather than concentrate on the likes of the father of Quantum Electrodynamics, the late Richard Feynman, or the originator of fractal geometry, Benoît Mandelbrot, Gleick's focus in this book is on Sir Isaac Newton, whose works on optics, and the creation of differential and integral calculus, allowed scientists to accurately describe and predict the motion of the planets in our solar system through the force of gravity. The mechanics of gravity as described by Newton are the foundation for physics and natural philosophy.Gleick, with great erudition and clarity on his subject, but unlike his other works, with tremendous conciseness, presents Newton's nearly impoverished upbringing, early schooling, and his transformation from a reclusive and excentric observational scientist and theoretician, to a single force and beast that transformed the Royal Society, and later by appointment from the King of England, the Royal Mint. We also see the range of Newton's personal relationships with colleagues, supporters and rivals, from the likes of Sir Edmond Halley, to the reluctant correspondences with compatriot Robert Hooke, and fierce exchanges with the co-creator of calculus, Gottfried Leibniz. The portrait of Newton penned by Gleick is not one that casts Newton in a distorted forward-looking and modern scientist, but as an individual obsessed with the pursuits and techniques of alchemy of the ancients. Also illustrated is Newton as a philosopher and scholar of theology of great earnestness, who undertook with tremendous scrutiny, a rigorous review of early manuscripts of both the Old and New Testament to form an unorthodox and borderline heretical view of the trinity in Christianity. In this masterfully crafted biography, Gleick makes accessible and understandable one of the intellectual giants in the history of science a compelling read."
66,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15900418-randy,4,"A short book (200 pages), replete with quotes from Newton and contemporaries that I found so oblique as to be incomprehensible. Could no one then speak plainly? Certainly any man as tight-lipped as Newton is a tough nut to unfurl, having interacted personably with so few and having lived when the written word was tiresomely formal and indirect. Inevitably, anyone a sphinx then shall remain one forever, despite the picklocks of able biographers such as Gleick.In the end, the book was unsatisfying. I felt I never understood Newton at all as a man. What drove him? What led him to gain the audience that his ideas needed to propagate? Was it only his mastery of mathematics, or did his arguments somehow resonate with and satisfy the inquiring minds of his day in a way that no one before had for millenia? When a revolutionary like Newton arises, the first question must be, ""How was this man so exceptional?"" Aside from Newton's astonishing degree of independence, both socially and intellectually, I can't guess why 2000 years had to pass before this guy overshadowed Aristotle -- by obscuring him rather than standing on his shoulders. If Gleick fails anywhere, it's in setting the social and intellectual stage for Newton's arrival and the positive reception of his ideas among peers. Why was 1642-1727 so ripe for such a man as Newton?I know other books delve more into the rise of the enlightenment era (Boorstein, Pagden, Gottlieb). Maybe Gleick just didn't want his book to wander as afar as that inquiry would demand."
67,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780263-ken,3,"Isaac Newton was born January 4, in 1643. He was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and natural philosopher. He was also an alchemist and theologian.Newton is considered by many scholars and members of the general public to be one of the most influential people in human history.His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"" and usually called the Principia), published in 1687, is probably the most important scientific book ever written.The book lays the groundwork for most of classical mechanics. Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation.I have always found it very interesting that Newton was also highly religious. He was an unorthodox Christian, and during his lifetime actually wrote more on Biblical hermeneutics and occult studies than on science and mathematics."
68,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,4,"It's really astonishing what Isaac Newton did for the world. He applied mathematics to the problems of nature, and through it, created an order that defined physics without modification for 300 years, and is invaluable to this day. Furthermore, he was the son of a poor farmer, defining the tides, despite probably never actually seeing the ocean. Writing about the life of such a man is no easy undertaking. And yet Gleick does such a fantastic job of outlining the times, events, and accomplishments of this man in less than 200 pages. Here, Gleick describes Newton from his birth on a farm to his works as a young college student at Cambridge. During Newton's formative years, we find that he did not just work in mathematics and physics, but also in alchemy and theology, even going as far as to deny the Trinity. Newton was also notoriously withdrawn as a young man, never even bothering to publish most of his discoveries until much later in his career. Gleick also does a great job of describing the origins of many of Newton's legends (the apple, the ""shoulders of giants"", etc.). I probably would have rated it higher if I didn't know some of this stuff about Newton already. However, through beautiful prose and solid research, Gleick shows how, indeed, ""...we are all Newtonians""."
69,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375171-joseph,4,"For such an interesting figure, I knew remarkably little about Isaac Newton, which is what led me to this book in the first place. In truth, I'm not sure how much there is to know; I assume his personal life is better documented than some of his contemporaries (I'm thinking predominantly of Shakespeare), but by how much, frankly, I'm still unsure.Gleick, to be fair, doesn't seem particularly interested in details outside of what Newton accomplished, but he still manages to impart a sense of Newton, the man, in addition to the scientist. His obsessions, idiosyncrasies, and feuds help to flesh out a rather interesting story.Gleick does a great job of documenting his subject's accomplishments, presenting them in such a way as to remind us how firmly they've been ensconced in the realm of modern thought. And while I would have appreciated a greater sense of the world in which he lived, if only to provide a better context for what he achieved, Gleick deserves credit for a great biography of both the man and the birth of modern scientific thought."
70,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010687-steven-dzwonczyk,3,"This book taught me that Isaac Newton was not a one trick pony as many tend to describe him. He was influential in many realms including physics, philosophy, and the monetary system of England, for which he was knighted. While he essentially invented the modern formula for scientific thought, reasoning, and experimentation, he was a human who was subject to petty competition with colleagues and a propensity to cling to beliefs that were not supported by his observations.A contemporary of Edmund Haley, it is interesting to see how the ideas of one man were advanced by the other. It is unlikely that Newton would have thoroughly characterized gravity without Haley's astronomical observations, nor is it likely that Haley would have been able to predict the paths of comets without Newton's ideas of gravity.The last 20% of this book was a bit dry, but the first 80% was top notch and inspiring to me as a scientist. It makes me what to seek out biographies of other great scientists like Max Plank, Christiaan Huygens, and others. I identify with them in my daily work."

There is certainly plenty of information in the book, but the timeline is not very fluid and often Gleick veers of topic to talk about the events surrounding Newton that seem to have no relevance to Newton. The Information is the only other Gleick book I have read, and this was written before it. In it you can tell that Gleick takes an interest in the advances in information transmission and retention, which is where he seems to go off topic. That being said, it is a very short book and inspired me to find a more detailed biography of Newton because Gleick does present him as a very interesting individual. Also, as far as I know there is not enough information about Newton to present a detailed biography and Gleick may have made due with what was available. I guess I will know once I decide to look further. All in all, worth the read but don't set high expectations."

Engaging, interesting, and at times, entertaining. This book does give you a true sense of the absolutely fundamental nature of Newton's discoveries to our current world. It's almost inconceivable.But this bio lacked the personal insights, to some extent, that make the person accessible.If you've already read some biographies of Newton, consider skipping this one. If not, this seems to be a good, solid tome on Sir Isaac.I read this simultaneously with Neal Stephenson's fictional account of Newton's time (which I'm still tackling).

93,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4587507-ash,4,"Sir Isaac Newton is regarded as a genius. I recently got hold of his biography written by James Gleick, who has also authored Genius and Chaos. I always wanted to know more about Newton’s life. Having known Einstein’s biography, I was curious to know how Newton’s life was. “Newton was not a pleasant man“, is a statement about him that always comes to my mind, after having read Stephen Hawking’s review about Isaac Newton. He had too many adversaries and never had any friends. He was very lonely in his life ever since he was born. He was fatherless and his mother never wanted him. He neither got married nor did he ever involve in any relationship with any woman. His life is really intriguing.After knowing such less facts about his life, I always wanted to read more about his life. This book is very small and gives a brief overview of Newton’s life. It is not very technical with too many details. I found it little disappointing since it is written in a layman language, helpful for non-science students. There is no mathematics at all in it, which is what I expected to find. But still it mentions all the concepts in Mathematics that Newton came up with, starting with Differential and Integral calculus to Binomial theorems, Ellipses, curves, centre of curvature, radius of curvature, cycloid etc. Even though I knew about some of his works, I never knew that Newton has contributed so much to Science and Mathematics, until I read the book. I am really in awe of this man.He truly is a genius. I cannot think of another scientist who can be of match to him. No wonder he was the first scientist to receive Knighthood. It also talks about all the arguments that Newton got involved into. The famous one with Leibniz over calculus, the hatredness that Hooke and he had for each other. It also speaks of how he took Flamsteed’s findings and published them even though Flamsteed did not approve of it. It also talks about Newton’s interests in alchemy and his work on element Mercury, which I did not have much idea about. It also talks about Newton’s interest in Biblical matters. His contributions to time, space and motion, his findings on planetary motion, movement of the moon, tides, comets are commendable. He invented the reflecting telescope (one of which I own).Now that gravity is like a matter of common sense these days, it is interesting to know what people felt back then. How people thought it was something supernatural or magical and how they condemned Newton for that. I loved the lines which Newton had written and the author has quoted where he says that he did not care about what others thought and that he was satisfied that it had a mathematical backing And like I had read earlier that the apple falling on the head did not lead him to find out gravity, the author confirms this theory saying Newton never mentioned that in any of his notebooks.One of the most interesting facts about Newton that I learned was that Newton never did any kind of research to get acclaim. He worked on problems and came up with solutions only for “himself”. He always wanted to learn the ways of nature and it was his thirst for knowledge that made him explore more. Another interesting fact about him was that even though he had done lot of work on light and color, only after others forced him, he published his work after thirty years. He never published his findings, he liked to keep them to himself. The author says a lot about Newton’s involvement with Royal society and how he ended up becoming the president of it later on.What I liked in the book were the quotes, statements, figures drawn/written by Newton himself that the author has quoted. It feels good to read what Newton had written in letters to other scientists or the notes that he took in his book about his findings. Because of the presence of such authentic writings, you tend to believe in everything the author says about Newton. A thorough research about his life has been done by James Gleick and he needs to be praised for that.However not much light has been cast on some of the important phases of Newton’s life. He had a nervous breakdown at the age of fifty or so and I really wanted to know more about how he recovered from it, but it has been very briefly mentioned. Even though the author has mentioned lines from letters that Newton wrote to other scientists, it still felt incomplete.Overall: It is a great book if you want to know more about Newton’s life. A very interesting read and because of its size, does not take much time to complete it. I would give this book 4/5."
94,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40946339-francesca,2,"Newton is great, this biography not so much"
95,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4669367-william,4,"With Isaac Newton, James Gleick once again reasserts his credentials as a scientific historian and writer of the first rank, as well as winning the National Book Award, and as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. But rather than concentrate on the likes of the father of Quantum Electrodynamics, the late Richard Feynman, or the originator of fractal geometry, Benoît Mandelbrot, Gleick's focus in this book is on Sir Isaac Newton, whose works on optics, and the creation of differential and integral calculus, allowed scientists to accurately describe and predict the motion of the planets in our solar system through the force of gravity. The mechanics of gravity as described by Newton are the foundation for physics and natural philosophy.Gleick, with great erudition and clarity on his subject, but unlike his other works, with tremendous conciseness, presents Newton's nearly impoverished upbringing, early schooling, and his transformation from a reclusive and excentric observational scientist and theoretician, to a single force and beast that transformed the Royal Society, and later by appointment from the King of England, the Royal Mint. We also see the range of Newton's personal relationships with colleagues, supporters and rivals, from the likes of Sir Edmond Halley, to the reluctant correspondences with compatriot Robert Hooke, and fierce exchanges with the co-creator of calculus, Gottfried Leibniz. The portrait of Newton penned by Gleick is not one that casts Newton in a distorted forward-looking and modern scientist, but as an individual obsessed with the pursuits and techniques of alchemy of the ancients. Also illustrated is Newton as a philosopher and scholar of theology of great earnestness, who undertook with tremendous scrutiny, a rigorous review of early manuscripts of both the Old and New Testament to form an unorthodox and borderline heretical view of the trinity in Christianity. In this masterfully crafted biography, Gleick makes accessible and understandable one of the intellectual giants in the history of science a compelling read."
96,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15900418-randy,4,"A short book (200 pages), replete with quotes from Newton and contemporaries that I found so oblique as to be incomprehensible. Could no one then speak plainly? Certainly any man as tight-lipped as Newton is a tough nut to unfurl, having interacted personably with so few and having lived when the written word was tiresomely formal and indirect. Inevitably, anyone a sphinx then shall remain one forever, despite the picklocks of able biographers such as Gleick.In the end, the book was unsatisfying. I felt I never understood Newton at all as a man. What drove him? What led him to gain the audience that his ideas needed to propagate? Was it only his mastery of mathematics, or did his arguments somehow resonate with and satisfy the inquiring minds of his day in a way that no one before had for millenia? When a revolutionary like Newton arises, the first question must be, ""How was this man so exceptional?"" Aside from Newton's astonishing degree of independence, both socially and intellectually, I can't guess why 2000 years had to pass before this guy overshadowed Aristotle -- by obscuring him rather than standing on his shoulders. If Gleick fails anywhere, it's in setting the social and intellectual stage for Newton's arrival and the positive reception of his ideas among peers. Why was 1642-1727 so ripe for such a man as Newton?I know other books delve more into the rise of the enlightenment era (Boorstein, Pagden, Gottlieb). Maybe Gleick just didn't want his book to wander as afar as that inquiry would demand."
97,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780263-ken,3,"Isaac Newton was born January 4, in 1643. He was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and natural philosopher. He was also an alchemist and theologian.Newton is considered by many scholars and members of the general public to be one of the most influential people in human history.His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"" and usually called the Principia), published in 1687, is probably the most important scientific book ever written.The book lays the groundwork for most of classical mechanics. Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation.I have always found it very interesting that Newton was also highly religious. He was an unorthodox Christian, and during his lifetime actually wrote more on Biblical hermeneutics and occult studies than on science and mathematics."
98,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,4,"It's really astonishing what Isaac Newton did for the world. He applied mathematics to the problems of nature, and through it, created an order that defined physics without modification for 300 years, and is invaluable to this day. Furthermore, he was the son of a poor farmer, defining the tides, despite probably never actually seeing the ocean. Writing about the life of such a man is no easy undertaking. And yet Gleick does such a fantastic job of outlining the times, events, and accomplishments of this man in less than 200 pages. Here, Gleick describes Newton from his birth on a farm to his works as a young college student at Cambridge. During Newton's formative years, we find that he did not just work in mathematics and physics, but also in alchemy and theology, even going as far as to deny the Trinity. Newton was also notoriously withdrawn as a young man, never even bothering to publish most of his discoveries until much later in his career. Gleick also does a great job of describing the origins of many of Newton's legends (the apple, the ""shoulders of giants"", etc.). I probably would have rated it higher if I didn't know some of this stuff about Newton already. However, through beautiful prose and solid research, Gleick shows how, indeed, ""...we are all Newtonians""."
99,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375171-joseph,4,"For such an interesting figure, I knew remarkably little about Isaac Newton, which is what led me to this book in the first place. In truth, I'm not sure how much there is to know; I assume his personal life is better documented than some of his contemporaries (I'm thinking predominantly of Shakespeare), but by how much, frankly, I'm still unsure.Gleick, to be fair, doesn't seem particularly interested in details outside of what Newton accomplished, but he still manages to impart a sense of Newton, the man, in addition to the scientist. His obsessions, idiosyncrasies, and feuds help to flesh out a rather interesting story.Gleick does a great job of documenting his subject's accomplishments, presenting them in such a way as to remind us how firmly they've been ensconced in the realm of modern thought. And while I would have appreciated a greater sense of the world in which he lived, if only to provide a better context for what he achieved, Gleick deserves credit for a great biography of both the man and the birth of modern scientific thought."
100,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010687-steven-dzwonczyk,3,"This book taught me that Isaac Newton was not a one trick pony as many tend to describe him. He was influential in many realms including physics, philosophy, and the monetary system of England, for which he was knighted. While he essentially invented the modern formula for scientific thought, reasoning, and experimentation, he was a human who was subject to petty competition with colleagues and a propensity to cling to beliefs that were not supported by his observations.A contemporary of Edmund Haley, it is interesting to see how the ideas of one man were advanced by the other. It is unlikely that Newton would have thoroughly characterized gravity without Haley's astronomical observations, nor is it likely that Haley would have been able to predict the paths of comets without Newton's ideas of gravity.The last 20% of this book was a bit dry, but the first 80% was top notch and inspiring to me as a scientist. It makes me what to seek out biographies of other great scientists like Max Plank, Christiaan Huygens, and others. I identify with them in my daily work."
101,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10857670-troy-mattila,2,"Before saying anything I must admit I knew very little about Newton before reading this book, but I don't feel like I know much more after. There is certainly plenty of information in the book, but the timeline is not very fluid and often Gleick veers of topic to talk about the events surrounding Newton that seem to have no relevance to Newton. The Information is the only other Gleick book I have read, and this was written before it. In it you can tell that Gleick takes an interest in the advances in information transmission and retention, which is where he seems to go off topic. That being said, it is a very short book and inspired me to find a more detailed biography of Newton because Gleick does present him as a very interesting individual. Also, as far as I know there is not enough information about Newton to present a detailed biography and Gleick may have made due with what was available. I guess I will know once I decide to look further. All in all, worth the read but don't set high expectations."
102,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/176618-noiresque,3,"I listened to this book on CD over the last week.I found the reader's crisp, Jeremy Irons-like British accent to be helpful sometimes, but distracting an equal amount of the time.For a James Gleick book, I found this to be lacking in the insightful science that I'm used to from him.That being said, this was a good biography. Engaging, interesting, and at times, entertaining. This book does give you a true sense of the absolutely fundamental nature of Newton's discoveries to our current world. It's almost inconceivable.But this bio lacked the personal insights, to some extent, that make the person accessible.If you've already read some biographies of Newton, consider skipping this one. If not, this seems to be a good, solid tome on Sir Isaac.I read this simultaneously with Neal Stephenson's fictional account of Newton's time (which I'm still tackling). Stephenson's mostly factual accounts of Newton's experiments are far more entertaining and enlightening."
103,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2825576-andy,3,"A far more thorough account of the life of Newton than I had seen previously, this book certainly accomplished the task sought after by all authors of nonfiction - that of inspiring greater curiosity in the reader. After finishing, I feel like I've only scratched the surface of all there is to know about the complicated world of philosophy, politics, and science which existed during Newton's life.This biography details the work of Newton and places it all within the context of his connection to other great thinkers in Europe at the time, particularly the Royal Society of England. He is shown to be both enormously innovative and deeply flawed. If interested in a greater understanding of Newton's contributions to the worlds of physics and philosophy (both scientifically and socially), read this book.Beware lots of old timey quotations :)"
104,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891277-fabian,4,"Isaac Newton was the culmination of all mathematics and physics that had come before his time and had remained separate. He is to date the most influential scientist of all time. He invented one half of the Calculus. He was at the same time fervently religious, and a heretic denying the holy trinity. He was obsessed with alchemy, to the extent of creating for himself a tonic/elixir to drink daily to prevent illness, which contained as an ingredient quicksilver (mercury). He was the first to document intelligibly the light spectrum using a prism, proving white light is comprised of many others. He also stared at the sun...An eccentric man, a life-time loner, a virgin maybe, a shut-in, a Mathematician, a Christian, ""the last and greatest magician"", a Scientist, a genius. The pinnacle of man. Great book."
105,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3705706-david,4,"In Isaac Newton, James Gleick provides a well balanced view of the world’s most influential scientific mind. I knew of many of Newton’s achievements but was unaware of the childhood difficulties that shaped the man who transformed the idea of science and our understanding of the natural world. Along with the brilliant insights, Newton is shown to be petty and spiteful, especially in his later years. Apparently around 1700 there was no publish or perish mentality in academia as Newton held his advances in mathematics and science in secret for over 30 years. I definitely enjoyed reading this book, but I am technically oriented. If the reader also has an interest in the sciences then I would suggest this is a good read. "
106,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,3,"This is one of those ""torn between three stars and four"" books. I did get a good sense of who Newton was. He was an asshole. Gleick gets pretty technical. A lot of this book describes Newton's theories, including calculus, in no small amount of detail. I've been frustrated in the past by biographies that didn't go into enough technical detail about the discoveries of various scientists, so this may be a ""Careful what you wish for"" situation; I've always been shit at calculus, and much of this book flew right over my head.But it does the job. At under 200 pages it's a snappy read, and I understand Newton and his place in history exactly as well as I want to, so: mission accomplished."

Newton is one of those who qualifies to be on the very short list of the Smart People In History. This book gives one appreciation of Newton's intuitive brilliance. He described gravity, INVENTED calculus, figured out the inverse square law, understood and set out the rules for motion and on and on. There is also interesting stuff about his personal life. Disappointments, demons, dreams, etc.Some of this story was difficult to understand. I have a difficult enough time with math when it is laid out and described in a book or on a chalk board but when it is just described conceptually ... whew .... its a mental workout."

Isaac Newton
 soon hit its stride as it describes Newton's discoveries in mathematics, optics, physics and astronomy. Gleick chooses to focus on Newton's scientific accomplishments, but also includes details from his personal life that mark him as a bit of an odd duck. Newton was reclusive and secretive and his personal interactions, though they occurred infrequently, were marked by brinksmanship and confrontation. One is left with the impression of a brilliant but socially awkward nerd, more comfortable with the world of ideas than people. "
109,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,4,"A nice little book describing the strange individual who was perhaps the smartest human who ever lived. Newton is really only of great interest to scientists because we value his contributions so highly. The average person has no idea what his contributions were and could care less, but he was really the first true physical scientist who showed how the laws of nature could best be expressed with mathematics. He is the father of modern science.Read again, this time with an audiobook.His strangeness most certainly stemmed from his enormous genius. He was just very different from the average mortal. It reminds me of Churchill who was also very strange due to his genius."

I am really in awe of this man.He truly is a genius. I cannot think of another scientist who can be of match to him. No wonder he was the first scientist to receive Knighthood. It also talks about all the arguments that Newton got involved into. The famous one with Leibniz over calculus, the hatredness that Hooke and he had for each other. It also speaks of how he took Flamsteed’s findings and published them even though Flamsteed did not approve of it. It also talks about Newton’s interests in alchemy and his work on element Mercury, which I did not have much idea about. It also talks about Newton’s interest in Biblical matters. His contributions to time, space and motion, his findings on planetary motion, movement of the moon, tides, comets are commendable. He invented the reflecting telescope (one of which I own).Now that gravity is like a matter of common sense these days, it is interesting to know what people felt back then. How people thought it was something supernatural or magical and how they condemned Newton for that. I loved the lines which Newton had written and the author has quoted where he says that he did not care about what others thought and that he was satisfied that it had a mathematical backing And like I had read earlier that the apple falling on the head did not lead him to find out gravity, the author confirms this theory saying Newton never mentioned that in any of his notebooks.One of the most interesting facts about Newton that I learned was that Newton never did any kind of research to get acclaim. He worked on problems and came up with solutions only for “himself”. He always wanted to learn the ways of nature and it was his thirst for knowledge that made him explore more. Another interesting fact about him was that even though he had done lot of work on light and color, only after others forced him, he published his work after thirty years. He never published his findings, he liked to keep them to himself. The author says a lot about Newton’s involvement with Royal society and how he ended up becoming the president of it later on.What I liked in the book were the quotes, statements, figures drawn/written by Newton himself that the author has quoted. It feels good to read what Newton had written in letters to other scientists or the notes that he took in his book about his findings. Because of the presence of such authentic writings, you tend to believe in everything the author says about Newton. A thorough research about his life has been done by James Gleick and he needs to be praised for that.However not much light has been cast on some of the important phases of Newton’s life. He had a nervous breakdown at the age of fifty or so and I really wanted to know more about how he recovered from it, but it has been very briefly mentioned. Even though the author has mentioned lines from letters that Newton wrote to other scientists, it still felt incomplete.Overall: It is a great book if you want to know more about Newton’s life. A very interesting read and because of its size, does not take much time to complete it. I would give this book 4/5."

125,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4669367-william,4,"With Isaac Newton, James Gleick once again reasserts his credentials as a scientific historian and writer of the first rank, as well as winning the National Book Award, and as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. But rather than concentrate on the likes of the father of Quantum Electrodynamics, the late Richard Feynman, or the originator of fractal geometry, Benoît Mandelbrot, Gleick's focus in this book is on Sir Isaac Newton, whose works on optics, and the creation of differential and integral calculus, allowed scientists to accurately describe and predict the motion of the planets in our solar system through the force of gravity. The mechanics of gravity as described by Newton are the foundation for physics and natural philosophy.Gleick, with great erudition and clarity on his subject, but unlike his other works, with tremendous conciseness, presents Newton's nearly impoverished upbringing, early schooling, and his transformation from a reclusive and excentric observational scientist and theoretician, to a single force and beast that transformed the Royal Society, and later by appointment from the King of England, the Royal Mint. We also see the range of Newton's personal relationships with colleagues, supporters and rivals, from the likes of Sir Edmond Halley, to the reluctant correspondences with compatriot Robert Hooke, and fierce exchanges with the co-creator of calculus, Gottfried Leibniz. The portrait of Newton penned by Gleick is not one that casts Newton in a distorted forward-looking and modern scientist, but as an individual obsessed with the pursuits and techniques of alchemy of the ancients. Also illustrated is Newton as a philosopher and scholar of theology of great earnestness, who undertook with tremendous scrutiny, a rigorous review of early manuscripts of both the Old and New Testament to form an unorthodox and borderline heretical view of the trinity in Christianity. In this masterfully crafted biography, Gleick makes accessible and understandable one of the intellectual giants in the history of science a compelling read."
126,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15900418-randy,4,"A short book (200 pages), replete with quotes from Newton and contemporaries that I found so oblique as to be incomprehensible. Could no one then speak plainly? Certainly any man as tight-lipped as Newton is a tough nut to unfurl, having interacted personably with so few and having lived when the written word was tiresomely formal and indirect. Inevitably, anyone a sphinx then shall remain one forever, despite the picklocks of able biographers such as Gleick.In the end, the book was unsatisfying. I felt I never understood Newton at all as a man. What drove him? What led him to gain the audience that his ideas needed to propagate? Was it only his mastery of mathematics, or did his arguments somehow resonate with and satisfy the inquiring minds of his day in a way that no one before had for millenia? When a revolutionary like Newton arises, the first question must be, ""How was this man so exceptional?"" Aside from Newton's astonishing degree of independence, both socially and intellectually, I can't guess why 2000 years had to pass before this guy overshadowed Aristotle -- by obscuring him rather than standing on his shoulders. If Gleick fails anywhere, it's in setting the social and intellectual stage for Newton's arrival and the positive reception of his ideas among peers. Why was 1642-1727 so ripe for such a man as Newton?I know other books delve more into the rise of the enlightenment era (Boorstein, Pagden, Gottlieb). Maybe Gleick just didn't want his book to wander as afar as that inquiry would demand."
127,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780263-ken,3,"Isaac Newton was born January 4, in 1643. He was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and natural philosopher. He was also an alchemist and theologian.Newton is considered by many scholars and members of the general public to be one of the most influential people in human history.His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"" and usually called the Principia), published in 1687, is probably the most important scientific book ever written.The book lays the groundwork for most of classical mechanics. Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation.I have always found it very interesting that Newton was also highly religious. He was an unorthodox Christian, and during his lifetime actually wrote more on Biblical hermeneutics and occult studies than on science and mathematics."
128,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,4,"It's really astonishing what Isaac Newton did for the world. He applied mathematics to the problems of nature, and through it, created an order that defined physics without modification for 300 years, and is invaluable to this day. Furthermore, he was the son of a poor farmer, defining the tides, despite probably never actually seeing the ocean. Writing about the life of such a man is no easy undertaking. And yet Gleick does such a fantastic job of outlining the times, events, and accomplishments of this man in less than 200 pages. Here, Gleick describes Newton from his birth on a farm to his works as a young college student at Cambridge. During Newton's formative years, we find that he did not just work in mathematics and physics, but also in alchemy and theology, even going as far as to deny the Trinity. Newton was also notoriously withdrawn as a young man, never even bothering to publish most of his discoveries until much later in his career. Gleick also does a great job of describing the origins of many of Newton's legends (the apple, the ""shoulders of giants"", etc.). I probably would have rated it higher if I didn't know some of this stuff about Newton already. However, through beautiful prose and solid research, Gleick shows how, indeed, ""...we are all Newtonians""."
129,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375171-joseph,4,"For such an interesting figure, I knew remarkably little about Isaac Newton, which is what led me to this book in the first place. In truth, I'm not sure how much there is to know; I assume his personal life is better documented than some of his contemporaries (I'm thinking predominantly of Shakespeare), but by how much, frankly, I'm still unsure.Gleick, to be fair, doesn't seem particularly interested in details outside of what Newton accomplished, but he still manages to impart a sense of Newton, the man, in addition to the scientist. His obsessions, idiosyncrasies, and feuds help to flesh out a rather interesting story.Gleick does a great job of documenting his subject's accomplishments, presenting them in such a way as to remind us how firmly they've been ensconced in the realm of modern thought. And while I would have appreciated a greater sense of the world in which he lived, if only to provide a better context for what he achieved, Gleick deserves credit for a great biography of both the man and the birth of modern scientific thought."
130,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010687-steven-dzwonczyk,3,"This book taught me that Isaac Newton was not a one trick pony as many tend to describe him. He was influential in many realms including physics, philosophy, and the monetary system of England, for which he was knighted. While he essentially invented the modern formula for scientific thought, reasoning, and experimentation, he was a human who was subject to petty competition with colleagues and a propensity to cling to beliefs that were not supported by his observations.A contemporary of Edmund Haley, it is interesting to see how the ideas of one man were advanced by the other. It is unlikely that Newton would have thoroughly characterized gravity without Haley's astronomical observations, nor is it likely that Haley would have been able to predict the paths of comets without Newton's ideas of gravity.The last 20% of this book was a bit dry, but the first 80% was top notch and inspiring to me as a scientist. It makes me what to seek out biographies of other great scientists like Max Plank, Christiaan Huygens, and others. I identify with them in my daily work."
131,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10857670-troy-mattila,2,"Before saying anything I must admit I knew very little about Newton before reading this book, but I don't feel like I know much more after. There is certainly plenty of information in the book, but the timeline is not very fluid and often Gleick veers of topic to talk about the events surrounding Newton that seem to have no relevance to Newton. The Information is the only other Gleick book I have read, and this was written before it. In it you can tell that Gleick takes an interest in the advances in information transmission and retention, which is where he seems to go off topic. That being said, it is a very short book and inspired me to find a more detailed biography of Newton because Gleick does present him as a very interesting individual. Also, as far as I know there is not enough information about Newton to present a detailed biography and Gleick may have made due with what was available. I guess I will know once I decide to look further. All in all, worth the read but don't set high expectations."
132,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/176618-noiresque,3,"I listened to this book on CD over the last week.I found the reader's crisp, Jeremy Irons-like British accent to be helpful sometimes, but distracting an equal amount of the time.For a James Gleick book, I found this to be lacking in the insightful science that I'm used to from him.That being said, this was a good biography. Engaging, interesting, and at times, entertaining. This book does give you a true sense of the absolutely fundamental nature of Newton's discoveries to our current world. It's almost inconceivable.But this bio lacked the personal insights, to some extent, that make the person accessible.If you've already read some biographies of Newton, consider skipping this one. If not, this seems to be a good, solid tome on Sir Isaac.I read this simultaneously with Neal Stephenson's fictional account of Newton's time (which I'm still tackling). Stephenson's mostly factual accounts of Newton's experiments are far more entertaining and enlightening."
133,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2825576-andy,3,"A far more thorough account of the life of Newton than I had seen previously, this book certainly accomplished the task sought after by all authors of nonfiction - that of inspiring greater curiosity in the reader. After finishing, I feel like I've only scratched the surface of all there is to know about the complicated world of philosophy, politics, and science which existed during Newton's life.This biography details the work of Newton and places it all within the context of his connection to other great thinkers in Europe at the time, particularly the Royal Society of England. He is shown to be both enormously innovative and deeply flawed. If interested in a greater understanding of Newton's contributions to the worlds of physics and philosophy (both scientifically and socially), read this book.Beware lots of old timey quotations :)"
134,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891277-fabian,4,"Isaac Newton was the culmination of all mathematics and physics that had come before his time and had remained separate. He is to date the most influential scientist of all time. He invented one half of the Calculus. He was at the same time fervently religious, and a heretic denying the holy trinity. He was obsessed with alchemy, to the extent of creating for himself a tonic/elixir to drink daily to prevent illness, which contained as an ingredient quicksilver (mercury). He was the first to document intelligibly the light spectrum using a prism, proving white light is comprised of many others. He also stared at the sun...An eccentric man, a life-time loner, a virgin maybe, a shut-in, a Mathematician, a Christian, ""the last and greatest magician"", a Scientist, a genius. The pinnacle of man. Great book."
135,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3705706-david,4,"In Isaac Newton, James Gleick provides a well balanced view of the world’s most influential scientific mind. I knew of many of Newton’s achievements but was unaware of the childhood difficulties that shaped the man who transformed the idea of science and our understanding of the natural world. Along with the brilliant insights, Newton is shown to be petty and spiteful, especially in his later years. Apparently around 1700 there was no publish or perish mentality in academia as Newton held his advances in mathematics and science in secret for over 30 years. I definitely enjoyed reading this book, but I am technically oriented. If the reader also has an interest in the sciences then I would suggest this is a good read. "
136,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,3,"This is one of those ""torn between three stars and four"" books. I did get a good sense of who Newton was. He was an asshole. Gleick gets pretty technical. A lot of this book describes Newton's theories, including calculus, in no small amount of detail. I've been frustrated in the past by biographies that didn't go into enough technical detail about the discoveries of various scientists, so this may be a ""Careful what you wish for"" situation; I've always been shit at calculus, and much of this book flew right over my head.But it does the job. At under 200 pages it's a snappy read, and I understand Newton and his place in history exactly as well as I want to, so: mission accomplished."
137,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5960332-karl-tenney,0,"The story of this man's life is flat-out amazing. Newton is one of those who qualifies to be on the very short list of the Smart People In History. This book gives one appreciation of Newton's intuitive brilliance. He described gravity, INVENTED calculus, figured out the inverse square law, understood and set out the rules for motion and on and on. There is also interesting stuff about his personal life. Disappointments, demons, dreams, etc.Some of this story was difficult to understand. I have a difficult enough time with math when it is laid out and described in a book or on a chalk board but when it is just described conceptually ... whew .... its a mental workout."

Isaac Newton
 soon hit its stride as it describes Newton's discoveries in mathematics, optics, physics and astronomy. Gleick chooses to focus on Newton's scientific accomplishments, but also includes details from his personal life that mark him as a bit of an odd duck. Newton was reclusive and secretive and his personal interactions, though they occurred infrequently, were marked by brinksmanship and confrontation. One is left with the impression of a brilliant but socially awkward nerd, more comfortable with the world of ideas than people. "
139,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,4,"A nice little book describing the strange individual who was perhaps the smartest human who ever lived. Newton is really only of great interest to scientists because we value his contributions so highly. The average person has no idea what his contributions were and could care less, but he was really the first true physical scientist who showed how the laws of nature could best be expressed with mathematics. He is the father of modern science.Read again, this time with an audiobook.His strangeness most certainly stemmed from his enormous genius. He was just very different from the average mortal. It reminds me of Churchill who was also very strange due to his genius."
140,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2357602-s-chandler,4,"Gleick nestles Newton right into historical context and uncovers Newton the person while dazzling us with Newton, the mind behind the math. He humbly walked a balance I find so beautiful I could cry:""it may also be allow'd that God created particles of matter of several sizes and figures, and in several proportions to space and perhaps of different densities and forces, and thereby to vary the laws of nature and make worlds of several sorts in several parts of the universe. At least I see nothing of contradiction in all this."""

This is a well-told story about a genius who was somehow able to imagine new sciences just by sitting and thinking. Newton possessed an intellect on a par with Einstein and came up with names for properties we all learn about in high school (and take for granted): mass, gravity, velocity. Gleick paints a detailed picture of an extraordinary man, drills down on the science but does so without every being dull or slow. ""Isaac Newton"" is a great, fast read."

145,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3620841-brian,4,"Slow going at times, but packs a serious punch. I had never thought through the fact that, when Newton defined his laws of mass, motion, and gravity, no one even had words like ""laws,"" ""mass,"" ""motion,"" and ""gravity,"" in their modern senses. So it's like winning the Boston Marathon while wearing firefighter boots."" "

I recently got hold of his biography written by James Gleick, who has also authored Genius and Chaos. I always wanted to know more about Newton’s life. Having known Einstein’s biography, I was curious to know how Newton’s life was. “Newton was not a pleasant man“, is a statement about him that always comes to my mind, after having read Stephen Hawking’s review about Isaac Newton. He had too many adversaries and never had any friends. He was very lonely in his life ever since he was born. He was fatherless and his mother never wanted him. He neither got married nor did he ever involve in any relationship with any woman. His life is really intriguing.After knowing such less facts about his life, I always wanted to read more about his life. This book is very small and gives a brief overview of Newton’s life. It is not very technical with too many details. I found it little disappointing since it is written in a layman language, helpful for non-science students.

Why was 1642-1727 so ripe for such a man as Newton?I know other books delve more into the rise of the enlightenment era (Boorstein, Pagden, Gottlieb). Maybe Gleick just didn't want his book to wander as afar as that inquiry would demand."
157,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780263-ken,3,"Isaac Newton was born January 4, in 1643. He was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and natural philosopher. He was also an alchemist and theologian.Newton is considered by many scholars and members of the general public to be one of the most influential people in human history.His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"" and usually called the Principia), published in 1687, is probably the most important scientific book ever written.The book lays the groundwork for most of classical mechanics. Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation.I have always found it very interesting that Newton was also highly religious. He was an unorthodox Christian, and during his lifetime actually wrote more on Biblical hermeneutics and occult studies than on science and mathematics."

He applied mathematics to the problems of nature, and through it, created an order that defined physics without modification for 300 years, and is invaluable to this day. Furthermore, he was the son of a poor farmer, defining the tides, despite probably never actually seeing the ocean. Writing about the life of such a man is no easy undertaking. And yet Gleick does such a fantastic job of outlining the times, events, and accomplishments of this man in less than 200 pages. Here, Gleick describes Newton from his birth on a farm to his works as a young college student at Cambridge. During Newton's formative years, we find that he did not just work in mathematics and physics, but also in alchemy and theology, even going as far as to deny the Trinity. Newton was also notoriously withdrawn as a young man, never even bothering to publish most of his discoveries until much later in his career. Gleick also does a great job of describing the origins of many of Newton's legends (the apple, the ""shoulders of giants"", etc.). I probably would have rated it higher if I didn't know some of this stuff about Newton already. However, through beautiful prose and solid research, Gleick shows how, indeed, ""...we are all Newtonians""."

In truth, I'm not sure how much there is to know; I assume his personal life is better documented than some of his contemporaries (I'm thinking predominantly of Shakespeare), but by how much, frankly, I'm still unsure.Gleick, to be fair, doesn't seem particularly interested in details outside of what Newton accomplished, but he still manages to impart a sense of Newton, the man, in addition to the scientist. His obsessions, idiosyncrasies, and feuds help to flesh out a rather interesting story.Gleick does a great job of documenting his subject's accomplishments, presenting them in such a way as to remind us how firmly they've been ensconced in the realm of modern thought. And while I would have appreciated a greater sense of the world in which he lived, if only to provide a better context for what he achieved, Gleick deserves credit for a great biography of both the man and the birth of modern scientific thought."

He was influential in many realms including physics, philosophy, and the monetary system of England, for which he was knighted. While he essentially invented the modern formula for scientific thought, reasoning, and experimentation, he was a human who was subject to petty competition with colleagues and a propensity to cling to beliefs that were not supported by his observations.A contemporary of Edmund Haley, it is interesting to see how the ideas of one man were advanced by the other. It is unlikely that Newton would have thoroughly characterized gravity without Haley's astronomical observations, nor is it likely that Haley would have been able to predict the paths of comets without Newton's ideas of gravity.The last 20% of this book was a bit dry, but the first 80% was top notch and inspiring to me as a scientist.

The Information is the only other Gleick book I have read, and this was written before it. In it you can tell that Gleick takes an interest in the advances in information transmission and retention, which is where he seems to go off topic. That being said, it is a very short book and inspired me to find a more detailed biography of Newton because Gleick does present him as a very interesting individual. Also, as far as I know there is not enough information about Newton to present a detailed biography and Gleick may have made due with what was available. I guess I will know once I decide to look further. All in all, worth the read but don't set high expectations."

Engaging, interesting, and at times, entertaining. This book does give you a true sense of the absolutely fundamental nature of Newton's discoveries to our current world. It's almost inconceivable.But this bio lacked the personal insights, to some extent, that make the person accessible.If you've already read some biographies of Newton, consider skipping this one. If not, this seems to be a good, solid tome on Sir Isaac.I read this simultaneously with Neal Stephenson's fictional account of Newton's time (which I'm still tackling). Stephenson's mostly factual accounts of Newton's experiments are far more entertaining and enlightening."
163,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2825576-andy,3,"A far more thorough account of the life of Newton than I had seen previously, this book certainly accomplished the task sought after by all authors of nonfiction - that of inspiring greater curiosity in the reader. After finishing, I feel like I've only scratched the surface of all there is to know about the complicated world of philosophy, politics, and science which existed during Newton's life.This biography details the work of Newton and places it all within the context of his connection to other great thinkers in Europe at the time, particularly the Royal Society of England. He is shown to be both enormously innovative and deeply flawed. If interested in a greater understanding of Newton's contributions to the worlds of physics and philosophy (both scientifically and socially), read this book.Beware lots of old timey quotations :)"
164,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891277-fabian,4,"Isaac Newton was the culmination of all mathematics and physics that had come before his time and had remained separate. He is to date the most influential scientist of all time. He invented one half of the Calculus. He was at the same time fervently religious, and a heretic denying the holy trinity. He was obsessed with alchemy, to the extent of creating for himself a tonic/elixir to drink daily to prevent illness, which contained as an ingredient quicksilver (mercury). He was the first to document intelligibly the light spectrum using a prism, proving white light is comprised of many others. He also stared at the sun...An eccentric man, a life-time loner, a virgin maybe, a shut-in, a Mathematician, a Christian, ""the last and greatest magician"", a Scientist, a genius. The pinnacle of man. Great book."
165,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3705706-david,4,"In Isaac Newton, James Gleick provides a well balanced view of the world’s most influential scientific mind. I knew of many of Newton’s achievements but was unaware of the childhood difficulties that shaped the man who transformed the idea of science and our understanding of the natural world. Along with the brilliant insights, Newton is shown to be petty and spiteful, especially in his later years. Apparently around 1700 there was no publish or perish mentality in academia as Newton held his advances in mathematics and science in secret for over 30 years. I definitely enjoyed reading this book, but I am technically oriented. If the reader also has an interest in the sciences then I would suggest this is a good read. "
166,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,3,"This is one of those ""torn between three stars and four"" books. I did get a good sense of who Newton was. He was an asshole. Gleick gets pretty technical. A lot of this book describes Newton's theories, including calculus, in no small amount of detail. I've been frustrated in the past by biographies that didn't go into enough technical detail about the discoveries of various scientists, so this may be a ""Careful what you wish for"" situation; I've always been shit at calculus, and much of this book flew right over my head.But it does the job. At under 200 pages it's a snappy read, and I understand Newton and his place in history exactly as well as I want to, so: mission accomplished."
167,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5960332-karl-tenney,0,"The story of this man's life is flat-out amazing. Newton is one of those who qualifies to be on the very short list of the Smart People In History. This book gives one appreciation of Newton's intuitive brilliance. He described gravity, INVENTED calculus, figured out the inverse square law, understood and set out the rules for motion and on and on. There is also interesting stuff about his personal life. Disappointments, demons, dreams, etc.Some of this story was difficult to understand. I have a difficult enough time with math when it is laid out and described in a book or on a chalk board but when it is just described conceptually ... whew .... its a mental workout."

Isaac Newton
 soon hit its stride as it describes Newton's discoveries in mathematics, optics, physics and astronomy. Gleick chooses to focus on Newton's scientific accomplishments, but also includes details from his personal life that mark him as a bit of an odd duck. Newton was reclusive and secretive and his personal interactions, though they occurred infrequently, were marked by brinksmanship and confrontation. One is left with the impression of a brilliant but socially awkward nerd, more comfortable with the world of ideas than people. "
169,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,4,"A nice little book describing the strange individual who was perhaps the smartest human who ever lived. Newton is really only of great interest to scientists because we value his contributions so highly. The average person has no idea what his contributions were and could care less, but he was really the first true physical scientist who showed how the laws of nature could best be expressed with mathematics. He is the father of modern science.Read again, this time with an audiobook.His strangeness most certainly stemmed from his enormous genius. He was just very different from the average mortal. It reminds me of Churchill who was also very strange due to his genius."

He humbly walked a balance I find so beautiful I could cry:""it may also be allow'd that God created particles of matter of several sizes and figures, and in several proportions to space and perhaps of different densities and forces, and thereby to vary the laws of nature and make worlds of several sorts in several parts of the universe. At least I see nothing of contradiction in all this."""

This is a well-told story about a genius who was somehow able to imagine new sciences just by sitting and thinking. Newton possessed an intellect on a par with Einstein and came up with names for properties we all learn about in high school (and take for granted): mass, gravity, velocity. Gleick paints a detailed picture of an extraordinary man, drills down on the science but does so without every being dull or slow. ""Isaac Newton"" is a great, fast read."

183,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4587507-ash,4,"Sir Isaac Newton is regarded as a genius. I recently got hold of his biography written by James Gleick, who has also authored Genius and Chaos. I always wanted to know more about Newton’s life. Having known Einstein’s biography, I was curious to know how Newton’s life was. “Newton was not a pleasant man“, is a statement about him that always comes to my mind, after having read Stephen Hawking’s review about Isaac Newton. He had too many adversaries and never had any friends. He was very lonely in his life ever since he was born. He was fatherless and his mother never wanted him. He neither got married nor did he ever involve in any relationship with any woman. His life is really intriguing.After knowing such less facts about his life, I always wanted to read more about his life. This book is very small and gives a brief overview of Newton’s life. It is not very technical with too many details. I found it little disappointing since it is written in a layman language, helpful for non-science students. There is no mathematics at all in it, which is what I expected to find. But still it mentions all the concepts in Mathematics that Newton came up with, starting with Differential and Integral calculus to Binomial theorems, Ellipses, curves, centre of curvature, radius of curvature, cycloid etc. Even though I knew about some of his works, I never knew that Newton has contributed so much to Science and Mathematics, until I read the book. I am really in awe of this man.He truly is a genius. I cannot think of another scientist who can be of match to him. No wonder he was the first scientist to receive Knighthood. It also talks about all the arguments that Newton got involved into. The famous one with Leibniz over calculus, the hatredness that Hooke and he had for each other. It also speaks of how he took Flamsteed’s findings and published them even though Flamsteed did not approve of it. It also talks about Newton’s interests in alchemy and his work on element Mercury, which I did not have much idea about. It also talks about Newton’s interest in Biblical matters. His contributions to time, space and motion, his findings on planetary motion, movement of the moon, tides, comets are commendable. He invented the reflecting telescope (one of which I own).Now that gravity is like a matter of common sense these days, it is interesting to know what people felt back then. How people thought it was something supernatural or magical and how they condemned Newton for that. I loved the lines which Newton had written and the author has quoted where he says that he did not care about what others thought and that he was satisfied that it had a mathematical backing And like I had read earlier that the apple falling on the head did not lead him to find out gravity, the author confirms this theory saying Newton never mentioned that in any of his notebooks.One of the most interesting facts about Newton that I learned was that Newton never did any kind of research to get acclaim. He worked on problems and came up with solutions only for “himself”. He always wanted to learn the ways of nature and it was his thirst for knowledge that made him explore more. Another interesting fact about him was that even though he had done lot of work on light and color, only after others forced him, he published his work after thirty years. He never published his findings, he liked to keep them to himself. The author says a lot about Newton’s involvement with Royal society and how he ended up becoming the president of it later on.What I liked in the book were the quotes, statements, figures drawn/written by Newton himself that the author has quoted. It feels good to read what Newton had written in letters to other scientists or the notes that he took in his book about his findings. Because of the presence of such authentic writings, you tend to believe in everything the author says about Newton. A thorough research about his life has been done by James Gleick and he needs to be praised for that.However not much light has been cast on some of the important phases of Newton’s life. He had a nervous breakdown at the age of fifty or so and I really wanted to know more about how he recovered from it, but it has been very briefly mentioned. Even though the author has mentioned lines from letters that Newton wrote to other scientists, it still felt incomplete.Overall: It is a great book if you want to know more about Newton’s life. A very interesting read and because of its size, does not take much time to complete it. I would give this book 4/5."

185,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4669367-william,4,"With Isaac Newton, James Gleick once again reasserts his credentials as a scientific historian and writer of the first rank, as well as winning the National Book Award, and as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. But rather than concentrate on the likes of the father of Quantum Electrodynamics, the late Richard Feynman, or the originator of fractal geometry, Benoît Mandelbrot, Gleick's focus in this book is on Sir Isaac Newton, whose works on optics, and the creation of differential and integral calculus, allowed scientists to accurately describe and predict the motion of the planets in our solar system through the force of gravity. The mechanics of gravity as described by Newton are the foundation for physics and natural philosophy.Gleick, with great erudition and clarity on his subject, but unlike his other works, with tremendous conciseness, presents Newton's nearly impoverished upbringing, early schooling, and his transformation from a reclusive and excentric observational scientist and theoretician, to a single force and beast that transformed the Royal Society, and later by appointment from the King of England, the Royal Mint. We also see the range of Newton's personal relationships with colleagues, supporters and rivals, from the likes of Sir Edmond Halley, to the reluctant correspondences with compatriot Robert Hooke, and fierce exchanges with the co-creator of calculus, Gottfried Leibniz. The portrait of Newton penned by Gleick is not one that casts Newton in a distorted forward-looking and modern scientist, but as an individual obsessed with the pursuits and techniques of alchemy of the ancients. Also illustrated is Newton as a philosopher and scholar of theology of great earnestness, who undertook with tremendous scrutiny, a rigorous review of early manuscripts of both the Old and New Testament to form an unorthodox and borderline heretical view of the trinity in Christianity. In this masterfully crafted biography, Gleick makes accessible and understandable one of the intellectual giants in the history of science a compelling read."

Could no one then speak plainly? Certainly any man as tight-lipped as Newton is a tough nut to unfurl, having interacted personably with so few and having lived when the written word was tiresomely formal and indirect. Inevitably, anyone a sphinx then shall remain one forever, despite the picklocks of able biographers such as Gleick.In the end, the book was unsatisfying. I felt I never understood Newton at all as a man. What drove him? What led him to gain the audience that his ideas needed to propagate? Was it only his mastery of mathematics, or did his arguments somehow resonate with and satisfy the inquiring minds of his day in a way that no one before had for millenia? When a revolutionary like Newton arises, the first question must be, ""How was this man so exceptional?"" Aside from Newton's astonishing degree of independence, both socially and intellectually, I can't guess why 2000 years had to pass before this guy overshadowed Aristotle -- by obscuring him rather than standing on his shoulders.

212,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55558982-zack-dixon,5,AudiobookAn excellent overview of Newton’s scientific contributions. The author did a very good job of describing these in a way that would not deter those with arithmophobia but also captivate those with a love of math. 
213,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4587507-ash,4,"Sir Isaac Newton is regarded as a genius. I recently got hold of his biography written by James Gleick, who has also authored Genius and Chaos. I always wanted to know more about Newton’s life. Having known Einstein’s biography, I was curious to know how Newton’s life was. “Newton was not a pleasant man“, is a statement about him that always comes to my mind, after having read Stephen Hawking’s review about Isaac Newton. He had too many adversaries and never had any friends. He was very lonely in his life ever since he was born. He was fatherless and his mother never wanted him. He neither got married nor did he ever involve in any relationship with any woman. His life is really intriguing.After knowing such less facts about his life, I always wanted to read more about his life. This book is very small and gives a brief overview of Newton’s life. It is not very technical with too many details. I found it little disappointing since it is written in a layman language, helpful for non-science students. There is no mathematics at all in it, which is what I expected to find. But still it mentions all the concepts in Mathematics that Newton came up with, starting with Differential and Integral calculus to Binomial theorems, Ellipses, curves, centre of curvature, radius of curvature, cycloid etc. Even though I knew about some of his works, I never knew that Newton has contributed so much to Science and Mathematics, until I read the book. I am really in awe of this man.He truly is a genius. I cannot think of another scientist who can be of match to him. No wonder he was the first scientist to receive Knighthood. It also talks about all the arguments that Newton got involved into. The famous one with Leibniz over calculus, the hatredness that Hooke and he had for each other. It also speaks of how he took Flamsteed’s findings and published them even though Flamsteed did not approve of it. It also talks about Newton’s interests in alchemy and his work on element Mercury, which I did not have much idea about. It also talks about Newton’s interest in Biblical matters. His contributions to time, space and motion, his findings on planetary motion, movement of the moon, tides, comets are commendable. He invented the reflecting telescope (one of which I own).Now that gravity is like a matter of common sense these days, it is interesting to know what people felt back then. How people thought it was something supernatural or magical and how they condemned Newton for that. I loved the lines which Newton had written and the author has quoted where he says that he did not care about what others thought and that he was satisfied that it had a mathematical backing And like I had read earlier that the apple falling on the head did not lead him to find out gravity, the author confirms this theory saying Newton never mentioned that in any of his notebooks.One of the most interesting facts about Newton that I learned was that Newton never did any kind of research to get acclaim. He worked on problems and came up with solutions only for “himself”. He always wanted to learn the ways of nature and it was his thirst for knowledge that made him explore more. Another interesting fact about him was that even though he had done lot of work on light and color, only after others forced him, he published his work after thirty years. He never published his findings, he liked to keep them to himself. The author says a lot about Newton’s involvement with Royal society and how he ended up becoming the president of it later on.What I liked in the book were the quotes, statements, figures drawn/written by Newton himself that the author has quoted. It feels good to read what Newton had written in letters to other scientists or the notes that he took in his book about his findings. Because of the presence of such authentic writings, you tend to believe in everything the author says about Newton. A thorough research about his life has been done by James Gleick and he needs to be praised for that.However not much light has been cast on some of the important phases of Newton’s life. He had a nervous breakdown at the age of fifty or so and I really wanted to know more about how he recovered from it, but it has been very briefly mentioned. Even though the author has mentioned lines from letters that Newton wrote to other scientists, it still felt incomplete.Overall: It is a great book if you want to know more about Newton’s life. A very interesting read and because of its size, does not take much time to complete it. I would give this book 4/5."

215,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4669367-william,4,"With Isaac Newton, James Gleick once again reasserts his credentials as a scientific historian and writer of the first rank, as well as winning the National Book Award, and as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. But rather than concentrate on the likes of the father of Quantum Electrodynamics, the late Richard Feynman, or the originator of fractal geometry, Benoît Mandelbrot, Gleick's focus in this book is on Sir Isaac Newton, whose works on optics, and the creation of differential and integral calculus, allowed scientists to accurately describe and predict the motion of the planets in our solar system through the force of gravity. The mechanics of gravity as described by Newton are the foundation for physics and natural philosophy.Gleick, with great erudition and clarity on his subject, but unlike his other works, with tremendous conciseness, presents Newton's nearly impoverished upbringing, early schooling, and his transformation from a reclusive and excentric observational scientist and theoretician, to a single force and beast that transformed the Royal Society, and later by appointment from the King of England, the Royal Mint. We also see the range of Newton's personal relationships with colleagues, supporters and rivals, from the likes of Sir Edmond Halley, to the reluctant correspondences with compatriot Robert Hooke, and fierce exchanges with the co-creator of calculus, Gottfried Leibniz. The portrait of Newton penned by Gleick is not one that casts Newton in a distorted forward-looking and modern scientist, but as an individual obsessed with the pursuits and techniques of alchemy of the ancients. Also illustrated is Newton as a philosopher and scholar of theology of great earnestness, who undertook with tremendous scrutiny, a rigorous review of early manuscripts of both the Old and New Testament to form an unorthodox and borderline heretical view of the trinity in Christianity. In this masterfully crafted biography, Gleick makes accessible and understandable one of the intellectual giants in the history of science a compelling read."
216,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15900418-randy,4,"A short book (200 pages), replete with quotes from Newton and contemporaries that I found so oblique as to be incomprehensible. Could no one then speak plainly? Certainly any man as tight-lipped as Newton is a tough nut to unfurl, having interacted personably with so few and having lived when the written word was tiresomely formal and indirect. Inevitably, anyone a sphinx then shall remain one forever, despite the picklocks of able biographers such as Gleick.In the end, the book was unsatisfying. I felt I never understood Newton at all as a man. What drove him? What led him to gain the audience that his ideas needed to propagate? Was it only his mastery of mathematics, or did his arguments somehow resonate with and satisfy the inquiring minds of his day in a way that no one before had for millenia? When a revolutionary like Newton arises, the first question must be, ""How was this man so exceptional?"" Aside from Newton's astonishing degree of independence, both socially and intellectually, I can't guess why 2000 years had to pass before this guy overshadowed Aristotle -- by obscuring him rather than standing on his shoulders. If Gleick fails anywhere, it's in setting the social and intellectual stage for Newton's arrival and the positive reception of his ideas among peers. Why was 1642-1727 so ripe for such a man as Newton?I know other books delve more into the rise of the enlightenment era (Boorstein, Pagden, Gottlieb). Maybe Gleick just didn't want his book to wander as afar as that inquiry would demand."
217,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780263-ken,3,"Isaac Newton was born January 4, in 1643. He was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and natural philosopher. He was also an alchemist and theologian.Newton is considered by many scholars and members of the general public to be one of the most influential people in human history.His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"" and usually called the Principia), published in 1687, is probably the most important scientific book ever written.The book lays the groundwork for most of classical mechanics. Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation.I have always found it very interesting that Newton was also highly religious. He was an unorthodox Christian, and during his lifetime actually wrote more on Biblical hermeneutics and occult studies than on science and mathematics."
218,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,4,"It's really astonishing what Isaac Newton did for the world. He applied mathematics to the problems of nature, and through it, created an order that defined physics without modification for 300 years, and is invaluable to this day. Furthermore, he was the son of a poor farmer, defining the tides, despite probably never actually seeing the ocean. Writing about the life of such a man is no easy undertaking. And yet Gleick does such a fantastic job of outlining the times, events, and accomplishments of this man in less than 200 pages. Here, Gleick describes Newton from his birth on a farm to his works as a young college student at Cambridge. During Newton's formative years, we find that he did not just work in mathematics and physics, but also in alchemy and theology, even going as far as to deny the Trinity. Newton was also notoriously withdrawn as a young man, never even bothering to publish most of his discoveries until much later in his career. Gleick also does a great job of describing the origins of many of Newton's legends (the apple, the ""shoulders of giants"", etc.). I probably would have rated it higher if I didn't know some of this stuff about Newton already. However, through beautiful prose and solid research, Gleick shows how, indeed, ""...we are all Newtonians""."
219,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375171-joseph,4,"For such an interesting figure, I knew remarkably little about Isaac Newton, which is what led me to this book in the first place. In truth, I'm not sure how much there is to know; I assume his personal life is better documented than some of his contemporaries (I'm thinking predominantly of Shakespeare), but by how much, frankly, I'm still unsure.Gleick, to be fair, doesn't seem particularly interested in details outside of what Newton accomplished, but he still manages to impart a sense of Newton, the man, in addition to the scientist. His obsessions, idiosyncrasies, and feuds help to flesh out a rather interesting story.Gleick does a great job of documenting his subject's accomplishments, presenting them in such a way as to remind us how firmly they've been ensconced in the realm of modern thought. And while I would have appreciated a greater sense of the world in which he lived, if only to provide a better context for what he achieved, Gleick deserves credit for a great biography of both the man and the birth of modern scientific thought."
220,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010687-steven-dzwonczyk,3,"This book taught me that Isaac Newton was not a one trick pony as many tend to describe him. He was influential in many realms including physics, philosophy, and the monetary system of England, for which he was knighted. While he essentially invented the modern formula for scientific thought, reasoning, and experimentation, he was a human who was subject to petty competition with colleagues and a propensity to cling to beliefs that were not supported by his observations.A contemporary of Edmund Haley, it is interesting to see how the ideas of one man were advanced by the other. It is unlikely that Newton would have thoroughly characterized gravity without Haley's astronomical observations, nor is it likely that Haley would have been able to predict the paths of comets without Newton's ideas of gravity.The last 20% of this book was a bit dry, but the first 80% was top notch and inspiring to me as a scientist. It makes me what to seek out biographies of other great scientists like Max Plank, Christiaan Huygens, and others. I identify with them in my daily work."

There is certainly plenty of information in the book, but the timeline is not very fluid and often Gleick veers of topic to talk about the events surrounding Newton that seem to have no relevance to Newton. The Information is the only other Gleick book I have read, and this was written before it. In it you can tell that Gleick takes an interest in the advances in information transmission and retention, which is where he seems to go off topic. That being said, it is a very short book and inspired me to find a more detailed biography of Newton because Gleick does present him as a very interesting individual. Also, as far as I know there is not enough information about Newton to present a detailed biography and Gleick may have made due with what was available.

243,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4587507-ash,4,"Sir Isaac Newton is regarded as a genius. I recently got hold of his biography written by James Gleick, who has also authored Genius and Chaos. I always wanted to know more about Newton’s life. Having known Einstein’s biography, I was curious to know how Newton’s life was. “Newton was not a pleasant man“, is a statement about him that always comes to my mind, after having read Stephen Hawking’s review about Isaac Newton. He had too many adversaries and never had any friends. He was very lonely in his life ever since he was born. He was fatherless and his mother never wanted him. He neither got married nor did he ever involve in any relationship with any woman. His life is really intriguing.After knowing such less facts about his life, I always wanted to read more about his life. This book is very small and gives a brief overview of Newton’s life. It is not very technical with too many details. I found it little disappointing since it is written in a layman language, helpful for non-science students. There is no mathematics at all in it, which is what I expected to find. But still it mentions all the concepts in Mathematics that Newton came up with, starting with Differential and Integral calculus to Binomial theorems, Ellipses, curves, centre of curvature, radius of curvature, cycloid etc. Even though I knew about some of his works, I never knew that Newton has contributed so much to Science and Mathematics, until I read the book. I am really in awe of this man.He truly is a genius. I cannot think of another scientist who can be of match to him. No wonder he was the first scientist to receive Knighthood. It also talks about all the arguments that Newton got involved into. The famous one with Leibniz over calculus, the hatredness that Hooke and he had for each other. It also speaks of how he took Flamsteed’s findings and published them even though Flamsteed did not approve of it. It also talks about Newton’s interests in alchemy and his work on element Mercury, which I did not have much idea about. It also talks about Newton’s interest in Biblical matters. His contributions to time, space and motion, his findings on planetary motion, movement of the moon, tides, comets are commendable. He invented the reflecting telescope (one of which I own).Now that gravity is like a matter of common sense these days, it is interesting to know what people felt back then. How people thought it was something supernatural or magical and how they condemned Newton for that. I loved the lines which Newton had written and the author has quoted where he says that he did not care about what others thought and that he was satisfied that it had a mathematical backing And like I had read earlier that the apple falling on the head did not lead him to find out gravity, the author confirms this theory saying Newton never mentioned that in any of his notebooks.One of the most interesting facts about Newton that I learned was that Newton never did any kind of research to get acclaim. He worked on problems and came up with solutions only for “himself”. He always wanted to learn the ways of nature and it was his thirst for knowledge that made him explore more. Another interesting fact about him was that even though he had done lot of work on light and color, only after others forced him, he published his work after thirty years. He never published his findings, he liked to keep them to himself. The author says a lot about Newton’s involvement with Royal society and how he ended up becoming the president of it later on.What I liked in the book were the quotes, statements, figures drawn/written by Newton himself that the author has quoted. It feels good to read what Newton had written in letters to other scientists or the notes that he took in his book about his findings. Because of the presence of such authentic writings, you tend to believe in everything the author says about Newton. A thorough research about his life has been done by James Gleick and he needs to be praised for that.However not much light has been cast on some of the important phases of Newton’s life. He had a nervous breakdown at the age of fifty or so and I really wanted to know more about how he recovered from it, but it has been very briefly mentioned. Even though the author has mentioned lines from letters that Newton wrote to other scientists, it still felt incomplete.Overall: It is a great book if you want to know more about Newton’s life. A very interesting read and because of its size, does not take much time to complete it. I would give this book 4/5."
244,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40946339-francesca,2,"Newton is great, this biography not so much"
245,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4669367-william,4,"With Isaac Newton, James Gleick once again reasserts his credentials as a scientific historian and writer of the first rank, as well as winning the National Book Award, and as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. But rather than concentrate on the likes of the father of Quantum Electrodynamics, the late Richard Feynman, or the originator of fractal geometry, Benoît Mandelbrot, Gleick's focus in this book is on Sir Isaac Newton, whose works on optics, and the creation of differential and integral calculus, allowed scientists to accurately describe and predict the motion of the planets in our solar system through the force of gravity. The mechanics of gravity as described by Newton are the foundation for physics and natural philosophy.Gleick, with great erudition and clarity on his subject, but unlike his other works, with tremendous conciseness, presents Newton's nearly impoverished upbringing, early schooling, and his transformation from a reclusive and excentric observational scientist and theoretician, to a single force and beast that transformed the Royal Society, and later by appointment from the King of England, the Royal Mint. We also see the range of Newton's personal relationships with colleagues, supporters and rivals, from the likes of Sir Edmond Halley, to the reluctant correspondences with compatriot Robert Hooke, and fierce exchanges with the co-creator of calculus, Gottfried Leibniz. The portrait of Newton penned by Gleick is not one that casts Newton in a distorted forward-looking and modern scientist, but as an individual obsessed with the pursuits and techniques of alchemy of the ancients. Also illustrated is Newton as a philosopher and scholar of theology of great earnestness, who undertook with tremendous scrutiny, a rigorous review of early manuscripts of both the Old and New Testament to form an unorthodox and borderline heretical view of the trinity in Christianity. In this masterfully crafted biography, Gleick makes accessible and understandable one of the intellectual giants in the history of science a compelling read."
246,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15900418-randy,4,"A short book (200 pages), replete with quotes from Newton and contemporaries that I found so oblique as to be incomprehensible. Could no one then speak plainly? Certainly any man as tight-lipped as Newton is a tough nut to unfurl, having interacted personably with so few and having lived when the written word was tiresomely formal and indirect. Inevitably, anyone a sphinx then shall remain one forever, despite the picklocks of able biographers such as Gleick.In the end, the book was unsatisfying. I felt I never understood Newton at all as a man. What drove him? What led him to gain the audience that his ideas needed to propagate? Was it only his mastery of mathematics, or did his arguments somehow resonate with and satisfy the inquiring minds of his day in a way that no one before had for millenia? When a revolutionary like Newton arises, the first question must be, ""How was this man so exceptional?"" Aside from Newton's astonishing degree of independence, both socially and intellectually, I can't guess why 2000 years had to pass before this guy overshadowed Aristotle -- by obscuring him rather than standing on his shoulders. If Gleick fails anywhere, it's in setting the social and intellectual stage for Newton's arrival and the positive reception of his ideas among peers. Why was 1642-1727 so ripe for such a man as Newton?I know other books delve more into the rise of the enlightenment era (Boorstein, Pagden, Gottlieb). Maybe Gleick just didn't want his book to wander as afar as that inquiry would demand."
247,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780263-ken,3,"Isaac Newton was born January 4, in 1643. He was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and natural philosopher. He was also an alchemist and theologian.Newton is considered by many scholars and members of the general public to be one of the most influential people in human history.His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"" and usually called the Principia), published in 1687, is probably the most important scientific book ever written.The book lays the groundwork for most of classical mechanics. Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation.I have always found it very interesting that Newton was also highly religious. He was an unorthodox Christian, and during his lifetime actually wrote more on Biblical hermeneutics and occult studies than on science and mathematics."
248,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,4,"It's really astonishing what Isaac Newton did for the world. He applied mathematics to the problems of nature, and through it, created an order that defined physics without modification for 300 years, and is invaluable to this day. Furthermore, he was the son of a poor farmer, defining the tides, despite probably never actually seeing the ocean. Writing about the life of such a man is no easy undertaking. And yet Gleick does such a fantastic job of outlining the times, events, and accomplishments of this man in less than 200 pages. Here, Gleick describes Newton from his birth on a farm to his works as a young college student at Cambridge. During Newton's formative years, we find that he did not just work in mathematics and physics, but also in alchemy and theology, even going as far as to deny the Trinity. Newton was also notoriously withdrawn as a young man, never even bothering to publish most of his discoveries until much later in his career. Gleick also does a great job of describing the origins of many of Newton's legends (the apple, the ""shoulders of giants"", etc.). I probably would have rated it higher if I didn't know some of this stuff about Newton already. However, through beautiful prose and solid research, Gleick shows how, indeed, ""...we are all Newtonians""."
249,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375171-joseph,4,"For such an interesting figure, I knew remarkably little about Isaac Newton, which is what led me to this book in the first place. In truth, I'm not sure how much there is to know; I assume his personal life is better documented than some of his contemporaries (I'm thinking predominantly of Shakespeare), but by how much, frankly, I'm still unsure.Gleick, to be fair, doesn't seem particularly interested in details outside of what Newton accomplished, but he still manages to impart a sense of Newton, the man, in addition to the scientist. His obsessions, idiosyncrasies, and feuds help to flesh out a rather interesting story.Gleick does a great job of documenting his subject's accomplishments, presenting them in such a way as to remind us how firmly they've been ensconced in the realm of modern thought. And while I would have appreciated a greater sense of the world in which he lived, if only to provide a better context for what he achieved, Gleick deserves credit for a great biography of both the man and the birth of modern scientific thought."
250,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010687-steven-dzwonczyk,3,"This book taught me that Isaac Newton was not a one trick pony as many tend to describe him. He was influential in many realms including physics, philosophy, and the monetary system of England, for which he was knighted. While he essentially invented the modern formula for scientific thought, reasoning, and experimentation, he was a human who was subject to petty competition with colleagues and a propensity to cling to beliefs that were not supported by his observations.A contemporary of Edmund Haley, it is interesting to see how the ideas of one man were advanced by the other. It is unlikely that Newton would have thoroughly characterized gravity without Haley's astronomical observations, nor is it likely that Haley would have been able to predict the paths of comets without Newton's ideas of gravity.The last 20% of this book was a bit dry, but the first 80% was top notch and inspiring to me as a scientist. It makes me what to seek out biographies of other great scientists like Max Plank, Christiaan Huygens, and others. I identify with them in my daily work."

There is certainly plenty of information in the book, but the timeline is not very fluid and often Gleick veers of topic to talk about the events surrounding Newton that seem to have no relevance to Newton. The Information is the only other Gleick book I have read, and this was written before it. In it you can tell that Gleick takes an interest in the advances in information transmission and retention, which is where he seems to go off topic. That being said, it is a very short book and inspired me to find a more detailed biography of Newton because Gleick does present him as a very interesting individual. Also, as far as I know there is not enough information about Newton to present a detailed biography and Gleick may have made due with what was available. I guess I will know once I decide to look further. All in all, worth the read but don't set high expectations."
252,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/176618-noiresque,3,"I listened to this book on CD over the last week.I found the reader's crisp, Jeremy Irons-like British accent to be helpful sometimes, but distracting an equal amount of the time.For a James Gleick book, I found this to be lacking in the insightful science that I'm used to from him.That being said, this was a good biography. Engaging, interesting, and at times, entertaining. This book does give you a true sense of the absolutely fundamental nature of Newton's discoveries to our current world. It's almost inconceivable.But this bio lacked the personal insights, to some extent, that make the person accessible.If you've already read some biographies of Newton, consider skipping this one. If not, this seems to be a good, solid tome on Sir Isaac.I read this simultaneously with Neal Stephenson's fictional account of Newton's time (which I'm still tackling). Stephenson's mostly factual accounts of Newton's experiments are far more entertaining and enlightening."

After finishing, I feel like I've only scratched the surface of all there is to know about the complicated world of philosophy, politics, and science which existed during Newton's life.This biography details the work of Newton and places it all within the context of his connection to other great thinkers in Europe at the time, particularly the Royal Society of England. He is shown to be both enormously innovative and deeply flawed. If interested in a greater understanding of Newton's contributions to the worlds of physics and philosophy (both scientifically and socially), read this book.Beware lots of old timey quotations :)"
254,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891277-fabian,4,"Isaac Newton was the culmination of all mathematics and physics that had come before his time and had remained separate. He is to date the most influential scientist of all time. He invented one half of the Calculus. He was at the same time fervently religious, and a heretic denying the holy trinity. He was obsessed with alchemy, to the extent of creating for himself a tonic/elixir to drink daily to prevent illness, which contained as an ingredient quicksilver (mercury). He was the first to document intelligibly the light spectrum using a prism, proving white light is comprised of many others. He also stared at the sun...An eccentric man, a life-time loner, a virgin maybe, a shut-in, a Mathematician, a Christian, ""the last and greatest magician"", a Scientist, a genius.

I knew of many of Newton’s achievements but was unaware of the childhood difficulties that shaped the man who transformed the idea of science and our understanding of the natural world. Along with the brilliant insights, Newton is shown to be petty and spiteful, especially in his later years. Apparently around 1700 there was no publish or perish mentality in academia as Newton held his advances in mathematics and science in secret for over 30 years. I definitely enjoyed reading this book, but I am technically oriented. If the reader also has an interest in the sciences then I would suggest this is a good read. "

272,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55558982-zack-dixon,5,AudiobookAn excellent overview of Newton’s scientific contributions. The author did a very good job of describing these in a way that would not deter those with arithmophobia but also captivate those with a love of math. 
273,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4587507-ash,4,"Sir Isaac Newton is regarded as a genius. I recently got hold of his biography written by James Gleick, who has also authored Genius and Chaos. I always wanted to know more about Newton’s life. Having known Einstein’s biography, I was curious to know how Newton’s life was. “Newton was not a pleasant man“, is a statement about him that always comes to my mind, after having read Stephen Hawking’s review about Isaac Newton. He had too many adversaries and never had any friends. He was very lonely in his life ever since he was born. He was fatherless and his mother never wanted him. He neither got married nor did he ever involve in any relationship with any woman. His life is really intriguing.After knowing such less facts about his life, I always wanted to read more about his life. This book is very small and gives a brief overview of Newton’s life. It is not very technical with too many details. I found it little disappointing since it is written in a layman language, helpful for non-science students. There is no mathematics at all in it, which is what I expected to find. But still it mentions all the concepts in Mathematics that Newton came up with, starting with Differential and Integral calculus to Binomial theorems, Ellipses, curves, centre of curvature, radius of curvature, cycloid etc. Even though I knew about some of his works, I never knew that Newton has contributed so much to Science and Mathematics, until I read the book. I am really in awe of this man.He truly is a genius. I cannot think of another scientist who can be of match to him. No wonder he was the first scientist to receive Knighthood. It also talks about all the arguments that Newton got involved into. The famous one with Leibniz over calculus, the hatredness that Hooke and he had for each other. It also speaks of how he took Flamsteed’s findings and published them even though Flamsteed did not approve of it. It also talks about Newton’s interests in alchemy and his work on element Mercury, which I did not have much idea about. It also talks about Newton’s interest in Biblical matters. His contributions to time, space and motion, his findings on planetary motion, movement of the moon, tides, comets are commendable. He invented the reflecting telescope (one of which I own).Now that gravity is like a matter of common sense these days, it is interesting to know what people felt back then. How people thought it was something supernatural or magical and how they condemned Newton for that. I loved the lines which Newton had written and the author has quoted where he says that he did not care about what others thought and that he was satisfied that it had a mathematical backing And like I had read earlier that the apple falling on the head did not lead him to find out gravity, the author confirms this theory saying Newton never mentioned that in any of his notebooks.One of the most interesting facts about Newton that I learned was that Newton never did any kind of research to get acclaim. He worked on problems and came up with solutions only for “himself”. He always wanted to learn the ways of nature and it was his thirst for knowledge that made him explore more. Another interesting fact about him was that even though he had done lot of work on light and color, only after others forced him, he published his work after thirty years. He never published his findings, he liked to keep them to himself. The author says a lot about Newton’s involvement with Royal society and how he ended up becoming the president of it later on.What I liked in the book were the quotes, statements, figures drawn/written by Newton himself that the author has quoted. It feels good to read what Newton had written in letters to other scientists or the notes that he took in his book about his findings. Because of the presence of such authentic writings, you tend to believe in everything the author says about Newton. A thorough research about his life has been done by James Gleick and he needs to be praised for that.However not much light has been cast on some of the important phases of Newton’s life. He had a nervous breakdown at the age of fifty or so and I really wanted to know more about how he recovered from it, but it has been very briefly mentioned. Even though the author has mentioned lines from letters that Newton wrote to other scientists, it still felt incomplete.Overall: It is a great book if you want to know more about Newton’s life. A very interesting read and because of its size, does not take much time to complete it. I would give this book 4/5."

275,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4669367-william,4,"With Isaac Newton, James Gleick once again reasserts his credentials as a scientific historian and writer of the first rank, as well as winning the National Book Award, and as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. But rather than concentrate on the likes of the father of Quantum Electrodynamics, the late Richard Feynman, or the originator of fractal geometry, Benoît Mandelbrot, Gleick's focus in this book is on Sir Isaac Newton, whose works on optics, and the creation of differential and integral calculus, allowed scientists to accurately describe and predict the motion of the planets in our solar system through the force of gravity. The mechanics of gravity as described by Newton are the foundation for physics and natural philosophy.Gleick, with great erudition and clarity on his subject, but unlike his other works, with tremendous conciseness, presents Newton's nearly impoverished upbringing, early schooling, and his transformation from a reclusive and excentric observational scientist and theoretician, to a single force and beast that transformed the Royal Society, and later by appointment from the King of England, the Royal Mint. We also see the range of Newton's personal relationships with colleagues, supporters and rivals, from the likes of Sir Edmond Halley, to the reluctant correspondences with compatriot Robert Hooke, and fierce exchanges with the co-creator of calculus, Gottfried Leibniz. The portrait of Newton penned by Gleick is not one that casts Newton in a distorted forward-looking and modern scientist, but as an individual obsessed with the pursuits and techniques of alchemy of the ancients. Also illustrated is Newton as a philosopher and scholar of theology of great earnestness, who undertook with tremendous scrutiny, a rigorous review of early manuscripts of both the Old and New Testament to form an unorthodox and borderline heretical view of the trinity in Christianity. In this masterfully crafted biography, Gleick makes accessible and understandable one of the intellectual giants in the history of science a compelling read."
276,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15900418-randy,4,"A short book (200 pages), replete with quotes from Newton and contemporaries that I found so oblique as to be incomprehensible. Could no one then speak plainly? Certainly any man as tight-lipped as Newton is a tough nut to unfurl, having interacted personably with so few and having lived when the written word was tiresomely formal and indirect. Inevitably, anyone a sphinx then shall remain one forever, despite the picklocks of able biographers such as Gleick.In the end, the book was unsatisfying. I felt I never understood Newton at all as a man. What drove him? What led him to gain the audience that his ideas needed to propagate? Was it only his mastery of mathematics, or did his arguments somehow resonate with and satisfy the inquiring minds of his day in a way that no one before had for millenia? When a revolutionary like Newton arises, the first question must be, ""How was this man so exceptional?"" Aside from Newton's astonishing degree of independence, both socially and intellectually, I can't guess why 2000 years had to pass before this guy overshadowed Aristotle -- by obscuring him rather than standing on his shoulders. If Gleick fails anywhere, it's in setting the social and intellectual stage for Newton's arrival and the positive reception of his ideas among peers. Why was 1642-1727 so ripe for such a man as Newton?I know other books delve more into the rise of the enlightenment era (Boorstein, Pagden, Gottlieb). Maybe Gleick just didn't want his book to wander as afar as that inquiry would demand."
277,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780263-ken,3,"Isaac Newton was born January 4, in 1643. He was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and natural philosopher. He was also an alchemist and theologian.Newton is considered by many scholars and members of the general public to be one of the most influential people in human history.His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"" and usually called the Principia), published in 1687, is probably the most important scientific book ever written.The book lays the groundwork for most of classical mechanics. Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws, by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation.I have always found it very interesting that Newton was also highly religious. He was an unorthodox Christian, and during his lifetime actually wrote more on Biblical hermeneutics and occult studies than on science and mathematics."
278,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446389-upom,4,"It's really astonishing what Isaac Newton did for the world. He applied mathematics to the problems of nature, and through it, created an order that defined physics without modification for 300 years, and is invaluable to this day. Furthermore, he was the son of a poor farmer, defining the tides, despite probably never actually seeing the ocean. Writing about the life of such a man is no easy undertaking. And yet Gleick does such a fantastic job of outlining the times, events, and accomplishments of this man in less than 200 pages. Here, Gleick describes Newton from his birth on a farm to his works as a young college student at Cambridge. During Newton's formative years, we find that he did not just work in mathematics and physics, but also in alchemy and theology, even going as far as to deny the Trinity. Newton was also notoriously withdrawn as a young man, never even bothering to publish most of his discoveries until much later in his career. Gleick also does a great job of describing the origins of many of Newton's legends (the apple, the ""shoulders of giants"", etc.). I probably would have rated it higher if I didn't know some of this stuff about Newton already. However, through beautiful prose and solid research, Gleick shows how, indeed, ""...we are all Newtonians""."
279,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/375171-joseph,4,"For such an interesting figure, I knew remarkably little about Isaac Newton, which is what led me to this book in the first place. In truth, I'm not sure how much there is to know; I assume his personal life is better documented than some of his contemporaries (I'm thinking predominantly of Shakespeare), but by how much, frankly, I'm still unsure.Gleick, to be fair, doesn't seem particularly interested in details outside of what Newton accomplished, but he still manages to impart a sense of Newton, the man, in addition to the scientist. His obsessions, idiosyncrasies, and feuds help to flesh out a rather interesting story.Gleick does a great job of documenting his subject's accomplishments, presenting them in such a way as to remind us how firmly they've been ensconced in the realm of modern thought. And while I would have appreciated a greater sense of the world in which he lived, if only to provide a better context for what he achieved, Gleick deserves credit for a great biography of both the man and the birth of modern scientific thought."
280,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010687-steven-dzwonczyk,3,"This book taught me that Isaac Newton was not a one trick pony as many tend to describe him. He was influential in many realms including physics, philosophy, and the monetary system of England, for which he was knighted. While he essentially invented the modern formula for scientific thought, reasoning, and experimentation, he was a human who was subject to petty competition with colleagues and a propensity to cling to beliefs that were not supported by his observations.A contemporary of Edmund Haley, it is interesting to see how the ideas of one man were advanced by the other. It is unlikely that Newton would have thoroughly characterized gravity without Haley's astronomical observations, nor is it likely that Haley would have been able to predict the paths of comets without Newton's ideas of gravity.The last 20% of this book was a bit dry, but the first 80% was top notch and inspiring to me as a scientist. It makes me what to seek out biographies of other great scientists like Max Plank, Christiaan Huygens, and others. I identify with them in my daily work."
281,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10857670-troy-mattila,2,"Before saying anything I must admit I knew very little about Newton before reading this book, but I don't feel like I know much more after. There is certainly plenty of information in the book, but the timeline is not very fluid and often Gleick veers of topic to talk about the events surrounding Newton that seem to have no relevance to Newton. The Information is the only other Gleick book I have read, and this was written before it. In it you can tell that Gleick takes an interest in the advances in information transmission and retention, which is where he seems to go off topic. That being said, it is a very short book and inspired me to find a more detailed biography of Newton because Gleick does present him as a very interesting individual. Also, as far as I know there is not enough information about Newton to present a detailed biography and Gleick may have made due with what was available. I guess I will know once I decide to look further. All in all, worth the read but don't set high expectations."
282,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/176618-noiresque,3,"I listened to this book on CD over the last week.I found the reader's crisp, Jeremy Irons-like British accent to be helpful sometimes, but distracting an equal amount of the time.For a James Gleick book, I found this to be lacking in the insightful science that I'm used to from him.That being said, this was a good biography. Engaging, interesting, and at times, entertaining. This book does give you a true sense of the absolutely fundamental nature of Newton's discoveries to our current world. It's almost inconceivable.But this bio lacked the personal insights, to some extent, that make the person accessible.If you've already read some biographies of Newton, consider skipping this one. If not, this seems to be a good, solid tome on Sir Isaac.I read this simultaneously with Neal Stephenson's fictional account of Newton's time (which I'm still tackling). Stephenson's mostly factual accounts of Newton's experiments are far more entertaining and enlightening."
283,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2825576-andy,3,"A far more thorough account of the life of Newton than I had seen previously, this book certainly accomplished the task sought after by all authors of nonfiction - that of inspiring greater curiosity in the reader. After finishing, I feel like I've only scratched the surface of all there is to know about the complicated world of philosophy, politics, and science which existed during Newton's life.This biography details the work of Newton and places it all within the context of his connection to other great thinkers in Europe at the time, particularly the Royal Society of England. He is shown to be both enormously innovative and deeply flawed. If interested in a greater understanding of Newton's contributions to the worlds of physics and philosophy (both scientifically and socially), read this book.Beware lots of old timey quotations :)"
284,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891277-fabian,4,"Isaac Newton was the culmination of all mathematics and physics that had come before his time and had remained separate. He is to date the most influential scientist of all time. He invented one half of the Calculus. He was at the same time fervently religious, and a heretic denying the holy trinity. He was obsessed with alchemy, to the extent of creating for himself a tonic/elixir to drink daily to prevent illness, which contained as an ingredient quicksilver (mercury). He was the first to document intelligibly the light spectrum using a prism, proving white light is comprised of many others. He also stared at the sun...An eccentric man, a life-time loner, a virgin maybe, a shut-in, a Mathematician, a Christian, ""the last and greatest magician"", a Scientist, a genius. The pinnacle of man. Great book."
285,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3705706-david,4,"In Isaac Newton, James Gleick provides a well balanced view of the world’s most influential scientific mind. I knew of many of Newton’s achievements but was unaware of the childhood difficulties that shaped the man who transformed the idea of science and our understanding of the natural world. Along with the brilliant insights, Newton is shown to be petty and spiteful, especially in his later years. Apparently around 1700 there was no publish or perish mentality in academia as Newton held his advances in mathematics and science in secret for over 30 years. I definitely enjoyed reading this book, but I am technically oriented. If the reader also has an interest in the sciences then I would suggest this is a good read. "
286,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,3,"This is one of those ""torn between three stars and four"" books. I did get a good sense of who Newton was. He was an asshole. Gleick gets pretty technical. A lot of this book describes Newton's theories, including calculus, in no small amount of detail. I've been frustrated in the past by biographies that didn't go into enough technical detail about the discoveries of various scientists, so this may be a ""Careful what you wish for"" situation; I've always been shit at calculus, and much of this book flew right over my head.But it does the job. At under 200 pages it's a snappy read, and I understand Newton and his place in history exactly as well as I want to, so: mission accomplished."
287,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5960332-karl-tenney,0,"The story of this man's life is flat-out amazing. Newton is one of those who qualifies to be on the very short list of the Smart People In History. This book gives one appreciation of Newton's intuitive brilliance. He described gravity, INVENTED calculus, figured out the inverse square law, understood and set out the rules for motion and on and on. There is also interesting stuff about his personal life. Disappointments, demons, dreams, etc.Some of this story was difficult to understand. I have a difficult enough time with math when it is laid out and described in a book or on a chalk board but when it is just described conceptually ... whew .... its a mental workout."

Isaac Newton
 soon hit its stride as it describes Newton's discoveries in mathematics, optics, physics and astronomy. Gleick chooses to focus on Newton's scientific accomplishments, but also includes details from his personal life that mark him as a bit of an odd duck. Newton was reclusive and secretive and his personal interactions, though they occurred infrequently, were marked by brinksmanship and confrontation. One is left with the impression of a brilliant but socially awkward nerd, more comfortable with the world of ideas than people. "
289,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,4,"A nice little book describing the strange individual who was perhaps the smartest human who ever lived. Newton is really only of great interest to scientists because we value his contributions so highly. The average person has no idea what his contributions were and could care less, but he was really the first true physical scientist who showed how the laws of nature could best be expressed with mathematics. He is the father of modern science.Read again, this time with an audiobook.His strangeness most certainly stemmed from his enormous genius. He was just very different from the average mortal. It reminds me of Churchill who was also very strange due to his genius."
290,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2357602-s-chandler,4,"Gleick nestles Newton right into historical context and uncovers Newton the person while dazzling us with Newton, the mind behind the math. He humbly walked a balance I find so beautiful I could cry:""it may also be allow'd that God created particles of matter of several sizes and figures, and in several proportions to space and perhaps of different densities and forces, and thereby to vary the laws of nature and make worlds of several sorts in several parts of the universe. At least I see nothing of contradiction in all this."""

This is a well-told story about a genius who was somehow able to imagine new sciences just by sitting and thinking. Newton possessed an intellect on a par with Einstein and came up with names for properties we all learn about in high school (and take for granted): mass, gravity, velocity. Gleick paints a detailed picture of an extraordinary man, drills down on the science but does so without every being dull or slow. ""Isaac Newton"" is a great, fast read."

I really enjoyed the process and iterations that it took for Isaac Newton to build the tools he would need to make his discoveries. It was disappointing to see that, like so many others, when he did have the power to do as he pleased, Sir Isaac abused that power like so many before him. "
295,1400032954,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3620841-brian,4,"Slow going at times, but packs a serious punch. I had never thought through the fact that, when Newton defined his laws of mass, motion, and gravity, no one even had words like ""laws,"" ""mass,"" ""motion,"" and ""gravity,"" in their modern senses. So it's like winning the Boston Marathon while wearing firefighter boots."" "

After reading this book, it's clear he's one of the founding fathers of modern science. Possibly a greater scientist than Albert Einstein himself. James Gleick tried to show Newton's ideas through Newton's words. This created an incredible impact but was difficult to read at times."

The book emphasizes the importance of Newton's discoveries very well. It also gives a very good image of the environment and the people who affected Newton's life.This book made me love Isaac Newton even more -if that is even possible.
