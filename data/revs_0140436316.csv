1,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"Darwin wrote this book in 1872. It's interesting to compare what he wrote about then with what his successor theorists write about today.In contrast to today’s emphasis on universals (e.g., humans are this or not this or that), Darwin notes throughout this book that individuals have a wide variability in physical, emotional, and mental characteristics. Importantly, this suggests variability in biological temperament (e.g., timidity and courage) and, more broadly, in inherited character traits. Many theorists have assumed that we are motivated by pleasure, which we seek, and pain, which we avoid. Darwin does not agree. Some instincts in other animals, and tendencies and dispositions within ourselves, are so strong that they are followed “from the mere force of inheritance, without the stimulus of either pleasure or pain.” “Hence,” Darwin continues, “the common assumption that men must be impelled to every action by experiencing some pleasure or pain may be erroneous.” Here, Darwin implies, strongly, that an internal “ought” drives us, not pleasure or pain. A pointer dog, Darwin summarizes, must point. Or, as Schopenhauer argued, internal need, is pain, and must be satisfied (pleasure). While some today look for the evolutionary function of various traits and tendencies, Darwin wrote that many of our human characteristics have no survival value. They may be neutral or may have developed through (non-survival-related) sexual selection, and could be retained within the species as long as they were not injurious. The second half of this book is entirely about sexual selection, where males and females develop various traits to attract mates and to out compete rivals (this topic does not get much attention within contemporary theory). Sexual selection is separate from natural selection, which applies to the ""general struggle for life."" The secondary sexual characteristics (traits not directly connected to the sexual organs) are ""highly variable (since they are not acted on by natural selection), both within a ""race"" and between ""races."" These include hair (or lack thereof); love of ornament (e.g., body paint; ""clothes initially were ""for ornament, not warmth); temperamental traits (e.g., courage); skin color (""Negroes admire their own color""); and love of musical tones (cadence and rhythm; ""poetry is an offspring of sound""). Regarding ornament, ""fashion"" has an interesting role as it lies at the cusp of conformity to group standards, yet wears out over time, which results in variations, but not radically so: ""The men of each race prefer what they are accustomed to; they cannot endure any great change; but they like variety, and admire each characteristic carried to a moderate extreme."" Ornament and fashion are related importantly, to beauty and the variable (by ""race"") of the standards for beauty (face shape, skin color, location of cheekbones, etc.). Darwin discusses at length the role the social group plays in individual survival. Briefly, individual survival depends on the social group; what is good for the group is also good for the individual. While many today discount the operation of selection at this “communal level,” Darwin sees our “social nature,” based on parental and filial instincts, as essential to individual survival. This attachment to the group is so strong that we are obedient to the group's wishes and judgment, and our “sympathy” is such that we care most about “approbation and disapprobation” (“love of praise and the strong feeling of glory, and the still stronger horror of scorn and infamy”). “As a social animal,” Darwin writes, “it is almost certain that he would inherit a tendency to be faithful to his comrades, and obedient to the leader of his tribe....” We have a sense for right and wrong, but the moral content varies by group. Good and bad are what is good or bad for the group. In his summary of our group-centeredness, Darwin sees three main components: social instincts, moral sense (care about what others think), and ""imagination"" (we remember past wrongs; we plan for the future).As a species, we share an underlying universal form to imprint on the group, but the content of that form – group norms – varies by group and culture (“Although man...has no special instincts to tell him how to aid his fellow-men, he still has the impulse....”). Even so, Darwin observes ""that a belief constantly inculcated during the early years of life, whilst the brain is impressible, appears to acquire almost the nature of an instinct."" Our commitment to the group is such that it impels us to altruistic acts that benefit the group as a whole, so that our social nature prevails over strict and pure self-preservation. We act for ""the general good"" of the tribe (not the general happiness of humankind). This other-regarding social instinct to support our tribe and the need to remain in its good graces removes, Darwin states, the reproach of laying ""the foundation of the noblest part of our nature in the base principle of selfishness."" But, then, he adds, ""unless, indeed, the satisfaction which every animal feels, when it follows its proper instincts, and the dissatisfaction felt when prevented, be called selfish."" But our tribal nature comes with a downside. We promote our group's collective interest and oppose, and even hate (enmity or hatred “seems to be the complement and converse of the true social instinct”) those who are different because they are seen as a threat. Darwin writes that while we take pleasure in social company, this does not extend to the “same species” but is, rather, focused on those “of the same association.” Yet, even with this emphasis on our biological nature, Darwin sees the capacity of the mind and reason to transcend our negative impulses so that we, for example, can see the dangers of tribalism, transcend them, and commit to “the dignity of humanity.”A few questions and concerns about Descent: First, Darwin states that the instinct for self-preservation is not felt except in the presence of danger. This is interesting as most theorists today would categorize much of what humans do as, ultimately, “self-preservation.” We eat to survive. We defend ourselves to survive. We are social because of survival value. Darwin apparently uses “self-preservation” only when the self faces immediate danger. Second, Darwin keeps sexual selection on a separate track from natural selection, yet he also says that sexual selection is even more important than natural selection as it leads to more progeny. Here, Darwin might be seaming these two selection theories back together as he states that “the better fit” leave more progeny. Yet, it's not clear how this all might work as those less fit can find each other and have children even though they don't compete at the higher levels. Much of the commentary on sexual selection focuses on males attracting females (“charming”) and out-competing other males, but Darwin is quite clear that females also do their considerable part to attract males via dress, ornament and beauty. Third, Darwin seems to have a strong Lamarkian strain. He makes continued reference to habitual actions that lead toward inherited traits, and it's not clear how that matches up with contemporary natural selection theory unless the genetic tendencies that lead to good habits result in greater survival and reproductive success.Finally, there's a strong cultural and class boundedness to Darwin's theory. He makes some unfortunate characterizations about savages (e.g., “the hideous ornaments and equally hideous music admired by most savages)” and women who he believes are mentally inferior. Highly civilized nations, he states, can transcend natural selection and “not supplant and exterminate one another as do savage tribes,” but that does not match up with history or Darwin's own view that whites are superior and savages are inferior. Even with those opinions, Darwin could not help make the observation from his Beagle days about the similarities of the savage mind “to ours; and so it was with a full-blooded negro with whom I happened once to be intimate.” Most troubling, Darwin comments that there are many from the lower class who “ought to refrain from marriage if they are in any marked degree inferior in body or mind.” From the context, Darwin is not talking about those who might be or ought to be confined to institutionalized care, but to those from extremely unfortunate circumstances (“abject poverty”). What or who is deemed inferior is a dangerous line of thought. The real threat to civilized life might just lie with those who have that sort of perspective. Given genetic variability, who's to say that those from the lower class might not rise to the highest levels and vice versa. Darwin worries that “the inferior members tend to supplant the better members of society.” That unfortunate comment also undermines Darwin's sexual selection thesis that the “better members” end up with the most progeny."

3,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2279250-sarah,1,"This is one of the few books I found no redeeming qualities in. Some of his sentences absolutely scream racism and sexism. I know that ignorant statements should not entirely discount what a person is saying but when Darwin refers to the ""Negro"" (his word) as an entirely different ""species"" than the European man; I think my cringe lasted for the rest of the afternoon. I am truly astounded that so many of Darwin's loyal followers have either not read this book or choose to ignore it. Granted it was written after ""Origin of the Species"" when Darwin had become inflated with praise so I will attempt to give him the benefit of the doubt and say he got carried away in his own ""brilliance"". Yuck."
4,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48011083-steve,5,"Need anything further be said of the origins of our species? While Mr. Darwin goes to great lengths to discuss variations among and between different species, particularly between the sexes, this book is as valuable a reminder today of who we are, and why we behave the way we do, as it was the day it was published. As Mr. Darwin reminds us, we are the product of a most savage and brutal history, yet we are capable of great tenderness and love. He ends the work with:We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system—with all these exalted powers—Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.I wish we had more writers like Darwin."
5,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1652517-merilee,4,"Hallelujah! Finished at last....and it only took almost 2 years to get through all 648 pages. Darwin is much more verbose in this book than he was in the very readable Voyage of the Beagle. I'm sure that this book made quite a (shocking) splash in 1874, when it was first published. He put off publishing it for a while after On the Origin of Species as he was well aware of what knickers would be twisted by the realization that he was actually saying that even humans evolved...from apes, no less. I'm glad to have read it, although there were very many more details than I need to know, especially about birds (over 200 pgs of them)."
6,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4515420-ali-shams,4,"“One must admit when he makes a mistake, reading my below review I can see how ignorant I was to the studies that where conducted after Darwin’s work which proved the parts related to natural selection, yes there were mistakes in some of Darwins observations, but natural selection is not a theory any more and there is enough evidence to prove it right more than any other simplistic explanation for human existence, unless you believe that we are living in a simulation and all the archeological evidence is put there to fool us” 31 Dec 2018Ok, I understand how important the work done in this book must have been at the time it was published, but now with the recent discoveries in this field many of the arguments and proves put forward could be scientifically argued. Also I couldn't help noticing the contradiction in his own work. I'm Not underestimating the work and arguments put forward as they are profound specially at that time but my issue is as scientist he would have gained my respect if he would have referred to his findings and encouraged further studies to be conducted, however instead he insisted that his findings are solid prove that Men descend from apes., and this should be considered as a fact Well a simple argument would be if all animals are subject to his evolution theory then shouldn't we see a different shapes of intelligent animals other than humans!Also he has noticed that by practicing certain activities the shape of the human would develop during his life cycle, which had been proved in other studies, so in terms of percentage change if applied then the evolution should have been faster than he depicted! Specially with the developments achieved recent millennium, I think the human brain is processing more info than he ever did before!One that a person would notice in reading Darwin his aristocratic views of humans from different classes, he referred to the Australian Barbarians, as more stupid form of humans and even more stupid than animals, I'm sure he would have had the same views about African tribes, well no comment!He also argued whether humans are in the evolution cycle or devolution which was quite interesting for me, he argued that capitalism could be a reason for devolution where selection is not done based on individual qualities but how rich a man is. He also referred to the below Poem from 550B.C. This suits my taste :)The Grecian poet, Theognis, who lived 550 B.C.""With kine and horses, Kurnus! we proceed By reasonable rules, and choose a breed For profit and increase, at any price: Of a sound stock, without defect or vice. But, in the daily matches that we make, The price is everything: for money's sake, Men marry: women are in marriage given The churl or ruffian, that in wealth has thriven, May match his offspring with the proudest race: Thus everything is mix'd, noble and base! If then in outward manner, form, and mind, You find us a degraded, motley kind, Wonder no more, my friend! the cause is plain, And to lament the consequence is vain.""(The Works of J. Hookham Frere, vol. ii. 1872, p. 334.))"

Also, I think I'd like to read the non-concise version. The editor's interjections are a little bit annoying and disjointed for me.Notes:p. 2 - Larmark argued that two laws of nature gradually changed life over time. Simple life forms perpetually came into existence, and they were all driven toward greater degrees of perfection. Species also adapted to their particular environments through experience."" There aren't two branches, so this is one of the differentiation that Darwin isn't into.p. 22 Darwin and Lamark are both thinking in terms of use and disuse. DNA doesn't quite do that.""As species evolve new habits, some of their genes become unnecessary. Mutations that disable them are not eliminated by natural selection, because animals with those mutations suffer no penalty.""p. 53 - The editor is talking about the idea that Darwin had to look at indirect evidence of evolution in humans b/c our history is only 200k years old and not long enough to really see any fossils and the like. He uses the pygmies, American Mayans. ""If a trait could increase a person's reproductive success, it could become more common over the generations."" The problem is, in this case, it was a nutrition that was causing this group to be notably shorter.p. 65 “It is familiar to everyone that watchmakers and engravers are liable to be short-sighted, whilst men living much out of doors, and especially savages, are generally long-sighted.”p. 109..This is pretty f***-in racist, but it's the time he came from. ""No doubt the difference in this respect is enormous, even if we compare the mind of one of the lowest savages, who has no words to express any number higher than four, and who uses hardly any abstract terms for common objects or for the affection with that of the most highly organised ape."" Ouch. Luckily from there the rest of the chapter, largely speaking (still a couple of weird jibs in there) is comparing human to other animals, not specific groups of humans to specific animals or brits to the rest of the ""savage"" world. p. 118 - ""The principal of Imitation is strong in man, and especially, as I have myself observed, with savages."" Dude... you are a visitor that speaks nothing of their language. These people are trying to communicate with you and you gonna say this is just what savages do? Oh my my....Then, just in case you think it might be a compliment he says:""In certain morbid states of the brain this tendency is exaggerated to an extraordinary degree; some hemiplegic patients and others, at the commencement of inflammatory softening of the brain unconsciously imitate every word which is uttered, whether in their own or in a foreign language, and every gesture or action which is performed near them."" p. 130 He talks about how monkeys do in fact use tools, so that's not a way to differentiate man.p. 193 ""Nevertheless the difference in mind between man and the higher animals great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind."" Nopey. That was proven in 2013. But it's ok. p.195 - The editor differentiates between what Darwin says and what is later used to justify stuff like Eugenics. Even if he agreed/disagreed, it is immaterial. It's not what he actually published and wrote and there is some evidence he would not have felt that way (although I could not yet tell from some of the authors that have published biographies. More to do there).p. 198 ""Nothing speeds up evolutio fatser than disease, because any mutuation that can provide some resistance may save an animal from death."" Actually true or not, very freakin close having no idea at the time about virus/bacteria.p. 225 he thought we evolved from apes. Kind of, not exactly.p. .227 A person considered black in the United States might be considered white in Brazil.p. 291 - ""Polygamy...leads to the same results as would follow from an actual inequality in the number of the sexes; for if each male secures two or more females, many males cannot pair; and the latter assuredly will be the weaker or less attractive individuals."" Interesting. Not sure what to think.p. 369 ""When faced with certain kinds of mental challenges, men and women use different parts of their brains -- and end up performing equally well."" Actually not totally true, but again this research is more recent in neurology. This editor is a little off.  "
8,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"Evolution is an area of major interest to me so it is curious I had never read ""The Descent of Man."" The reason is I had been told that there is no science in the book worth mentioning, and having now read the book I find that is the case.In his conclusions at the end of the book Darwin states his ideas put forward in the book are ""highly speculative and may be in error."" He was correct in that statement.Basically Darwin posits that the various human races, while descended from an ape-like ancestor, differ from one another due to sexual selection, e.g. the preference of females in choosing whom to mate with. For example, the dark skin of many races he attributes to female preference for dark skin. He states that it is not due to environmnet because Dutch settlers living in South Africa for 300 years still had very white skin. Therefore environment could not be the cause. Here Darwin simply betrays the complete lack of understanding of his era of geologic time, for which he must be forgiven. To him 300 years was a huge amount of time.I did find the book worth reading, however, for historical reasons concerning the history of science, if not for the sake of science itself. Read once again Jan 2016. Much of what Darwin writes here is simply wrong, due to his complete ignorance of genetics and the causes of heritable variation in organisms.While I believe that all educated persons should read ""The Origin of Species"" this work really only appeals to those with a deep interest in the history of science."
9,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"Darwin applies his theory of natural selection to humans in ways that are not supported by today’s evolutionary science. Echoing Malthus, Darwin frames his argument by saying that reproduction outpaces the resources necessary to support a population and this creates competitive pressure that natural selection acts upon. “As all animals tend to multiply beyond their means of subsistence,” he writes, “so it must have been with the progenitors of man; and this would inevitably lead to a struggle for existence and to natural selection.” The strong survive to propagate their kind; the weak die off. Groups extended and amplified this competition, pitting one group against the other. “Savages, when hard pressed, encroach on each other’s territories, and war is the result,” Darwin writes, “but they are indeed almost always at war with their neighbors.” The stronger group reproduces its kind and advances the species.As to what constitutes group strength, Darwin focused on the “arts,” by which he meant intelligence to create superior warfare technology. “Civilized nations are everywhere supplanting barbarous nations,” Darwin states, “and they succeed mainly…through their arts which are the products of the intellect. It is, therefore, highly probable that with mankind the intellectual faculties have been mainly and gradually perfected through natural selection….” This knowledge is passed on to succeeding generations, thereby advancing the group’s superior strength. (1) Group strength was also directly related to the “moral” faculties, the social instincts, that brought the group together. This involved a willingness to cooperate for the good of the group. And, with the advance of “reasoning powers,” Darwin writes, “each man would soon learn that if he aided his fellow-men, he would commonly receive aid in return.” (2) Then, bringing in Lamarck’s inheritance of acquired characteristics, Darwin says that “from this low motive he might acquire the habit of aiding his fellows; and the habit of performing benevolent actions certainly strengthens the feeling of sympathy which gives the first impulse to benevolent actions. Habits, moreover, followed during many generations probably tend to be inherited.” Hume’s approbation and disapprobation supplements reason-based cooperation. “Praise and blame” rests on sympathy (here, sympathy means a capacity to know how others view oneself, as opposed to care for the plight of others). Endowed with such cohesive-inducing attitudes, all of this now translates into the advantage of one tribe over another and the advance of the species. (3) Darwin then applies his thinking to “civilized nations.” We “do our utmost to check the process of elimination,” he writes, and allow “the weak to propagate their kind.” (4) Darwin refers to the “imbecile(s), the maimed, and the sick,” though it’s clear that he applies his theory to moral and intellectual capacities as well. If the checks “do not prevent the reckless, the vicious and otherwise inferior members of society from increasing at a quicker rate than the better class of men, the nation will retrograde, as has too often occurred in the history of the world.” A few critical comments: First, were all groups hostile? Wasn’t there also cooperation for mutual benefit? Or, just an uneasy coexistence? More importantly, didn’t the struggle for existence apply to the environment as a whole (and not just hostile groups), and wouldn’t this necessitate a mutually dependent, cooperative, network that created genetic-reproductive benefits for all? Prior to Chapter V, Darwin seemed to recognize that the social instincts were created by natural selection to provide mutual survival benefits: “With those animals which were benefited by living in close association the individuals which took the greatest pleasure in society would best escape various dangers, whilst those that cared least for their comrades, and lived solitary, would perish in greater numbers.” Second, although Darwin’s group selection and the inheritance of acquired traits (habits and emulation) are generally considered to be inaccurate, Darwin was getting at something. If, as discussed above, the group is essential to individual survival, then the unit of selection can remain still at the gene-individual level. Now Trivers’ reciprocal altruism (mutual benefits) and Dawkins’ extended phenotype notion (the group as an extension of the individual gene’s interest) can work within a Darwinian context. How might these social tendencies be passed along genetically in a way that avoids Darwin’s Lamarckian language? Evolutionary scientists today define altruism to mean actions that benefit the genetic success of others at the expense of the self. That is not the dictionary definition of altruism. Even if it were, that definition stipulates that those with altruistic tendencies always died before reproducing when it is just as likely that they did not die and were able to pass along their other-regarding traits. And, given the integral connection by the individual-gene and group interest for survival and reproductive success, is it not possible that the social instincts evolved, as they did for parent-child relationships, because of the extensive and intensive reciprocal benefits and that those who were more other-regarding were able to pass along the same tendencies to their progeny?Third, Darwin is at his best in emphasizing the role of variability (physical, mental, moral) among individuals. Given this, is it not possible that some are more other-regarding than others, at their genetic core? The benefits of other regarding behavior are clear for the reasons argued above. The survival benefits of an egoistic, self-regarding strategy are also clear (i.e., individuals who dominate, manipulate or deceive others). In other words, could there could be the twin poles of a successful evolutionary strategy, with most of us lying at points in between.Darwin also did not pick up on the implications of Hume’s argument that reason is a slave to passion. Given the variability of human nature, and the possible poles of human nature that lie at our genetic core, the advancement of reason does not lead, as Darwin believed (e.g., “highly civilized nations do not supplant and exterminate one another as do savage tribes”) to a common good. Reason is the advance of means and technique, but reason doesn’t change the motive force that comes from a relatively fixed character or disposition. Reason that rests on an other-regarding foundation is one thing. Reason that serves an egoistic nature is quite another. 1. “Now, if some one man in a tribe, more sagacious than the others, invented a new snare or weapon, or other means of attack or defence, the plainest self-interest, without the assistance of much reasoning power, would prompt the other members to imitate him; and all would thus profit. The habitual practice of each new art must likewise in some slight degree strengthen the intellect. If the new invention were an important one, the tribe would increase in number, spread, and supplant other tribes. In a tribe thus rendered more numerous there would always be a rather greater chance of the birth of other superior and inventive members.” 2. “When two tribes of primeval man, living in the same country, came into competition, if…the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members, who were always ready to warn each other of danger to aid and defend each other this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other….Selfish and contentious people will not cohere and without coherence nothing can be effected. A tribe rich in the above qualities would spread and be victorious over other tribes: but in the course of time it would, judging from all past history, in its turn overcome by some other tribe still more highly endowed. Thus the social and moral qualities would tend slowly to advance and be diffused throughout the world.” 3. “[An] increase in the number of well-endowed men and an advancement in the standard of morality will certainly give an immense advantage to one tribe over another. A tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high degree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be victorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection. At all times throughout the world tribes have supplanted other tribes; and as morality is one important element in their success, the standard of morality and the number of well-endowed men will thus everywhere tend to rise and increase.” 4. “No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.”"

It is surprising to me that a man of Darwin's intellect could not see that any difference in the scholarly abilities between the men and women of his time was due entirely to differences in opportunity resulting from cultural attitudes.Anyone interested in hearing the clear voice of Darwin coming down through the years should of course read The Origin of Species, but also this important work as well."

Well what can I say, other than I was easily distracted by easier books to read.Overall, Darwin is quite a persuasive fellow with very dry wit. No one can doubt that his research is extensive. Can you imagine the discussions that he had with his peers over a meal or ale. Or the correspondence sent back and forth over a differing view point. You have to applaud these educated persons, if not necessarily for their content but the time and efforts of these pursuits in attempting to broaden the human mind. If you can divorce yourself from today's understandings and treat these writings at the height of their times then there is in absolute quality in his arguements.I really appreciated the final words in his general summary""-with all these exalted powers-Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.""Finally, I have to say that Mr Darwin really and I mean really loved birds."

There are a lot of amusing anecdotes involving various animals, which I enjoyed. This book also covers sexual selection in complete detail. Darwin goes through sexual selection in insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The section on birds is very long, and is well worth reading for anyone interested in ornithology. He shows how the thought process of other animals is not so different from our own, and gives clear evidence that man is descended from an ape-like progenitor.There are also negative aspects. Darwin unfortunately became more racist in his later years, and it shows in this work. Too many times he brings up the term ""inferior races"" and ""savages."" In some rare cases (e.g. tribes that practice infanticide), I can see why the term ""savage"" is used. But in many other instances, it is simply a way of putting down non white races.For those that are OK with racism (which seems to be too many), there is still a huge negative from a scientific perspective. In Origin of Species, Darwin goes into his theory of natural selection extensively and shows why it is far more likely than Lamarck's theory of acquired characteristics. Somehow in his old age, he starts giving credence to Lamarckian theory!! This is now known to be an erroneous theory, and Darwin knew this back in his younger days. It is frustrating to see how often he attributes inherited traits to the accumulated effects of progenitors using or disusing parts.In summary, the book is still worth reading as it goes into extensive detail on sexual selection, and in that way it complements Origin of Species, which goes into extensive detail on natural selection. But there are negative aspects of racism and Lamarkian theory that crop up in various sections. "

I read Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species over a decade ago, but for many different reasons didn't quite get around the following it up with the descent.There is something special about reading his work that will always make me feel that he wasn't just ahead of the game; he had decided to reinvent what the rule book should look like. This is evident in the vision that he puts forward showing how much he could analyse and deduce through observation and study. More importantly he understood his and sciences limitations at the time of writing the material.Darwin heavily references other great scientists in an understated manner and a sense of respect for other specialists who were at the forefront of defining their fields of study. This not only endorses the subject matter, Darwin also hides the somewhat dryness of the subject matter through the use of articulate and beautiful prose.When it comes time for my children to start picking up and reading great classics, then Darwin will be there, just as current and contextual as he was writing at the end of the 1800s.Jules Verne may have been the epic visionary for the future but Charles Darwin was the grounded realist who was able to draw the past and the present into his presence and give them comprehension."

There are chapters on human evolution, to be sure, but the lengthiest writings have to do with sexual selection in non-human species (there are three or four chapters on birds alone). This fact was my first disappointment.My second disappointment is many of Darwin's remarks on the differences between the sexes in humans. A lot of his hypotheses in this regard are severely dated and, frankly, cringe-worthy.Nevertheless, the historical influence of Darwin, and a view of the incipient ideas that eventually form modern evolutionary theory, make this an informative read."

This places man at the apex with the rest of the animal kingdom as more specific interactions of the same, depending on their niche. Much of this book is just route example, with most of the really interesting stuff about realigning human interaction in the beginning."

It's much more than just natural observations contained in this book, there are some pretty interesting and unique ideas about psychology. Where this work is instrumental is in establishing a link between humanity and the animal kingdom. The difference between us, the readers of this text, and animals is only one of degree, but not that we as humans are essentially different from the animal kingdom."
26,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1632189-matt,4,"Any timidity Darwin showed in The Origin of Species published 12 years earlier is cast aside in The Descent of Man. Confidently, he proposes the application of natural selection to the history of humankind. But he does not sacrifice his scientific integrity in the process. After laying out his observations and the research of a lifetime, including everything from the vibrations of hair on flies' antennas to a lengthy examination of peacock feathers, he humbly offers room for doubt:Many of the views which have been advanced are highly speculative, and some no doubt will prove erroneous; but I have in every case given the reasons which have led me to one view rather to another. It seemed worth while to try how far the principle of evolution would throw light on some of the more complex problems in the natural history of man. False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness; and when this is done, one path towards error is closed and the road to truth is often at the same time opened. Pg.675-676.With that same intellectual honestly, he plainly lays out his views on why we are descended from some less highly organized form. And with striking imagery, he compares the embryo of a human to a dog. The physical structures “all point in the plainest manner to the conclusion that man is the co-descendant with other mammals of a common progenitor.” Darwin was a naturalist. His method was not the scientific method. He didn’t experiment to come to his conclusions. He observed (and read the observations of others) and recorded. Extensively. He was a man, who by curiosity and training, spent a lifetime perceiving what most of us only see. He sought patterns and connections in the strange chaotic designs of our world. At times, he speaks like an anthropologist, at others a biologist and, at others, like a druidic philosopher. Despite the wonders he saw, he refused to bow to social convention and couch them in religiosity. Just as biblical time vs. geologic time was the friction preventing acceptance of natural selection in The Origin of Species, the belief that humankind has a special spiritual privilege in our world is the obstacle for evolution. Darwin faces such arguments head on:The belief in God has often been advanced as not only the greatest, but the most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower animals. It is however impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that this belief is innate or instinctive in man. On the other hand a belief in all-pervading spiritual agencies seems to be universal; and apparently follows from a considerable advance in man’s reason, and from a still greater advance in his faculties of imagination, curiosity and wonder. I am aware that the assumed instinctive belief in God has been used by many persons as an argument for His existence. But this is a rash argument, as we should thus be compelled to believe un the existence of many cruel and malignant spirits, only a little more powerful than man; for belief in them is far more general than in a beneficent Deity. The idea of a universal and beneficent Creator does not seem to arise in the mind of man, until he has been elevated by long-continued culture. Pg. 682For Darwin, we are creatures of our society and the values we cherish are such because they have, through time, been values reflective of our communal sexual selection and evolution. Whether they favor survival or not. Detractors seeking to confirm their beliefs and show Darwin possessed “false views” will find some solace in these pages. He is, as we all are, people of our time. He is most vulnerable when he takes the anthropologist role. His thoughts on women, and their place in society, simplistically attributes their class status to a result of biological consequence. Likewise, he makes broad sweeps when interpreting in cursory fashion the aesthetics and values of other cultures. I’m sure for some, these admitted speculations of his are enough to discredit his arguments and his life’s work. Which, in this humble reader’s mind, seems like a considerable shame and disservice. It is only by defying social convention and comfort that Darwin provided a theory which caused seismic changes in thought for the 20th century. Sometimes misfires happen. But, as Darwin himself noted, those mistakes permit one path towards error to close and allows the road to truth to open.And, even if you disagree with everything he ever wrote, you can at least find pleasure in watching a man experience joy in a world that most of us don’t even bother to see. Toward the conclusion of The Descent of Man, Darwin stated:I know of no fact in natural history more wonderful than that the female Argus pheasant should appreciate the exquisite shading of the ball-and-socket ornaments and the elegant patterns on the wing-feathers of the male.Pg. 686.Regardless of however this world was made, Darwin appreciated it in all its beautiful subtlety. And he shared it with us."

29,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,4,"In 1859, Charles Darwin published his On the Origin of Species. In this ground breaking book, Darwin explained how species originate via the principle of natural selection. Each organism differs from the other members of the population, and lives in a continuously changing environment. Therefore, each organism has, in interaction with its environment, a degree of fitness that determines his chances of survival and reproduction. Since all organisms differ, there are various degrees of fitness within a population: some organisms are more successful than the rest. The traits (bodily and/or mental) that determine this relative reproductive success are inherited by their offspring, meaning that these traits spread throughout the population. So variety within a population leads - via natural selection - to the development of different species. This is Darwin's message, in a nutshell.Even though Darwin left out, on purpose, the topic of Man in his On the Origin of Species, it is not hard to see that readers would immediately extrapolate from that book to humanity. In Darwin's time, men believed in a ladder of nature. Nature was divided into categories that were progressively more perfect (i.e. shaped in the image of God). From dead matter, via plants and bacteria, to the animals, with mankind as apex. Mankind itself was divided into categories - races - with the black 'savages' at the bottom and Victorian Englishmen at the top. In his Origins, Darwin basically destroyed the natural hierarchy, with mankind at its apex. Since species originate via natural selection, and mankind is just 'another' species, mankind is just one of the animals and shares common ancestors with the apes. Darwin destroyed the man-made hierarchy and left Man standing as 'just' a more intelligent ape. (This is, in effect, what the title in The Descent of Man stands for). As for the second hierarchy, that of the different races, Darwin abhorred slavery and the abonimable treatment of 'savage' tribes. It is, actually, one of the driving forces that made Darwin write The Descent of Man (1871). In this book, Darwin offers his thoughts on the genealogy of man, and with it he hopes to convince readers that mankind shares a common ancestor with the apes, and that the different races are just the product of selection. But, according to Darwin, the races aren't shaped by natural selection (at least not for the biggest part; he does notice the changes in the susceptibility of whites, as compared to blacks, to tropical diseases like malaria). The differences between the different races of man - hair texture, skin colour, etc. - are due to sexual selection. Males compete for females and females pick their sexual partners according to their preferences. Ultimately, the preferences of the females are just arbitrary signs by which they differentiate, so we could (in a narrow sense) call them fashions. Darwin claims that female preference lies at the root of the differences between races; in Africa females prefer black men and in Europe females prefer white men. Now, from our comfortable positions in the 21st century, we can laugh at this, but we should realize that beneath the superfical comical appearance of Darwin's ideas lies an important issue - for (at least) two reasons.1. As mentioned, Darwin lived in a racial society, which saw itself as superior to all other races, and he personally wasn't convinced of this - for example, he felt abhorred by the treatment of his fellow Europeans of the slaves in South America. This is the time of the American Civil War and of the political movements that fought for equality of rights and treatment (for example, women's rights). So Darwin, with his theory of sexual selection as origin of the races, took the argument of superiority out the hands of his opponents. After The Descent of Man it was just a fallacy to claim superioriy on the basis of genealogy.2. For more than 100 years after Darwin, sexual selection was ignored as a scientific theory, but the last 50 years have seen a vindication of Darwin's thoughts on this. Many experiments and observations attest to the preferences of females being the cause of conspicuous and extraordinary ornaments in males - from birds to mammals to fish. There is even a growing body of knowledge to the claim that our mental capacities have (at least partly) evolved as a 'linguistic peacock's tail'. I am aware that this is only part of the explanation - theories on social group living are part of the solution here as well (dealing with individuals and keeping scores requires mental capacity) - but the point is that Darwin's ideas have been acknowldged. Sexual selection does exist and is an important driving force in evolution.Darwin published The Descent of Man in 1871. Around this time, the first excavations of early human settlements and skeletons of our ancestors became known. This means that part 1 of the book is outdated and can be read as a fiction. His views on sexual selection as a force of evolution have been ignored for a century, but it seems that he has, at least on this topic, been vindicated. The content of part 2 (the descriptions of sexual selection in all the different animals) is clearly outdated though; behavioural studies have progressed ever since Darwin. Therefore, there are two important caveats to Darwin's theory of sexual selection.1. Modern research in genetics has verified that our DNA differs barely (around 1%) with chimpanzee and bonobo DNA. So our closest relatives - the chimpanzees and the bonobo's - share about 99% of our genetic code. This verifies Darwin's point of gradualism between man and animals. Next, research in population genetics shows that differences on traits within ethnic groups (i.e. races) are bigger than differences between ethnic groups. In other words: on average, human beings are (genetically) more alike than our concept of 'race' suggests. This partially verifies Darwin's point of gradualism between races. Partially, since race does exist (there are for example differences between races in susceptibility to diseases) and this is not a product of sexual selection but of natural selection. There is evidence that skin colour isn't the ladies' choice, but that it depends on the amount and intensity of sunlight - which we need and which varies geographically. So Darwin's conclusion is right, but his premisses are false.2. Darwin clearly acknowledged that different cultures have different preferences, and that these preferences are sexual and the cause of the different races. There is, in fact, some anthropological and sociological research that establishes Darwin's claim. Different cultures have different views on marriage, rituals, social bonds, etc. But the social sciences have, unfortunately, been contaminted with ideologies determining the truth of theories (instead of observation and experiment). The infamous example of Margaret Mead beeing fooled by Samoan girls and claiming (thus on false evidence) that male dominance (i.e. female suppression) is a Western trait, is most illustrative. Mead wanted to preach feminism and found what she was looking for; this isn't science though.The social sciences have become warzones of ideologies, and it is hard to seperate truth from fiction. An important (and relevant to Darwin) point is that there is a growing amount of evidence that races or cultures don't differ fundamentally. The ideal of beauty seems to be stable across all cultures; the same with sexual preferences of men and women. This means that we should focus on the commonalites between cultures and that we should be aware of our bias to detect differences everywhere. In this sense, genetics and anthropology both point to the same conclusion: mankind doesn't differ that much, and race is, in most cases, a social construct that hasn't been validated by science. There is an exception: in the field of medicine there seem to be significant differences between races, thus making it an important scientific concept in this field.The Descent of Man itself, as a book, is long and wide in scope. In short: Darwin starts (in part 1) with explaining the geneaology of man. In part 2, he sets out his theory of sexual selection and then applies his theory to all the different types of animals. This means a lot of descriptions on how particular birds or fish look like, attract mates, etc. It is only in the last chapters that Darwin moves to man and races. While his Origins of Species is interesting as a general book on natural science, The Descent of Man is less readable and less interesting for modern day readers. Darwin's history of mankind (the first part) is very outdated, and much of his work on sexual selection (the second part) has been falsified or updated. Yet, as a historical document, it remains an important work. For one thing, it clearly shows people's tendency to apply science to society (selective breeding/Social Darwinism; something Darwin didn't promote, by the way) or vice versa (infusing science with ideology, as in Darwin's concept of race).I'd recommend people interested in Darwin and evolutionary biology to read The Descent of Man, but skip large portions of part 2 (especially the parts on sexual selection applied to birds, fish, reptiles, etc.). As closing remark, I'd like to add something on Social Darwinism. Darwin was a Social Darwinist, in the sense that we use it; it is only after his time that this term was coined to distinguish between Darwinism as a scientific theory and a Darwinism-inspired policy of selected breeding. So in that sense, Darwin is hard to classify; he did see the superiority of Victorian Englishmen as the measure of all things - biology and ethics. He didn't advocate any policy of selective breeding though, as the later eugenics movement would do.Social Darwinism claims that the human race degenerates and we should intervene. In other words, some authority should decide who breeds with who, and he should base this selection of a particular set of values. It is always unclear (1) who constitute(s) this authority, (2) on what right this supposed authority operates and (3) why it is exactly this particular set of values that are to be preferred and not others. We can easily prevent falling into the trap of Social Darwinism by always remembering that science doesn't prescribe morals. Science describes reality; ethics prescribes rules of conduct. Those are two different areas. Deriving morals from science is the naturalistic fallacy. This becomes immediately clear when we try to posit Darwinism as a principle of society: there were radicals arguing that World War 1 was the struggle between races; there were different radicals claiming that the best indidivuals would die while the unfit who remained safely behind would be able to reproduce, leading to further degeneration. In other words: Darwinism - or any scientific theory, for that matter - is NO basis for morality, you can legitimate anything you want with it, meaning: exactly nothing."

Those who marry early produce within a given period not only a greater number of generations, but, as shewn by Dr. Duncan, produce many more children. The children, moreover, that are borne by mothers during the prime of life are heavier and larger, and therefore probably more vigorous, than those born at other periods. Thus the reckless, degraded, and often vicious members of society, tend to increase at a quicker rate than the provident and generally virtuous members. Or as Mr. Greg puts the case: ""The careless, squalid, unaspiring Irishman multiplies like rabbits: the frugal, foreseeing, self-respecting, ambitious Scot, stern in his morality, spiritual in his faith, sagacious and disciplined in his intelligence, passes his best years in struggle and in celibacy, marries late, and leaves few behind him. Given a land originally peopled by a thousand Saxons and a thousand Celts—and in a dozen generations five-sixths of the population would be Celts, but five- sixths of the property, of the power, of the intellect, would belong to the one-sixth of Saxons that remained. In the eternal 'struggle for existence,' it would be the inferior and LESS favoured race that had prevailed—and prevailed by virtue not of its good qualities but of its faults.""(Sources from the quote have been removed, but the text is otherwise as it appears on Project Gutenberg)."

While I found Origin of Species and Voyage of the Beagle to be worthwhile, I have to say that unless you have some specific historical or cultural reason to dive into Descent of Man, I'd be very wary.At this point, Darwin has already put out his world-changing work on evolution. Descent of Man is a follow up that focuses exclusively on sexual selection and how various animals might develop unusual colors or features that do not help them survive per se, but do increase their odds of successful mating and passing on their genes. It is very slow and tedious going. Though the book is called Descent of Man, it is in fact mostly concerned with animals of all types, and man is only addressed in a rather cursory fashion at the end of the book.As others have mentioned, the book is also full of antiquated ideas that strike the modern reader as racist and sexist, sometimes in the extreme, though these attitudes were of course not unusual in Darwin's own time.This is all said with no disrespect to Darwin and evolutionary ideas, which are certainly true. But we've come a long way in the 150 years or so since this book was published and it is frankly best left as a historical footnote to more recent work. I read it so you don't have to. "

I read it more as a history lesson because we now know so much more about genetics and anthropology than he could have ever dreamed of. I was surprised to see how much he focused on sexual selection for our and other animal evolution and he certainly makes a good argument.He seems to predict a lot of things, like gender-specific inheritance which would later be confirmed by X and Y chromosomes.

He goes through many things that serve only the purpose of alluring a mate and might not otherwise exist. He attempts to show why they would be harmful to the species if not for sexual selection or how they only benefit it in that manner.It is an interesting read, but I am not sure the book would be nearly as long as it is had it been subject to today's peer review standards."

46,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7231894-chris-branch,3,"Before reading On the Origin of Species in 2011, I was a little concerned that although the ideas were clearly innovative when written, it would prove not to have stood the test of time. For the most part, this wasn't the case; I enjoyed the book quite a bit for Darwin's excellent writing and passionate yet reasoned explanations of his findings.This book demonstrates a bit of what had concerned me about Origin - it suffers from Darwin's main blind spot: not being aware of genetics and thus having no hypothesis for the exact mechanism of inheritance. He often reaches for possibilities, saying things like ""natural selection would probably have been greatly aided by the inherited effects of the increased or diminished use of the different parts of the body."" (p. 24) There are so many speculations here that we should not be surprised that he gets some wrong, and in fact it's impressive how many he gets right.The writing style is precise and professional, but also excessively wordy at times. Each chapter has a flat structure in which Darwin exhaustively lists every case he knows of to demonstrate a particular point, in many cases casually referencing colleagues and correspondents who provided the data. To emphasize the extreme thoroughness (or wordiness), in chapter XVIII, Darwin states “I have now given all the cases known to me of a difference in colour between the sexes of mammals.” but then proceeds to discuss additional cases for another fourteen paragraphs. It seems this style is not unusual for the time when Darwin was writing, but it does make me more appreciative of the modern use of clear English in science writing for a general audience, not to mention the practice of summarizing the key facts and implications for the reader rather than simply dumping all available information onto the page.The frequent use of anecdotes and personal observations to back up Darwin's positions also strikes me as a negative. Reading these in a modern book would tend to bias me against the writer's conclusions. In this case, we already know the truth (or not) of most of Darwin's points, so this isn't as serious a problem. However, there are some claims that even as an avid reader in evolutionary biology, I wasn't sure if they turned out to be correct. This makes the book more of historical than scientific interest.It's particularly noticeable in chapter VII (On the Races of Man) where Darwin makes statements about mental and physical features that at best would be considered anecdotal, such as ""Every one who has had the opportunity of comparison, must have been struck with the contrast between the taciturn, even morose, aborigines of S. America and the light-hearted, talkative negroes"" and ""Again, when I looked at the statue of Amunoph III., I agreed with two officers of the establishment, both competent judges, that he had a strongly-marked negro type of features"" (p. 110). Even considering attitudes of the time on this particular topic, and allowing for scientists to expand upon existing knowledge by their own insights, it's disconcerting that Darwin didn't include language indicating that these are merely personal observations, and to draw scientific conclusions would of course require more solid data. Later, in chapter XIX, Darwin presents what can only be described as an embarrassing litany of casually racist comments and speculation about racial differences in appearance and preference based on unfounded assumptions and stereotypes.Likewise, when discussing matters of evolutionary psychology, Darwin is unable to avoid making moral judgments that were appropriate to his time. While again, this makes many passages primarily interesting as a matter of history, there may be a lesson there for us to keep in mind when discussing evolutionary psychology today. On the aesthetics involved in sexual selection, Darwin seems conflicted. In the section on birds, he rightly states “...we must not judge of the tastes of distinct species by a uniform standard; nor must we judge by the standard of man's taste.” even though a few pages earlier he’d written about macaws: “have these birds as bad taste for musical sounds as they apparently have for colour, judging by the inharmonious contrast of their bright yellow and blue plumage?” (ch. XIII)In the end, much of Darwin’s speculation based on anecdotes is a bit tedious in its exhaustiveness, and of questionable scientific importance, but worth reading to see his thoughts on the subject matter."
47,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10138996-vanessa-wester,4,"It seems apt to review this book, since it was written in the time period that I am writing my latest books about. It is important to remember what people use to think, and how much they knew considering the fact they had nowhere near the access to resources we now have.There is no denying that a lot of the material included in this book is scientific, and that his speculations are slanted by the ""way of thinking"" at that time. It would be incredible to bring Darwin to modern day to see if his theories stack up...Either way, for a FREE read, I recommend this to anyone who wants to know how we arrived at many of are thoughts in the modern age. The theory of supremacy, racial equality, survival of the fitness, etc, are all discussed here. I am sure Darwin's thoughts sparked many a war, controversy, and the need to change the status quo. Many a suffragette must have read this and felt compelled to change the view that a woman has a smaller brain! There is no denying that on the whole men are superior is stature and strength, but, since this was written, woman have risen to the challenge and proved that we can just as feisty and determined, skillful and intellectual, and, unfortunately, as cold-blooded and ruthless as males are stereotyped to be!Human beings are by are nature not the same. We are diverse and unique and capable of anything we set our minds to... like I always say, ""if it had been down to me, we'd still be in caves!"" I have never been a risk-taker when it came to the physical. However, I certainly do not lack courage or conviction when it comes to getting something done!I wonder what you all, if you can brave it, think of this book?All the best,VanessaCharles Darwin""Wow... This is a mammoth read! If you only read the first few chapters, you will be horrified by his use of language. Called disabled people ""monstrosities"" and ""idiots"" - I will use the term loosely now! But, this was the terminology used in that period of time, so I will try not to scream ""racist"", etc.Most of this book is scientific in nature. Very matter of fact, according to the information he has available. The amount of research he used and quoted beggars belief when you consider this was a time without computers, etc. I am amazed at the information he could source and use.The research used in relation to ""savages"" is extensive, and I wonder if we would ever refer to other races of mankind as ""savages"" because they do things differently. In this age, we strive to find a meaning for life, have a quest for equality, and long for a better future. Perhaps, as Darwin points out, in our fight for these principles we lost control and therefore we now have an ageing and growing population, and struggle to make ends meet. War is something that has gone on from our basic beginnings, and it appears that it is something we can not prevent. However, women have a huge role to play in the future of humanity. Thank goodness we are no longer killed as he noted from the chapters on infanticide!I have to rate this book a 4 purely for the scale and depth of research. I do not have to agree with his conclusions and that it my given right. I wonder how he would have felt knowing that many of his scientific ideas led to genocide, and justification of mass slaughter. If only we were equipped with the benefit of hindsight!I have to admit that I skipped some chapters on insects, etc, but I did read the bulk of it. If you want to try good luck! It'll take you a while... And you might roll your eyes at a lot of his speculation!"""
48,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233798-monica,3,"So technically I have been reading this work for almost a year so my disclaimer is that I may have forgotten a few things noted along the way. I by no means have studied this work but did just read it for educational and historical and perhaps a little bit of entertainment purposes. I am not a scientist or claim to know much about this topic but yet I have been interested in it. So quick notes of sarcasm and inappropriate jokes - Darwin discusses the evidence that our ears were previously pointed. So I'm concluding that we are all descendants of elves not apes and the Lord of the Rings hits closer to home now. Darwin also notes that individuals that have a few longer hairs in their eyebrows is an inherited factor and that in the past they were used as organs of touch in animals. Well my husband has a few of these, many older men (geriatric age) I've seen these on - not sure what conclusion I want to make about this. Darwin has some interesting theories in Part I Chapter 4 about positive traits including: courageous, sympathetic and faithful, leading to more successful tribes. My interpretation also was that these do not survive to pass down traits. I wonder what today's evolution of this would be. Intellect, I can perhaps see, as discussed but moral characters is a bit more difficult as moral characters are frequently learned behaviors. There are almost some contradictions as Darwin also states that the poor and reckless multiply more rapidly then the careful and frugal.Part II Chapter 8 notes that males to females born proportion was 104.5%. I wonder if this still holds true, and if this was just in England. I have always been informed that there are more females than males but I am unsure if this is at birth or because the difference in life expectancy. This also makes me wonder if males have intrinsic factors that lower their life expectancy or if it is all environmental.In general, I wonder how much of the information published was new information at the time, how much continues to be relevant and how much has been disproved.Darwin talks extensively about sexual selection. He briefly mentions inheritance. Again, I am not a scientist and have only a rudimentary understanding of all of this, but I have to wonder if, at the time, Darwin would have consulted and crossed theories with Mendel's genetic work of dominant traits how mind blowing their research could have been. From what I can tell, the two were alive and doing research about the same time but it seems that Mendel's research was not accepted until much later. I wonder how many suppositions about sexual selection would have been different.There comes a section towards the end of the work that talks about men's superior intelligence and sexual selection of women/men with ornamental/ beauty considerations etc etc. Although this was an interesting perspective of the time, it still was a bit white male centric which I found cause to be annoyed by in Darwin's Origin of the Species.The first paragraph of the ""General Summary"" does do a nice job of stating a disclaimer for Darwin stating -""Many of the views which have been advanced are highly speculative, and some no doubt will prove erroneous; but I have in every case given the reasons which have led me to one view rather than to another"" but I guess this is just science in general and how we progress. Isn't it?"
49,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44693825-michael,3,"Quite shameful how long it took to read this, but I did put it aside for another book while travelling in April/May, but mostly I so remiss due to the utter dryness. I deeply regret thinking this was a book worth reading through casually. It is not, it is a reference piece. It is merely pages upon pages of collected evidence, which is fantastic, it shows how through and fastidious this man was with his paradigm shifting ideas. He made big claims and had all the receipts. As someone currently finishing their degree in evolutionary biology, I can appreciate this and am glad I read this classic, but do wish i’d had the foresight to realise it would be exactly this. I read this thinking it would possibly enrich my Honours research, however at most it has provided a couple flowery quotes. Given that this work is so old, most of it has been superseded or is readily garnered from more contemporary literature, whether you study evolution formally or not. This book is very much only of historical interest now. I do personally think Darwin’s writing is verbose and circular, but it’s hard to say if this is a product of his era or him personally. I won’t comment on the systematic racism and sexism that is clearly so natural to Darwin and his contemporaries. I think readers who condemn them for this are, frankly, morons. I am not a fan of historical revision and will not support slandering central figures for being a product of their cultural and intellectual context. I say this particularly because the copy I borrowed contained vapid annotations in the margins focusing purely on any pedantic point that wasn’t entirely inclusive, leaving me with sore eyes not from reading but from rolling. Further, if you read this book properly, you will see hints that Darwin himself was not fully subscribing to such institutional racism. As said, I’m glad I finally read this, but regret not skimming it first and realising it was more suited for just that. I skipped several chapters in the middle dealing with specific taxonomic groups. I think the beginning and end of the book are more than sufficient to understand Darwin’s ideas even if you’ve never read about sexual selection, and to get a feel for how he worked. For me, that is what I usually take away from books of this age and calibre; an appreciation for how the author worked and watching pivotal ideas unfold almost in realtime, seeing him raise questions or make claims we now know the the correct answers to. It’s just a exciting, rosy feeling. "
50,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75953334-forked-radish,2,"While Chas. Darwin was an excellent observer and recorder, the reason he was shipped on the Beagle, his inferences are poor and even his intelligence comes into question many times in this book. For example: ""That the state of the body by affecting the brain, has a great influence on the moral tendencies is known to most of those who have suffered from chronic derangements of the digestion or liver."" Is Darwin saying that the digestion or liver is responsible for morality? Yes, sadly, he is. In the following passage Darwin asserts that the ""golden rule"" is a natural product of evolution: ""The moral sense perhaps affords the best and highest distinction between man and lower animals; but I need say nothing, as I have so lately endeavoured to shew that the social instincts, - the prime principle of man's moral constitution - with the aid of active intellectual powers and the effects of habit, naturally lead to the golden rule, ..."" It's bizarre that such a counter-intuitive concept as the golden rule should be thought natural by anyone except, of course, someone with: ""...The mind of an utter idiot, lower than that of an animal low in the scale, to the mind of a Newton."" The preceding quotations are from Chap. IV; Mental Powers of Man and the Lower Animals.Darwin also uses highly dubious circular logic in the following: ""...The habit of performing benevolent actions certainly strengthens the feeling of sympathy which gives the first impulse to benevolent actions."" Then Darwin is guilty of reductio ad absurdum with: ""To the instinct of sympathy, ... it is primarily due, that we habitually bestow both praise and blame on others, whilst we love the former and dread the latter when applied to ourselves; and this instinct no doubt was originally acquired, like all other social instincts, through natural selection."" Darwin's ignorance of epidemiology is revealed by the following: ""There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind."" The preceding quotes are from Chap. V; Development of Intellectual and Moral Faculties.Overall, boring and bad, but thought provoking. I had previously believed in evolution, albeit teleologic or orthogenetic evolution but now I reject it completely since there in zero proof.Conclusion: Chas. Darwin should have stuck with his pigeons, people are too complex, contentious and contumelious."
51,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1097517-barry-cunningham,3,"A very difficult read. I read it as an eBook on my iPhone, which made it doubly difficult because all the footnotes are interlineated in the text.Historically, the book is very important. Darwin had left off dealing in detail with man's place in evolution in The Origin of Species because he knew it would be a lightning rod, and, as such, a distraction from his exposition of principles of natural selection.I found the book's organization somewhat confusing. Only the first part of the book is really devoted to analyzing man's place in the natural world and how he has evolved. The second part of the book is devoted to sexual selection, surveying sexual characters throughout the animal kingdom. The third part attempts to tie together the first two parts, examining sexual characters in man.Throughout this book, I was struck by how little data Darwin actually had on which to base his inquiries. One hundred forty years later we have exponentially more data on species, their genomes, relations, and behaviors. Hence, much of Darwin's discussion is speculative, as he readily acknowledges. DNA was unknown to Darwin, so he speculated about ""gemmules"" being transmitted to offspring. Much of his speculation about the relations among species is outdated by the precise information we have from DNA sequencing.Unfortunately, Pasteur's insights into the crucial importance of microbial life, which were being formulated at that time, seem to have come a little late to have much influence on The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man. In reading this book, I can easily find flaws in his speculation on particular subjects: we now know about the importance of symbiosis as a mechanism driving evolution thanks to the work of Lynne Margulis; we know about the influence of geography, native species, natural resources, and infectious diseases in accounting for cultural and technological differences that Victorians might have attribute to race (e.g., see Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse; and the language about lower and higher species, savage and civilized races, now seems hopelessly Victorian.Darwin was a trailblazer. This book reminds us how little Darwin could see from where he stood in the mid-19th century. We must also remember where he started and how far he came. His broad vision of the web of life and man's place in it was insightful and revolutionary. "
52,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6820027-peter-cawdron,5,"Not the lightest of reading material, but thoroughly engrossing once you pick up on the subtle threads Darwin exposes. This book should stand equal to On the Origin of Species. Darwin is meticulous in documenting his sources, which makes it hard to read at times as the flow is often broken by these interjections, but his insights into both animal and human behaviour are astounding. Calling this book the Descent of Man is a little misleading in that 80% of the book is to do with establishing the role of sexual selection before showing how it applies to humans. And it is fascinating. It's more than peacock feathers and bower birds, the role of sexual selection on the development of species is far more dominate than I ever dared imagine. Whenever you see sexual dimorphism, where the two sexes of a species differ slightly (and not just in extreme examples, it could be subtle differences in height, size, colour, longer teeth, etc), then sexual selection is coming into play. Sexual selection and natural selection go hand in hand. Darwin asks the question, ""Why are ravens black?"" And it's not because they hunt at night or in the shadows, it is because their mating preferences have steered their colouration.No doubt some will be offended at Darwin's seemingly sexist remarks on the differences between men and woman, and I'm sure if given the exposure we have in the modern world, Darwin would probably revise some of his comments, but men and women aren't physically equal. And nowhere is this more evident than in the Olympics, where no fuss is made over the sexual segregation of a running race, etc. Why are women physically smaller, more petite and generally paler than men? The answer, surprisingly, is it's not that women are smaller, but that men are bigger. Men are sexually selected by women to be stronger, more robust. Men compete with men for the attention of women, and women are picky, they have too much to lose if they chose the wrong partner, and so this difference has evolved as a result of these choices over thousands of years.Anyway, jump to the summary of each chapter and to the chapters on the conclusion if you don't want to wade through all the detail, there's some real gems in there."
53,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32845512-joonas-vali,2,"Pretty much what I expected this 600+ page book to be. I would recommend it for an enthusiast who's looking to get the historical feel and look of the theory of evolution. I would not recommend it to someone who does not feel at home in the subject already. To be honest, the book holds many observations about different animals and at time feels more like an encyclopedia than a book that you would read from the beginning to an end. There are too many facts about Latin named species I'd have to look up from the internet to see what it looks like, and most of the times I wished the chapter would already reach its end. While I understand that most of the observed data is there to prove his conclusions, modern online encyclopedias obsolete most of the knowledge in the book, as it feels a bit bloated with it. The book is something that if I'd lived in the 1800's I would have certainly recommended to every literate person around as ""something you need to read before you die."" Modern alternative for Darwin is Dawkins, and even without considering the fact that Darwin's original theories were proved flawed in many aspects, like he himself carefully speculates in the end of the book might happen, the modern knowledge acquired within last 150 years is certainly more fun to read. I guess what amazed me the most in this book is the fact how well connected Darwin was, having biologists send him data from all over the world on request and that the book is full of references to articles and earlier works on the subject, proving that evolution was not something that Darwin ""just came up with"", it was already well known. Having already read Dawkins' ""The Selfish Gene"" and the ""The Blind Watchmaker"" I feel like Darwin's previous and more well known book ""On the Origin of Species"", might not provide me with enough value to read it."
54,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2169303-ty,4,"Very well written, very interesting. But I must admit I skipped a few chapters as the book was due at the library. And he elaborated way too much on certain points.That said, his theories were very well thought out and supported by scores of evidence, even if some of them were anecdotal. He raised many very interesting points on the origin of humans and, despite the title of the book, other animals as well. With modern research techniques, and the advances in genetics, many of his theories have now been validated. Likewise, many of them have been proven wrong. Keep that in mind while reading. However, it is interesting to note that what we now know as ""sex-linked"" and ""autosomal"" inheritance was in some way described by Darwin under his sexual selection theory. Hence, Darwin can be said to be rather ahead of his time.Overall, a good read but not perfect, though the perfectionist in him can be detected."
55,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/886234-scot,3,"I understand that Darwin was very paranoid about releasing this for fear of persecution, and also understand that in today's day and age when this all seems to be recognized as fact that I should have enjoyed this more. That said, I think he should have stuck to the straight story and focused on natural selection which may or may not be the full story, instead he often gets speculative about the sexes and races maybe because he feels emboldened about finally speaking his truth and sadly this detracts from the overall fascinating road to discovery he undertook to get where he was going.Would only recommend this if you either have a serious interest in evolution or like books where you can get upset about the antiquated views of past centuries. If that is the case, let it out and scream out loud!"
56,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2244282-mary,5,"Darwin's last book addresses the problem of man's place in the universe. Far from being made in the image of God or even a link in the great chain of being, the human race is not even the goal of evolution. It is the adaptive product of evolution as are all the other species on earth today. He concludes that we are descended from a common arboreal ape ancestor, that intelligence is just an adaptive byproduct of evolution and that there is also a moral evolution in that we have adapted for life in society. His findings on sexual selection were revolutionary for his time. Males compete for females and the females do the choosing - based on what is attractive, viz. the peacock. Darwin even posits an evolution of ideas. If correct the idea will survive and if wrong it will steer us toward the right idea. What a Romantic!"
57,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/523305-prooost-davis,4,"The book's complete title is Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, and the bulk of the book deals with sexual selection. Chapters eight through twenty are detailed catalogues of secondary sexual characteristics of types of animals, from ""lowest"" to ""highest,"" with discussions of whether these characteristics are likely to have arisen from sexual selection, or some other factors.In fact, the ""cataloguing"" aspect of Descent of Man lessens its readability, for which reason I knocked off one star. The book, however, with its index and end notes, makes a fine reference. And the number of questions naturalists had not answered when the book came out in 1871, but discussed there nevertheless, has probably been the source of many a PhD thesis in the ensuing years."
58,0140436316,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james,5,"This is Darwin's final major book with a focus on man. The primary focus is on man's origin in Part I, and sexual selection in Parts II & III. I found the discussion of moral sense and social instincts to be particularly enlightening with his focus on ""sympathy"" and ""habit"" as discussed by the Scottish philosophers (cf. Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments). Notably he rejects God as the source of conscience. The bulk of the text, however, contains detail examples and discussion of the process of sexual selection. While I did not enjoy it as much as The Voyage of the Beagle it is still a classic worth reading. "

Now, this is a BEHEMOTH of a book, Darwin covers what seems like every single species in their evolutionary process. From birds and insects to large mammals and humans. The detail is...well, honestly, it's a little excruciating to read through for fun. But I love that Darwin went to such extensive lengths to prove his points, spent so much time getting all the details and proofs lined up for his audience, to help them understand his process, the process of the earth's changes and evolution from primordial soup to thousands of distinct species.

At the time, he was advocating a controversial view, but today, it is accepted by all apart from religious extremists and a few cranks, and even most Creationists will accept the power of sexual selection to modify species.That said, I could have done with it being half the size and didn't really need to read quite so many details about bugs."
