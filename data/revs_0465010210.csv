0,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161314-chris,4,"Conversation with Eliza Bot. Wed Feb 15, 2012. ( http://chayden.net/eliza/Eliza.html )How do you do? Please state your problem.>> Hello, Eliza.Hi. What seems to be your problem?>> I recently read Sherry Turkle's book, ""Alone Together"". I am not sure how to review it.You say you read Sherry Turkle's book.>> Yes. It's a book about how sociable robots and networked technologies change the way we relate to one another.You seem to be quite positive.>> I'm not. In fact I am sympathetic to Turkle's argument that when we interact with sociable robots (like you) we elevate machines to being ""alive enough"". Yet online I treat many people as objects. In Turkle's words, these are ""fearful symmetries"".Is it because you are not that you came to me?>> I came to you because you are one of the sociable robots Turkle examines.Perhaps in your fantasies we came to each other.>> Perhaps we did. I must admit, I am genuinely surprised by that suggestion.You don't seem quite certain.>> I rarely am.Can you elaborate on that?>> I think the web is incredible. It might be the greatest thing humans have created. Yet I increasingly believe that it screws up the attention spans of people around me, feeds anxiety, and isolates me from others.That's quite interesting.>> Really? That's what you have to say?Why do you ask?>> I ask because I am concerned about teenagers who feel tethered to their online selves. I ask because I find the act of posting confessions to places like Postsecret, rather than apologising to people we hurt, disturbing. I ask because I worry that we increasingly externalise problems rather than looking within.How long have you been concerned about teenagers who feel tethered to their online selves.>> This is ridiculous.I'm not sure I understand you fully.>> At least we agree on something. Good night.Good night."
1,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8514079-chris-elsden,1,"I really wanted to like this book. Honestly I did, it deals with a fascinating topic. Sadly however, I found this far too anecdotal, repetitive and bias. Her point felt laboured, the anti-technology rhetoric was tiring and she seldom gets into any great depth on an issue. I felt she was able to point out a fairly evident phenomenon such as people texting more and calling less but failed to deeply analyse it beyond showing the angst and frustrations it brought teenagers. I do believe ""we are all cyborgs now"", as a young person I can see our behaviour is changing, our generation is different, this book just never really showed me the fundamental psychological changes that are occuring or where they will lead, beyond the somewhat ludicrous suggestion that we will all want to marry robots in 2020.Although her anecdotal evidence is considerable, I seldom found it convincing as an argument for anything in a general sense. What's more, many of the problems she pointed to, weren't shown to be explicitly caused or exacerbated by our connectivity or technology. The teenagers she interviews sound like stereotypical teenagers, with stereotypical problems about identity, sex, image etc. She doesn't show that facebook is the problem, rather than just a new way to express and work with their problems. For example she quotes ""Adam"", an addicted video gamer, who admits he doesn't really like his job. Without doubt he is a sad example of addiction and the power of very clever video designers, but to me the example says more about Adam, and the problems with his real life, than the omnipotent pervasive technology. In another age perhaps he would have been an alcoholic, a drug user, or a problem gambler. Finally, the anecdotes and her own personal references made her line of argument at times incoherent and unclear. You had to flip back a couple of pages, to figure out exactly where she was going with a particular story of teenage trauma.Basically a lot of what she claims may be true, some of it sounds dubious, I was just expecting a more thorough treatment of the topic, there were very few moments which were truly thought provoking or original."
2,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5964579-roger-haskins,5,"Wow. Yeah. Can humans find companionship with robots? Should they? 2 years ago I would've thought the author was stretching for scify stories. After working at Verizon and seeing the disproportionate emotional responses people give when their device doesn't work as expected i totally agree with her. Consider the difference between having friends and being ""friended"" and for too many it is the difference between getting what you want and getting what we think we want. The book does a great job looking at the way technology infiltrates our relationships. A generation who has not had the emotional input from their parents has gone looking for it elsewhere. Moving from multitasking to multi""life""ing combining the real relationships of those around them, seamlessly with the digital relationships of those absent. Many use technology to avoid people in a selfish way in order to keep from having to use social graces, filter themselves, or reveal themselves in a way that might leave them rejected. For those who consider humans to be godless cogs in an evolutionary assembly line, humans can easily be reduced to the level of machines. And for those who believe everything down to the rocks beneath our feet have a soul, machines can easily be elevated to the level of humans. But i believe God created me in his image and breathed life into me. That sets humans apart. Electronics can aid us, but we approach a slippery slope when we look to them for companionship, assurance, and comfort. In the words of Thoreau, live life intentionally and do not live that which is not life. I recommend this book to marketers, counselors, clergy, and anyone else who studies the way our environment molds us and the decisions we make."
3,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1630617-moira-russell,0,"Poorly written and not that well-researched -- and my eyes glazed over so much during the long first half about robots I didn't retain much about it -- but the second half, which discusses avatars, Second Life, Skype, texting, Facebook, WoW, and so on, was a lot better, and helped me articulate some of the misgivings I've been having recently about the time I spend on the internet.It was interesting, and saddening, she spent almost no time on blogging and the ""classic"" journaling sites like LiveJournal, Blogger, Diaryland, well-known bloggers like Neil Gaiman or Cory Doctorow, or even corporate ""blogs"" (essentially press releases - but look what happened in Netflix's comments section when they announced the death of DVDs). It's all about Facebook and Twitter and texting, in no small part because the book is focused on very young people (it's essentially a ""letter"" to her college-age daughter). I first got on the internet basically to blog and for free web-based email, in 2000, and the drinking-from-the-firehose effect of Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook and other sites seems overwhelming and superficial to me. But there I am anyway, at least on G+ and Twitter, trading bits of my identity for bytes of connection. Not a good bargain.Like some other reviewers here, I also felt the book was pretty much two disconnected halves -- I kept waiting for something like an insight about how the robot nannies and nurses described in the first part resemble the virtual selves and 'weak connections' detailed in the second, but no dice. The argument is pretty convincing that the internet is built on hundreds and thousands of weak connections -- strangers 'liking' a post on Facebook, or a review on GoodReads, a photograph on Flickr, what have you. Is there that much difference between a cadre of silent lurkers -- 'friends' or 'readers' -- and the wondrously detailed motion capture in modern films, or endlessly attentive robot nannies? Probably not. She struggles at the end to come up with a ""it's not going away so we have to know how to deal with it"" conclusion; probably noone today would buy a book that points out the real core problem with the simulacra is that it is, in fact, inauthentic. The virtual Emperor has no (tangible) clothes."
4,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724491-paige,2,"Sigh. This book. Great title, great subtitle, I wish the content had delivered. Unfortunately I am no closer to telling you why we expect more from technology & less from each other than I was before I read this book.One of the main things that bothered me about this book was that, even though I was really interested in these issues, Turkle did not argue her points very well or very strongly. She only very briefly touches on why we should be concerned about the phenomena of ""being connected"" in the first place. She doesn't talk about deaths, injuries, and collisions caused by texting & driving, which is a HUGE problem. All her ""research"" into the way it changes relationships between friends and family members is anecdotal and shows me pretty much nothing. She only barely--and I do mean barely, maybe two sentences in hundreds of pages--touches on the changes in brain chemistry that takes place when a person is engaged with a screen. Instead she has paragraph after paragraph, chapter after chapter of what this kid said about his Furby, what THIS kid said about HER Furby, what THIS OTHER KID said about THEIR Furby, what this kid said about her Tamagotchi, what THIS kid says about HIS Tamagotchi, what THIS OTHER KID said about THEIR Tomagatchi, what this senior citizen said about My Real Baby, what THIS senior said about My Real Baby, what THIS OTHER SENIOR said about My Real Baby. Seriously. That is what the first half of this book consists of. The second half consists of ""this is how this teenager runs her Facebook profile, this is how THIS teenager runs HIS Facebook profile, this is how THIS OTHER TEENAGER runs THEIR Facebook profile!!"" It's honestly not a boring read at all, I enjoyed it, but eventually I did remember what this book is supposed to be about. It's really a shame because there are many times that she raises some really important and thought-provoking questions. And then leaves them there unexamined.Her references are pretty poor. What's more, most of the footnotes don't even show you a source, they are just her rambling about something completely unrelated to the corresponding sentence in-text. O...K...The ""research"" she does do is dubious. She says, ""I find people willing to seriously consider robots not only as pets but as potential friends, confidants, and even romantic partners."" Yeah and I can find people who think alligators built the pyramids if I know where to look. What she claims is widespread she doesn't back up with any statistics or studies, and from my own anecdotal experiences, the whole ""robot as friend/romantic partner"" fantasy is not at all widespread or commonplace. And I'll point out that I don't work at MIT or go to robotics conferences so my experience may be the more mainstream of the two. Maybe she finds people willing to consider robots as potential friends because she is asking them to do so. Hell, I think robots are pointless and they basically hold zero interest for me (also I think it's sort of unethical to put so much time and money and support behind them when there are actual people and actual animals that are starving and suffering to death--but I feel that way about a LOT of things, not just robots), and I would consider the question of robots as friends if somebody asked me to. I mean, you ask people to consider robots as friends and romantic partners and then you're like ""OMG THEY WERE WILLING TO CONSIDER A ROBOT AS A FRIEND!!!!!!""? Why would you even do that?I stuck about 200 page markers in this book and I could go on for a lot longer, but I will say, in Turkle's defence, that only about half of them are things I took issue with. She made a lot of assumptions I didn't agree with and she didn't support her thesis to my satisfaction, but like I say, she does raise some important questions. The writing is engaging and fun to read. I'm glad I read the book but I wish it had lived up to its promises. "
5,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1429082-daniel-solera,4,"This is the second book of my ""The Dangers of New Technologies"" series of book reviews. I decided to read Sherry Turkle's Alone Together after reading an article in Slate about it. When I started working in an office that blocked Facebook, I stopped spending unnecessary amounts of time on the website and came to the realization that my life was unchanged because of it. So when I learned that someone had written something of a psychoanalytic profile on the website's effects on our daily lives, I had to read it.Of course, Turkle's book isn't just about Facebook. It is divided into two sections, the first of which, ""In Solitude, New Intimacies"" is about our growing attachment to robots. Turkle shows how people will open up to robots such as MIT's ELIZA or Furbys or the robotic dog AIBO, eventually coming to love and nurture them. Despite the fact that these people are completely aware that these cybernetic creations aren't alive, they project human emotions onto them to the point where the line between robot and living being is blurry to them. She argues that a great appeal is that they are somehow better than the ""real thing"" - robots won't deliberately hurt you, they won't die after you've become attached to them and they're always there. However, by simplifying these relationships, you cut out all the complexities (or some might say ""difficulties"") that make genuine relationships worthwhile. Turkle talks about robots primarily in nursing homes and daycare centers, focusing heavily on how children and the elderly would interact with them. After reading this, my reactions ranged from shock (children so readily accepting robots into their lives) to sadness (adults sending robots to visit Grandma instead of themselves).But I bought and read this book for the second section, ""In Intimacy, New Solitudes."" Here is where Turkle talks about Facebook, texting and chat. She talks about how a Facebook avatar is only a version of one's self, a projected, ideal version that we broadcast to the world in vain hopes of representing the convergence of all our most desirable personality traits. Second Life takes this to a new extreme by literally letting you create your avatar as a heightened, ""better"" self. Texts are bereft of the spontaneity of real conversation and robs the dialogue of the essence of social interaction. Phone calls have been relegated to logistical exchanges and chats are one of seven different concurrent activities. With this, we have to ask, is the act of spending uninterrupted time with one another slowly becoming archaic?Turkle's conclusions rely very heavily on the opinions of her subjects. The grand majority of this book is composed of transcripts from her sessions. In true psychoanalytic fashion, she reflects her subjects' thoughts back to them in the form of more questions and ultimately conclusions. She rarely directly cites works and keeps the focus largely on what is said and what it means. It can get repetitive but not to a fault. Instead, you just keep reading and asking yourself, Who are these kids and why are they sending upwards of 200 texts a day?A few weeks ago, I called a friend of mine from college just to see how his life was. We literally talked just to talk and catch up. Yet, I couldn't help but feel like I had to have a singular question to ask, or a particular issue to communicate other than ""What's Up?"" Awareness, regrettably, does not imply immunity."
6,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/179382-audrey-babkirk-wellons,5,"If I had to pick two descriptors for this book, I'd say ""thought-provoking"" and ""stone-cold chilling."" As for the first part of that, I found myself alternately highlighting brilliant pieces and writing counterpoints in the margins. By the end, though, I was swayed to her way of thinking: that in our excitement for the benefits of technology, we have overlooked real and true dangers.The sections about human-robot interactions are the creepiest thing I've read in a long time, and not not solely because of the threat of some future dystopia. More often than not, hearing (in quotes from her interviews) what people ALREADY BELIEVE about simulation and the value of humanity will stop your blood in its tracks (and make you want to throw your arms around the person next to you). Highly unsettling and thoroughly enjoyable! If you haven't read her early works, like Life on the Screen and The Second Self, go back and find them. The technology she describes may be old now, but the implications are timeless."
7,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410586-john-carter-mcknight,4,"A mixed bag. Turkle's overall tone, despite her constant denials of Luddism, is one of ""Get off my lawn!,"" of cranky alienation from digital culture. There's too much of ""the technology I grew up with is natural and human; the technology of Kids These Days is causing a parade of horrors.""Despite Turkle's crankiness, she does have some excellent critical observations. Her methodology is somewhat troubling, though, relying on anecdote and case study. I found myself wondering how much she cherry-picked examples, giving us only Thoreauvian teens craving wilderness and solitude, or longing for their parents to put down their BlackBerries. That said, she does effectively problematize a clear cultural trend for more attenuated contact with other people, and the role played by technology in enabling us to maintain a screen between ourselves and others. "
8,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,3,"Hmmm. Fascinating concept. Copiously researched. Boring as all hell.Okay, just kidding. A cheap effort to get the attention of all my on-line friends out there with whom I apparently have these illusory relationships (and, perhaps, feel pressure to serve up charming and witty sound bytes that I'm less compelled to do IRL). The book wasn't boring as all hell; it made some very interesting points at times. But there were certainly problems with the overall execution, and provocative though it was, I can't unreservedly recommend it as a fabulous read.I started out devouring the first half of the book. Gradually I found myself skimming, then finally skipping to the second half which was far more relevant to my life. The first half of the book focuses on electronic toys which seem to be imbued with personalities of their own such as Tamagotchi, Furby, My Real Baby, etc. This was a trend which completely passed me by; I was too old for these toys when they came out and would never consider buying them for my children simply because I have this weird policy of not buying them any electronic toys (whole other story which I won't go into here). The question of how it affects us and our view of relationships when toys give the illusion of having personalities and feelings can be fascinating. Unfortunately, though, the book got bogged down in endless examples of kids with their furbies and Tamagotchies which was ultimately highly repetitive. All of these kids were basically saying the same things: sometimes I feel like my toy is alive, sometimes I remember that it isn't, sometimes I feel overly responsible for my toy, sometimes I'm cruel to my toy, and variations thereof. In this chapter, we heard several kids say this about their furbies. And then, in the next chapter, we heard several kids say all the same things about My Real Baby. It got old, and I was feeling beaten over the head about a topic which was completely irrelevant to me in any case.So I skipped to the second half, which suffered many of the same flaws but at least covered ground that was more personally relevant to me. Online relationships, social networking, confessional sites, etc. The author talked about the attraction of attachment without commitment, the illusion of intimacy provided by these relationships when in fact, you don't actually know these people and won't truly be there for each other in a real-life crisis, how texting and facebook updates are replacing face-to-face contact (although this was questionable considering that much of the described texting was about making appointments to get together) and certainly phone calls, woe is me, woe is me. It was interesting to read Turkle's points, even if they were a bit belabored, and to contemplate whether or not they held true for me and for people I know. I reacted a bit when she wrote about today's teenagers having grown up with parents texting while they pushed them on the swings; my oldest children are sixteen and fourteen and texting certainly wasn't around when they were kids so I don't know which teenagers she means. It's the teenagers of tomorrow who we have to be concerned about, I think. It's a picky thing, but it seemed to me as if Turkle's zeal to predict doom was getting her ahead of herself.In truth, I'm as concerned about the effects of our digital world as anyone else. It was strange to me even several years back to see a family eating out in a restaurant with a child playing on his gameboy throughout the meal, although I wouldn't jump to conclusions because for all I know the child may have had some issue and this could have been the only way the family could eat in peace. So I do like the topic, and many of Turkle's ideas resonated with me at least as open questions if not clear conclusions. I just wish the book had been better."
9,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2143439-jocelyn,1,"Every time I read one of these books, I am amazed by how utterly they manage to miss the mark, and by how the author manages to track down the 8 people who are still playing Second Life."
10,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2213047-e-marvin,0,"Recently, I read an article by Jonah Lehrer. He started this article by warmly responding to a negative book review which he received. Lehrer’s smart reply gave me some ideas about reviewing other’s work. In fact, after reading his reply, I have some misgivings about reviewing a person’s work negatively. Constructively critiquing each other’s work is something I think we are still working on in social media. But how is that done? How do I warmly critique someone’s work? Yet, before I start my review, I also think that we appraise the work which speaks to us. And, in the most profound ways, this book, Alone Together, speaks to me. This is why I spend an hour in late May to record my thoughts on a book published nearly two years ago. With that said, I am not an adherent to Sherry Turkle’s perspectives advanced in Alone Together Alone. Turkle’s ideas seem to advance a type of mechanical determinism. In particular, she contends that social media is metering out a type of group think fostered by the new media culture and its devices. In some ways, it seems that there are two types of thinking in our new social media age. I think many of social media’s thought leaders are too uncritical of social media. Yet, I will tackle the “a critical” tone of social media at another time. Today, with my comments on Turkle’s work, I am not concerned about an uncomplicated understanding of social life. Her ideas are appropriately complex. Yet, at important times, Turkle seems too much of a psychoanalyst. That is, her theoretical framework of dysfunction seems to be the only lens through which she views the culture which has developed around social media. And, in this way, I wonder the extent to which the Academy can speak to issues in social media if their frameworks are strictly orthodox. This may be the case with Turkle. Her analysis is too deeply seeped in one framework to tell the full story about social media and its current impact on society. First, I understand that I am coming late to this party. Turkle’s work has been out since the beginning of 2011. However, social media has had growing traction in this time. My reading of Turkle seems to have changed somewhat given the time since it has been release. In particular, I have noticed how Turkle seems to have one response to the growing reach of social media- a negative one. To a degree, I understand this. She highlights how both teenagers and parents are distracted by their mobile devices. And, I believe there are concerns about the ways mobile technology and social media platforms are influencing the process of thinking. Turkle, especially on the second reading, lays-out what seems to be a relatively uncomplicated understanding of technology. I know this seems somewhat strange given that Turkle has been studying the influence of technology for nearly 30 years. And there are caveats- Turkle never outwardly frames her arguments so straightforwardly. Yet, on reflection, I wonder about the academic’s role in social media. In particular, I wonder if someone like Turkle can fully tackle social media. More completely, Turkle’s theoretical framework of psychoanalysis may be too pronounced. I wonder if it can bring practically insightful understandings to social media. Going even further, I am not convinced that Turkle’s theoretical framework is sufficiently complex to understand social media because the framework itself often provides much the analysis rather than the data. For example, in the introduction, Turkle outlines the “robotic moment” in ways that are too Freudian for me. In fact, I found the introduction, which lays the structure for the book, is too “tethered” to notions of dysfunction to provide a relatively objective perspective. I found the examples provided somewhat bombastic. From the turtles in the American Museum of Natural History to focusing on an arcane figure like David Levy, it was all too unbelievable. Social Media’s Thought Leaders: Reflections on Sherry’s Turkle’s Alone TogetherThis is not to say that Turkle has not made a number of salient points. She consistently points out that there is a tendency for many of us to prefer the “technological” experience to an authentic one. I tend to fully agree with her in this case. Turkle is right. There is a type of simulacrum that permeates some aspects of social media. However, in many parts of this book, I think Turkle could have employed a more fully complex theoretical context to the problem. I think using other frameworks may have been helpful. For example, Jean Baudrillard way of understanding of integration of symbols, relationships, and society could have been an illuminating use of theory. In particular, Baudrillard outlines four distinct semiotic stages of simulacra and simulation. The integration of theoretical frameworks may more fully reflect the ways in which social life is enacted in the world of social media. This brings me to our last point: the role of the academic in the growing field of social media. I am not fully sure I know how to answer this question. Yet, if the academic brings her epistemological frameworks to bear, it may not be completely helpful to the academic or the field. First, I think it is not helpful to the field of social media because the theories are too rigid. There is often too little room for nuanced arguments. However, in enacted life, nuance is the rule not the exception. Additionally, academics are commissioned to study social life. However, in doing so, they may unconsciously employ understandings of social life which to too bound to a philosophical position that does not describe the problem at hand."
11,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/819802-lisa,3,"First, I can't escape the irony of writing a review of this book for a social media website. I hope that the author can appreciate that! Like many other reviewers, I really wanted to like this book. The first half of the book deals with human-robot interactions including research conducted by Turkle and her colleagues. She does a great job of describing the results for a popular audience. The second half of the book pertains to every mode of on-line communication: gaming, chat rooms, IM, social media, video conferencing, etc. Turkle's training as a psychotherapist infuses her interpretations of the research. After reading the first half of the book, I felt she had a very dystopian view of modern technology, and I had a hard time motivating myself to finish the book. However, my curiosity motivated me to continue, and I'm glad I did. Turkle raises some interesting questions, especially regarding adolescent development and how relationships are maintained in modern times. I would have liked for her to go further with her analysis and postulate some new theories based on her findings, but she did not. This book makes us stop and think critically about our embrace of technology, and that's a good thing."

13,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4811508-paula,1,It is books like this that give social science a bad name.
14,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223580-chris-witt,2,"I've struggled with how to review this, but here goes a half-assed attempt...""Alone Together"" is broken down into two parts. The first part deals with robotics. And it was awful. Everything reeks of a psychologist who has found exactly what she set out to find. For example, it felt like she wanted to show that children are unable to tell the difference between human beings and electronic toys. So she interviews, say, 100 of them. And if she finds one of them that confirms her theory, she devotes a chapter to talking about how disconnected today's children are.I don't know that I'm right about this, of course. I'm just saying that it really felt like her stories were way too fantastic to be the norm. I don't think she fabricated those stories. I just think that things feel a little cherry-picked.The second part of the book, however, was a bit more interesting. She deals with how human beings communicate in the modern world. Text, IM, Facebook, etc. I'd probably give 1 star to the first half of the book and 3 to the second.Something else that bothered me about the book was this subtitle - ""Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other"". For the last 100 or so pages I was reading the book, I kept asking myself about it. ""Okay, why do we expect more from technology and less from each other?"" For that matter, ""Do we expect more from technology and less from each other?""I came away unconvinced.The problem here is that things do change. As we get older, it's (I think) natural for people to start getting nostalgic about the ""good old days"" and seniors always seem to think that the world is going to hell. But I think they forget that the generation before them felt the same way. As did the generation before them. And so forth.I'm not going to lie. I am a bit of a Luddite at times. I only recently got a smart phone. And I'm a 37-year old who has worked in IT for 12 years now. I guess I'm contrary, or something.I do see the amazing advances being made in technology and often think ""ya, but how is this affecting the way human beings interact with each other?"" I sit on a train platform most days and marvel at how many faces are buried in smart phones instead of actually communicating with others.That stranger over there is wearing a Chicago Bears jacket. You're a Bears' fan and there was a big game yesterday afternoon. Why not ask them if they watched the game - see what they thought. Allow them to vent about a bad play or maybe reflect on the big win and bring a smile to somebody's day.Nah... I'll just go back to checking my e-mail on my Blackberry...To go back to an earlier mention, although I felt like she might have been cherry-picking examples for the purpose of writing a harder-hitting book, there are still some things that will stick with me awhile. For example, the number of children who seemed disappointed at having parents who were not present in the moment with them. Instead of sitting down to dinner together or talking on the drive home from school or helping them out with a toy they are trying to figure out, their parents are off to the side with their faces turned towards the glow of some electronic device.At its best, the book offers some good conversation starters. And maybe a chance for self-reflection. Something that our modern, post-wired world doesn't always afford."
15,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15857225-ivan,4,"Since I previously enjoyed Turkle’s ‘Reclaiming Conversation,’ I decided it was time to read her oft-cited book ‘Alone Together.’ As Turkle summarizes, “The narrative of ‘Alone Together’ describes an arc: we expect more from technology and less from each other.” It’s sort of a depressing book, and even more so when you realize how much has changed in nearly a decade since she wrote it. The issues she raises and the explosion of platforms and technology have more, not less, of a pressing issue. Here are a few quotes that stood out to me:“Technology is seductive when what it offers meets our human vulnerabilities. And as it turns out, we are very vulnerable indeed. We are lonely but fearful of intimacy. Digital connections and the sociable robot may offer the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. Our networked life allows us to hide from each other, even as we are tethered to each other. We’d rather text than talk.’“People are lonely. The network is seductive. But if we are always on, we may deny ourselves the rewards of solitude.”“Winston Churchill said, ‘We shape our buildings and then they shape us.’ We make our technologies, and they, in turn, shape us. So, of every technology we must ask, Does it serve our human purposes?—a question that causes us to reconsider what these purposes are. Technologies, in every generation, present opportunities to reflect on our values and direction.”“Today, our machine dream is to be never alone but always in control. This can’t happen when one is face-to-face with a person.”“Communities are constituted by physical proximity, shared concerns, real consequences, and common responsibilities. Its members help each other in the most practical ways. On the lower east side of Manhattan, my great grandparents belonged to a block association rife with deep antagonisms. I grew up hearing stories about those times. There was envy, concern that one family was doing better than another; there was suspicion, fear that one family was stealing from another. And yet these families took care of each other, helping each other when money was tight, when there was illness, when someone died. If one family was evicted, it boarded with a neighboring one. They buried each other. What do we owe to each other in simulation?”“We have to love our technology enough to describe it accurately. And we have to love ourselves enough to confront technology’s true effects on us. These amended narratives are a kind of realtechnik. The realtechnik of connectivity culture is about possibilities and fulfillment, but it also about the problems and dislocations of the tethered self. Technology helps us manage life stresses but generates anxieties of its own. The two are often closely linked.”“We became tethered to the network, we really didn’t need to keep computers busy. They keep us busy. It is as though we have become their killer app. As a friend of mine put it in a moment of pique, ‘We don’t do our e-mail; our e-mail does us.’ We talk about ‘spending’ hours on e-mail, but we, too, are being spent.”"

Humane, filled with common-sense, and refreshing.The writing is not graceful—it's a bit wordy, repetitive, occasionally ponderous. It's not as well-organized or tight as it could be, either—somewhat redundant in ideas as well as words. But these are minor quibbles compared to how well this book does on the two critical aspects of nonfiction: the importance of the topic, and the arguments and insights it offers. In these, it shines.The two main sections of Alone Together consider our engagements with first, robots and robotic toys; next, social networks. Her argument can be summed up with this quote from the introduction: ""we seem determined to give human qualities to objects and content to treat each other as things."" (p. xiv)As a researcher of long standing at MIT, Turkle has far more access to robots than I do; so for me, the first section read more as a warning about what's coming, while I had no trouble relating whole-heartedly to the lamentations of the second. Still, after decades of watching actors play androids, speaking lines written by screenwriters rather than assembled by programmers, it's useful to be reminded that, inside the hardware embodying Kismet, Cog, Paro, Furby, or your Tamagotchi, nobody's home. You've been studied, and responses that elicit an emotional response from you have been programmed; that's all. What robots offer is is mimicry, not understanding. That we're so easy to fool speaks volumes about our willingness to be fooled. Are we really so lonely?Evidently, to go by the social networking discussions. Boy, am I glad that my adolescence encompassed merely LSD and assassinations, and my heart was free to break without the ceaseless need to groom my Facebook profile, or respond to text messages within ten minutes no matter what. Not a new thought, but I had no idea how extreme matters have become. I realize lots of people get good at Guitar Hero because it's easier than learning to play the guitar, but I’d never reflected on how hollow it must feel to be robbed of real accomplishments in so many spheres of your life at once. And I thought I knew about Second Life—ha! I'm haunted by the guy who tells Turkle, while watching his kids at the playground, that he starts his day by engaging his avatar in interactive sex animations with the avatar of a person he's never met, and probably never will. And that this enables him to stay in his marriage. Bleak. So bleak. I could go on—the book's stuffed with fascinating vignettes, well chosen and sharply drawn, to advance her argument— but you get the idea. Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should. But try telling that to enthusiastic, myopic, greedy, lonely, vulnerable us."
17,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84779-jane,4,"I've been feeling a becoming-less-vague dislike of social media and portable connectivity for a while now, but had chalked those up to Luddite impulses that I should get over. This book has made me reevaluate whether those feelings are actually good. Things like my partner being on his phone constantly during meals (I feel lonely), browsing aimlessly through Facebook and feeling more and more insecure about the image I get of other people's lives compared to my own, and wishing I kept in touch with more people by phone and letters. These are all normal results of having the illusion of closer connections to people, when really they are elsewhere or only sharing an inauthentic version of themselves to the masses, rather than just me. It makes me want to quit FB. I'm not going to do that (curiosity about people who are only there in my life), but I've started only logging on to check notifications and then getting out. I think it's better for my brain. I've never got into Twitter and couldn't come up with a really good justification for why not; I'm just not interested. Now I realize that it's because while it would connect me to a lot of people, those would all be superficial connections to people who didn't actually care about me, might not be there tomorrow, and of whom I couldn't expect a whole lot. I don't want 1000 followers; I want 10 friends that I talk to and see regularly.This book also made me think a lot about parenting, and how I hope my kid(s) don't grow up with the assumption that they have no privacy and no space to themselves without other people expecting them to respond. Good lord; ten years ago I could spend a whole day out and about and only have pay phones to use! I don't want to be always on, always available. I don't want to be the parent that bans cell phones, and I also don't want to spend their adolescence constantly arguing about how I resist things that everyone else already does. It's too much for one person to fight. Step one, though, I'm getting from Turkle, would be to put away *my* phone and computer, and just pay attention to them. Duh. They'll learn manners by watching me. (Duh!)"
18,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/361160-elizabeth,3,"3.5/5This was a fascinating collection of ideas presented by one of the foremost experts on technology and its effects on human behavior... I will be thinking about it for a long, long time. I think it's important for individuals, families, and classrooms to really consider how best to incorporate the ""always on"" culture without losing what she calls sacred spaces, and the human values that we want to preserve. However. The first part of the book was very Furby-anecdote heavy. I know she has been at this research for decades and wanted to provide some context, and I get that social robots are part of this brave new technological world we will live in, but... I wanted to cry Furby Uncle there for a while. I was also very interested in her methodology, her research questions and procedures, etc. and those never fully were explained which gave this book a very anecdotal feel that was not as satisfying as I had hoped. I had the sense that she was mostly sharing the experiences of wealthy, white private school students (this may or may not be true, but it's really hard to tell either way) and I wondered if her research had been conducted throughout the U.S. in more than one kind of community or if the social media usage/attitudes featured are just standard for teenagers now no matter the geographic location. While I did find some observations in Part II about how smartphones have begun to change behaviors/motivations, I was most interested in the conclusion and epilogue—I feel that's where the most important and interesting points of discussion ended up, and I wanted more of that. It's still worth reading (especially for educators and parents) and essential for discussion, because the technological world will continue to change in ways we can't even imagine--better to be aware and involved than to be a pawn in those outcomes. "
19,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia,2,"The concept for the story outweighed the excitement for reading it. In the vein of others that discuss how technology has pulled humans farther apart, Turkle, wants to add to that and heavily, heavily focuses on robots and their work now in companionship and love. She references studies and conversations with others scientists in the field and at conferences but it seems to go around in circles discussing the same thing over and over without really digging in. It seemed surface and cyclical. Related, there weren't as many nuggets as Reclaiming Conversation to sit and think about though certainly there were a few evocative statements. Ultimately, I expected more and my expectations didn't match the information shared in the book, but that's not to say I'm not going to keep reading Turkle's others since Reclaiming Conversation was life-changing for me. "
20,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3014030-vivian,1,"I admit, I gave up on this book after about 100 pages. For those of us over 40 (45?), this book sometimes seems like an academic rant against all the technology that connects us, while keeping us separate. While I agree with some of the concepts outlined in this book, I felt that the author was constantly looking for research (or conducting her own) to support her own preconceived ideas. I had been looking forward to a somewhat original take on technology and society, but the beginning of the book was a rehash of old, tired opinions. A disappointment. "
21,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"The best things about the book are the titles of its two sections: 1) In Solitude, New Intimacies 2) In Intimacy, New Solitudes. The first section deals with how we perceive and interact with robots and how this may develop in the future. The second section deals with how our networked lives that are supposed to keep us more connected may be going the other way. Turkle has done most of his research on teenagers. Call me old, but I didn't like reading chapter after chapter about teenagers who send hundreds of texts a day and live their entire lives on Facebook. "
22,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10280795-julia,3,"Like my friend Jonathan McKay said, read the last chapter because it has some great quotes, and skip the first half of the book. I liked the repeated anecdotes about how technology influences our lives, so three stars instead of two. But the academic prose made me constantly feel like the author was lecturing me, like she thought she was better than me. And it made me feel not so smart. I didn’t appreciate that."
23,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,0,"Any theory predicated on ""hookup culture"" is bound to be full of stupidity. A theory which says all teens eschew sentimentality, and deep emotions, but also that they all adore ""Twilight""'s angsty schmaltz and tortuous love is, you know, not a good or useful theory."
24,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"I found 'Alone Together' hugely thought-provoking. The methods used are anthropological and grounded in the ideas of psychoanalysis, which made for an interesting change. The specific points within each theme are introduced and explained through case studies. Such an approach differs from the kind of social science I am used to, which I found powerful as Turkle’s methods displayed no cross-contamination from economics. Most quantitative and some qualitative work regurgitates the assumptions of economics in a manner I find hugely frustrating. On the other hand, it is difficult to generalise from a small sample, or indeed generalise very far at all when you’re dealing with matters of psychology. Nonetheless, it is important to study how rapid changes in technology impact upon people. Turkle’s book is fascinating as a starting point. As I read it I could not help but evaluate the roles of the internet and mobile phones in my life and contemplate how I could establish different boundaries with them.The book begins with children and their interaction with robotic toys. I am of the generation that first experienced such things; I had an off-brand tamagotchi as a tweenager but never wanted a furby. Those weird chattery things have always freaked me out. Turkle expounds on how very young children interact with these toys, at an age when they are still finding out how to categorise objects. To me it seems odd to contemplate that children try to understand whether a furby is alive like an animal, whether it has feelings, whether it can die. That was strange, but the section about elderly people interacting with robotic baby dolls and Paro the robot seal was heart-breaking. In particular, the insight that the elderly people studied got much more from interactions with the researchers than the robots. The robots were better company than no-one, but not a substitute for real people. Turkle also confronts the social assumption that robots are needed to look after the elderly because young people cannot, for some reason. The latter part of the book covers changes of communication patterns amongst (presumably American) teenagers and working age people. I found this eye-opening; how can anyone send hundreds of texts a day?! It takes a fairly negative approach to the always-connected ethic of smartphones, which I certainly agree with. I don’t have a smartphone because I don’t like them. It seems a little baffling to me that so many people keep them despite finding the attendant anxiety and obsessive behaviour upsetting. Then again, smartphones didn’t exist when I was teenager, although mobile phones did. Growing up with the assumption of constant connection by social networking and texting must be intensely stressful. Despite it being based in specific cases, I found Turkle’s argument for the negative side effects of recently-adopted technologies convincing. It certainly made a pleasant change from the constant barrage of phone advertising. Why should it be strange to not want a smartphone? Constant connection to the internet is neither necessary nor desirable for every single person.That said, I wonder to what extent I was convinced by the book because it espoused views that I already held. I am somewhat wary of psychoanalytical theory, as my efforts to gain a basic understanding of it have left me dubious. I would have also liked the book to contain more evidence on the actual uptake of technologies and how it breaks down demographically, even if only for America. How does internet/smartphone use vary along gender, wealth, and age lines? A few numbers here and there would have been nice. Moreover, the massive American bias of the whole thing is not actually mentioned. Although similar trends can be observed in other rich developed nations, most likely, the cultural and demographic contexts will definitely differ. Which will change the impacts of technology, in no doubt very interesting ways.The book also raises, without delving into, the huge and difficult question of capitalism and authenticity. In the twenty-first century of multinational company-controlled neoliberal capitalism, what is authentic experience? Are texts and emails less authentic forms of communication than letters and face-to-face conversations? If going out to a concert, film, or meal is punctuated by texting, tweeting, and posting photos online, do these attempts to capture the authenticity of the moment diminish it? I was at the cinema a few days ago and noticed at the edge of my vision a blue glow - someone was checking their phone in the middle of an exciting action film. Just the awareness that someone was doing that distracted me from the film. When considering these massive, abstract questions about everyday material experience, it is always tempting to resort to anecdote, so I can sympathise with Turkle. That said, it is not the case that people are freely adopting fancy new phones, tablets, etc in a neutral environment. These are extremely profitable products, pushed relentlessly upon us by massive companies using sophisticated marketing techniques. As well as the unintended effects, it is worth considering the history behind this rapid technological upheaval and this is definitely something I’d like to read more about. As for authenticity, I once read a book that tried to define it (Authenticity: Brands, Fakes, Spin And The Lust For Real Life), without making much headway. It is one of those things that can scarcely be put into words, yet you know it when you feel it. The main difficulty is that everyone surely experiences it differently. Then, when different people label an experience authentic or otherwise, the disagreement often takes an exclusionary tone of snobbery or trendiness. It is also a snake that eats its own tail, as authenticity seems only available at incredibly high cost or for no money at all. What was once seen as new, original, and innovative is rapidly co-opted for profit and becomes mainstream, thus somehow its authenticity is degraded. Authenticity has itself become a commodity, likely by changing what the words means to people. Which is practically impossible to pin down, making this tangent rather futile. (Although it did remind me to think further about whether irony and authenticity are mutually exclusive.)On a more pragmatic note, Turkle concludes with a set of personal anecdotes from which I inferred the need to find your comfort level with technology and re-negotiate a compact with it. She could perhaps have made this clearer, although doing so would not necessarily fit with the ethos of the book. Anthropological case study-based methods do not lend themselves to generalisable policy proscriptions. During and after reading this book, though, I contemplated how I use my laptop, my phone, and social media and decided to make some tweaks. I was also reminded of the very frustrating inconsistency of my concentration levels. When reading a book, I can easily concentrate without interruption for three or four hours, basically until I get too hungry. I can’t work for anywhere near that long on an internet-connected computer without being distracted. My PhD work is all being done on a laptop, which is a total procrastination machine. If I can read a book for so long, why is my concentration so pathetically poor with the internet just a click away? I would love to disconnect the wireless but cannot when so many of my research materials are online. It’s maddening. I love the internet, but do not feel adequately in control of my use of it. This worries me. I imagine I’m not the only one. "
25,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4591728-dwight-davis,2,"I’m conflicted on how to fairly review this book. It’s well-researched but poorly presented. Turkle is an expert in her field. But there are some glaring errors for me in this. A few observations. 1. Any book writing about technology is necessarily already out of date by the time it is published, and this book was published in 2011. Turkle spends a lot of time talking about MySpace and Furbies which, as far as I know, had both passed largely out of public consciousness by 2011. There is no discussion of Twitter, which was most definitely a big deal in 2011 and has only grown in influence since, so it’s odd to see a book on how online tools are making relationships harder that doesn’t engage with Twitter at all. And this book, only 7 years old at this point, already feels like an antique. Second Life and MySpace and AOL Instant Messenger make many appearances, all are completely irrelevant in 2018. This makes it overwhelmingly difficult to take this work seriously today. 2. Some of this feels alarmist from someone who didn’t grow up in a digitally connected world. The data also feels skewed to demonstrate Turkle’s point. There are almost no anecdotes about how online culture and texting has positively built community, helped overcome issues of anxiety and depression and mental illness, or alleviated loneliness. Turkle only identifies folks who feel disconnected and anxious because of texting and social media. This feels disingenuous to me. 3. There’s literally not a single piece of hard data that I can remember being presented in this book. It’s entirely anecdotal as far as I can recall. 4. There’s certainly a case to be made that social media and texting have stunted our growth as social people. But this book does not compellingly make that argument. Much of it felt alarmist. Little of it felt balanced. 5. Turkle does not argue that we need to technologically regress. That feels important to point out. Just that we need to learn how to appropriately use tech. Which...feels like a bad youth group sermon moral to me. 6. The beginning of the book largely focuses on robots. And I got excited because Turkle sort of gestured towards questions of ontology and personhood and how robots complicate our notions of those things. But instead of actually addressing that central question, one she herself raised in the introduction, she instead pursues the simpler question of “Are robots good for us, especially caretaker robots for the elderly and young?” Turns out she thinks they aren’t. Because they aren’t people. I guess. I don’t know. This part was just mostly bad to me. 7. The subtitle of this book leads one to believe that Turkle is trying to answer a question about why we have come to expect more from our technological relationships than our in real life ones. This is literally never addressed. Not once. She asserts that we do (an assertion that isn’t backed up) but she doesn’t talk about why we do. Broken promises all over the place in this work. I don’t think this book carefully engages the deep issues of communal life in a digital age. It prefers to approach things from one view, simplistically: tech makes it harder to connect in real life. There is no nuance, no explorations of support groups online, no anecdotes about the positive impact of life online. It’s entirely unconvincing to present only one side of an argument, especially when it’s largely based on appeals to emotion from a select group of interviewees who back up the central thesis of Turkle’s work."
26,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31260727-josiah,5,"Most technology books tend to focus on how it negatively affects our mind and impairs our thinking. However, given her unique background as a trained psychologist and professor at MIT, Turkle brings a very unique perspective into discussions about technology.The book is basically divided into two main parts, both centered on different ways that we seek community through technology: one half of the book focusing on human-robot interactions, and the other half on human-human interactions mediated through technology.The first half of the book was surprisingly disturbing and creepy. The conversations Turkle describes with people who would be willing to ditch human companions for robotic ones are mind-chilling, especially as it becomes clear that we're quickly moving to that sort of technology--and--in some cases--the technology is already here. We already have robots that people form ""emotional attachments"" to. We already have social robots, robotic dogs, and robots that can take partial-care of the elderly. The most unnerving part? The fact that, over time, nearly all of the people that Turkle worked with in her experiments would eventually form emotional attachments with their social robots and begin to view them as ""alive."" These types of robots may be few at the present; but the questions Turkle raises in this section are undoubtedly going to become the sorts of ethical questions we'll need to make in the near-future.The second half of the book was more applicable than the first to the present-day, as Turkle looks at social interactions online. To her credit, Turkle does not gravitate to extremes, and praises many of the capabilities of these new technologies. But she also raises serious questions about these technologies, and convincingly shows that pretty much all digital technologies push us toward only presenting a cleaned-up, perfect, or even completely different image of ourselves than we are in real life. Both parts together offer a critical insight: We want to be in community with other people--but we want to avoid all those messy interactions that tend to happen in real-life. Digital technologies now give us the opportunity to feel connected in a community--whether it be with social robots that will never disappoint us, or with social networks that edit out the messiness of actual communities in real-life. Digital life is easy; and by retreating to it, we tune out the complexities of real-life.All this leads to a question: What do we do next? Assuming that neither an abandonment of real-life to a cleaned-up digital world nor a complete abandonment of the digital world are options, we have the difficulty of navigating a middle path. Turkle's book mostly raises these questions, and doesn't spend a lot of time answering them. As people living in a more and more digital world, this then becomes mandatory for us to consider. How much will we sacrifice the difficulties of the real-world in exchange for the ease of the digital? How do we balance the necessity of interacting with the digital world with its downsides? I'm not sure of all the answers. But one thing is clear in this book: these are questions that need to be asked; and how we answer these questions will dramatically shape our lives.Rating: 4.5-5 Stars (Extremely Good)"
27,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611813-melinda,5,"A very worthwhile book to read. Having been part of the world of artificial intelligence and robotics in years past, this book is a fine overview of the development of the first ""thinking"" machines (like ELIZA) to the current trend of robots that ""feel"" or relate. Or at least we have programmed them to simulate responses that to us indicate ""feeling"". In the first half of the book, the author raises the dilemma -- we are beginning to rely on relational robots or care-taker robots more than humans. In Japan with the younger population significantly fewer in numbers than the elderly, certain therapeutic robots were developed to purposely give the elderly someone (or some thing) to relate to. Look up AIBO, Cog and Kismet, My Real Babies, Furbies, Milo (virtual human), Nursebots, Paro, Tamagotchis and you will find a mixture of toys and relational robots.So what does it mean for us to relate and rely on programmed machines? It seems simple enough, but in creating relational robots we now have given them programmed behaviors that imitate human emotions. The emotions are not real however, they are programmed. Paro, the therapeutic robot that is in the form of a baby harp seal, is programmed to emit soothing noises when the person holding Paro pets it softly and gently. Many elderly patients project onto Paro emotions that the robot really does not have. The author raises this issue and asks, ""is this dangerous?"", and then shows us why it is.The second half of her book deals more with the interconnected world of Facebook, Twitter, the internet, and virtual lives lived online. So what does it mean when real humans who have real human relationships in a real world prefer to spend their time (dare we call it ""living""?) in an online simulated world? In that online simulated world you can relate to various other people, all with their own avatars and hiding who they really are. So what becomes real? The author here raises this issue and asks ""is this how we want to grow and develop as humans?"" and then shows us the consequences of living in this way.*************************As a followup to this, here is an interesting article, ""Baby Robot Unveiled in Japan as number of Childless Couples Grows""https://www.theguardian.com/technolog...

28,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/467338-dan,1,"This one falls into the same trap as ""God Is Not Great"" by Christopher Hitchens: while I agree with the subject matter very much, after awhile I grew somewhat bored by it for that very reason. In this case, more so. Turkle's approach is very dry and academic. She is an instructor at MIT and it reads as such. The book is very easily broken down into introduction (explaining what she is going to cover), the two main sections (one on robots, one on social media and online/electronic interactions) and then a conclusion (what did we learn?). She even made a point to devote equal space to each subject, as the second part begins at exactly the half-way mark in the book! In the interest of full disclosure, I went into this looking to read more on her thoughts on social media, after hearing her discuss it on The Colbert Report. Unfortunately, I would have to get through her section on robots, and as she started researching this back in the mid-nineties, it starts with Tamagotchis and Furbies, which hardly seems relevant at all now. She also touched on some of the first video games in the late 70's/early 80's, and supposes that children, when confronted with a machine that can play against it, wonder if the machine is thinking. She says that the games made the children into philosophers, in the way they question a machine's motives. That phrase, which she used a few times, just rang so utterly false and pretentious to me. As a child who grew up at just that time, I never once pondered if my NES or Atari was, in fact, learning to beat me or adapting. I was well aware it was a program. I never once projected any sort of human personality characteristics onto it. After that, I skimmed through the robot section fairly quickly, trying to get to what I came for. As I said, I agreed with her thoughts on interactions through texts, tweets, Facebook, and the like, but it just came off like someone lecturing to me about it, and bemoaning the loss of actual communication. I had really hoped, from hearing her speak, that her approach to this subject would be different than much of what is out there. Sadly, that was not the case."
29,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073273-roy-klein,2,"I've done the opposite to what most people confessed to do - I read the robots part rather than the social networks part. I tried reading the social networks part, but by the time I got there I grew extremely tired of the constant in-depth descriptions of her tests subjects. Obviously Turkle grew very attached to some of them, and spares us no detail in describing their every muse and emotion. I'd say that what I've read comprises of about 70% of that. 25% more is spent on rehashing her opinion on the alienating nature of robotics and net life, and the remains are spent on actual insights. Brilliant and thought provoking though they may be, I grew so very tired of digging them out and gave up.I understand that Turkle is dealing with cutting edge anthropological phenomena and has nothing to put forth but anecdotal evidence, but so much of that evidence represents what I'd say are extreme cases. Every once in a while I'd run into a description of a person's behavior that I'd say ""oh, I could relate to that"", but most of the time I'd think ""she must've dug deep to find these weirdos"". These examples, like the girl who would rather text her friend in the next room rather than talk to her, diminish Turkle's point significantly, and make her insights much harder to swallow. I do agree with the premise of the book and believe the phenomena presented are worthy of our attention and consideration, but they are wrapped in tedious, unstructured and repetitive writing that is simply too big a pill to swallow."
30,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/161266-gabe,1,"For someone who feels technology can't provide the authenticity and depth of real life, it's ironic how shallow this book is. It feels like a printed out Google search. Full of anecdotes and assumptions with no data or proof to support her conclusions.I'll give it two stars purely because it does bring up interesting questions and some of the anecdotes are worthwhile. But the biggest question that it brings up is: Why would this author work at MIT and give her child so many robots and electronic toys if she hates technology so much?"

33,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/881752-heather,5,"Alone Together: Why we expect more from technology and less from each other is not a book about technology. It is a book about people and how they interact with technology. Technology obsession or addiction is a symptom to a larger problem. Sherry Turkle is a MIT professor of social science and the science of technology as well as a licensed psychologist. She began studying people’s relationship to technology in the days before the personal computer was a household item. This book is the third in a trilogy about her work over the years of the personal computing movement. However, this book can stand alone as an assessment of what our love affair with our smartphones and obsession with artificial intelligences says about us.Most lay-level philosophy of technology books are either so melancholy that we might as well be living in a post-apocalyptic technocratic society where all we can do is lament the bygone days when we were in a technological infancy. Other technology books are so optimistic that you get the uncomfortable sense that the author broke into songs of praise while writing about how technology will save us from our ills. Alone Together is neither doom-and-gloom nor overly optimistic about technology. When the book does take a melancholy tone, it is not because technology wreaks havoc on our society, but because of the needs that people are trying to meet using technology. It is not so much that technology is the bad guy. Indeed, she argues that robots are not sentient beings. I take that to mean that they, or our smartphones, cannot be morally culpable for how we, as a society, use them. Many people talk about addiction to technology as though it was a drug, but Turkle points out that technology is the mechanism by which people satisfy something else:“Sometimes people try to make life with others resemble simulation. They try to heighten real-life drama or control those around them. It would be fair to say that such efforts do not often end well. Then, in failure, many are tempted to return to what they do well: living their lives on the screen. If there is an addiction here, it is not to technology. It is to the habits of mind that technology allows us to practice.” (288)Those habits of the mind, incidentally, are entrenched through the use of technology. They come from relationships you can control and interactions that are completely mediated. They come from constant stimulation through everything from getting “likes” on Facebooks (a type of recognition and approval) to video games (adrenaline rush) to online erotica to feeling important and productive by multitasking. Key ThemesIt is difficult to summarize Alone Together because Turkle walks the reader through countless studies and interviews. But if there is one narrative strand throughout the work, it is the tension between fear of loneliness and fear of intimacy.Part One is entitled “The Robotic Movement: In Solitude, New Intimacies.” This section looks at how people respond to artificial intelligence, or robots that are meant to mimic human mannerisms. These robots are designed to give the sense that they are responding to the human who is interacting with it. Turkle provides high tech examples from MIT’s robotics labs as well as lower-tech examples from off-the-shelf robots such as Furbies and Tamagotchis for children. She provides examples from product testing of My Real Baby and Paro the seal as stand-in companions for the elderly. All of these robots, to an extent, give the impression that they are responding to the user’s care. Particularly in the studies with the elderly, they ostensibly provide a remedy for loneliness. However, in these examples lies another theme in her book: What starts as better than nothing becomes just better. For the elderly having a robot seal that “loves” them is better than nothing. But in her discussions with career adults, some would prefer a robot companion to a real human. Their reasons reveal more about the person than the technology. A robot will not hurt you and a robot will not get sick and die. The robot will always be there, but you also have the freedom to leave the robot at home and be your own person. It is both doing away with the fallenness of other human beings, while enabling self-centeredness and autonomy.Part one is aptly subtitled “in solitude, new intimacies” because despite how a robot may make the person feel, he or she is still alone in the room. The robot is a substitute that is good enough to satisfy a need for intimacy. “Good enough” in this case means not only that it is “real enough” but also that it does not have the baggage that comes with actual intimacy.Part Two is entitled “Networked: In Intimacy, New Solitudes.” Unlike artificial intelligence, which is still a futuristic prospect, living networked lives is a present reality. This section looks at the trends in smartphone usage, including the anxiety people feel when they are without their phone. Many people truly fear being “off the grid” (16). Their lives are lived partially in the physical world and partially online. Turkle recounts the “stress” many people, young and old, feel about creating their Facebook profile and maintaining their online interactions. For example, at the time this book was written, Facebook was the hottest social network. Students she interviewed would get nervous if it had been a day (or even a few hours, in some cases) since someone had commented on their wall. They want to appear popular and well-liked, so, in order to construct this identity, they will comment on other people’s wall in hopes that they will comment on theirs. Today this game is played on places like Twitter, where the aspiration is to increase the ratio of “followers”/ “following”. In other words, the goal is to have more people following you than you follow. One way to manipulate this ratio is to start by following everyone possible. Twitter etiquette is that if someone follows you, you follow them back. Once you have a large number of followers, you un-follow some to maintain the ratio. It is a game of identity craft where everyone wants to (appear to) be a celebrity.Turkle spends a chapter on communication. Many of the students she interviewed don’t like talking on the phone, but prefer texting or messaging because it gives them more control. In assessing some of her interviews, Turkle says that the phone is too much but “Texting offers just the right amount of access, just the right amount of control. She is a modern Goldilocks: for her, texting puts people not too close, not too far, but at just the right distance. The world is now full of modern Goldilockses, people who take comfort in being in touch with a lot of people whom they also keep at bay” (15). Turkle says that the machine dream to be never alone but always in control is impossible with face-to-face interactions, and difficult when talking on the phone. But is made possible through digital life (157).The concept of identity craft is not new. Charles Taylor wrote about this in Sources of Self (1992). Identity craft is a distinctly modern task that arises from several factors, including our lack of moral foundation and lack of common culture. Turkle points out that we are simply reworking our identities with the materials on hand (158). This explains the cell phone addiction studies which showed that really people were addicted to social networking sites, not to the cell phone, per se. This also explains the anxiety when a person, for whatever reason, is without their smartphone. They have become dependent upon constant connection, and in order to stay connected in what are often shallow, utilitarian relationships, many of them are distressed over maintaining their carefully crafted identity so that they will receive the affirmation they crave.ReflectionThere are many aspects in Alone Together that make me think of technology as the new religion or idol of our times. I had just finished reading a short academic piece by Sean Desmond Healy entitled Boredom, Self, and Culture which traces the emergence of hyperboredom as a prolific condition in our modern times. As in so many of these history-of-ideas pieces, Healy says that hyperboredom comes out of a sense of meaninglessness that emerged from the modern fragmentation of our common moral foundation. Technology serves as a kind of false-solution in that it provides as a diversion from hyperboredom and its twin, anxiety.In Alone Together, Turkle discusses people’s vulnerabilities. In a world of meaninglessness, people create their own meaning by consuming themselves with online identities, archiving their lives, creating robot companions, living in a fantasy game, etc. Photos, robots, and video games are problems in-and-of themselves, but when people seek them out in a kind of obsessive compulsive cycle of needing to check email or text alerts or Facebook in order to allay anxieties, technology becomes something far more than a tool. It becomes something around which we can all come together and orient our lives. It becomes our god.I appreciate that this book does not call for abandoning the smartphone or the internet, but for putting technology back in its place. Technology can be a good tool, but taken too far, it begins to control us rather than us controlling it. This comes out of what Turkle calls an over optimistic narrative about technology. In reality, technology is not the panacea for all of life’s ills, but one would think so given the way some technophiles talk. She calls for getting back to the virtues of solitude, deliberateness, and living fully in the moment. I would add the Aristotelean idea of temperance to that list. A key idea of Turkle’s based on this book and some interviews she had done since its publication is that of having sacred spaces, places where technology cannot enter, such as the dinner table or the carpool lane. One of Turkle’s experiences exemplifies the problem:“When I recently travelled to a memorial service for a close friend, the program, on heavy cream-colored card stock, listed the afternoon’s speakers, told who would play what music, and displayed photographs of my friend as a young woman and in her prime. Several around me used the program’s stiff, protective wings to hide their cell phones as they sent text messages during the service. One of the texting mourners, a woman in her late sixties, came over to chat with me after the service. Matter-of-factly, she offered, ‘I couldn’t stand to sit that long without getting on my phone.’ The point of the service was to take a moment. This woman had been schooled by a technology she’d had for less than a decade to find this close to impossible” (295).I agree with Turkle that we need to learn to have appropriate boundaries with our devices. I find it odd that the people at the funeral did not even consider the irony of their actions. A funeral is to remind us of our mortality and to live our lives. When all is said and done, do we really want to have spent eight hours per day staring into our phone rather than living life?"
34,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42188133-kim,5,"The title suggests, as the book presents, the real, and sinister reasons why “we expect more from technology and less from each other”, as the book is subtitled.Turkel breaks the book down into two parts: the introduction and conundrum of social robots, starting with ELIZA, Baby Alive® and then the 1990’s Furby craze. Here, children and the elderly are introduced to social robots to see how each will interact with the robot. The children are fascinated with the robots, but work through the differentiations of whether or not the robot is ‘alive’, to what degree (in comparison with themselves, in which the children do see a difference and a parallel), and crucially because the robot either responds to them or not, whether or not the robot likes them, and subsequently, whether or not a bond can be established. If the emotive component is not there, the robot is relegated to a thing; there is no cognitive reason to (try to) relate to it. This becomes clearer later in the book. With the elderly, it is a matter of recollection ‘re-living’ of times, and memories lost, and sometimes, underutilized. The robot – a Baby Alive®- reminds the elderly of what it is like to take care of a child, the memories surrounding doing so, and in the periphery, to be able to do something, rather than sit in a nursing home with those memories, if any. Here, robots introduce a quandary as is it better for a robot to fulfill some housekeeping/nursing home functions or will a human caretaker be better? I love Turkel’s tackling of that quandary. In the second part of the book, Networking, Turkel explores the social, professional and emotive impacts that the internet, particularly around our cellular phones, with the problem(s) of always being on call, or plugged in. The internet has grown by leaps and bounds, and therefore, allows us all, from children through adulthood to do so many things, simultaneously, that we could not otherwise, do before. A few examples follow: Convenience, for one. A lot can be done via computer and technology than we ever could do at one time. Just with our cell phones, we can make a call, e-mail, text, buy tickets and in general shop. Have a readily-available calculator, maps and store our photos, all on one device. The adrenaline rush - going into the online world allows us to try things, become thrill-seekers in ways that we would not consider, let alone dare in real life. We can explore, try things and possibly come to terms with our shortcomings, and resolve them, but only if we so choose. Anonymity – we can accomplish much without being tied to one location, as we are with our landline phones and desktop computers. Moreover, we can again, explore ourselves, and others, via avatars, fake name accounts, and “be” other people. The problem here is are you representing yourself, or what you want to be? Same is true for the others one interacts with! Finally, these pose ethical problems as to what is online being true or not. However, the thrust of the book and the sinister question, is with all the technology and what we can do with it, is are we aware and asking the questions of what are we losing in being immersed in this technology? Turkel does not advocate destroying, doing away with nor going cold turkey with the technology; just be(com)ing aware of what we do (still and potentially) give up in being so immersed in it. Do we remember, know and therefore, teach our children what it is like to be a human being? Is touch, social interaction, family and social time without it account for something? These are perquisites that we take for granted, but we don’t consider imagine what it is like to grow up without these. Turkel warns that we are going to begin to find out as the children of constantly-plugged in parents, will produce constantly-plugged in children, who have little or not context in having constant/regular human contact. Can a robot feel, and by what measure does it feel? What and how are we are to take these ‘feelings’ however measured as equivalents to our own? Do we even honestly and willingly recognize and deal with our own? Here, I love Turkel’s concern through Robert Caper: The transgression in that analytic enterprise is not that we try to make things better; the transgression is that we don’t allow ourselves to see its costs and limitations (page 283). This is where Turkel also assesses the social concerns of being replaced by robots, with the limited quandary (robot or nothing), question is tactfully resolved … and still worth considering, as the answer has implications toward our own social and emotional priorities.A crucially chilling feature that is just becoming realized via the recent Facebook® scandal, is our privacy online. Are we aware of what we give to companies like Facebook® and Google® and what is it used for? Once upon a time (even when we aren’t looking) anything one posted became the property of these sites, and they could do what they pleased with the information. Now, in light of data breaches and the implications of unwanted, but assumed surveillance, the issue is up in the air … for as long as the public feels it(still) is a critical problem. As Turkel notes, the terms of service change, but one still have to read them extensively and be(come) vigilant as to what is private (yours) and up for public domain, scrutiny and marketing purposes. A subset consideration with this issue is what is posted is until recently, not delete-able; what is posted on social media stays on social media. This is irreparably dangerous as once posted, the material with its implications cannot be retracted. There is also the implication of people (law enforcement – which does have its place- and employers) having access and authoritative (which is not always conclusive) judgment on what one sees on social media. So the young and public in general have been warned as to what information should not be posted on social media. Sadly, as young people need to explore and experiment in finding their own identities, this can be irrevocably traumatizing. For adults, this also can be irrevocably devastating. Therefore, a key insight from this book is to be(come) aware and honest with oneself as to what one wants in a relationship. When we defer and delegate what we want to technology in presenting only our best sides, when we want, and being able to withdraw at will, all of which is what technology offers, we forget, ignore or deny the fact that we still are using technology to communicate ironically, with other people! We lose sight of that irony, and the price we pay is the nearly quiet, but nagging suspicion that we don’t totally get away with what our respective underlying social or un(der)developed problems are! Yes, it is easier said than done. However, what the book clearly demonstrates is that when(ever) we use something else to address the symptoms of our problems, we don’t address, let alone resolve the problem. We keep using whatever it is to uphold or return to the temporary euphoria, but ultimately, we have to return to still face what(ever) we’re trying to escape from. If we do some self reflection and be(come) honest with ourselves, and with others, we won’t need substitutes for what we really need. Fortunately, in the book, it is the children who are asking the critical question, as repeatedly highlighted throughout the book, “Don’t we have people for these jobs?”, along with the young’s growing disillusionment with the immersion with, and the un-ending ‘need’/ pressure to perform on social media, are rays of hope in the debate. Still, the honest realization, however it occurs, that emotive algorithms, as seemingly close as they may be to conveying feeling, will not be the same, let alone equivalent to the importance of human emotion, because human emotion requires human context in order to provide the basis as to why a person feels the way he/she does. So while, it can be demonstratively duplicated, it does not have the same context, nor depth as a(ny) human emotion: I worry if a robot came in that could help her with falls, then she might really want it … She might like it more than me (page 75).” To understand something subtle about a person’s intent, it’s really going to be hard to put that into a robot (page 131).”Yes, this may suggest fear or the equivocation, but it is still a recognition of an implication of an equivocation: a robot can show or duplicate a human emotion on its face, and now, with voice recognition, sound more and more like a human, including intonations – which evokes a degree, if not also outright creepiness. How then, do you know, if you are communicating with a computer? The central point still stands, when we delegate or defer what we can still do ourselves, we irrevocably lose the multi-nuanced, but still commonly-shared context of what human emotion, human. Therefore, to depend (and that’s the key word) on technology, undermines the nuances and creative possibilities that inspires our success. To be “always on”, as one of the chapters is titled, diminishes the capacity to do, create things, and explore and engage with people. E-mails and blog posts because they are public, do not have the same individual resonance and permanence as a letter, post card or card. Turkel’s book is highly worthy of consideration in our honest assessment as to where we are, and who we are as we continually relate to, and evolve (hopefully with constructive fashion) with technology.

35,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3074982-keith,4,"Part 1 describes experiments by the author and others showing the contradictory feelings we have toward robots that mimic human interaction.1. People quickly bond with the robots and tell them things they would not tell another person.2. They are concerned about the lack interaction with real humans.Part 2 gets into an exploration of human emotion.There is a lot is this book that is still relevant. I have not attempted to make a complete summary, only noted a few things that especially caught my attention. The field is changing rapidly, and we might not be able to change the direction society is going. Joseph Weizenbaum raised concerns, in his book Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to Calculation, 1976. Meeting him in person I found him to be much less rabid that I expected. Some of the things he was concerned about have happened, and we hardly blinked. It all came on us gradually and we accepted the loss of privacy with hardly a whimper.Late in life I worked with a beautiful young woman who announced that she was getting off Facebook. She has done that so many times in the last few years that I don’t bother to count. I couldn’t count even if I wanted to, for I am seldom on there. She is of that generation easily trapped into the allure of “social media”. But, it's not just young people who get trapped into the constant on of social media.In the middle of the book Adam and his various in person and online gaming stages are described. His life and job are disintegrating, but he is doing nothing to prepare. This book does not concentrate on addiction. It is more concerned about are we really willing to give up personal human interaction?“In fiction and in myth, human beings imagine themselves “playing God” and creating new forms of life. Now, in the real, sociable robots suggest a new dynamic. We have created something that we related to as an “other,” an equal, not something over which we wield godlike power. ... Because we reach for mutuality, we want them to care about us as we care for them. They can hurt us.” (Page 100 of 360)“But people are capable of the higher standard of care that comes with empathy.” (Page 107)“My own study of the networked life has left me thinking about intimacy — about being with people in person, hearing their voices and seeing their faces, trying to know their hearts. And it has left me thinking about solitude — the kind that refreshes and restores. Loneliness is failed solitude. To experience solitude you must be able to summon yourself by yourself; otherwise, you will only know how to be lonely.” (Page 288)"
36,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5208681-magdelanye,4,"The machine could be preferable-for any number of reasons- to what we currently experience in the sometimes messy, often frustrating, and always complex world of people. p2we seem determined to give human qualities to objects and content to treat each other as things. pxivThese are not exactly conclusions, presented early in the book, but factors on the way to inescapable truths. Sherry Turkle is a warm and refreshing guide to the netherworld of machine tech which she regards not with judgment but with curiosity and concern. You get the sense that she is a real person, quite distinguishable from the robots that she has researched from all angles. She asks the right questions, and gets some startling answers.Indeed, roboticists want us to know that the point of affective machines is that they will take care of us.... We will not care if our machines are clever but whether they love us. p280It's not that she doesn't have her own point of view. From decades of research, this POV has evolved as the industry has, starting with the introduction of interactive toys that allow children a certain sense of mastery and encourage a sense of comfort and ease that will make them receptive to future robotic developments. ST introduces us to the world of robotic companions and the idea of ""our willingness to take the performance of emotion as emotion enough."" p280 and ""a machines performance of caring seem like caring enough."" p282. If there are indeed not enough people willing or easily able to care for their old or their young, or do many of the necessary obnoxious jobs that keep this system humming; if the people who do fill these jobs are not exactly thrilled or competent to be doing them; if indifference on one extreme and sadism on the other are not uncommon: than perhaps there is a point to considering robotic substitutes over fallible human caregivers. The robots' special affordance is that they simulate listening, which meets a human vulnerability: people want to be heard. From there it seems a small step to...people take their robots into private space to confide in them. In this solitude, people experience new intimacies. The gap between experience and reality widens. People feel heard, but the robots cannot hear. p116Our current therapeutic culture turns from the inner life to focus on the mechanics of behaviour, something that people and robots might share. p50ST does not hesitate to point out that with many jobs that rely on technology, the fact that it is a human on the line is moot. For all intents and purposes, much of corporate or institutional behaviour is robotic. Humans that quote from rule books or who won't veer from the script might as well be robotsThe question here is not whether machines can be made to think like people but whether people have always thought like machines. p21At the extreme, we are so enmeshed in our connections that we neglect each other. p294For those who like references, in addition to all of the studies she refers to, are the studies she has initiated and/or collaborated on, delving into the new modes of communication that are challenging traditional means. If you can't summon up nostalgia for the simple telephone call, and cringe at the thought of being separated from your device, maybe you won't find it at all alarming to consider the end of handwriting, or find it sad to see parents interacting with their kids via tech, or treating the kids not the tech as a distraction.We have invented inspiring and enhancing technologies, and yet we have allowed them to diminish us. The prospect of loving, or being loved by, a machine changes what love can be. We know that the young are tempted. They have been brought up to be. p295...immersed in simulation, it can be hard to remember all that lies beyond it or even to acknowledge that everything is not captured by it. For simulation not only demands immersion but creates a self that prefers simulation. Simulation offers relationships simpler than real life can provide. p285This, as far as I know, is the last book in a trilogy examining what ST has called ""the robotic moment"". I would have like to have read them in order, but this was all that was available. After seven years, it would seem like another book is due. At first I was inclined to add a note that if anyone finds me keeping company with a robotic seal to please kill me as quickly and painlessly as possible. Then I started thinking of a scenario where I had a robot companion that would read me the rest of my tba when I could no longer read for myself. The question becomes, what quality of life is the minimum acceptable? And are we willing to accept that, and push on to perfect a world of illusions; or will we perhaps use these and similar findings to rethink what we need and want from each other."

38,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45485537-kurt-geisel,5,"This is an important book. Sherry Turkle is no newcomer to studying the effects of technology on people and society. She has been doing this from the late seventies until the present day--all from the vantage point of one the vanguards of the technological revolution itself, MIT. The result is some significantly ""longitudinal"" observations of both general experiences and specific cases. She has also a first-hand observer during the running of designed experiments, such as social robot interaction and researchers who tried on lives of being ""always connected"" decades before this was a possibility for the general public. And for nearly as long, Turkle has been a sober observer. Her observations must have at times been contrary to the basic DNA and constant thrust of her own institution.The book is divided into two parts. The first, covers the ""Robotic Moment"" at which robots will be taken seriously as social companions. I might find one criticism in the book leading with this part. I think some might have hard time relating or getting through it, but like much of Turkle's observations, this is only slightly ahead of its time. It is happening and it will happen--quickly. Not because robots are immediately becoming more convincing or reaching some quickening of autonomous intelligence, but--as Turkle observes--the change is in us. We are increasingly willing to be satisfied with ""as-if"" sociability. This is reflected in children's interactions with robotic toys (Tamagotchi, Furby, My Real Baby, etc.) and their own recognition of robots being ""alive enough"" to be captivating. Turkle demonstrates how our psychology arrives at this through an understanding of self objects and how our need for ""something better than nothing"" can dangerously evolve into our attaching to it as ""something better than anything"". The theme of the book does have continuity, as it starts with how, even being ""alone"" with a technological artifact, we find new (artificial) intimacy.The second part of the book should find deep resonance with anyone who has not been living under a rock. It focuses on the real impact of social networks. Here we bump up against the flip side of our dilemma: even as we are frantically connected (even ""intimate"") continuously in our networks, we somehow find ourselves feeling even more alone. Turkle's warnings should be heeded. These are not from an alarmist reaction of a few who don't understand the technology. This is from extensive ethnographies and psychoanalysis of many subjects, and an intimate understanding of the potential power and benefits of the technology.If you have any concerns about the possible downsides of social networking and don't want to wade through the whole book, I urge you to just read the sections in Part Two about the effects of social networking on real teens and children. This should be a cause for concern. The current implementations of being ""always on, always connected"" are not serving our children (or ourselves) and preparing them to be the robust, caring, problem solvers of the future. Instead, we are enslaving them to the machine and damaging their psyche along the way. By depriving them of any shred of solitude or space to fully form their own feelings, they live by waves of feelings made by committee and never develop a sense of self in the way we are meant to do. They are less happy, more anxious, less able to focus, and--most concerning--less authentically interested in other people.Despite all these negative effects, our psychology is set up for these technologies to have an inexorable pull on us. It isn't that it makes us narcissists, for example, but it creates many more narcissistic temptations. Getting control requires an intense amount of discipline.This does not all end on a hopeless note. Some incredible things have come from our digital revolution--and many far more incredible things are yet possible. We need to collectively break away from the distractions created by the current shallow and exploitive junk offered us by today's ""social networks"". Turkle still believes that we can rediscover ways to make our technology allow us to truly connect with one another and not dispose of each other's true human dignity."
39,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"Alone Together has been on my to-read list since it was released, though it’s taken me years to actually read it. It took so long because I have a wariness of reading books which I know I’ll agree with beforehand, unless I’m in need of more thorough information about a subject – but recent citations of this book have brought it front and center and coaxed me into reading it. Sherry Turkle has been studying human-machine interactions since the computer age began entry into consumer products, from a psychological point of view. Alone Together builds on her previous thoughts on the subject (produced in the eighties and nineties) to suggest that we have grown accustomed to treating things as people, and people as thingsI had my doubts about finishing this book at the start, because the first half proved to focus mostly on human-robot interactions, from the primitive (children and their Speak-n-Spells) to the elaborate, of people finding comfort in the ‘company’ of robotic dogs with programming designed to simulate personality and liveliness. Turks takes readers then through the changing relationships of the early internet age, as people created new identities for themselves online, and began having relationships – friendly, romantic, adversarial – with other ethereal identities. Many people who found their ‘real’ lives less than fulfilling (because of their appearance, their poverty, their location) began disconnecting from one to immerse themselves in the others. There was an important difference between online relationships and “IRL” ones, however: online relationships were far more convenient. A conversation could be ended by closing a window; an identity could be altered at will. This posed interesting questions and concerns, especially to those who developed deep friendships with personalities they only knew from behind the screen; how could they know if the person they’d been hearing the woes of was real, or just a character being played by someone else for curiosity‘s sake, or to express their own problems in another guise? How much could these relationships be counted on when the parties could simply disappear without a trace? When smartphones and social media entered our lives, the odd nature of online relationships increasingly began to define our real ones. Now it was our family and friends whose messages we felt free to ignore; it was our real-life profiles that we were putting on display. Ignoring flashing IMs on a computer screen when we’re trying to focus on something else is one thing; ignoring people we’re with to continually dip into another world is quite another. Turkle suggests that never-present behavior like this has grown to be endemic, as she records the frustrations of teenagers who have fought for their parents’ attention their entire lives. There’s a lot of unpack in a book like this, which is disturbing throughout. The unsettling content begins with lonely seniors finding some ersatz version companionship in robotic pets, whirring dogs and synthetic babies who ‘need’ their attention and make them feel both useful and connected to something. It returns in full in the latter third of the book, when Turkle focuses on smartphones. I’ve mentioned the teens lifelong struggle to pull their parents away from their phones, but the kids themselves often report to Turkle how overwhelming their own phones are to them. They may receive a hundred messages an hour, all of which demand a response, and one of them asked aloud – not of anyone, merely voicing his exhaustion — “How long do I have to do this?” A book like this is valuable, I think, for making us aware of our own attentive flightiness. Social media isn’t going anywhere, and here’s no question it adds to people’s lives. But those who are at all concerned about the way technology molds our minds, or those who are interested in living with intention, rather than simply being passive in letting technology shape our behavior rather than the other way around will find it helpful, if sometimes discouraging.

Everyone building new tech should read it.In a time when I feel a lot of anxiety about these issues, Turkle's message is ultimately hopeful and encouraging. ""We deserve better. When we remind ourselves that it is we who decide how to keep technology busy, we shall have better.""The biggest suprise for me was that kids nowadays are communicating deep concerns and reservations about robots, smartphones and constant connectivity. Turkle relates examples of teens conveying nostalgia for things they didn't experience – old-fashioned letters, land line phones, etc. She describes young children whose grandparents have robot companions express concerns about them. ""Even if, as adults, we are intrigued by the idea that a sociable robot will distract our aging parents, our children ask, 'Don’t we have people for these jobs?'""Some of the most important lessons I took away:– Recognize the tendency to frame decisions about new tech as fictional, binary quandaries.

Either we blindly embrace the Internet, or we take it as an addiction, go cold turkey, move into the mountains and become Luddites.) The really hard work behind moral and societal questions, the real work, lies in deciding how to frame these questions, not in choosing among the options laid out in a frame. Children can sometimes help with this because their imaginations haven't yet been completely molded into the frames of reference that the rest of us are locked into.– Avoid ""unbending narratives of technological optimism or despair"" – instead, acknowledge limits, stop to make corrections, double back. Avoid simple love of tech, avoid Luddite apocalyptic narratives. Encourage humility – continually step back, reconsider decisions, consider costs, recognize those things we consider sacred.It's important, from time to time, to reverse the common frames we employ in contemplating our relation to tech:	– “We don’t do our e-mail; our e-mail does us.” When we ""spend time on Facebook,"" Facebook is spending our time.	- When considering why people take to new tech, and how it's marketed, think in terms of disappointments and vulnerabilities rather than needs and desires. The idea of need means that we must have something; the concept of vulnerability leaves a lot more room for choice and evolution. For instance: ""When we say we look forward to computer judges, counselors, teachers, and pastors, we comment on our disappointments with people who have not cared or who have treated us with bias or even abuse.""	– Consider new tech as symptoms, rather than solutions.	– Ask: Is this really solving a problem, or is it just disguising the problem?	– Consider what a new tech replaces or diminishes, rather than just what benefits it brings.	– Don't just ask: Is this giving an audience what they want? Ask: How much is it giving them what they want, vs. only giving them something they've been convinced to *think* they want?"
41,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"I felt a growing sense of urgency as I read Sherry Turkle’s extraordinarily thought-provoking book, Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology And Less From Each Other. I’m a little unsure about exactly how to characterize that urgency, but I know its essence is about the relationships between humans and machines. And that sentence alone grossly understates the case, certainly in terms of the words “relationships” and “machines.”Turkle anchors the start of her story in the 1970s, when toy automation made an appearance in the playrooms of children. Though animation and interaction were quite crude, these early computerized toys were enough to affect the way children thought about them. They were more than just toys: it appeared they could think and possess knowledge. Some readers will be old enough to recall the shift from such devices to “sociable robots,” which took interaction to a new level. Sociable robots wanted care and attention, and seemingly flourished when they received it. Already, the term “relationships” was being nudged towards some kind of redefinition.Turkle’s deep and solid research centers on experiments with robots and two demographics: children and the elderly who, for one reason or another, often find themselves alone. With growing sophistication in technology, Furbies and Tamagotchis gave way to AIBO, Cog, and Kismet, not to mention My Real Baby. Relationships between humans and robots intensified enough to move from disinterested interaction to growing companionship and a “search for communion.” Despite being “alone” with a robot, people felt otherwise. Or, as Turkle describes the first half of her book, “in solitude, new intimacies.”In the second half of her book, Turkle switches to “in intimacy, new solitudes.” She fast-forwards to the networked age, when everybody is always on and always connected. But less and less—to an amazing degree, when one thinks about it!—that connection is in person or face-to-face. Rather, it is characterized as dynamic, on demand, and instant, but also features brevity, emoticons, and enough abbreviation to almost form a new language. The communion born out of such connections can be with one person or a multitude of people, with people we know and with those we don’t, or ever will.Turkle doesn’t negatively criticize or condemn what’s taking place, but she does pose provocative questions about what we are doing with technology and what technology is doing to us. Is it serving our intended purpose? Are we sure—and clear and comfortable with—what that purpose is, or do we need to build in deliberate checkpoints to avoid losing direction? One mark of a good book is that it will have you nodding periodically, either because it validates something you already know, or reveals new ideas with which you readily agree. Readers of Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology And Less From Each Other may well suffer neck pains from all the nodding induced by this excellent book![Note: The author has an excellent TED Talk, Connected, But Alone?, https://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turk... ] "
42,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30973553-caleb,4,"Go ahead. Read this book and Nicholas Carr's ""The Shallows"". Terrifying stuff. Both should be required reading for any person starting out (or, much more likely, continuing on) on the internet. Guard your mind and your privacy. Turkle's background in psychoanalysis gives her a solid humanist foundation from which to assess the claims made by and for the internet on our social, psychic, and spiritual lives. While she focuses most often on children and teenagers, the arguments are broadly applicable. We need more thoughtful and compassionate critiques of how we are being remade, like this one. And we need more critics from the humanities working on these issues, to keep the narrow minded technophiles in check. Turkle's story about a programmer who cites Michel Foucault's discussion of the pan-opticon as the social ideal to which we are heading is, frankly, scary. Who are these people?The book has two parts. The first queries our relationship with and attitudes about robots, broadly defined. The second part examines the various ways in which the Net is changing social relations and notions of the self. At first I thought that the robot chapters were beside the point, but having finished the book, I can see their purpose. Turkle is trying to get us to see a little further down the road to a future of further automation and Net-driven connection. Do we want to turn more and more of life over to machines? She suggests that we are increasingly sanguine about the prospect, despite nagging anxieties and guilt. Despite Snowden and the mental health effects of obsessive connectivity, many people remain technophiles who think that machines will come through where humans have failed. The second half of the book undermines this enthusiasm by showing how machines are changing our relationships, habits, and identities, with an emphasis on disconnection, loneliness, and alienation. Some of the stories are quite powerful and too familiar. The book can be repetitive and anecdotal; you can skim many of the examples without losing the main thread. But at least this MIT prof is trying to write for a popular audience. More academics need to make such an effort. Although there are more eloquent and better structured books out there, the core point here makes it worth the read. Some people have criticized Turkle for focusing on frivolous tech, like the Furby and Tamagotchies. They are missing the point. These are rudimentary robotic technologies aimed at children that normalize such interactions. If you look at the way people interact with their phones, IPADs, etc., which are becoming smarter, more powerful, and autonomous, you can see where she is going with this.David Foster Wallace's ""Infinite Jest"" would be a great novel to pair with ""Alone Together."" Wallace foresaw many of these problems. How are we going to focus our attention and nurture human connection in the face of the ultimate diverting entertainment that preys on our vulnerabilities? "
43,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27509806-edward,2,"I read this book because its author was mentioned by Mike Rugnetta of PBS Idea Channel on Youtube (although not as an author he agrees with). I ended up not agreeing with much Turkle had to say either, but it's good to read a book that challenges you like this every so often. The lower rating is not a comment on Turkle's abilities as a writer or researcher. I just (humbly) think her conclusions are wrong.If you've ever felt a vague discomfort with society's reliance on ""technology,"" the tone of this book will resonate with you. Who hasn't felt at least mild irritation when looking at someone who obviously can't pry their eyes away from their phone for even a second to enjoy the world around them? Or irritation with themselves for doing the same? Turkle has spent a lifetime observing and studying the way people interact with the technology in their lives, from cell phones to video games to robots. Page after page of this book is filled with disturbing anecdotes of people replacing human interaction with mechanical simulation, of new intimacies within solitude and new solitudes within intimacy, as she puts it. I would be lying if I said none of these examples gave me pause.That being said, I am always bothered by ""techno-critics"" who brood darkly over mankind's future. Something about it seems too easy; like blaming video games for school shootings (something Turkle at least does not do). Human culture is more complicated than our devices. We rely on technology, yes, but underlying problems like isolation, lack of depth or feeling within social settings, etc, are old. Turkle acknowledges this and argues that technology makes it easier for these things to occur, exacerbates them. Perhaps. But I am reminded of a meme I once saw (on the internet!) of a group of people on a train, all reading newspapers, all clearly ignoring each other. It looks like it was taken in the 1940s or 50s, and is captioned ""all this technology is driving us apart."" What may seem like a rapid, terrifying change of pace now may look placid later. As I read I wondered how much of Turkle's concern was due to the very broad definition of ""technology"" she employs. In some chapters she focuses on the cutting edge of A.I. and its implications on the very nature of being; in others she criticizes texting while driving. Her points within each sphere may be valid, but they are not on the same plane. The risks and rewards of these various technologies are more fairly judged separately, not as some lump entity. Like I said before, this is not a bad book. It sparked a lot of interesting questions; writers like this work at the intersection of several subjects--philosophy, cognitive science, theology. I plan to read more of another book I feel may be related, ""The Mind's I."" And also watch more PBS Idea Channel, which is awesome and everyone should totally check out. "
44,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2131722-kevin,3,"This book is split into two main sections. Alone but together, and together but alone.Alone but together. Looking at alone as no other human and/or no other quality connection. This section dealt with the segments of the population that no longer, or never had, a human partner and the deep connection that usually brings. The elderly being neglected because they don't have children or they are too busy to visit. Those dealing with the loss of a spouse after decades. Or the younger generation that can't seem to make a real connection. These people are lonely. But, there are robots for them. Robots have been made to want attention and care, which gives the lonely person some sense of responsibility. The robots provide little responses that we humans easily, and wantingly, interpret as both agency and intimacy. Think about the benefit of companion pets, but a robot is not going to ever snub you or bite your hand. It's more consistent ... well, as long as the batteries last.Together but alone. This section was the reason I read this book in the first place. I was a little dismayed that this topic wasn't the entire book, but it's ok, I dealt with it in a fairly adult manner. This was about how we are hyper-connected due to email, social media, instaface, bookgram, and instant messaging, yet, we can't make a decent connection and so many feel like we are alone. Having 500 friends digitally isn't equating to even one, quality friend that will bail you out of jail, hide a body, and stock diet mountain dews for when you get the munchies. And that makes me sad. Now I need my robot penguin to comfort me. Ahhh.Anyway, I read this book right after Click, by the Brafman brothers, which discussed the magic of instant connections. Take out the marketing hype, and it's really about how to make connections, period. There were several points that overlap with these ideas here. The biggest is presence. To have a connection, you must be fully invested and present to the person you are trying to connect with. If one of you is getting distracted at every phone beep to check facebook, you both lose. There won't be flow in the conversation, and there will never be a desire for either to be vulnerable (another Click necessity). The digital world is also discouraging physical proximity. Why meet one person at a coffee shop when you can just text each other, and five others, without putting on pants? Proximity (yet another Click talking point), is happening less. All in all, the digital world is causing us to not feel connected to others, resulting in more loneliness, and thus causing people to seek these missing connections elsewhere, in robots. Which is exactly what the robots want. They find all our dirty little secrets, blackmail us, then take over the world, subjugating humans to the role of meat puppets. They'll probably just feed us to the pandas."
45,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18196260-jessica,3,"The message of this book, which is already laid out in the title, is that we are losing touch with each other, and tricking ourselves into thinking that technology is picking up the slack by allowing us to virtually ""friend"" one another. On another note, we are removing ourselves from the picture, literally, by editing pictures we take of ourselves and one another to make them appeal to what we think society wants and it gratifies us only because we can ""control"" the situation and photo. We can manipulate ourselves and each other and altogether deceive one another through technology, in real life, it's quite harder to manage. Paradoxically, we are tricking our minds to believe that it's okay if we are more together with one another through social media and networking sites, as opposed for it being okay if you or I were to speak in person, face to face. Now, our brains are telling us that it's a danger, or bother, or just something we'd rather not do. That's not okay, in this way, we are losing our humanity to technology, we are losing our sense of empathy to sites that allow us to falsify information about ourselves to make ourselves appeal to our own false sense of identity and to others as well, we are becoming more and more desensitized. In a world where we feel like we can only unmask our true feelings behind the safety of a keyboard and screen, it's hard to be able to share feelings with one another anymore. People need to realize that we are social creatures, yes, but the social structure we choose will indefinitely impact our society's future in either a positive or negative way. My view is simply that we are giving our attention away to technology - Xbox, Playstation, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook - and this is leaving little to no attention for the people around us - beings that matter - who have feelings - we are crumbling as a society, feeling less like we can relate, if only through circumstances we control, and less through conversation, but more through, merely, connecting, as a result of our social media. This is what I feel the author is trying to convey. I highly recommend this book and give credit to the author. One more thing I feel I should say, I've noticed people's reviews for this book, saying that it's become a mockery, and that it's too biased. Well, sure, everything is biased. Everything, the fact you said it's biased is, well, biased. We should be taking this seriously. We need to support each other instead of poking fun as sensory material, relative to our feelings, because we all have them, and I'm sure not one person hasn't felt alone, in the sense that people aren't truly listening, and have you ever stopped to actually shed light on that thought - maybe they really aren't. - Jessica Ezell "
46,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6546332-ms-wendy-b,4,"“We are too much in contact with each other, and in ways that are random. . .unable to acquire value for each other because there is not enough space between our times together.”- Henry David Thoreau, Walden, 1854Although she quotes a 19th century author, MIT professor Sherry Turkle argues that this observation defines relationships in 21st century society -- particularly as a result of the ubiquitous presence of robotics and social networks. Turkle challenges readers to think about the effects of technology in one’s personal life, but focuses frequently upon children and adolescents. As we integrate ipads, Google Apps for Education, and other technology tools in the classroom -- all with the best intentions of helping our students communicate, collaborate and create -- we need to also ask ourselves, what are we potentially sacrificing? As a colleague suggested at the February staff meeting, the book argues that there is an inverse relationship between our use of technology and our ability to empathize. This argument is developed through a variety of anecdotes related to studies of children and adolescents in relation to technology. This format makes for an accessible, engaging read after a long teaching day, yet one that’s grounded in decades of research.The book is divided into two sections: one that explores the evolution of robots and artificial intelligence and one that explores the effects of social media. Chapter titles are articulated as brief phrases that suggest a general perspective on one effect of technology: “Love’s Labor Lost,"" “Alive Enough,” and “Growing Up Tethered” are a few examples. If the prospect of a 300-page book seems onerous at present, I’d suggest reading the second section only, and within this section, selecting specific chapters. Specifically, I’d recommend 9 through 12 for high school teachers since these chapters focus upon social media, anxiety, and the potential perils of maintaining an online audience. As we move toward teaching different modes of communication such as blogging and tweeting -- important mediums in our 21st century curriculum -- these chapters pose challenging questions.Although this book focuses upon the negative impacts of technology, it also highlights many positives. Turkle asserts several times that she’s “not a Luddite” but she challenges readers to rethink the associations of “community” and of “listening” with technology."
47,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5618146-s-k,3,"Sherry Turkle's 1995 book ""Life On The Screen"" was in no small part responsible for sparking my own interest in the internet, computer-aided social networks, and the ways in which people relate to technology. As such, I was excited to read her analysis of more recent social and technological developments. ""Alone Together"" is divided into two parts, the first focusing on sociable robots (from Furbies to elder-care bots) and the second on the ""always on"" world of mobile devices and the social web. My own experience with sociable robots is effectively nil so I found the first section interesting in terms of catching up but can't offer much comment on it. The second section explores some concerns I'd been thinking on recently on my own, about the way the ""always connected"" life fragments attention and discourages reflection, and the way superficial but pervasive social network connections with the ""friended"" can degrade the quality of connections with one's actual family and friends.Turkle, an MIT professor, is certainly neither a technophobe nor a layman. However, especially since the second section of ""Alone Together"" tends to focus on the experience of children and teenagers (albeit with some treatment of adults too) it's hard not to hear an undertone of ""kids these days"" hand-wringing. I don't share Turkle's nostalgia for the landline telephone, and I know that before I had my nose in a smartphone all the time I had a my nose in a book or magazine-- hardly a recipe for high-quality engagement with people in the flesh. Perhaps, also, I feel defensive of the media that were in many ways my social-skills stepping stone and reluctant to admit that the promised technological utopia of connection may never arrive.Nonetheless, I do share Turkle's concerns about the drift towards being alone together and the way we begin to view the rituals of human engagement as a chore. As such, I would have liked to see more exploration of how to derive the most benefit from these technologies while resisting their detrimental effects. Unfortunately, while Turkle encourages us not to accept computer-aided personal disconnect as inevitable or a necessary evil, ""Alone Together"" is light on solutions for how to cope with developments that are already thoroughly integrated into our daily lives."
48,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone,3,"Feeling disconnected by your cyber-connectivity? Here's an exploration of the enigma.Turkle tackles the issue on two fronts - first, through a study introducing robotic pets into the home environments of the elderly and the young. She marks the ease with which intimacy needs are transferred to these virtual devices and the way they tend to supplement insufficient familial caregiving. States of abandonment, loneliness, and the illusory nature of such mechanical gratifications are examined; how what moves and appears to be ""alive"" can so easily be accepted as an adequate substitution for human-to-human connection.Turkle's second front is social networking and the manner in which it culminates in a kind of hyper-other-directedness. The hunger to fill up a contact/friends list, the seemingly crucial importance of virtual presentation; the creation of an idealized, desirable self that is, at best, part-self yet too often non-self (or fictive self) requiring hard labor to maintain. She assesses the lesser interactive demand of a text versus a telephone call, an Internet post versus a luncheon conversation, and the prevalence of new millennium gate-keeping - dictating when you will communicate and how (by logging on) as well as when you will allow others to communicate with you (by choosing to check messages or replies). Dating, gaming, confessionals and the Facebook experience are covered as well.Turkle asks all the right questions which, in and of itself, makes this a work of substance. However, there is a distance in this material that's genuinely off-putting. Too much humanity goes missing in both the scientific study and the author's voice. I didn't feel she paid nearly enough attention to what we receive through the physical presence of another individual - spontaneity, communion (touch, taste, smell), body language, unconsciously relayed subtext, even the ability to participate in corporeal gaffs and recoveries, which enhance interactive tolerance and flexibility. As for Turkle herself - she's the white-coat in the corner taking notes. Feeling compassion, yes, but taking notes. (An impression solidified by conclusions I found to be a bit convoluted and steeped in psychoanalytical jargon.)It's an intriguing approach to a widely-experienced dilemma. Incomplete, but intriguing."
49,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897241-mjhancock,3,"Sherry Turkle argues that we need to take a step back and think about how our networked technology and distance from fellow human beings are negatively affecting us. Her book is divided into two broad parts: section one looks at human relationships with robots, and section two looks at human use of communication technology. The methodology is basically the same throughout; Turkle bases her results on the analysis she performs on interviews and studies she performed of children, adults, and the elderly using digital technology. It's basically pop scholarship, but Turkle constantly references underlying structure of psychoanalytic and sociological theory behind it. While the divisions aren't absolute, different chapters tend to focus on slightly different technologies. Robots studied include the Tamagotchi, Furby, My Real Baby, the robot dog AIBO, the MIT robots Cog and Kismet, and Paro the sociable seal-like robot. And throughout, Turkle's concern is that the robots are being used as companions to replace companionship that human beings should provide. The networked section includes Second Life, texting, phone monitoring, the decline of actual phone calls, designing a Facebook persona, and so forth, with the concern here being that we're sacrificing meaningful interaction for something that leaves us less vulnerable, but less fulfilled. The book is a rather large reversal from Turkle's previous position, but whereas before she was a bit too utopian, this book strikes me as a bit too dystopian. There's also an unspoken human essentialism behind it, in that no robot can duplicate the human touch, or no text message equal the emotionality of the human voice. It's a little easier to take her side in the second half, where she argues against the current overuse of communication technology than in the first half, which is on the near future replacement of human companionship with robots. Ultimately, what's at stake here is the human relationship with technology. I think Turkle goes a bit far in the direction of technological determinism, but taking some time to reflect on our technological habits is rarely a bad idea."
50,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6159628-melissa,5,"I would give this fewer stars, because it left me dreadfully unhappy and depressed, but I think it is a necessary read. I can't decide if this was fascinating, or frightening, but I lean heavily toward frightening. I like my social media, but not where it is going, particularly since children, teens, and adults can avoid self-acceptance by creating avatars and profiles that project who they would like to be and ""living"" through that personna instead. Suddenly the higher suicide rate makes sense - even in a group, our friends are more interested in their phones than us. Further, if faceless people reject our ""ideal"" self, where does that leave the ""me"" that already felt inadequate? Where is the love? How will inner peace ever be achieved? I think dolls/toys that talk are cute, but never thought about how they are affecting the psyche of children and their perception of ""alive"" or ""love"" or the new mindset that toy animal pets might be better than real pets because they don't run off, and can be turned off....How controlling and dispassionate are future generations going to be if this is how we are programming our youth?I was also not aware of all the advancements in humanoid robots. Apparently, in an attempt to provide robots for companionship/care for the elderly and disabled children, they decided to first design a sex robot (demand/marketing reasons...$7000 available now...). Apparently, people will be happier if we have a submissive partner who never challenges anything we want, or one that we can program to be as wild as we want it to be. We really live in a sick world, if we are trying to create robots for any of those reasons. Just a thought: Perhaps we could just step away from materialism and selfishness, and be more present and compassionate. I highly recommend this book to anyone in the toy market, anyone who has elderly or disabled relatives, anyone who has teenagers who are always 'online', or anyone who has another life online that isn't congruent with their own real life. This book is your wakeup call."
51,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4281506-maureen,3,"The whole concept of this book is fascinating - that with the increase in technology in our lives, we are losing some important human elements, some of the very elements that make us human. The author has dedicated her professional life to this topic, and this third book in her opus is comprehensive and thought-provoking. But a little too comprehensive. I was most interested in the the parts that I'd read about in the media - of how families sit together in a room, but don't talk since they're all on their devices. But first I had to get through the entire first half of the book which was about robots. Robots that kids play with, robots that are are like pets, robots that people can have sex with, robots that can take care of the elderly. Interesting - especially when there were serious conversations about the possibility of having robots replace humans in one's affections. The second half of the book got into the content I'd expected, and I sure felt like she'd nailed me, since I'm the one in the family who has a cell phone at bedside, who checks her email (and Facebook, and news site, and weather site) before even getting out of bed. Some creepier parts were about people who live too much of their lives in on-line communities. I knew that there are people who game too much. But did you know that there are confessions sites, where people can go on and anonymously confess horrible things they've done, and then other people get on and diss them or support them? Too weird. She has good stuff about how the younger generation is growing up with a totally different expectation of privacy, and how they document so much of their lives on public forums. So, if any of this sounds like you'd like to get your thinking tweaked, then try this one. I'm glad I read it, but it was quite a slog. "
52,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,3,"I had high expectations for this one and ended up disappointed.Half of this (the first seven chapters) is just about robots. The second half is better, with more analyzation and consideration of social media and texting. Her concluding chapter is pretty good (in fact, the reader could probably read her conclusion only, and get the same basic points out of the book, without reading the middle). But it didn't go far enough.I wanted more conclusions and final verdicts, more insights. I wanted to learn more about the psychology behind all this. How are our interactions and learning processes changing by staring at screens all day? What is this doing to our brains and learning processes? How is this affecting the ways we communicate and understand each other? What about memory and recall? What about input/output of information electronically versus on paper?Turkle talks a lot about the fact that technology is affecting our connections, but she isn't specific about how this connection is changing over time. Her writing feels too cloudy and too repetitive. Turkle explains the same studies, the same kinds of interviews, and her same basic ideas over and over again. She also talks only about children and the elderly.Bottom line, this needed more editing, organization, and condensing. I want to read Growing Up Social: Raising Relational Kids in a Screen-Driven World next."
53,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33921897-kusaimamekirai,4," This is the second of her books I've read after ""Reclaiming Conversation"". She covers similar themes of constant connectivity and alienation as in the first book, but also examines humans interactions with robots and its ethics going forward. Reading this book, one can't help but feel that wherever it is we are going as a society, something isn't right. I read the majority of this book on a train and as I'm reading, I notice that 80% of those around me are on their phones.  It reminded me of a quote Turkle uses I believe to sum up her basic thesis that ""at a cafe near my home,almost everyone is on their computer or smartphone as they drink coffee. These people are not my friends, and yet somehow I miss their presence"". We truly are more connected than ever before but at what cost? Her case studies of students and adults who talk about conversation being ""risky"" so avoiding face to face interactions is both scary and sad.  Or the MIT researcher who sees marriage between robots and humans as not only a positive thing but an ideal. As the author points out, we learn empathy from human interactions. As those decline or are seen as superfluous, how do we retain our basic humanity? Or does humanity even have any intrinsic value in an information based society where anything outside your scope of interest is simply wasting time? I see value in the net, cellphones, and social media (I am on goodreads after all), however I hope we never get to a place where they become preferred to simple conversations.  "
54,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4603788-gary-lang,3,"This is one of those books that tries to shed some light on what effects pervasive communications, robot companions, and social networking are having on society. I think we're meant to think that this stuff is inherently flawed, and I don't know if that's the case or not, but as I read the well-described examples and case studies, I couldn't help wondering if it wasn't too early in the technology life-cycles for these things to pass judgment. I was surprised to read about Eliza in this book, since the rest of the cases dated from the last few years. Relating findings from a simple imitation of Rogerian psychotherapy from the 70s to the more recent social and empathetic technologies that are discussed in the book seemed odd to me. Eliza is very easy to write and really has no understanding of anything. The newer technologies either involve software with more intelligence built in, or actual human beings interacting through software. That said, given the potential for issues to arise, it's better to think about them ahead of time and design for success. Turkle's book highlights the pitfalls of excessive reliance on technology for social interaction. Some of this has been covered before - e.g. ""Delete"" on the topic of pervasive persistence of information - but it's nice to have it all in once place. Still, as I read about the problems, I guess my background as a software engineer kicked in. I thought ""these are bugs you're describing, and they can be fixed""."
55,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3501898-richard-thompson,4,"Turkle focuses on two technologies that have the potential to redefine who are as human beings: robots designed to respond to and mimic back human emotions, robots designed to ""care""; and hyperconnective technologies like the Internet, smartphones, Facebook, texting and Instant Messaging.Both technologies, as described by Turkle, have pretty gigantic creepiness factors, but hyperconnectivity seems to me to be scarier because it is HERE. Ubiquitous personal robot companions are (maybe) something that we will see in the future; people who are addicted to their on-line relationships at the cost of their face-to-face (or even ear-ear) relationships are ubiquitous with a capital U already. Turkle talks about how, once a technology emerges, seems to make its own demands and set its own agendas and the trick is to negotiate those demands so that what evolves is something that is life enhancing and healthy. We still have a bit of window to do think about that where digital technologies are concerned, but (this is me, not Turkle speaking) we have a have a truly lamentable record when it comes to putting technology in its place: automobiles, industrial agriculture, nuclear power (weapons and other), technologies for harvesting (or just plain killing) other species, mining... ALONE TOGETHER was published in 2011. Given the speed with which digital technology evolves, it would be interesting to read an addendum to the book that talks the current state of affairs."
56,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37408868-lee-lloyd,3,"I gave this book as high a score as I did, because I think it insightfully discusses important topics that we should all consider. That said, it was not a pleasant read. That is partly because of the subject matter, after all, pretty much anyone reading this book is bound to find some unfavorable similarities to their own behaviors, but also because it is frankly not that well written. While I find the author's thesis and arguments compelling, the entire book had the repetitive and arduous feel of something that had been hopelessly padded to bulk it up to the length of a proper book. I can't help but feel like all her points could have been better made, in a shorter format, that did not cover the same ground quite so many times. I found myself constantly peeking ahead, to get a feel for how much longer it would be until the next chapter, as I rushed through the fourth or fifth story illustrating the same point that had already been amply established.Unfortunately, as really meaningful as some of the ideas in the book were, and as much as it made me consider technology from a different perspective, by the epilogue I found myself thinking ""is this ever going to end? We get it, how much more could you possibly have to say?"" I would still recommend people read the book, because it brings up questions we should all be asking, but be prepared for a slog to get through it."
57,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46667560-robert-irish,2,"This book breaks into two halves. The first half looks at the concept of sociable robots taking over roles of caring and concern normally played by people. In this part, she oversimplifies the argument by focusing on children and the elderly -- the two groups who are most vulnerable to sociable robots and often lacking the ability to make judgments about how we might interact with the robots. Because these groups say it is o.k. and that they love their robots, Turkle concludes that we are in trouble, and doomed to lose something of our humanity to the machine.The second half looks at our networked lives of texting, email, gaming, Facebook, and other instant messaging. This half also tends to focus on youth, but overall it's a stronger assessment. One of the significant points she raises is that we use these technologies to create the illusion of control, while our lives spin further out of control, and out of attention. I think that's the big theme: we lose attention on people, we move further apart as our interactions with each other are technologically mediated. I found in the second half, several moments of good caution. I feel like I want to untether from my phone a little more ... except that's where I listen to audiobooks. There's also something in the value of mental space, that she touches on, but does not develop."
58,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2799585-steve,4,"I will start with the big question that this book asks and end with some important words from the conclusion. The question is ""What are we missing in our lives together that leads us to prefer lives alone together?"" This question is drawn from these selected words from the book's conclusion.""We don't do email, our email does us.""""We enjoy continual connection but rarely have each other's attention.""""We like being able to reach each other almost instantaneously but have to hide our phones to force ourselves to take a quiet moment.""""The ties we form through the Internet are not, in the end, the ties that bind. But they are the ties that preoccupy.""""When we misplace our mobile devices, we become anxious-impossible really.""Tragically for families, ""In the evening, when sensibilities such as these come together, they are likely to form what has been called 'postfamilial families"". Their members are alone together, each in their own room, each on a networked computer or mobile device. We go online because we are busy but end up spending more time with technology and less with each other."""
59,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16197762-leanna-pohevitz,5,"I completely love this book. I've been living in Morocco for the last year and half and coming home was extremely overwhelming for me. I was angry at smartphones and people for relying on them. I was sick of the internet. I was overwhelmed by how little people expected from each other in person but how much they demanded of each other online. I picked up this book from a long reading list I just hadn't gotten around to. Once I started I was hooked though I had to constantly put it down to think.I really appreciated the first part of the book, but the second part was where I felt every word. p 154 “Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we can feel utterly alone. And there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessed-and only for the parts we find useful, comforting, or amusing.”I'm glad someone somewhere is on the same page as me. I'm glad there are folks of all ages, based on the interviews, who don't want to only speak to others through a screen.I'm thankful I read this book right when I did and I look forward to suggesting it to others (now how to do that without seeming passive aggressive?)."
60,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7825156-mihai-barbat,5,"The first part of the book tackled the propensity that humans have to connect with entities that reflect back their humanity. This is now also including robots! It was food for thought but in the same time, reading this in 2019 with examples 15 years old gave it a bit of a passe vibe. On the other hand the second part of the book engages with the way technology mediates our human interactions which is changing us in profound ways with a speed that eludes any sort of critical engagement. I agree wholeheartedly with the author's assessments on the damages technology inflicts on the human spirit and the way it pushes our interactions outside of the human sphere and more in the object sphere. The real drama here is the way overworked adults (previously socialized by humans) leave their children to be socialized by the machines and push their elders also in the care of technology, further negating their humanity and any possibility to develop one's own. Capitalism takes care to fully occupy everybody's time (to work and consume) and doesn't provide any utilitarian reasons to engage with philosophy or literature."
61,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13156054-shana,3,"Having utilized Turkle’s previous work in support of my undergraduate thesis, I was surprised to see that she is somewhat less enthusiastic about technological advances as she used to be. I don’t think this change in sentiment is unique to her and I can definitely relate to some of the same misgivings.There are two distinct components in this book. First, Turkle covers robots: their evolution, our interactions with them, the roles they are supposed to play, etc. She discusses how children understand the “aliveness” of various robots, like Aibo and Furby. She also brings up how robots are seen as the next frontier in elder care, and how/why this is controversial.The second part of the book deals more with our reliance on technology as it relates to intimacy and authenticity. The title of the book sums it up well. Just last night I was lying in bed doing the New York Times crossword puzzle on my iPhone while my husband was next to me catching up on the news on his phone. We were together physically, yet totally separated in our minds. Or in other words, we were alone together."
62,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6180865-abdullah-konash,5,"Ignoring the part were the book talked about sociable robots (I didn't enjoy that part because I couldn't relate to it, but it was a nice insight.), this book is awesome! It contained many aspects that I tried to explain why I get annoyed when I'm with someone and they're busy with their phone, the decided attention problem. It explains how we are becoming less human with technology and are lacking intimacy in our relationships as human beings. People are reduced to text, and now are missing what it means to be truly human. Everything from Facebook to twitter, to social games to computer worlds, this book talks about them all. I could relate to a lot of aspects in it. I used to have my own view on these things and how they make you lose focus and urge to be always plugged, and now because of this book, I'm going to take extra care to have real intimate relationships with people.I highly recommend the book."
63,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3670585-erin-cataldi,4,"An exceptionally well researched book that explore technology and the unintended effects it's having on how we interact with others and ourselves. Broken into two parts, the first half explores the robotic movement and the second half discusses networking online. I really wish there was a new updated edition (this was published in 2010) because so much has already changed. Advances in social media, online privacy (or lack thereof), and robotic developments. Turkle does a wonderful job discussing the pros and cons of our technological advancements and brings forth many soul searching questions. Is our morality changing? Our we becoming less satisfied with our lives? How do we present ourselves online? Is social media what determines our happiness? Are we becoming more fake and competitive? Wonderful and depressing read, a little outdated even though it's only 7 years old, jus goes to show how fast technology is advancing!"
64,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36944-jen8998,4,"Interesting look at how people interact with technology. The first part examines people interacting with robots. Individuals interviewed in her book often describe interactions with robots as preferable to people as they take less time and require less vulnerability. Disturbed by this, Turkle turns her attention to social media (e.g. facebook, text message, IM, etc.). She points out that while these tools increase our communication with each other, they also decrease the quality of that communication. In numerous examples, she points out how twitter and the like promote frivolous, superficial messages rather than deeper communication. Much of her research on social media appears to be naturalistic observation and interview - one wonders how she chose her subjects and how representative they are. "
65,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5852496-zara-rahman,4,"I recently put together a list of women writing critically on technology, and this was one of the ones I hadn't read from that list. Turkle has been writing and thinking about technology since before I was born, which makes me feel like I have a loooooot to learn. In this book, she looks a lot at robots of all different kinds and considers how people's relationships towards technology differ to their expectations of relationships with other people. Given that it was written five years ago, I am very curious to know how the more 'human' style robots have ended up today - even reading the book, some of them sounded incredibly futuristic, described back in 2011. It's a long read, based upon a huge amount of interviews and original research. Recommended if you happen to also be thinking about relationships with technology, particularly robots. "
66,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7237449-sharon,1,"Didn't make it all the way through the book. I think I need to read her previous book, Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet which was actually written in 1995. I thought the book would be about how people interact, their mindsets and what it's done to human relationships. However this book really starts looking into robotics, and what new robots are coming together to offer relationships, from mechanical seals to pet and take the place of living pets to sex machines. The book was actually a disappointment. Given the grandeur and over-arching expanse that twitter, facebook, youtube, and dating sites have, I think the idea of her book in 1995 should be updated, as those things were not even in existence...but first I have to read it. ;)"
67,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"As literature, it at times pulled on my heartstrings vis-à-vis the relationship between technology and loneliness in a way that the movie Her tried to do, but radically failed to do. As social science, I'm not so sure.There's not much of a clear stance being taken, other than that robotics and smartphones can have an effect on the way we see things, which strikes me as a bit of a duh. And when you address hyper-specific moments in the history of technology-- the Tamagotchi, Second Life, etc.-- you run the risk of dating yourself badly. The sections on smartphones are quite a bit more interesting, and seem like they have the potential to initiate interesting research, but the rest is rather more unconvincing. As science. As literature, it's still worth reading."
68,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/738294-guido,2,"I did find this book well documented, and in several places also engaging, especially when goes into describing the different feelings and expectations we can overload our use of the network. Those mechanisms are very i teresting indeed and the way the author unpacks them quite inyeresting and instructive.I could not agree, though, on the conclusions she draws about what is the path we are on as society, as she fails to recognize any value in relationships carried out over the network, beyond a make-believe palliative for ""real"" ones.There is more to the so ial aspects if Internet that Mrs Turkle gives it credit for, even though we may not have found a collective way of harness it all."
69,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2574606-edward-sullivan,5,"I found this book fascinating and also quite disturbing. Turkle, a clinical psychologist and MIT professor, discusses her observations and research on the impact digital immersion has had upon human relationships. What I found particularly interesting and troubling are the observations Turkle makes from the hundreds of interviews she has had with children and teens. There is much cause for concern in how digital immersion negatively affects the emotional, psychological, and social development of young people. "
70,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1762068-daniel-lowen,5,"This is a great book. It is twice the book I was expecting it to be.Part I is all about ""sociable"" robots -- how far the technology has come, how people are reacting to them, why people like them, and why people are uneasy about them.Part II is what I was expecting -- a dive into our smartphones, Facebook, texting, photographing, Skype, etc., and what it's doing to us as individuals and as a society.And then she brings the whole thing together -- the deceptive & seductive promise of connection that both of these developments lure us in with."
71,0465010210,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45360-nick,4,"This book sometimes gave me the chills, not because of some scary future it portrays but because Turkle poses, and attempts to answer, some of the deepest imaginable questions about human relationships and the impact of information technology and what another favorite auther, Nicco Mele (okay, he is my son), calls ""radical connectivity"" on our lives. By the way, Turkle is not out to scare us, but some of the encounters and interviews she relates are creepy enough to be discomforting."

I listened to an NPR/TED interview with the author that was incredible. The book itself is a bit overwhelming in its delivery. The topic however, is startling and powerful and sad. After merely reading the introduction I was about ready to throw my iPhone away and never use the internet again. Truly. I'm still in serious thought about it all. Perhaps we all should be."

But it's the second half which I found most interesting. That's where the author talks about how social media, computer games, smart phones and the ability to be always connected, impacts our lives. If that's what you are interested in, you can very well skip the whole first part without losing much.A good read. "
