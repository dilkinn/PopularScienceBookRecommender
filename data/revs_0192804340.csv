The book begins with a guide to what matter is made up of and how it evolved, and goes on to describe the fascinating and cutting-edge techniques used to study it. The author discusses particles such as quarks, electrons, and the neutrino, and exotic matter and antimatter. He also investigates the forces of nature, accelerators and detectors, and the intriguing future of particle physics. This book is essential reading for general readers interested in popular science, students of physics, and scientists at all levels. "
1,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,3,"Good, but not as good as his other VSI book, Nothing, but a great read nevertheless. You´d be amazed how empty things are on the atomic and subatomic levels - far emptier than space, relatively speaking. This book is filled with plenty of great nuggety details like this - Close explaining the size of an atom: ""...look at the dot at the end of this sentence. Its ink contains some 100 billion atoms of carbon. To see one of these with the naked eye, you would need to magnify the dot to 100m across"".And the atomic nucleus? Well to see that - ""you´d need the dot to be enlarged to 10, 000km: as big as the earth from pole to pole.""And that´s only for starters..."

3,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233448-aaron,4,"There is some special sense of futility tied to the task of presenting physics without math. It's like parents trying to explain their impending divorce to their eight-year-old daughter. Bereft of any sort of background knowledge that would allow her to actually understand that reasons for what is happening, the parents must rely upon absolute pronouncements and the deployment of similes even more tortured than this one. But much like that child, I am lacking in background experience. I never learned the mathematics that would allow me to really understand what Close is getting at, so this is the book for me. I'm a scientist with an embarrassing lacking of physics and I fear that one day I'll be corned by on actual scientist who corners me at some science house party, discovers my intellectual short-comings and drums me out of the community of scientists forever. Reading this introduction was a desperate ploy that I'll at least be able to bullshit my way through a brief conversation on particle physics without sounding overconfused. What I actually got out of this book was about as much as I could hope for: I refreshed my understanding of the families of quarks and have a substantially improved understanding of the Large Hadron Collider. On the down side, the section on Exotic Matter (and antimatter) scaled a bit to rapidly, often leaving me somewhat confused after multiple readings, but overall I found this book more useful than trying to understand the field by reading a collection of wiki articles, which has become my ad hoc metric for judging these Very Short Introduction books."

5,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"One of the most intriguing and fascinating scientific stories of the 20th century has been the incredible advance in our understanding of matter in its most fundamental form. In a nutshell, the 20th century has seen the vindication of the atomic hypothesis: all of the nature, the matter and even the interactions of matter, can be reduced to a finite number of indivisible particles. It turns out that atoms, the original candidates for irreducible particles as their name suggests, are in fact composed of a myriad other particles which to the best of our knowledge and understanding are truly fundamental. Furthermore, we have discovered many other particles that cannot be found in an atom, and many of those turned out to be composites of other fundamental particles. Considering how many different kinds of these extra-atomic particles were discovered, it is quite remarkable that we were able to reduce this ""zoo"" to just a few basic ones. This book presents an interesting and accessible account of how we managed to get to this point. The book presents both the experimental and theoretical developments in Particle Physics that has led us to the point where we are at. The book is intelligible to anyone who has any interest in the subject, and it doesn't require any special mathematical knowledge. And yet, like most books in this series, it does not condescend to the reader but tries to educate him and bring him up to the latest in our understanding of this fascinating field. All of that makes this book an enjoyable and worthwhile read."
6,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32046266-adam,2,"I don't really understand why people think this is a good book. It's alright. There is a section on how particles are probed that is horrifically boring and there are almost no details you would ever want to force your brain to suffer storing. Often the text just reads like a list rather than focusing on underlying principles. Other than that it's an alright primer for those who know nothing about the subject, although it lacks any charm. Strange.Save yourself the effort and just independently discover the last century and a half of physics - it'll be quicker and less painful."
7,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91597571-emily-jennings,5,"Really was a great introduction to particle physics. Easy read for anyone with a general physics background and honestly a fun read, too!"
8,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,4,"My old school textbook was woefully irrelevant, incomplete, and unhelpful when it came to giving me a quick overview of the building blocks of fundamental physics. This was close to perfect though. I skipped the chapter on experimental engineering but otherwise every paragraph wrinkled my brain. Spent more time on this VSI than I normally would, and for that I am grateful. This was supposed to be a quick 1hr break in order to understand my other book on Schopenhauer using a physics lens, but now I have no idea what that other book was even saying. 2/3 steps forward, -1/3 steps back. NotesWhy do all physicists/cosmologists working on scales that are too small or too large focus exclusively on analogies of size. Imagine the earth is this M&M I’m going to eat now, imagine the solar system is one serving size of M&Ms, like this bag, and the universe is 10^40 times that, ie the number of M&Ms I’m actually going to eat. What we need are geometric intuitions, that’s what our human-scale brain is unable to find a proper analog for. Not how large an atom is compared to the drops of water in all the oceans, that’s just as impossible, instead the arrangement of un-imaginably scaled objects visavis each other, corresponding to a geometric map of an arrangement we can indeed imagine. That’s why the Bohr model is so easy to fathom and use as a base to manipulate individual objects in the mind-map further. Strong adhesive force between p-p or n-n balances the repulsive force of nuclear protons.Up, down (nucleus), neutrino, electron are all that survived stably after big bang. Charm strange top bottom, and heavier electrons muon tau, vanished.Angstrom -10 is 1 simple atom, Fermi -15 is 1 nucleus, hence used.Sun is plasma: sea of electrons and nucleii independently, separated by the heat.Visible light is strongest radiatio sent out by sun, that's why we've evolved to see this particular portion of the spectrum. Some really hot stars can emit gamma.Visible light wavelength longer than size of atom, so cannot be scattered by it. X-rays larger than atom but scattered by crystals.Multiple stones in water, troughs/peaks used to deduce where stones were dropped. Same with crystallography.High energy particle translates to really low wavelength that can therefore see inside an atom.Alpha radiation allowed us to see nucleus but not within. Beta radiation too weak. We need to ionise an electron and then accelerate it.High energy electrons can thus pierce nucleus and be diverted by proton neutron within, revealing their existenceQuark is 10x mass electron. So how is 3 quark of proton = 2000x e.m? Quarks grip each other tightly, have never been separated from proton. Confined to 10^-15m, energy of 1GeV (938mev) of proton corresponds to mass 2000x.Down slightly heavier than up. So ddu neutron little heavier, unstable than uud proton. Becomes proton through beta decay of electron, neutrinoProton/neutron are baryons, barus heavy, barometer, baritoneQuark + antiquark couple is a meson. Annihilate quickly but like pi meson, provides attractive strong force.Colliders more efficient than accelerators, no energy wasted on imparting motion, head on collision maximises interactionOnly 3 neutrinos because otherwise more paths for Z boson to decay and thus decay faster, which is not observedFor every charge there are 3 fundamental particles. 2/3 u,c,t quarks. -1/3 d,s,b quark. -1 e, muon, tau. 0 neutrino e,m,t. Why 3 generations (most unstable to most stable)Microwave background radiation is 3d above absolute zero. That's it. Hear energy from annihilation of antimatter from big bang, leaving matterMade k mesons. One in million times, observed matter and antimatter decays didn't balance. The cost and margins of new knowledge.What really is my mass? Sum of individual atoms? 3 Quarks (30x electron mass) grip each other so tightly within confined space it becomes 2000x e.m, so it isn’t purely additive. Mass seems an unnecessary quantity here only there to massage our intuitions. Sun-fusion all 4 forces needed: gravity pulls in Hydrogen protons until they’re colliding. Weak force transmutes proton to neutron. Strong force clumps protons+neutrons to form Helium nuclei. EM force radiates energy released.What exactly is the charge?Neutrino hitting water can create electron/muon that can move FTL through water, shockwave generated called Cerenkov radiation.Force carriers: EM through photons. Strong force through Gluons (glue the protons together), and Weak through W/Z Bosons.Neutron (ddu) transforms to Proton (udu). d->u through W-boson that decays within 10e-25s to e and neutrino. W-boson is 80times heavier than d, this ‘deficit borrowing’ is possible due to the tiny time period, limiting distance at which this force can act, hence Weak. In contrast, the Gluon and Photon are massless so perceived much stronger.Photons can’t react with each other, they don’t themselves carry any charge, so EM dies away by inverse square distance. But Gluons do carry *color, so they cluster, strong force grows with distance such that at 10e-15, it is infinite. So impossible to pull apart the quarks of baryons/mesons. At extreme energies, Strong, Weak and EM all become identical. Top Quark is 180 GeV, as big as a Gold Atom, packed into just 10e-18m. So very unstable and decays before can form baryons/mesons.P+P in plasma of sun, EM repulsion takes total energy above deuteron, so one P->N + e+ + n = 1H2. 2 of these become 2He3. 2 of these become 2He4. Had Neutron been lighter than Proton (more stable), then we don’t get atoms and electrochemistry. Luckily, the +1 charged particle is lighter. Can it be heavier though? What gives it its charge?Photons take 1000s of years to make it to the surface of sun because of charged plasma, but neutrinos come straight out. So studying different neutrinos gives us idea of different processes. Big bang creates quarks and electrons. Quark form protons and neutrons which transmute into each other. Though N is heavier, with high temperature, P+e contains enough energy to become N+n. As universe cools, only N->P occurs. We get P, Deuterium universe. After 300k years, temp is 10,000D so finally e captured by P to become neutral atoms. EM radiation is released. Transparency. Why quarks/leptons have ½ spin? Why Bosons have unit integer spin?Do neutrinos have non-zero mass that makes them cluster and account for dark matter?The Higgs field interacts with particles to give them mass. Photon doesn’t interact so massless. Just like EM Radiation is bundled into quantum packets called photons, Higgs field bundled into Higgs Bosons. That is where the journey now takes me. "
9,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1936076-alvaro-zinos-amaro,4,"Frank Close packs in a lot of information in this “very short” introduction (notice there’s no promise about difficulty!). That is at once this book’s biggest strength and its potential challenge. The reader who picks it up expecting a breezy, bird’s-eye-view of particle physics is in for a surprise. But if you stick with it, your efforts will be amply rewarded. In ten concise, albeit dense, chapters, Close covers everything from the basic scale of fundamental particles and forces and the three families of matter to quantum chromodynamics, the origins of mass, and even more esoteric subjects like dark matter. For the rest of this review, please see http://www.popularscience.co.uk/?p=3872."
10,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424073-so-hakim,4,"As the title says, a *very* short introduction to particle physics. Not that it's bad: with 129 pages the author did good job to explain basic quirks of particle physics, including all the exotic names. The only drawback is in chapter 5-6. Right after explaining quarks & neutrino, the author suddenly jumps to how accelerators and detectors work -- the experimental detail -- and after that jump back again to the theoretical side about four fundamental forces. I feel the narrative was hurt by this, but that may be just me.Otherwise an excellent book."
11,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1886439-portia-costa,4,"I must admit that this was a hard struggle for me to read. Not that there's anything wrong with the book. The author has a great style and explains difficult concepts extremely well. It's just a little too advanced for me. It did fill me with a great sense of wonder and awe though, at the way the universe is built and the magical world of the infinitesimally tiny. Despite my scientific shortcomings, I was able to grasp some new to me knowledge."
12,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671266-david,3,"Good summary but gets pretty confusing about 80% into it. Starts talking about Kaons and the varieties. Clearly important stuff, but not explained clearly. A simple summary chart would help. Enjoyable sum,wry though. It is out of date so keeps promising results from LHC. Obviously Higgs is the big news from last year but it would be useful to know if some of the other research suggested bore fruit in the intervening years. "
13,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15643804-gustav-ton-r,5,"Even though the fundamental building blocks described in this book are hard to relate to in everyday life, trying to figure them out will lead to a better understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe. This matters! (Pun intended)"
14,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15243815-christopher-byram,3,"I discovered the Very Short Introductions book series from a video on YouTube, uploaded by the channel Tibees, entitled ""Books for Learning Physics"". In the video, the narrator, Toby Hendy, a mathematics and physics graduate, is present with a guest, David Gozzard, who also has a background in physics. David mentions the Very Short Introductions book series which gives a (very short) introduction on a wide range of topics, such as business management or Islam, and that for physics, you can get the books in the series that are on physics itself, nuclear physics, particle physics, quantum mechanics and cosmology. He claims that there are over 400 of these books, and they are very small, you can read them in a few hours and pick them up for about $13. The books on physics do not go into the maths behind the physics, but they give you a very brief overview of the concepts and where the science is today. This book series is good to get you started on a subject that you do not have a background in."
15,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22669210-austin,2,"Perhaps the subject is too complex for this format, but I found the material impossible to follow. Particle Physics seems to be, for the most part, a collection of empirically verified facts about different particles and their characteristics, with little in the way of elegant theory to tie it all together (A recurring stanza through the book was something like: ""Why is X Fact true? We currently don't know.""). As such, it seems like the way the material is organized is of utmost importance for its intelligibility. I did not think the author did I great job organizing the material, and thus found the book extremely hard to follow. It was telling when I would read the same passage several times and still have no idea what it was talking about, only to read a short explanation on Google and have it click."
16,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4575101-charisse,5,"Outstanding Overview of Particle PhysicsI've always loved cosmology but didn't know much about particle physics. I figured I needed a primer and this was it. Now I'm completely fascinated by it. The author has the ability to explain concepts in a clear, succinct, and organized yet interesting way. It wasn't dry and neither was it simplistic. It still evokes a sense of wonder. I would say that it's not really a ""Very Short"" guide for the lay person. It provides a good amount of detail--enough that it will eventually answer many of the questions you'll have while reading it. "
17,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90757488-aleksandar-ovnarski,5,"I have to admit that ""Nothing: a short introduction"" was so mind-blowing-blowing that I felt inspired to go through everything else the author wrote. This introduction is especially useful in getting a sense of scale (much like Tyson's books on astronomy), and it is easy to understand up to about the middle of the book. From that point on, it gets more difficult. Understanding the subatomic world simply does not come naturally to a human mind (maybe because of the Savannah principle), but no matter how far your effort takes you, it is worth it. "
18,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,3," I really enjoy Oxford's Very Short Introduction series but this is the weakest one have read. Its serviceable, because it does what it says on the tin, but it is very dry compared to other books in this series I have read. Maybe the subject is a bit ""too basic"" to make it seem like anything more than a textbook. "
19,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9348981-matthew,5,"This is an excellent summary of what we know, what we don't know, and what we're trying to know when it comes to the relatively modern branch of science known as particle physics. I'll admit some of the concepts went over my unpracticed mind, but overall the author does a fantastic job of explaining this branch of science that many would say is difficult to learn."
20,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869795-steve-mitchell,3,"My copy is a little out of date - the CERN Large Hadron Collider and it’s confirmation of the existence of the Higgs boson are written in the future tense - but was still worth a read. It does get a little equation heavy towards the end and you need to bear in mind what Niels Bohr said, that If you’re not shocked by it then you haven't understood it."
21,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26822735-francis-m-van-meter,4,Fairly good insight into particle physics I enjoyed this book which develops the view of particle physics however it would be high desirable to have it updated with the current findings from the CERN LHC.
22,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28247256-daniel,5,"The book describes the historical background of particle physics studies, from its conception to the knowledge we had circa 2012. The book gives a brief description of the atom, what are they made up from (electron, proton and neutron). However, the particle hunt does not end there and later pages we are introduced to quarks, bosons, leptons and other particles in the standard model. While it gives a glimpse of the particles what I found interesting was the engineering aspects of the particle hunt (i.e., how they are detected). The book gives a very gentle introduction to the history of particle detection up to the beginnings of 2010 and finishes the book with a speculative feature on exotic matters and questions for the future scientists.I highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in science and physics."
23,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6429894-jayson-virissimo,3,"This was pretty boring (to me), since it doesn't really discuss potential technological applications of the physics."
24,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79025569-adarsh-agarwal,4,great for introduction to the topics very easy to understand and had fun reading it
25,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91959845-mrwan-mohey,4,It's a good book for physics students and people who have a quite good background on particle physics but if you are an ordinary reader you will have problems with understanding the information.
26,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47462423-ronah,5,"Well-written, clear and concise. This book is good as a starting point for particle physics if you don't have or has little background about atomic physics."
27,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108501431-ivan,4,A good place to start with the subject of particle physics. Very readable if you have no prior knowledge but think in a structured way.
28,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77744562-brian-bakker,4,"I learned several things from reading this. I learned a bit about particles, about particle research and accelerations, etc. I also learned that I need visual aids to really understand the level of quarks or baryons; which I did right after reading this, so it made for a fine introduction."
29,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16966766-pramod-pant,4,Fascinating ! Particularly for someone like me who's not formally educated in physics and mathematics.
30,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,4,"This I found to be an excellent introduction to particle physics. The enthusiasm of the author for his subject comes across very strongly and Frank Close, who is a Professor of Physics at Oxford University, is obviously very knowledgeable about particle physics. In what is a short volume (part of the ""A Very Short Introduction"" series) he covers a lot of ground in a clear manner and without the need for any mathematics. Close was able to explain some concepts to me, a non-physicist, with much better clarity than other authors have achieved. Topics covered include the particles and forces of the Standard Model, anti-matter and the Big Bang. The chapter entitled ""How big and small are big and small?"" includes some fascinating comparisons which make one appreciate the dimensions, masses and energies of particles.For my liking, Close devoted too much space, namely a whole chapter, to the different accelerators used to investigate particles, such as cyclotrons and synchrotrons, and explaining the advantages and disadvantages of linear versus circular accelerators. Likewise, the next chapter exclusively covered the detectors used to pick up evidence of particles and particle collisions. This was like a history lesson in the equipment used in particle physics, which to my mind detracted from the main theme of the book. Consequently, I merely skimmed through these two chapters. Of course, this is my personal opinion and other readers may find this sort of information more absorbing than I did.The final chapter is entitled ""Questions for the 21st Century"" in which Close speculates on the nature of dark matter, supersymmetry, massive neutrinos, mass (Higgs boson), quark gluon plasmas and the possibility of multi-dimensional universes. As the book was published in 2004, and I have read it nine years later, I'm left wondering what progress there has been in those nine years in these areas, over and above the well-publicised, probable discovery of the Higgs boson.As well as an index (which is not necessary in the Kindle version I read) the book usefully includes a glossary of terms."
31,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19200150-david-roberts,4,"The book I read to research this post was Particle Physics A Very Short Introduction by Frank Close which is a very good book which I bought from kindle. This book is part of a series of approximately 300 which get an expert in a field to write roughly 150 pages as an introduction to their subject. They are generally fairly although this book is quite complex in places. It is interesting though especially the stuff on colliders like the one at CERN in Geneva which is 27 km long and underground and uses powerful to bend atoms which are sent around a kind of circular tunnel and made collide with each other. They do this kind of thing to find what comprises an atom, make anti matter and also make plasma. Plasma is a state of matter in much the same way as a liquid or gas except it is super heated by something like a star and contains free flowing electrons. If nucleus of an atom was magnified to the extent it was visible to the human eye, the atom would be 10,000 km across. Most of an atom is comprised of nothingness. This is good because a nucleus is extremely dense for its size. There is also a kind of straight tunnel underground at Stanford University in California that is 7 km long where atoms are fired down and smashed together at high velocity. In the case of most atoms, the nucleus is relatively stable and these tend to have a fairly small nucleus with an equal amount of positive and negative charges. Where we get large nucleus's with different amounts of positive and negative charges, the element decays and gradually turns into something else which is a radio active substance. Not all elements occur in abundance in the Earth's crust, astatine for example has a total amount of less than 1 ounce and generally has to be manufactured in a laboratory. Atoms are also in a constant flux of being recycled and the atoms you are made from have only been in that form for a relatively short period but are as old as the planet and are 1/3 as old as the universe. I did find this book very interesting and enjoyed reading it."
32,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,5,"If you're looking for a clearer understanding of what the scientists at CERN are up to - or perhaps you just have an urge to know your baryon from your meson - this is the book to buy. I've read quite a few of the Very Short Introductions, on all sort of topics, and author Frank Close is to be commended for making Particle Physics one of the very best. It's concise, inspiring, crammed with facts (rather than opinions) and not so advanced as to curtail the beginner's attempt to gain a foothold. In short, it's the ideal very short introduction. The author begins with a string of irresistible facts (""Look at the dot at the end of this sentence - its ink contains some 100 billion atoms of carbon"") - exactly the kind of information that, for me at least, never fails to fascinate. This lays the groundwork nicely for what follows: one by one, Frank explains in clear layman's terms each of the fundamental particles and forces of the universe. It's all set out more clearly than I've read anywhere else, and the author is savvy enough to appreciate the reader's learning curve (as section headings like 'How do we know this?' demonstrate). He explains the spin and charge of a quark, something that has long been a mystery to me. Pions, kaons, muons, neutrinos, strange quarks and all the other exotic-sounding ingredients of the universe are covered. Finally he ends with a chapter detailing those areas of particle physics on which scientists are hoping to shed more light - the Higgs field, antimatter, supersymmetry, and so on. I have no criticisms at all about this excellent little book. Highly recommendeded."
33,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2030200-bj-rose,4,"I am not a scientist, and I have only a basic understanding of physics. So altho this is A Very Short Introduction to particle physics, it's still contains strong elements of an unknown foreign language to me.And I was doing fine until the formulas started coming in chapter 4! The most significant thing I recall after that is that anti-matter destroys matter in a flash of light, and that positrons are destroyed when they collide with electrons. But that's OK - that I didn't get that much out of some of the chapters, I mean! The good news for me is that this was an audiobook, so I can (and will) go back to it again to see what else I can glean from it.What I learned from this book (so far):Quarks and electrons are the seeds of matter on earthQuarks cluster together in threesThe fundamental structure of the atom is beyond imaginingAtoms from a long-dead supernova made you and meThat's not a bad list - and maybe I'll add to it as I listen again. I especially want to re-do chapter 8, which he titled ""Exotic Matter and Anti-Matter"" to see if I can hear (and understand) the answer to the question: where did all the anti-matter go?"

This edition is definitely in need of an update as it refers to the excitement of the LHC experiments which are to begin in 2007. Nevertheless it is exceptional in its clarity, and detailing the vast range of the particle zoo and the domains of how they interact. Particle physics and quantum cosmology is a fascinating relationship and reading about this throughout the text is a rewarding experience as the reader works through to development a full appreciation of our very existence. Highly recommended before reading any other text on the subject. "

There are just too many particles and it gets confusing and I never knew up from down or strange from charm anymore. This book though. This book fucking gets it. Very clear, very informative. I'll probably pick up a few others from this series, in hopes they will be the same level of quality.Also: the pocket-size was a nice touch.

38,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648632-ned,2,"Unlike most of the OUP's excellent ""Very Short Introduction"" series, this particular volume was very poorly written. There were several examples of non-sentences masquerading as sentences. One gets the distinct impression the author became tired of writing the book a little past the half-way mark, an exhaustion surpassed only by the reader's fatigue in trying to parse her way through the clumsily assembled miscellania of questionably related facts and slapdash sentences. "
39,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35523735-jon-jacobs,5,"This is one of my favorite books. I've read it about five times in the last several years and I learn more every time I read it.One can read it once at get more insight into the world of particle physics than should be possible. For someone of my, admittedly, limited intellectual acumen re-reading this fine book will provide a nice working knowledge of one of the coolest topics mankind has ever looked into."
40,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2008769-philip,4,Does what it says on the tin. A very comprehensive overview of particle physics given the small size of the book. Well worth reading if you're interested in particle physics.Only criticism is that sometimes an idea will be introduced very quickly and then used as if second nature. This isn't a book designed to read in one sitting!
41,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23748469-krollo,4,"This is a gem of a book. Admittedly, when one attempts to explain the entirety of particle physics from scratch in 130 pages, there is going to be some loss of clarity. On the whole, the book was readable, but as the going got tough towards the end I seemed to lose my way. It's a great book for what it is, but I'd recommend something a little bigger for the added comprehension."
42,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917720-gordon,2,"Sure, it covered a lot of complex material in a short space, but the writing was pretty terrible, and the approach seemed weak - spending too much time in the middle discussing the technologies of various equipment - accelerators, colliders etc. Then no doubt the large number of matter and anti-matter particles gets pretty overwhelming to cover in a sensible, and short, way."
43,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39042450-flappers-66,5,Great ExplanationsFrank Close presents this tricky subject with clarity and takes us into how the theories have been probed and proven using ever higher resolutions- that is - at higher energies. He leaves you with a much better feel for how this all hangs together - very readable.
44,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39626536-violeta-vornicu,4,"Surprisingly, this booklet offers a lot more than many thick text books I have read on the subject; it's packed with useful information and it largely covers all important aspects. The chapters, I believe, are very well structured. If one assimilates all the infomation this book contains, he can say he knows some particle physics! Nice."
45,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3059906-neil,3,I'm not done with this book yet. However...A bit simplistic in the first few chapters and sadly lacking in diagrams that would have helped considerably for people new to physics. It is now quite out of date now that the LHC is running. The book needs updating IMHO.
46,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5482641-michael,4,"The title pretty much sums up what I was looking for in this book, and also exactly what I got out of it. I docked it a star because the later chapters start to gloss over advanced material, but the beginning is a perfect explanation of the basics of the subject."
47,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,3,"A good book, on the whole, and engagingly written. It suffers, as so many popular science books do, from veering between being too easy and general to being too detailed and hard to follow, but it does what it says on the cover."
48,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36218190-john-martin,3,"Overall a pleasant read. The book is a novel attempt at describing particle physics without the use of advanced mathematics. As the title state it is a ""very short introduction"", however I sometimes thought that the auther should have elaborated on some topics. "
49,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"A very good overview. Not too watered down, as many popular physics books sadly tend to be."
50,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,5,Frank Close deserves your respect.
51,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4762834-george,3,Found this book helpful in explaining W bosons in relation to quantum theory. I will still have to do more reading on colour charges and positrons (which do seem very interesting.)
52,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/954432-angela,3,too much history of physicists and not enough theory or explanation of principle for my taste. 
53,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3122769-sam-bruskin,5,great! exactly what it says. v timely for discovery of higgsand explaining to friends what you already know.
54,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/634204-debra,3,"I know more now than I did before...even if I didn't understand all of it. Useful, interesting and mainly comprehensible to the non-science person."
55,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7944471-jan,4,A good book to keep on hand as a quick reference and refresher. Was referred by another reader and would pass that reference on.
56,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201179-daniel-wright,3,"Up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. All this and more. It is... what you are made of."
57,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5152233-roddy,3,First third of the book was interesting but then things got very dry as the symbols and abstract text took over.
58,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33332540-fares-d-alahmar,3,"Very informative, but too complicated to be called a short introduction.."
59,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38729971-faisal,3,"Good introduction for particle physics.However, I would not recommend it for people with no little knowledge about modern physics."
60,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5254180-atti,5,a very good introduction to the basics of particle physics
61,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44260361-adrian-rorheim,4,Great basic overview of a fascinating topic.
62,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52268212-anna,4,Useful and informative
63,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68275539-navid-aliakbarian,5,I fell in love with physics by this book. 
64,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13088772-pamela,4,An interesting & solid introduction to particle physics
65,0192804340,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1370029-julian-onions,4,Good - but the material is dating quite quickly - although there is a Higgs update.
