0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,2,"Here is my dilemma; I truly did enjoy reading this book. Every page of it. But the author seems to be schizophrenic. In the beginning of the book Barabasi shows that so many seemingly random events behave, not as from a Poisson distribution, but obey a power law distribution, instead. This is very interesting; so many events in our lives and in nature, occur in bursts, rather than at random intervals in time. But then the author starts a historical outline of a revolution attempt that occurred in Hungary, in the year 1514. He alternates sections between contemporary life; to-do lists, productivity, homeland security, the Internet--and a story that occurred 500 years ago. Fully a third of the book is dedicated to this intriguing story. But at the end of the book, there is no credible linkage between the theme of the Hungarian revolution attempt and the main theme of the book. Well, the author attempts to correlate the 16th-century predictions of Telgedi with the modern problem of predicting future events. It just doesn't tie together.Barabasi bemoans the fact that predicting future events is difficult because human dynamics are so complex. That would have sounded reasonable to me a month ago, but at the same time I was reading this book, I was also reading ""The Predictioneer's Game"" by Bruce Bueno De Mesquita. De Mesquita claims (and backs up his claims) that using game theory, he can predict future political, economic, diplomatic, judicial, and commercial events with 90% accuracy. But Barabasi makes no reference to the game theory approach--he does not even mention it to refute its credibility. I like Barabasi's writing style--I gave his previous book, ""Linked"" a 5-star rating. But ""Bursts"" just makes me feel like a pinball."

Unfortunately, my initial impression was correct, and this is a magazine article pretending to be a book.The basic idea - that most human activity occurs in short, concentrated bursts - is interesting enough, but all the author's supporting evidence could have fit into about three pages. The alternating chapters may be interesting to someone really into Eastern European history, but to me they read like someone who corners you at a party and wants to tell you all about his fascinating ancestry (one of the historical figures is an ancestor of the author). These parts of the book don't do much to hold up the thesis, and seem spliced in more for the author's own enjoyment that for any kind of clarity or evidence.I may still give his earlier book a try, since it sounds like it's more scientifically rigorous, but my dislike of this one has pushed it way down on my reading list."
2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2131722-kevin,2,"People do things in bursts. As opposed to randomly or sequentially and organized. So ... that's the book. Ok ... bye.To the author's credit, some ideas don't show value until others start making use of them. This was an idea he was putting out there that he had discovered which comes from deep inside our biology. Our molecules act in bursts. Animals are bursty. Humans, bursty. Our habits, also bursty. The value to this will be left to those that can monetize it, I guess. Best of luck to ya'll.Uhm ... oh, so it's a valid idea, right? But the book doesn't give an idea about what to do with it. Right after I read this book, I read an economic article about how people were out of ideas. About how the economic growth rate was basically because of a few great inventions, but that's over now and we'll go back to centuries of near 0% economic growth. Until ... another ... burst of invention and ideas. Neat, eh? The article wasn't written about the book. It was mutually exclusive. Just happened to converge.So, instead of one star, I gave it two because if we understand our natural bursty behavior, we can make better predictions. Ones that aren't based on expecting randomness or expecting organized sequences. "

Very uninformative. Two stars is potentially generous."
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5615695-jesse-goodsell,4,"Albert-laszlo Barabasi the Author of ""Bursts"" asks the question: ""Can human behavior be predicted by applying the quantum physics principles of the Dispersion Theory of Particles?"" If the answer is yes, then the trajectory of disease, ideas, innovation, and human activity could be predicted with a reasonable amount of confidence.The book weaves the story of a medieval hungarian knight, who when appointed to lead a crusade to the Holy land, turns his army of peasants against the Hungarian nobility with probalilty, mathematics and physics theories.The author's theory of Bursts is rooted in Albert Einstein's ideas on the dispersion of particles. In a 1905 paper, Eisnstein correctly predicted that particles typically move in a back and forth, zigzag motion and the typical particle would move a distance proportional to the square root of the time elasped since its release. Described in another way, the motion and distance of a specific particle cannot be predicted, but the mean or average of particles movement can be predicted. The typical particle will travel a certain distances in a certain amount of time. Quadrupal the amount of time and in the typical particle will not travel four times farther but twice the distance from its release point.In addition to Einstein's Dispersion theory, the book introduces the reader briefly but effectively to Poisson distributions, Gaussian dristributions, power laws, Levy flight, the random walk, entropy, outliers, predictability and several other mathematical models and theories. These models or theories can be used to predict human behavior if human behavior is termed random rather than unpredictable.The book worked for me. I would have preferred deeper explanations of the theories and models described in the book. The story of the medeival knight was interesting but was not germaine to the subject of the book. The book was easy to read and provided a good introduction to the way consumer behavior is being predicted by corporate merchants and internet providers. The message is that our behavior can be predicted with a very accuratly and there is no longer any privacy unless we are an ""outlier"" in the probability models or we do not use the internet, credit cards, telephones and that we used random number generators to make our decisions.We need to find out how to predict our own behavior so we cut down on our mistakes. In that the companies that have developed the methods to make such predictions are strictly guarded secrets, it would not appear that will happen soon."

While the concept of ""bursts"" as a pattern to explain much of human activity over time is interesting it just doesn't seem to resonate like the power laws of the last book did. Also found the constant switching back and forth between the present time and some of the historical stories a bit annoying and staged. There were many interesting bits throughout the book but I came away wishing it had just been written with less affectation and more directness."

We are also introduced to the concept of the power law, and in the end it is determined that ""Hey we just can not predict human behavior but we do believe that it might one day become an easier task than we all currently think"". Barabasi throughout manages to keep everything very entertaining with random jumps (Get it? BURSTS?) back and forth between a crusader uprising against the nobility in the 16th century to modern studies of the Albatross (A huge freaking bird) to Hasan Elahi (A modern artist mistaken for a terrorist by homeland security).SPOILER ALERT:The ending scene where Gyorgy Dozsa Szekely is tortured is something out of a hell realm from a Clive Barker novel. I was expecting the Hell Priest of the Cenobites to make a cameo halfway through the horrendous torture Szekely was forced to endure by the twisted hellish minds of Transylvania's ""nobility"". Seriously these people were extremely f*cked up. I can see why someone like Vlad the Impaler came from these parts.

It's rather aome kind of a non fiction novel that tells what it means to be a scientist and especially a social scientist.

Pagine 323. 19,34 $ Letto subito dopo la sua uscita, nella primavera-estate del 2010, ma poi non recensito.Barabási è un fisico di origine ungherese, nato in Transilvania nella comunità Székely. Questo ne spiega, anche se non ne giustifica, l’acceso nazionalismo: gli ungheresi ritendono, forse a ragione, di essere stati penalizzati nel trattato di Trianon, al termine della 1ª guerra mondiale, a vantaggio della Romania. Il suo nome è legato soprattutto alla teoria delle reti, e in particolare delle scale-free networks, di cui trattava il suo precedente volume destinato al pubblico non specialistico, Linked: The New Science Of Networks (Link. La scienza delle reti). Quando l’ho letto, una decina d’anni fa, nella torrida estate del 2003, ne sono stato fortemente e favorevolmente colpito. Mi era anche capitato, per motivi professionale, di leggere qualche cosa di più tecnico e più accademico di Barabási, che ormai guardavo con ammirazione e rispetto.Bursts ha in parte tradito le mie aspettative e vedo, dalle recensioni che si trovano in rete, che non sono il solo. Il problema è che, in questo libro, Barabási divaga in continuazione. Non che questo mi spiaccia: anzi, mi diverte molto e mi ci riconosco anche. Però, in tutto questo divagare, rischia di perdersi il messaggio principale: è questo che – nonostante i molti riferimenti al libro che costellano questo blog (a proposito della trilogia di John Twelve Hawks, ma anche di un suo articolo sulla “rete dei sapori” pubblicato su Nature) – mi aveva finora dissuaso dalla recensione.La tesi centrale di Bursts è che i comportamenti umani siano caratterizzati da bursts, esplosioni di attività all’interno di lunghi periodi di (relativa) quiete (il titolo del libro è tradotto in italiano Lampi, ma mi sembra renda meno di scoppi o esplosioni; allora forse meglio sprazzi). Pensate a come rispondete ai vostri messaggi di posta elettronica: benché i messaggi vi arrivino pressoché di continuo, soprattutto se ne ricevete molti dall’estero e dunque la loro cadenza non è influenzato dai ritmi circadiani del posto in cui vivete, è probabile che tendiate a limitare alcuni momenti della vostra giornata a rispondere. Il perché è molto semplice: le cose da fare sono tante, il tempo è poco. Perciò, istintivamente, date alle cose da fare delle priorità; e quelle che non ricadono tra quelle prioritarie, spesso giacciono inevase: per giorni, per mesi, per sempre.Paradossalmente, proprio perché bursts e priorità sono ineluttabili, prevedere il comportamento umano è più facile, non più difficile.Our tasks and responsibilities are poised to queue thanks to a shortage of time. If we could simultaneously work on an arbitrary number of tasks, no one would need a priority list. Time is our most valuable nonrenewable resource, and if we want to treat it with respect, we need to set priorities. Once we do that, power laws and burstiness become unavoidable. [posizione Kindle 1822]Peccato che questi due importanti messaggi, esposti con chiarezza e rigore, si disperdano in un libro che fa del detour la sua cifra.Tanto per cominciare, oltre metà del libro (14 capitoli su 28, cui vanno aggiunte 15 immagini originali dell’artista transilvano Botond Reszegh: «There is a theorem in publishing that each graph halves a book’s audience. Its corollary for e-books: Each image halves the number of devices that can properly display it.», pos. 4468) è dedicata alla storia di un eroe Székely, Dózsa György alias György Székely che, se non ricordo male, non ha moltissimo a che fare con il suo tema principale. Fino allo spaventoso supplizio del trono incandescente che vedete raffigurato qui sotto.upload.wikimedia.org/wikipediaCondivido largamente, a questo punto, la recensione di Clive Thompson sul Wall Street Journal del 30 aprile 2010:Mr. Barabási worries that burstiness makes us trackable online by corporations and government, particularly as digital tools like mobile phones produce records of our goings and doings.This is genuinely fascinating stuff, and when he focuses on the science, Mr. Barabási is a superbly clear writer. But science constitutes a surprisingly small fraction of “Bursts.” Mr. Barabási spends much of the book delivering real-life stories that are supposed to illustrate his principles. Some, like an account of Albert Einstein’s correspondence in 1919 with a little-known scientist, neatly illustrate how bursts govern our lives. But other stories aren’t so successful— particularly Mr. Barabási’s elaborate account of how a Crusade in 16th-century Hungary turned into a gore-splattered civil war. On its own, the Hungarian conflict makes a riveting story, but Mr. Barabási devotes more than a quarter of the book to its telling—yet never convincingly connects the tale to his theme. It became, for me, a maddening distraction. In the end, Mr. Barabási has written a thought-provoking book. But the most rewarding passages appear only, as it were, in bursts.* * *Naturalmente, data la classe di Barabási, il libro è colmo di riflessioni e spunti interessanti (consueti riferimenti alla posizione Kindle):[…] exploding prevalence […] [552]We live in a data-rich world.Putting these data to lucrative use propels the development of further technologies that aim to discover even more about each of us. [555]Once again, the truth failed to cooperate […] [951]The problem wasn’t his method but his data. [981]In 2007, eleven years after its initial discovery, the Lévy character of animal foraging was no longer considered a hypothesis but a well-established scientific fact and had inspired hundreds of publications by ecologists, animal researchers, mathematicians, and physicists. Thus the entire scientific community was shocked when they read that year’s October 25 issue of Nature: a paper coauthored by Edwards, Sergey, and many others concluded that any likeness the path of the wandering albatrosses had to a Lévy trajectory was an artifact of the measurements. [2541]Science itself often follows a Lévy pattern—a huge jump ahead is trailed by many small, localized steps that appear to take us nowhere, or perhaps even backward in some instances. These are not wasted moves, however, but necessary to testing the boundaries of the new paradigm. [2608]Predictably UnpredictableSince the publication in 2005 of The Traveler, a New Age “high-tech paranoid-schizophrenic thriller” with an Orwellian twist, a peculiar debate has absorbed cyberspace. The book takes us into a world where life is free of crises and surprises, a world of ennui-inducing normality. This peace and apparent security is maintained by a worldwide system of computers called the Vast Machine, fed by millions of surveillance cameras, sensors, and detectors. Only the members of a once-powerful ancient society and their sword-carrying protectors, the Harlequins, are aware of the Vast Machine’s reach and are willing to stand up to it.The ongoing debate this book continues to inspire on blogs and bulletin boards alike might easily focus on the eerie parallels between our own post-9/11 society and the tightly monitored world described in it. But it does not. It might also center on the book’s literary merits, except that, as one critic put it, the writing “is pitched to perhaps a seventh-grade reading level,” an assessment few would challenge. The debate is instead about John Twelve Hawks, its author.The blockbuster sales and movie rights ought to have elevated Hawks to national celebrity, putting him among the likes of Stephen King and Dan Brown. Yet they did not. And it isn’t because the media shuns him either. The real reason that you never hear about Hawks is that nobody seems to know him. He does not sign books and does not participate in promotional tours. In fact, he has never been seen in public and supposedly communicates even with his editor only through an untraceable satellite phone. Just like the Harlequins on perpetual run from the Vast Machine, John Twelve Hawks lives off the grid, a paranoid seclusion that fuels ongoing speculation regarding his true identity.The book’s central character is a Harlequin who preserves her off-the-grid anonymity by never using credit cards, opening bank accounts, or staying at permanent addresses. Aware that “any habitual action that showed a Harlequin taking a daily, predictable route to some location” will allow the Vast Machine to predict her whereabouts, she “cultivates randomness.” That is, she relies on a random-number generator, or RNG, to guide her decisions. “An odd number might mean Yes, an even number No. Push a button, and the RNG will tell you which door to enter,” freeing her actions from predictable patterns.The book is a tale of a battle between good and evil that takes us briefly into something like that fifth dimension Theodor Kaluza proposed to Einstein, throwing into the mix Japanese sword fights and quantum computing. It also again begs the question, could one build a Vast Machine that foresees our actions?We find it perfectly acceptable that particle physicists can predict within a picometer of accuracy the trajectory of a proton or that rocket scientists can launch a satellite that nine months later drops a robot on Mars. Unlike protons or satellites, however, humans tend to seek new experiences in a continually changing world, making it impossible to foresee their long-term actions. Indeed, given my hectic travel schedule, until recently I found any attempt to predict my whereabouts a few weeks in advance to be a hopeless exercise, fueling my hope that the Vast Machine will always stay where it belongs—in the realm of science fiction. Lately, however, I have begun to have my doubts. [2761: la mia recensione alla trilogia è qui]Given how impenetrable our past has become, perhaps it’s no small wonder that our future is uncertain. [2976]Today each person doing research on human dynamics increasingly faces a similar dilemma: How do we avoid contributing to the creation of a surveillance state or conglomerate, a back-to-the-future ticket to Orwell’s 1984?Hasan has a refreshing answer to this question.“Intelligence agencies, regardless of who they are, all operate in an industry where their commodity is information,” he observes. “The reason their information has value,” he adds, “is because no one has access to it.”His solution? Give it up, and it becomes worthless. “It is the secrecy applied to the information that makes it valuable,” he says. And with that, he joins the Szeklers and hides in plain sight, pouring his life out onto his Web site. [3215]As we have seen, predicting an individual’s behavior is getting steadily easier. And the future is far more valuable than the past, as our travel and purchasing plans are possibly the most potent commodity in our economy. And while secure firewalls and privacy laws protect our pasts, our futures, predicted by sophisticated algorithms, are up for grabs. With that we arrive at a new paradigm I call prospective privacy. It boils down to this: Who owns the information about our future actions and behavior? Who should profit from it? [3244]But no physicist has ever successfully predicted the trajectory of 10^23 molecules in a gas, either, and that hasn’t stopped us from predicting the gas’s pressure and temperature—arguably far more important than the trajectory of each individual molecule. The same is true for human dynamics. Our deep-rooted unpredictability does not need to bubble up at the level of the society. If we carefully distinguish the random from the predictable, we might be able to foresee many features of the social fabric. [3711]Any discussion about privacy is a discussion about trade-offs. Giving up the privacy of our medical records may allow the insurance companies to refuse coverage, but not sharing the data could limit the quality of the medical care we receive and thwart research toward the development of better cures. Giving up information about our shopping habits may be perceived by some as an uncomfortable loss of privacy, but others are more than willing to part with it for free or discounted services. Giving up information about our employment history and communication patterns may expose us to potential criminal investigation, but may also reward us with higher security and decrease our chances of being caught in a criminal activity or terrorist attack.

12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18766868-murwan,3,"Interesting book, the author is hunting an answer for the human predictability two questions: are human beings predictable, and if yes to what extent. The author ventured (seems like one of his habits) from seemingly unrelated topics and accounts to weave an argument that makes his point, which in this case we are predictably unpredictable, and the sweet spot of behavior that allows that is what so called bursts. The account is basically bursting with stories as you keep folding the pages, from Hasan Elahi, to Gyogry and Telgadi, to how his last name plateaued (after dropping l from it) and all over the place pieces. Not only it is difficult to keep the stitches of this dress but you almost want to shrug it off because of its heaviness, and non-relatedness to me, as I am not interested in the 1514 Hungary revolution. But that does not come at a surprise if you read the linked book, the author almost wanted to say the whole graph theory thing is ""Made in Hungary"", I don't mind a little bit of patriotism here and there but too much salt is not fun.  Sia, the Australian pop singer, does not like to appear in her video cause she doesn't want her art to be shadowed by her existence, and Barbasi sun blinded me.

And much more that I’ve already forgotten. But all this for the insight that we, humans (and animals and proteins etc.) don’t work steadily or efficiently or consistently, but rather in bursts of activity. Work measured over time comes in bursts. It’s still not clear to me how this was related to the historical writing on Hungary in the 1500s — great writing that perhaps should have been its own book. Not recommended."

As part of his discussion of the difficulty, but not impossibility, of predicting human behavior and events.Along with this is mixed the author's opinions of diminishing privacy in the age of cellphones and big data.While I did read this to the end, I give it halfhearted praise for keeping my interest and providing education.

I was wrong, there were many hours were I could have really used a book, specially the long train ride between Copenhagen and Stockholm, and the flight from Stockholm to NY. Only there, with just a small connecting flight to Toronto left, I ventured to the bookstore and hastily favored this book, despite the uninspiring reviews on the back cover, the words ""network science"" got my eye.Barabasi's uses one common technique in science popularization: telling the tale of how the discovery was made, getting you acquainted with the scientists as persons. And he unashamedly abuses another technique: telling story or an anecdote that is related to the scientific principle in question.And he has several major problems with this second technique. First, the relation between the story he tells, and his theory of bursty behaviour is practically non-existing, you could random mention any other example, a soccer match, the hot dog industry, Caetano Veloso's last album, and chances are you'll be able to relate it to the Burst theory in a more smooth and natural way. Another problem is that he abuses the technique by filling at least half of the book with the story of Gyorgy Szekely. And the last problem is that it is only 3/4s into the book that he bothers to disclose what is his alleged connection between the history of Hungarian revolts and his theory.But oh well, now the positives: It does help that he truly, genuinely cares about history. The scene where he goes to the archives of Nagyszeben in order to see with his own eyes one letter written in 1507 as part of his investigation really makes me empathize with him. I do too, feel the thrill and wonder of having in front of your eyes paper documents redacted at a time where the world as we know it today was beyond imaginable! Also, the history of Gyorgy Szekely, and impact on the outcome of eastern vs. western civilization's struggle is nothing less than fascinating, even if the description of his torture, gave me nightmares for days. Using internet I did look at Gyorgy's sculpture at Budapest's art gallery, and really wished I had known this history when I was in Budapest in 2005, barely 2 years before the visit to the archives Barabasi describes. And finally, it does help that Barabasi himself is a supposed direct descendant of one of the main protagonist of the historic drama.One more positive thing, he does use this second technique effectively when dealing with Einstein's correspondence with a young scientist about multiple dimensions (Kalussa, who reportedly swam succesfully after simply reading a book oto teach himself), when talking about the artist who grew himself an ear in his arm, about the incorrect conviction of a man accused of rape and the related reliability of jurors, when talking about why kids don't get sick when reading Harry Potter. And Finally, I fell like a fool with his description of Lifelinear, I even told Theban at work, before doing further progress and having to come back with my tail between my legs to report back that it was a hoax. Bottom line, I would have bought 2 different books: one with the history of the XVI century revolts and later demise of Bohemia, Hungary and Transylvania, and a very short one about his theory of burst. But there again, that's not the way you pitch your idea to a publisher.Now, scientist usually complain when tabloids oversimplify and misinterpret their research with headlines such as ""scientist find gene that makes you a cheater!"", but Barabasi actually indulges heavily into doing that himself, whith statements such as ""predicting the future"", becoming his own PR pimp. I know selling science books to the wide audience requires compromises, but still it left me very uneasy, it felt a tad sleazy.His theory of burst is worth a more detailed analysis with some rigor, I'll post it on my cognitive science site."

One minute you're reading about 16th century crusades, and the next it's about modern day nationwide digital surveillance invading your privacy.This book will certainly be enjoyed by specific persons in specific fields, but I, alas, am not one of them. It was an alright read for me, with little bits of new information here and there, as well as some general gossip, but that's about it. The book more or less covers bursty patterns as a general thing as well as networks, these two things being it's main focus. It contains quite the history lesson too."
33,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893559-larry-gallagher,2,"I'm torn in my opinions. The book was well written, the prose flowing, even a ""page turner"" in places. The content is an odd hybrid of popular-press level discourse on patterns in human behavior juxtaposed with a dramatic narrative of a 16th century Hungarian rebellion. As other reviewers have noted, in spite of the author's attempt to link the two, the book could have done quite well without all of the space devoted to the rebellion.Regarding the scientific meat of the book - the author left me wanting more. It's one thing to say ""yes, in the aggregate people are largely predictable."" Then he takes it a step further and distinguishes between Gaussian, exponential, and power-law distributions and how each applies to particular situations. But - and this is my main disappointment - there was never an ""aha!"" moment of discovering something truly novel. In the last chapter in particular, the author suggests that ""burstiness"" in everything from RNA synthesis to the migration of populations hints as some ""universal laws"", but falls short of identifying the specific model. To my mind these could simply be the superposition of two simpler processes (say, two Poisson processes with different parameters) - what's the big deal? In that sense I feel like this book was released before its time, before the author has really had a chance to consolidate his research and show how ""burstiness"" across situations derives from a common, understandable model/dynamic. To use another example, we see oscillating phenomena everywhere (pendulums, population dynamics, business cycles), and one can see at the heart of each of these the same relatively simple dynamic model. I'd like to see the author tie the threads together from his ""bursiness"" examples into a single, coherent explanation, but it's not there yet.Make no mistake, I believe the author's research is incredibly important, and I look forward to future output from his research group. For those who are more casually curious about the dynamics of human behavior, this book is an easy and entertaining introduction."

(Who doesn't want to be smarter?) But in the end, I kept with it because it was so gosh-darn entertaining. There are several things going for this book. One is that the author is very good at writing. He has an engaging style that makes reading his book FUN. It was great when out of the blue he would illustrate what he was trying to explain with a funny yet clearly relevant example. (""You must read fast, as this chapter may soon become irrelevant..."") Later, while explaining redundancy, he wrote a footnote saying, ""English has 50 percent redundancy, which means that about hlf of th ltrs o ths txt ca be dletd and w cold stll dcipr is mnig."" :DAnother thing that I personally liked about this book is that the author is Hungarian, like myself. Although he lives and works in the United States, he has family in Transylvania and speaks fluent Hungarian. Luckily for me, he is also familiar with Hungary's history (which I, to my embarrassment, am not.) His familiarity with Hungarian history resulted in chapters that described his theory of bursts alternating with chapters that illustrated what he had just explained by using Hungarian history as an example. In this way, I learned about György Székely and, as I stated at the beginning, I was thoroughly entertained. Barabàsi not only recounted Székely's story, but he made it dramatic, suspenseful and incredibly real.The bursts theory seems to me to make sense and yet it is so simple. Once it was explained, I understood it and just leaned back to enjoy the ride. Barabàsi shared many anecdotes and introduced some very interesting people and events along the way.I would recommend this book. It is a quick and interesting read."

Every other chapter was the author telling the tale of some cardinal in the Crusades and a battle and.. well, I can't accurately describe it, because by about the third time this happened, I stopped reading them. I was intending to skim them, but I couldn't bring myself to even do that. Even if it did have something to do with Transylvania!Now, he does refer to this incident from time to time, but it wasn't important enough to make slog through it.The rest of the book is shorter stories (thank goodness!) -- about Einstein and Hasan Elahi, and albatrosses. And basically it all comes down to, we do things in bursts. (Which anyone could've told you, really. Do _you_ check your Email _and reply to it_ every hour, on the hour, all the time you're awake?)And then something about a power law.And it's not that the science and the math escaped me (was not that complicated), but it's that you get it fairly quickly and then you're like 'Well, so what?'What does it _mean_? Why did we evolve this way? How can we use it to be more productive in our own lives or in business?This book would've been far more interesting as a several-page article, that made up part of a book where other people answered my questions in the above paragraph. ""Given this, where do we go from here?""If you like reading this sort of book, by all means go ahead. But if you don't read many of this type, then save your time for other, better, more interesting, and shorter books."
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101117-beth-barnett,3,"I picked this up on a whim and found it to be a fast read and compellingly written. The author covers various topics from (mostly present day) scientific inquiry relating to human and animal behavior that pertain to his interest in ""bursty"" behavior patterns. Alternately mixed in is a recounting of a story of a history-making Knight and a military campaign from 16th Century Hungary and Transylvania.  I'm interested in history, so this eastern European story was fascinating to me. I'm still not so sure it has very much to do with the other topics covered in the book. There is a connection between the ""burst"" pattern of wars and social movements to this historical story, but perhaps not enough of a specific connection to tie in this story which takes up half of this book. The rest of the book's more modern day topics jump around and are not covered with much depth. This lends the book to easy and entertaining reading, but leaves the reader wanting a few more details. I certainly would have liked more content to have been offered up on a number of the subjects. Nonetheless, despite its faults, this was very enjoyable to read, and I am not going to complain further about the structural logic of the text. I say just go with it and enjoy the book. It covers Poisson, Einstein, wheresgeorge.com, Homeland Security, the early 1500s, Hungarian & Transylvanian history, power laws (a mathematical term), random patterns and distributions, among a few other things.

In fact, one of the reasons I picked this book up was because Linked looks really good and this book has the subtitle: The Hidden Power Behind Everything We Do. Given that subtitle, how could one not have any interest at all in reading it?Having read it...i wish i hadn't picked it up. He intertwines history with science and doesn't accomplish either one particularly well. Especially the science part. It takes until page 100 for him to finally get around, somewhat, to what the book revolves around. And even after that the point is not all that easy to follow, to see the ""great"" scientific value of it (though i am sure there is), or to apply to every day life.We do things in bursts followed by periods of rest or silence. Those bursts make us quite predictable, as compared to random, or possessing absolute free will. The premise of the book is interesting and as this theory gets developed and proven it's applications may prove themselves to be relevant to our everyday lives. If you liked Linked (and a lot of people did, and i look forward to reading that book)...don't be fooled by this book. It's long on story, short on science and relevance and, at least for me, doesn't tie the two together in any meaningful way. "

I found the basic idea interesting--that the daily pattern of human activity is bursty--short flourishes of activity followed by randomness because I have noticed that pattern myself but I did not learn any more about that pattern from reading this book. Barabasi uses long drawn out examples to prove his point--I lost interest in the examples and skipped to the straight science. It was almost like he was trying to be Malcolm Gladwell, pulling together disparate examples and showing how they connect only it wasn't working the way it does for Gladwell... because Brabasi doesn't really show the relevance. In particular there is a long historical example that would be interesting in a different context but which does not seem to have any relevancy to the topic. Then he started talking about how most humans are predictable in their behavior arcs with only a few outliers who are not predictable. Interesting, but he doesn't shed any light on why outliers are different. He does bring to public attention the chilling reality that pretty soon we will be completely trackable by machines, unless we as a society takes steps to stop it--but he doesn't take any kind of strong stand on this. Ultimately, the book is really light on science and didn't provide many insights."

But whereas Linked was a fascinating and focused scientific investigation, Bursts is a confused jumble of disconnected material.For some unfathomable reason, Barabasi spends almost half of the book talking about a Romanian historical figure named Gyorgy, who led a peasant rebellion. The forced ways in which Barabasi tries to tie this material to his thesis are laughable. Another quarter of the book is spend following an artist named Hasan who's always traveling. As if you couldn't have guessed yourself, this means his movements are unpredictable.The thesis, as such, barely discussed. Barabasi argues that human movement is mostly predictable, and that much of human behavior occurs in bursts. You'll never really find out how these two arguments are related, and both are supported with predominantly anecdotal evidence. Barabasi's stories get so out of hand that you'll feel like he's trying to satirize of Malcom Gladwell. The small portion of this book that pertains to scientific investigation is certainly interesting, but it's not worth the unfocused droning you have to put up with to get there"
40,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300032-keith,4,"Kind of a nerdy book, but a good one. The main idea is that things don't just happen all the time in sequence or even exponentially, sometimes surprises take place and this has an underlying mathematical model also. These 'bursts' occur in other places and times, not only in math. Many things in the modern world follow this pattern and other things that seem that way don't. The author does get a bit obscure in using a historical model for his idea: An uprising in Hungary in the 1500's. He alternates between this Hungarian history and today's world where everything mostly fit normal patterns that we can think of. Think TSA and tracking Americans who travel. Someone who travels 300 times a year is outside the 'normal' pattern. There is an actual individual who is a salesman and travels to places all over the world, He is constantly harassed by the government agencies since his 'pattern' doesn't conform. He still gets harassed even though they claim to have him written down as an exception. In any case, anyone who likes mathematics and understands the idea of how in our Google world we fall into distinctive slots, regardless of subject, this a good read."

It has it's good moments and now and then I get the same feeling of awe and inspiration as I got with his ""Linked"" book, but by mixing the historical background story with his personal exploration of the importance of bursts in nature, science and humanity, the cocktail didn't really work for me. I often get the impression it's more of a personal diary of glorification instead of a scientific exploration. If it had been written by another person than himself, you would think he payed the guy to make the story better than it already was. In this case however, he wrote the book himself. It's cheaper that way in more than one sense.Conclusion: he had better written two separate books, one about his family history in the context of greater events, and one about the importance of burst and how it scientifically translates. We might have learned a lot more, and might have better understood what's so new about bursts that it merits an entire book (at least half a book)."

I think that social scientist may get some new slants on this subjects and also some readers may be interested in the haphazard way scientific discoveries are made. I am intrigued at the application of entropy to human behavior and its use in estimating our predictability. The use of simulation to compare poisson processes, random walks, brownian motion and Levi flights, embedded in social behavior seem to be worth perusing if a suitable context can be found. Furthermore it seems that these underplaying geometries can be easily combined to create an underlying dynamical system with which one can work with.E.g. Will 2 Wikipedians in different social roles be more likely to meet again once they have interacted?P.S. a Random walk has a mean position equal to its point of origin to which it may return but a Levi flight tends to diverge further and further over time without returning to the Origen."

The end result is like watching your dad flip between a show on the history channel and the discovery channel- mostly infuriating and confusing, while at moments fascinating. You always feel as if profound insight is around the corner, only to be repeatedly let down by the literary equivalent of a commercial break. My impression was the author was in the middle of his research on bursts and rushed to get the book out before arriving at the key conclusions of the research. Add a summer research project on some family history and an opportunistic publisher, and you have Bursts. I cannot for the life of me remember why there is a chapter about a guy with a third ear, but like the rest of the book I'm sure it rested on some tortured premise and manufactured relevance. I like the author, but would prefer if he stopped trying to be the next folksy pop social ""scientist"" a la malcolm gladwell, and focused on bringing the fascinating science of networks to a broader audience."

It tells the story, not only of bursts and new ideas around human behavior, but also how those new theories came into being. Writing papers never sounded so captivating - I found myself paging through the book just to see what came next. Unfortunately, I think all the story telling is hiding the fact that there's not yet that much there. The most interesting part of the book comes towards the end, when Barabasi writes on the ethics of conducting this type of research, what it means for our future and privacy. I'm not sure what the side-track into historic Hungary really added to the book, but it was still fascinating and interesting. While Barabasi's first book, Linked: How Everything Is Connected to Everything Else and What It Means, seemed a bit dry but packed-to-the-seems with information, this was captivating but I walked away wishing I'd learned a little bit more."

One immediately gets the feeling that the author is very proud of his heritage and wants people to hear his story… despite the fact that the history is only marginally related. If you are willing to wade through the history you will learn some real scientific jewels… For example: Most email users don’t send emails at the same rate hourly rate during a 24 hour period. Rather, they tend to send the emails in a short burst of time and then go dormant for remainder of the day. Or, and this is my favorite: People tend to move around mostly between home, work site, and other local areas. However, some people will, on occasion, make a long trip by car or airplane.

The rest of it is a mix of Hungarian/Transylvanian history which was boring and pointless, some anecdotes that weren't very interesting for the most part, and even a made up company, LifeLinear, just to alarm readers who were probably falling asleep by that point like I was. This book reads like it was promised to a publisher by a deadline (his 2nd book, like a 2nd album) and he wasn't as inspired as with his 1st book which got rave reviews, so he just threw together some mishmash of notes and history that had personal meaning for him and turned in the assignment.

Barabasi interweaves an epic historical narrative of the 16th century crusades with scientific theories of social patterns and predictability, which seems intriguing, but the logical thread that connects the two is so thin I am left decidedly unconvinced. Yeah, the story of the battles was engaging, but had nothing to do with his main thesis except that one guy argued that the crusades might cause instability among the peasants and cause them to revolt against the nobility, and because this is in fact what happened we are somehow to think he had some extraordinary predictive abilities that science can explain. There were a lot of interesting anecdotal tidbits that suggest that humans, along with many other examples in the natural world, behave in patterns that may be trackable and predictable, but nothing meaty enough to justify an entire book.

One is the history lesson - which if further developed could have provided a bit more foundation for those of us having no knowledge of the crusades. The second is essentially a scientific paper, but as written, without enough data to be published as such. Without focusing on either the history or the human behavior, the reader is left to try to understand what the author is getting at throughout the book - and then at the end, is left with a sense of disappointment because of the book's lack of closure/conclusions."

Likewise, though I found the history of the Romanian Crusade interesting, it seemed that he took a lot of license in terms of attributing feeling and intentions and I just couldn't connect this and the story of the FBI target guy to the main premises of the book.

I heartily hope not. I hope that instead one day Lewis Robertson`s dream will be fulfilled in that the pursuit of knowledge will guide our priorities.

In fact this book would have been closer to a 5 star book should the good Professor have told the story of Gygory Dozsa.

He tackles the job through a clever parallel. One one path he builds the case with succinct cases drawn from modern life, each culminating (more or less) in an illustration of its ""burstiness"". On the other, he looks back to an epochal incident in Hungary during the early 16th century and shows how inexplicable behavior by key players is understandable using ""burst"" theory.
