This was generally accepted by both religious figures and conservative scientists, and led to a certain stagnation of thought, preventing the eventual invention of the space elevator. When the wizards try to correct this, the potential futures of Roundworld go mad. The possibility of Darwin ever writing the book becomes near zero, with most futures featuring his death or failure to write a book in seemingly improbable—and sometimes downright ridiculous—ways. The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch (2005) is a book set on the Discworld, by Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. It is the sequel to The Science of Discworld and The Science of Discworld II: The Globe.

1,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/579016-reenie,4,"Possibly the best book you'll ever read about Darwin, the physics and science fiction of time travel, and the invention of the steam engine. Not to mention Wizards (and Wizzards). If that sounds like it jumps all over the place, that would be because it does. And although there is a clear overarching narrative/theme about Darwin and the theory of natural selection, the authors don't restrict themselves to just that story, and the science behind it, but discuss issues of science, maths, and stories that come up as the story of the wizards trying to save their Roundworld by ensuring that Darwin writes the Origin of Species wanders around amusingly.The combination of mathematician, biologist, and novelist makes for a pretty killer way of getting to the analyse what we think and how we think about it in science and other fields, and although this book is kind of patchy, it's worth reading for the Secrets of Life essay (about how we understand evolution, and how it actually might work) alone."
2,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2528889-jakub,5,"What can I say? I have a soft spot for this mixture of the UU faculty's shenanigans and the scientific ruminations of the co-authors. However, the optimistic message of the book (despite pointing out the stupidity of many) rings a bit hollow in 2020. Still, the more we know..."
3,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19503683-khai,5,"I really, really loved this book. The story was fun as expected, but I especially enjoyed the science, social, and historical discourse. And I very much look forward to reading the other Science of Discworld books!"
4,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,2,"Again with the Roundworld problems!As much as I love the Discworld, and as much as I enjoy popular science, I think the guys are reaching their limit here.The first book was great - very readable, very accessible to those of us who haven't spent many years immersed in the newest developments in mathematics and physics. And it was really funny.The second book was a little rougher, but at least kept on a consistent theme, the emergence of the Mind. There were some chapters that just slid off my brain, but for the most part, I didn't have too much trouble with it. Plus, it was really funny.This one is a bit more disjointed than its predecessors - the science chapters are less accessible and, in my opinion, only loosely connected to the theme of the Discworld story it accompanies.In this story, the wizards of the Unseen University of Ankh-Morpork are alerted that Something has gone wrong in the Roundworld. They had saved its future before, by ensuring the correct destiny for William Shakespeare, but now they have to do it again. This time, the problem is Charles Darwin.Something (which turns out to be two Somethings - the God of Evolution and the Auditors) have together pushed Darwin away from writing Origin of the Species. Instead of bringing together the various theories of evolution that preceded him and proposing the mechanism for that process, he wrote Theology of the Species, which brought together evolutionary theories and the ""watchmaker"" concepts that were also floating around. The scientists and the creationists were happy, and the argument over the evolution of life on Earth was resolved.This meant that humanity failed to get off the Earth before it turned into a giant snowball thousands of years later.The Wizards now have a task - fix all the tiny little points of historical divergence that would have prevented Darwin from making his historic voyage and writing Origin. But, history being the incredibly complex system that it is, this is not as easy as it sounds....The science portion of the book runs all over the place. It talks about Darwin's life and how he almost didn't manage to write the book for which he became famous. It talked about time travel and alternate universes. It talked about the progress of science and how it checks itself. It asked the question, if one person, such as Darwin or Watt, can be properly credited with having ""discovered"" something that others had worked on before them.It's not bad material, it's just.... kind of dull. Stick with the Discworld chapters and you'll be happy."
5,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1888911-brian-dean,3,"I bought the book because I recently prepared a class on evolution and am a Discworld fan - the two together sounded great.The result was merely good.The chapters alternate between a Discworld story and scientific explanations and the history of various concepts. The combination could work (and, from reading the reviews of others, does work in The science of Discworld, #1 and #2) but really doesn't here.First, the Discworld story is weak. Briefly, the wizards of Discworld have the 'Roundworld' - the Earth - in a jar at their university. Exotic agents - mystical creatures from Discworld - have entered the jar and are changing the history of roundworld and the theory of Charles Darwin. This premise allows Pratchaett, with Stewart and Cohen, to discuss evolution and the history of the Earth, but also time travel and cutting edge physics. The problem is, the story seems a little tacked on and exists more to give an excuse to describe the science - it is not all that compelling on it's own. I enjoyed reading about the 'wizzard' Rincewind and the story has its moments but is too lightweight.The science chapters were mostly entertaining but some of the physics and math subjects were over my head. This might be due to my own limitations but also might be because so much was material was displayed so quickly.I will definitely read more pratchett novels but probably pass on the other Science of Discworld books which would seem a shame as I, modestly, consider myself unusually scientifically literate and so should be the ideal target audience for this type of book,"
6,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8130928-jill,3,"For some reason I don't like reading books in order. Hence, this is the first of the 'Science of Discworld' sub-series that I've flipped through, and I'm going to find the other two books now. If this is your first time tackling Discworld or Terry Pratchett, this is not the book to go with. Prior knowledge of the wizards of Discworld (especially Rincewind and Ridcully) is preferable.It was surprisingly a fun read. I was a bit worried initially at the ever-shortening story chapters and ever-lengthening science chapters, some of which didn't seem very significant to the continuation of the story and rather complicated. Halfway through the book, I figured the best way to read it was not to concentrate too hard on the science and appreciate the little hints that appear in the story. I was confuzzled at the maths chapter but enjoyed the parts about the genome and evolution. No doubt someone with more interest in maths than me would see things differently. Also this book elaborated on some of the background of 'Thief of Time' (another Discworld novel), so I'll be re-reading that too."
7,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954469-ron,4,"What do you get when you mix wizards, Hex, and Roundworld? You get the next installment in The Science of Discworld by Terry Pratchett and company. In Darwin's Watch, when Charles Darwin writes The Theology of Species rather than The Origins of Species, the future of humanity escaping the snowball earth future disappears. The Wizards of the Unseen University spring into action to restore humanity's future, fighting unseen forces between chapters on time travel, the vagaries of biological evolution, the need for good education, not to mention plenty on the absurdity of math taken to extremes. If you liked the other Science of Discworld books, you are likely to enjoy this one as well, not to mention learn a few facts and theories."
8,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136271-maria,3,"Science on Earth has gone down the wrong leg in trousers of time, and it up to wizards of Unseen University and Hex to ensure that Charles Darwin writes the right book, The Origin of Species instead of the The Theology of Species. Alternating between a lucid explanation of how science works and the mad dash of wizards, this story endeavors to show just how messy, ridiculous and breathtaking science is.Why I started this book: I started without expectations and was surprised at the melding of science and fantasy, theory and application. Why I finished it: Fun, silly and educational... just like all of Pratchett's books."
9,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1559463-james,2,"Pratchett should stick to fantasy. This is a diatribe against Christianity, but like so many of the Fundamentalists he mocks, Pratchett holds to his scientific theories with religious fervor. He tries to support Darwinianism using a numerical theology, claiming the since we can make numbers go on into infinity, therefore the evolutionary possibilities could also be infinite.Scientific evidence would prove better than numerology, but since there is a dearth of it, Pratchett goes for the theoretical. This book, although interesting from a philosophical standpoint, should not be in the Discworld series."
10,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16034088-michael,4,"Another eclectic mix of science, philosophy and the madness of Discworld. This can be read purely for the entertainment value but dig a little deeper and there is some really thought provoking stuff here about the science of evolution, time and the Many World Theory. I loved the risks taken by the authors to state personal and sometimes political opinions. Full of surprises and highly recommended. I shall be reading number 4 in the series."
11,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4716208-kyrie,3,"I think I've read too many of these Discworld stories embedded in abbreviated science discussions. I found myself wanting to skip the science and just get on with the tale. On the other hand, there was a chapter (a really long one) that explained string theory so I felt I had some actual understanding of it - well, almost. I did like the story and can only imagine Darwin's confusion at encountering the Wizards of Unseen University. "
12,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48451466-max,4,"I love the Science of Discworld books. It makes me feel like I'm also learning something while reading my favourite fantasy stories. Great writing, the science bits are sometimes a bit long and the Pratchett bits too short though. :-) "
13,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/786109-craig-smith,5,Brilliant pretty much sums it up. 
14,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21853313-brandt,3,"At a conceptual level, The Science of Discworld novels by Discworld creator Terry Pratchett along with science writers Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen seem like they would be winners. Pratchett's Discworld exists first and foremost as a satirical vessel for almost any subject that Pratchett wished to address, starting first with some frankly tired fantasy and sci-fi trope and then branching out. In these novels(?), Pratchett provides a framework for Stewart and Cohen to expound on whatever science topics they wish to discuss. Unfortunately, in execution none of these novels have lived up to the potential that the concept promises us.I think there are ultimately two reasons for this. The first is with Pratchett's frame story in each of the novels. While Pratchett engages in the narrative (here, attempting to get Charles Darwin to write On the Origin of Species) it is difficult to see if this book would be a worthwhile endeavor if the story was not interspersed with Stewart and Cohen's commentary. This in turn begs the question--would Pratchett even have bothered with this book had Stewart and Cohen not been involved and did the story lead to the topics Stewart and Cohen address in the book or does the tail wag the dog, so to speak? In the first 
Science of Discworld
 novel, I think it's easy to attribute Pratchett as the driving force behind the book since Stewart and Cohen discuss many science topics up to and including the kitchen sink. However, this isn't the feel I got from 
The Science of Discworld: The Globe
, where it felt like Stewart and Cohen gave Pratchett a bulleted list of topics they wanted to cover. Darwin's Watch feels like more of the latter than the former. As such, the narrative, taken on its own really seems completely superfluous. Unfortunately, since Stewart and Cohen choose their subject matter based on Pratchett's narrative, there really isn't a flow to what they are writing about. I think ultimately this works best in the first novel because Stewart and Cohen seem committed to writing briefly about a number of science topics (and controversies) based on the narrative. Yes, it is a more pop science approach to these topics, but it seems like Stewart and Cohen's motivation is to get readers to look more deeply into these topics at their own leisure. Unfortunately, in both The Globe and now in Darwin's Watch Stewart and Cohen provide an overarching theme that they want to explore. However, the framework is supposedly what Pratchett's narrative is supposed to be providing here and so this feeds into the idea that it is Stewart and Cohen driving all of this, not Pratchett. Since Stewart and Cohen are prodigious writers of their own accord, I think it is valid to ask if the continuing existence of the Science of Discworld novels is actually necessary.Of course, when it comes to the topics they cover, Stewart and Cohen show that they've done their research and are willing to question some of the ""established"" science out there, especially when it comes to controversial questions where the actual answer to the question is usually ""we don't know."" In this novel however, Stewart and Cohen go out of their comfort zone and address questions of Darwin's history in the lead up to him writing On the Origin of Species. And it turns out they do have a bit of an axe to grind with ""creationists"" who they estimate dismiss Darwin's work using the wrong criteria. This is fine and good, but I have a feeling that the target of their ire aren't the sorts of people who are reading The Science of Discworld.In some ways I am still looking for the ""magic"" of Discworld, which seems to be in short supply from what I've read thus far. However, there are other paths that I have not followed yet, and hopefully the ""magic"" I seek is hiding there."
15,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,5,"I loved, loved, loved this book. I mean, I’ve read the first two books in the Science of Discworld series and I enjoyed them both a lot, but nowhere near as much as this one. I’m not sure if that’s because this book was better than the others or because it came along at just the right time.Here, we have the usual mixture of fiction and non-fiction in the form of a Discworld story from Terry Pratchett that’s offset by chapters from Stewart and Cohen that delve into the science of both the Discworld and Roundworld, where we live. The title itself references The Blind Watchmaker, a Richard Dawkins book, and there are plenty of references to both Dawkins and Charles Darwin, who appears as a character in Pratchett’s sections.What surprised me here was that I actually enjoyed the non-fiction parts more than the Discworld story that accompanied it. That’s not to say that I didn’t enjoy Pratchett’s contribution, though. It was all fantastic, which is why I didn’t hesitate to give the book a 5/5. I put off reading it for a while purely because it’s a thick old hardback, but in hindsight I think that was a mistake. It’s worth reading whether you’re a Pratchett fan or not, although there are plenty of in-jokes for seasoned fans to enjoy, too.The best thing of all is the fact that you don’t have to read the Science of Discworld books in order. Sure, they reference each other, but they’re more like little self-contained releases that act as a beautiful add-on to the Discworld series. I have a horrible feeling that they get overlooked when compared to the rest of Pratchett’s releases, which is a shame. I could name at least a half-dozen Discworld books that weren’t as good as this. So go out and buy it – you won’t regret it."
16,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935560-dan-l-danehy-oakes,4,"This is the best of these I've read so far. (There's only one left. for me to read) In the first two volumes, the wizards of Unseen University accidentally created a Universe, which fortunately fit inside a manageable container. In this Universe, they found what they called ""Roundworld"", a fictional(?) version of our Earth; and proceeded to save it, or rather its humans, from a variety of ills (such as an invasion of Elves. Discworld Elves are nasty critters).As before, the format of this book is chapters of a Discworld novella featuring the wizards, alternating with chapters of science illustrating and illustrated by the fictive chapters.The fictional part is easily described. Malign forces seek to prevent humanity surviving (by leaving the Earth before it becomes an iceball). They are doing this by sabotaging a key point of the scientific advancement - in particular, they have caused a Reverend Charles Darwin to write _Theology of Species_, which fully supports Paley's watch. So they have to figure out how this is happening, and maybe even who is behind it, and put things right.The nonfiction chapters are not so easily described. They mostly cover evolutionary science, but also bits of cosmology (a fairly thorough treatment of the multiple universes interpretation of quantum theory wanders in), history, sociology, etc. But they are very readable and entertaining (to the mind interested in such things)."
17,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1157324-peter-dunn,5,"The third in the series of four, and just marginally below the peak of first two books, the focus this time is Darwin which gives University of Warwick researchers Jack Cohen (reproductive biologist) and Professor Ian Stewart (mathematician) all the excuse they need to wax lyrical in their chapters on the theory of evolution. As they have successfully written together several times on this and related topics you are in safe, educational, and very funny hands.They also get to talk a little about the nature of time travel as Terry’s almost seamlessly accompanying Discworld tale takes Charles Darwin out of time, and out of round world. When Terry, Ian and Jack detail the vast range of real coincidences, mishaps and general strange events that did lead to Darwin getting and safely of the Beagle, one does begin to think that maybe he really was being assailed by interfering time travellers. Probably four and a half stars, as it is just below the peak of the previous two, but hey let’s be generous and round it up to five."
18,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6286612-molokov,3,"Once again on this read through, we only covered the Discworld and not the Science chapters. In this next book, the wizards have to make sure that Charles Darwin writes The Origin of Species instead of Theology of Species. Unfortunately it treads a lot of the same ground as SoD2, with a different subject and different antagonist. And where SoD2 borrowed heavily from Lords and Ladies, this one borrows heavily from The Last Continent and Thief of Time - and the fact that ideas from other Discworld novels are recycled makes the story here fall a little flat. It's not as good as its predecessors and sometimes you get the feeling that Terry's heart just isn't in writing these stories for Science of Discworld, but Ian & Jack have a lot to say on the Science side of things. Still, as with the previous ones, it's good to get a bit more of the UU Wizards, especially as Rincewind plays a larger part in the proceedings, and he's always a good foil to Ridcully and Ponder Stibbons."
19,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7504303-amanda-nunn,4,"Accidentally nicked this book from a friend after I started reading it at a party. That's right, I like to party hard.This is the first Science of the Discworld I have read, but it doesn't seem to have mattered much. It was nice to catch up with Rincewind in his university role after his retirement from being chased all over the Discworld.It was also fun to catch up with my old friend Darwin, whose Voyage of the Beagle I'd read for my post where I roleplayed him on a New Zealand beach.I enjoyed the mix of science, science history, time travel and narrative. I'm afraid I didn't understand a few of the more advanced concepts, but I did appreciate the way they were presented in an attempt to be accessible to the lay reader."
20,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5877131-katrin,2,"I thought I had another gem from Pratchett in my hands but I was wrong. I didn't like this at all. I would have given only one star, but then some of the discussion was really interesting, so two stars it is. This is basically a story mixing discworld and roundworld, interrupted by scientific essays. Why on earth you'd do that?? If I want to read science, I read science. If I want to read fantasy, I read fantasy. This here was a mix that lacked sense, humour and meaning. It all seemed so fabricated. The fantasy parts are short, the scientific discourse is much bigger. So why bother with a rather boring storyline at all? This could have been better if it was only the science bit, labelling it as that. Discworld has almost nothing to do with it anyway and the thin story was nothing worth remembering... Too bad."
21,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38293445-stripe-fisk,3,"This was the first book I read in the Science of Discworld series, and though it was comprehensible, I think it may have been a more enjoyable experience had I read the other two first.Either way, this is a strange book - one third of it is a short story about Discworld and Roundworld and Charles Darwin, and the other two thirds alternates as a mix of a popular science book, a biography on Darwin, a history book, and a philosophy book. All of the Discworld portion was fun, but some of the chapters in the other two thirds were either boring (I had to skip some of the sections on Victorian England) or so deep into theory that they’re nearly incomprehensible (the chapters on time travel and infinity are particularly intense).Still, for the most part I found it enjoyable and learned some fun facts. Not a bad read if you like both Discworld and science."
22,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,3,"While it is rare I can put a book on both the ""fantasy"" and ""science"" shelves, this was a bit of a let down. The wizard stuff is great, of course, but the science part of this doesn't stick to evolution. I wish they had, because we need as many books as possible to reach people who don't understand the theory.Instead, the science authors go gallivanting off on time travel, infinity, and other subjects that just confuse a reader trying to decide what the hell it all has to do with Darwin and evolution."
23,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6000188-gil-t,4,"So with the Science of Discworld series, Terry Pratchett is educating people on all things physics, math, science, evolution and more. All this is done with the sense of humor found in all the Discworld books. This book while focusing on Darwin & evolution, they do throw in some string theory and more. Whether you want to learn or not the humor with this book is worth it, who knows you may learn a thing or two."
24,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29170317-kim-clarke,3,"All of the books in this series can be very heavy in the science chapters, with some of the discussion being very high level. Certainly not pitched at children or those who have not studied science at higher levels.But even with that, the Discworld chapters are well worth it by themselves if you enjoy the wizards mucking about with the universe and dropping little pieces of paper whilst doing it."
25,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60583805-steven,3,"Fun. Good explanations of some scientific ideas and history thereto. But an odd fetishization of post-Victorian England (in the parts written by Ian and Jack) and it's ability to progress compared to other places, but a profound lack of discussion of state-funded R&D that has caused so much innovation (which is odd because it refers to things/projects that were created this way or that will need to be created with the full force of a state)."

27,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29831899-robert-hepple,4,"Published in 2006, The Science of Discworld III follows the familiar format of a passable story about the Wizards having an adventure on 'Roundworld', this time attempting to ensure that Darwin writes the 'right' book, sandwiched between a factual account of the issues surrounding this.

43,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5516573-robert,3,"I gave this three stars largely because the fiction (Discworld) chapters were dull and irrelevant. I did enjoy most of the science chapters, though. They are very well written and interesting. I like that the authors delve into the philosophy of science. Their explanations of multiple dimensions and multiple universes were probably the best I've seen for public consumption. I'm glad someone finally explained to non-scientists the difference between a useful mathematical model for something and the thing itself. Physicists often get so caught up in the very productive practice of pretending that the mathematics is the physical reality that they forget to mention the difference when they are explaining physics to others. Sometimes they seem to forget the distinction themselves. I was glad to see the description of the multiverse as a phase space. I'm not sure how many people would understand it, but at least it is accurate. The long section on Cantor and transfinite numbers was not particularly interesting for me, but then I already know that material. I am puzzled about who the intended audience for it was, though. I've taught the subject to many math majors and know they often have difficulties with it. I have serious doubts about whether a lay-person would understand it particularly well. It also seemed like a major digression. I'm sure the authors felt that people needed a lesson on infinity since many other things in the book depend on it. Still, there was a lot of space used to describe transfinite numbers and not much used to explain other types of infinity. Unless one assumes the universe is discrete, this is putting the emphasis in the wrong place. I was amused, however, to read a review by an evangelist who ridiculed the book for spending so much time on ""numerology"". Just so you know, there is no numerology in the book. There is some mathematics, actually quite a lot of it, but the two are not the same. I am not particularly surprised that an evangelical would equate mathematics with numerology. Such a tragic waste of a mind.My biggest disappointment was that the topic of evolution was not discussed much more here than it was in previous books in the Science of Discworld series. A whole lot of talk about Darwin doesn't substitute for good coverage of the primary topic of the book. Then again, maybe the authors had something other than evolution in mind. Maybe they just wanted to talk about Darwin and time-travel. If so, then way to stay on topic! Another downside of the book is that it uses the exact same plot device as the preceding book---the wizards have to travel through time repeatedly to get the protagonist onto the time-line in which he will write the stuff he is ""supposed"" to write. In book two this is Shakespeare writing his plays and sonnets; in book three it is Darwin writing The Origin of Species. Not particularly creative. One last thing, I don't care for the wizards. Wizards are rarely interesting. Including large numbers of them in a story doesn't make that weakness go away."

This is one of the topics covered in the book. I have to say the comments in the blog really do fit my own views, except that I come from the other side of the argument. Now I wasn’t looking for this, I just ‘stumbled across it’, and it’s a really nice way into what I want to say. The book starts out with a zeal for its message that the religious fundamentalists would understand. Why do we have to read through all this anti-religious ‘preaching’ about evolution? The authors clearly have strongly held views, and have not considered adequately either the effect on the reader, or that many of the scientists have a strong religious faith of their own. Throughout the rest of the book there is a story of the discworld Wizards acting as God in the roundworld, to alter the timeline, so that Darwin writes “The Origin of the Species”. It’s a nice story, but again somewhat overplayed. If the probability of Darwin actually writing this book is so low, why did it happen?So what are we left with? Well there’s some interesting ‘science’. Not the sort of science where a prediction is made and then tested, revised, tested, and so on. This is the sort of ‘science’, which is mainly ‘mathematical models’. Entirely theory, and not able to be validated by observation. This it seems is where all ‘science’ leads. Perhaps we’ve gone far enough with pure ‘science’, and our future is in technology – the exploitation of our understanding, to make our lives more bearable, but I’ll get accused of preaching if I go on."
45,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50432252-jay,4,"This is an odd duck of a series. It is a combination of fiction and nonfiction, in which both aspects illustrate and expand upon each other. The fiction side is a side story to the Unseen University subseries of the Discworld books, whereas the nonfictional portions are an exploration and examination of modern science, as well as the various paths taken to reach the current level of understanding. Oh, and the science sections are more engaging than the fantasy ones. Seriously.In this book, the authors examine the consequences of Darwin and his writings, both the ones he did that changed the world, and the ones he would have written if just a few things were different. Along the way, we of course examine evolutionary theory, but also quantum and relativistic physics, the possibility of time travelthe various merits of Victorian society, and much more. It is surprising and heartening that the authors can juggle all of this while spinning a darn good tale.There are issues, of course. For one thing, limited appeal. The fictional sections may not rely on knowledge of the main series, but they certainly benefit, while the science sections would get a significant boost from working knowledge of basic, current theories. Also, the wizard parts are typical Discworld farce, with little to no effect on the Disc in the novels, as this is not a main, or perhaps even canon, entry.All in all, this is a fun entry in a fun series. If you are someon who, like me, is a fan of both Terry Pratchett and Sam Kean, this is a must. If, however, that combination does not appeal, this will not be the book for you"
46,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29704412-sarafina-skov,5,"Terry Pratchett’s style of writing reminds me of a quote by Socrates: “I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think”. His use of humour and story-telling makes it feel like I’m just having fun, meanwhile I’m being made to think about mind-boggling concepts; in The Science of Discworld series especially.The story follows the journey of a group of magicians trying to make Darwin write The Origin of Species”. So the overall themes of the plot could be said to be scientific thinking, time travel, and the history (specifically of Victorian England). However, there is also focus on very human concepts through these motifs.Reading “Darwin’s Watch” took me on a journey through everything the world is not, and made me appreciate everything that it is: every mistake made (Darwin wrote 8 of the “wrong books” before being able to write his masterpiece after all) and every unlikely turn of events that led us humans to exist exactly as we do (The book does so by discussing probability, many-worlds theory, and evolution).The authors emphasize the importance of getting our knowledge from several sources. This is because listening to several opinions (and being willing to change one’s own opinion when faced with evidence) is the best way to understand things.  This idea I find especially relevant considering the current political situation worldwide being that people’s extreme opinions seem to make them incapable of seeing the opposition as humans. Themes of the book aside, I won’t lie and say it’s an easy read, since the authors use big words and discuss of even bigger concepts, but the comic relief of the wizards certainly helps. It’s a fun and eye-opening read that I would highly recommend and which I will probably read again when I’ve grown a little wiser."

This series manages something no other Discworld book has done - felt unnecessary. They're beating a dead horse with increasingly random topics of discourse. Ostensibly focused on Darwin, the Discworld story actually feels more like it is written to meet the science topics, rather than the other way around. And the science topics range from time travel to the weaknesses of the modern British culture, to 'Steam Engine Time,' to the oh-so-positive 'Everything you've ever been taught is wrong, and you can't even handle it if it were right... but that's okay. Really.' There are some interesting topics, and some approached in a useful manner, but the tone of the writing just rubbed me the wrong way; maybe it was the straw man approach in the early chapters that treated people with religious beliefs as being precious but forgivable. Maybe it was the completely disassociated topics that make for a barely coherent throughline. Whatever it was, I had to force myself to read through this book, and the Discworld sections just weren't enough to reward reading the rest. I considered skipping the science chapters, and by the end really wished I had. I know there's a fourth book in the series, but I don't know that I'll be able to bring myself to read it considering all the self-important drek that surrounds it."

I might have spent a lot less time fighting unconsciousness and a little more time actually learning something.PS - himself who is a science nerd of the first order read the book at the same time as me and was equally impressed.

They thought they had everything straightened out with Shakespeare, but now Darwin is causing problems. Something has caused him to not write The Origin of the Species and instead write Theology of the Species. This sets science back decades and means that humanity doesn't get off the planet before it turns into a snowball again. The wizards are up against the Auditors and the god of evolution to set things right. This third Science of Discworld was probably the most difficult to get through. I thought it wasn't as cohesive as the other books. The Discworld story seemed a bit thinner and the science sections less relevant to the story. I did enjoy the fantasy section of the book, but I thought the story could have been stronger. The role of the Auditors especially seemed very tacked on. However, it was the science sections that really bogged down. I will admit to skimming most of the chapters as I thought they were very dry and dull. It didn't help that most of them didn't seem related to the fantasy story being told. Sure they discussed Darwin and evolution, but there were also chapters on infinity and black holes and other subjects I have completely blocked from my mind. I received this book from Netgalley.com."
50,0091898242,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678629-sfreader,5,"This is not a novel. It is an overview of certain aspects of actual (more or less: read the book) science, directed against anti-evolutionists, but also against certain misapplications of mathematics and science.The title is from a book, Natural Theology (1802), by William Paley. He describes a man walking across a heath (uncultivated area). He sees a rock, and may imagine that it has always been there. But if he sees a watch, he knows that watches have not always existed, therefore there must have been a watch Maker. This leads to what has since been tagged ""intelligent design."" The authors [and I] do not agree with this. They note two very different uses of the word ""theory."" One is a misleading equivalence with ""hypothesis,"" which is a question or statement proposed for testing, to see if it can be falsified, that is, proven to be false. The other is an idea about which considerable evidence has accumulated, which has not been falsified. It may not have been nailed down in all particulars, but a heavy preponderance of evidence says that it is true. Read more at SFReader.com: Darwin's Watch, by Terry Pratchett"

This time the focus is on Darwin and whether or not he writes Origin of the Species and what effect that has on the timeline.These Science of Discworld books have misleading titles, because they're really about science in our world interspersed with a frame story that takes place on Discworld and involves the Wizards of the Unseen University.I've enjoyed all these books, including this one. The biggest difference is that the science gets a little heavier here. There were some sections where I just glossed over and I'm a huge science geek. The only other disappointment was that for a book about Darwin, there wasn't nearly as much on evolution as I'd hoped there'd be. There were other interesting topics like time travel and infinity (the latter going a little to deep in the weeds for me), but I'd have preferred to have had a lot more on evolution.It can be a bit hard to find in the states, you usually have to buy it used off of someone on the Amazon ""other options""."

The premise is based on Darwin and his book(s): Which one will be written? Bringing in all the circumstances--in alternate universes--that might have prevented him from writing Origin of Species, introduces us to his background--based on actual incidents. I learned a lot! And the background branches out into scientific theories, other scientists, the steam engine--and so much more. It's a good thing there's an index! I confess that sometimes I got bogged down in all that exposition, but it is incredibly educational and could even be assigned as required reading in some courses.

What I expected was a book that goes into detail some aspect of real science that actually shows up within the Discworld novels. One would think that with a title like the Science OF Discworld, it would be a safe assumption. But that's not what you get. There's a Discworld story, yes, of the wizards of Unseen University trying desperately to make sure that the Darwin of Roundworld to write The Origin of the Species. But in between chapters are chapters of sctual science for actual Earth, aka Roundworld. And while some of that was good and interesting, it wasn't why I picked up the book. I didn't want to read something about my world, I wanted to escape, once again, into someone else's. So the book, for me, was a bit of a letdown. "

The book delves into evolution - both of humanity and of ideas, and discusses the important concepts of the multiplicity of ideas, the non-linear march of history, and the necessity of understanding complex narratives without resorting to a simple linear chain of cause and effect to truly understand the impacts that ideas can have on the world. The authors end the book on a poignant point - the rise of prosperity in Victoria England was thanks, mainly in part to their heterogenous society, and their (general) acceptance of differing, conflicting ideas - difference, at the end of the day, leads to strength."

While not as good as the first book, Darwin's Watch is much better than the ""The Globe"", the second installment. Darwin's Watch just seems to be more focused; namely on the theme of evolution in general and Darwin's theories in particular. It also manages to fit in some fun notes on the nature of infinity, time travel, and the concept of alternate dimensions among other things. Ultimately a great read if you are a Discworld fan with an interrest in science. You do really need to have a minimum of interrest in both subjects to get the most out of the book though."

In the story chapters, the wizards have to set things up so that Darwin makes his voyage. They're battling the Auditors (my least-favourite Discworld characters) and along the way, courtesy of the non-fiction chapters that separate the fiction ones, we learn a lot about Darwin, the Many Worlds hypothesis, and the social construction of science. A good book for this anniversary of Darwin's trip (you'll remember a lot more than if you plod your way through a fat biography) but treat yourself and get Science of Discworld II while you're at the bookstore."

I didn't enjoy this book as much as TSoD or TSoD II, but it was still enjoyable. The ending didn't resonate with me as much, and the Discworld story was (I think) the weakest of the three. However, there were lots of interesting chapters in between the story. Unfortunately, there were a few chapters that just bogged me down: the chapter on time machines oddly enough and the discussion of infinity. I think it was because these required more complexity to explain and so the discussion got a little heavy. I enjoy learning, but trying to jump into the complex at the amateur understanding is never easy. "

One quarter is a disc world novel, the other three are an effort by two other authors to explain many fields of science in a light manner. The novel has an amazing beginning (as always) but rushes to story really fast and is very disctracted by the other part, so I couldn't really enjoy it a lot. The science part I found very tiring. I am saying this as a scientist myself. There are a lot of interesting anecdotes in it, but they change topics so fast that I never fully got invested and tried to cover all interesting parts of science.So to sum up.. this is not one of Pratchett's best works."
