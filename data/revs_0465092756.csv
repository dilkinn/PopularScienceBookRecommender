0,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"[Original review, June 2009]Just looking at the title gives you a large clue as to what this book is about. Woit is covering a lot of the same ground as Smolin, in 
The Trouble with Physics
. Both of them argue convincingly that fundamental physics has lost its way. Superstring theory has been around for over 20 years, and it hasn't delivered on its early promises. Here are what I saw as the main pieces of evidence:1. Problems with supersymmetry. Every particle is supposed to have a supersymmetric partner. No one has ever observed a supersymmetric partner to any known particle. The theory doesn't even predict what masses these partners should have, so it's not clear how to look for them. Very bad.2. Incredibly bad predictions on vacuum energy/dark energy. It's notorious that natural versions of superstring theory predict a value for the density of dark energy that's at least 50 orders of magnitude too high - maybe as much as 100 orders of magnitude, or even more. As the author gleefully points out, probably the worst prediction ever made by a mainstream theory that people take seriously.You'd think that this would be enough to sink it. But the worst part is that superstrings aren't in fact a proper, falsifiable theory. As Feynman is supposed to have said, superstring theorists don't make predictions, they make excuses. By which he meant that the framework is so loose, and has so many adjustable parameters, that any inconvenient observation can explained away. It's always possible to come up with a new variant that fits, or that at least can't easily be proved not to fit.So, why on earth is this still the mainstream approach? Woit's argument is, more than anything, that it's down to one person, Edward Witten. Witten is incredibly gifted, and almost certainly the best mathematical physicist alive. By all accounts, he's also a very nice guy. Physicists are not just in awe of him, they like him too. When Witten started doing superstring theory, and discovered amazing new directions to explore, others followed. Unfortunately, the math required is very difficult, if you don't happen to be as smart as Witten. As Woit says, suppose you're a grad student who's spent several years of his life learning this stuff. It's hard to write it off as a bad investment. You have a strong emotional reason to want it to be right. After a while, a self-perpetuating circle is set up. Smolin spends rather more time analyzing the sociology in The Trouble with Physics.So, is Woit's book just one long rant? 300-odd pages of variants on ""The Emperor has no clothes""? Actually, no. The last third or so could reasonably be described in those terms. But the greater part of it is quite positive, and contains what I found to be a remarkably interesting take on quantum mechanics, presented so as to highlight the role played by the concept of symmetry. The way Woit tells it, one of most important people in the development of the field was the mathematician Hermann Weyl, who came up with some of the central ideas, and showed how mathematical ways of describing symmetries could be made into a cornerstone of the theory. There is an interesting human dimension to this as well. Weyl was not only Schrödinger's best friend and close collaborator; apparently Schrödinger was also quite happy for Weyl to be his wife's lover, while Schrödinger himself spent most of his time with another woman, who, oddly enough, has never been identified. I can't imagine why this hasn't all been made into a movie. Maybe it has, and I just don't know about it.Woit presents a detailed account of how Weyl's ideas came to fruition in quantum chromodynamics and ""The Standard Model"", which he plausibly describes as one of the great achievements of science. He goes on to argue that the biggest mistake people have made has been to abandon Weyl's lead. Superstring theory no longer gives the same weight to these concepts. I'm in no way competent to judge whether Woit's arguments are correct, but they're interesting, and I hadn't heard them before.Unfortunately, although Weyl's symmetry story is fascinating, and I applaud Woit's courage in delving so far into its details, I must warn you that he assumes a startling amount of background in math and physics. In particular, he talks more about the representation theory of Lie groups and its application to quantum mechanics than I would ever have imagined possible in what's supposed to be a non-technical book. I did courses on group theory and representation theory as an undergraduate, and I've read both Dirac on the principles of quantum mechanics and Kaplansky on Lie groups and Lie algebras. All of this stuff is very relevant to Woit's exposition, and he quotes it constantly. I still found myself struggling most of the time, and in general reading the book as poetry rather than as science. Alas, I'm not as smart as I'd like to think I am.So, the more you know about that kind of thing, the more likely you are to feel that Woit is worth looking at. (Penrose is one famous physicist who gives this book a big thumbs-up). If you haven't got the math background, and just want to find out what the deal is with the crisis in superstring theory, I strongly recommend reading Smolin instead. They're very interesting books, and I'm glad I read both of them. But I wish more than ever that someone would sort out the mess that physics has got itself into. It's scary to see the world's greatest minds behaving like this.PS Not drew my attention to the following xkcd cartoon. Well, if you can't be bothered to read the book, it's definitely giving you the essentials...__________________________________________[Update, December 2014]I've just finished rereading this book; in the five years since I first read it, I've improved my understanding of physics, and now I found it fairly easy to get through. That said, there are still many passages I don't understand at anything more than a very superficial level. Woit has an impossible task to confront here. If he doesn't include a lot of extremely technical material, the string theorists he's attacking will sneer and say he doesn't know enough about the subject to be worth taking seriously. If he does put in that level of detail, he's going to lose most of his lay audience. I think I'm now at the level of expertise he's aiming for, but only just. I certainly wasn't first time round.Woit's criticisms of string theory come across as serious and well-founded. He explains convincingly why the subject is failing to deliver on its promise of creating a valid ""theory of everything""; as he says, string theory has all the classic hallmarks of a failed approach. There is no clean, elegant core idea, but a series of increasingly bizarre and incomprehensible ad hoc constructions. There are no empirical predictions. There is no metric of progress. There is no obvious technical problem that needs to be solved in order to eliminate the difficulties it is currently experiencing. The weaknesses appear deep-rooted and structural.The thing I found most damning was the reception Woit's manuscript received from the Cambridge University Press referees. Some of them were enthusiastic, but the string theorists were implacably hostile. Quite understandably so, of course, given that he was attacking their subject, but they were unable to offer coherent criticisms; they claimed he didn't know what he was talking about, but presented no details. The only concrete item Woit received was a comment on a single sentence, which had been misquoted so as to convey a meaning different from its original one. If the book really were the product of a crank with an axe to grind, they should have had no trouble demolishing it; all they could do was bluster, but their opinion carried enough weight that they managed to block publication until Woit found another, less prestigious publisher. Shame on you, Cambridge University Press. You published one of my books, and it wasn't nearly as interesting or worthwhile as this one. In Woit's case, you didn't have the guts to offend influential people in the theoretical physics community, and you let yourselves be bullied into silence. I expected better of you."

3,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,1,"I’m sorry, I can’t bring myself to finish this one. It is too hard. It has been written about as badly as it is possible to write a book like this. Take this as a case in point:“Mathematicians were much slower to appreciate the Dirac equation and it had little impact on mathematics at the time of its discovery. Unlike the case with the physicists, the equation did not immediately answer any questions that mathematicians had been thinking about. This began to change in the early 1960s, when the British mathematician Michael Atiyah and his American colleague Isadore Singer rediscovered the equation for themselves in their work on the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, one of the most important results of the latter half of the twentieth century.”Ahh, yes, the old Atiyah-Singer index theorem – one of my favourites. No point in saying anything more about something quite so well known as the index theorem.I was so looking forward to this book because I do think String Theory has a lot to answer for. The title comes from a favourite saying of Wolfgang Pauli – but Woit even stuffs up this story. My favourite telling comes from In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat (at least, I think that is where I read it – it was a long time ago). This is my memory of the story, anyway. Pauli had some sort of illness (Parkinson’s? – I honestly can’t remember) and it had the unfortunate effect of making his head bob. He would sit listening to lectures by young Physicists and they would think they were making a wonderful impression on the great man as he sat there nodding along with them, all until he would suddenly jump up and say, “Wrong! Utterly false!”Anyway, that was him on a good day. By far his worst criticism, which has become proverbial, was his saying to someone their theory was “Not even wrong!” That is, what they had said was nothing more than pure, blind speculation that could be neither proven nor disproven. Damning criticism indeed. And that is what I was expecting this book to show about String Theory – that String Theory makes no predictions about the world that can be proven one way or the other and that therefore it too is not even wrong.And I bet that is what this book gets around to saying – it is just that I found everything from about page 40 virtually completely incomprehensible. Admittedly, I was reading this one before going to sleep – but I really struggled with it. I’ve stopped at page 80 – not actually with blood coming out of my eyes, but close enough not want to go on. Roger Penrose calls it ‘Compulsive reading’ – but I suspect Roger may have less trouble with what I found were far too vague introductions to concepts like quantum theory. I think Roger may have been able to fill in the gaps more than I was able to do. Woit provides a very ‘geometric’ view of quantum theory, one I’ve never heard of before, and I admit it left me completely lost.I was really looking forward to this one and I feel very let down by it. This might be a much better book than I found it to be – but I would suggest you will need quite a bit more physics to understand it than should be expected from the ‘general’ reader."
4,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21788173-daniel-shawen,5,"This is a great book, even if it is a little dated.I previously thought that I was the only one who ranted about things like the 'anthropic principle', which basically says: ""If life were impossible, no one would know it."" -- Captain Obvious Since when did a statement such as this become 'science'? It's a valid question.Just like the (now Nobel-Laureate) Alan Guth's ideas about cosmic inflation: ""There are no magnetic monopoles in our current universe, because once there were, but now the universe is so diluted, there aren't any left."" The same could be said about things like fairies, Santa Claus, and the Easter Bunny, could it not?Together with the ideas of Hume and Popper (which deny that science uses any measure or 'induction' process from previous established science including instrumentation, science itself seems to be very diluted these days.Mathematics, and in particular, the mathematics associated with string theory, is however a good example of one of Popper's ""unfalsifiable"" ideas. When string theorists are told that two experiments demonstrate that a proton has not decayed since the beginning of the universe (14 billion years or so), there is no response. Just how long should we wait for it to decay then? Many of the precepts of string theory can never be tested on a practical basis. A collider with an energy of 10^16 GeV would be required to break apart one of their ""strings"" into whatever its constituent parts are. There aren't enough resources on this planet to build such a device, nor is there anything that energetic going on in the universe it is practical for us to observe. Moreover, some 20 or so 'free parameters' (fudge factors) exist in the current Standard Model (and many more in string theory, that must be individually adjusted in order to satisfy the conditions of the so-called 'anthropic principle' alone.Peter Woit's book is a must read to see how much of the last 30 years of theoretical physics has been squandered by what appears to be the mathematical equivalent of superstition. Mathematics has at least one characteristic in common with all other human languages. Nonsensical or fictional expression will always be possible with any language, including that of mathematics if one is determined enough. There needs to be a balance struck between mathematics that is describing something that is real vs. mathematics that doesn't even come close to the mark, and also does little or nothing to advance our ability to model real situations, or the mathematics we may someday use in order to do so.The development of the Amplitudihedron seems likely to be the only good thing that has come out of the branch of physics called string theory in over 30 years time, so perhaps it is time to give the subject a well deserved pause."
5,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10105356-eric,4,"A fascinating book criticizing the institution that is String Theory. The central question here is whether string theory deserves the attention and man hours it receives, and moreover, whether elegance and mathematical beauty are necessities of a scientific theory. He makes a convincing case that string theory fails the most basic test of scientific knowledge: can the theory be proven wrong? We never really know if a theory is ""true,"" so the best we can do, as scientists, is to say a theory is ""not invalid."" So how do you test a theory that invents a world full of infinitesimally small strings vibrating in 11-dimensions? Maybe it will be that string theorists find a way to unify the four force fields in a mathematically satisfying way within their framework - and maybe I will devise a brilliant theory that methed-out garden gnomes are behind the slow disappearance of my sock pairs. Until I see a garden gnome dragging a bag of stolen Walgreen's ephedrine down the street, that theory is of limited utility. All it does is describe a plausible reality, not necessarily the one I live in. But it is a beautiful theory. Shit, I even used 100 years of painstakingly developed group theory to classify the gnome types. How could I be wrong!? Worse yet, can I ever know I'm wrong? That's the important question this book raises about string theory, currently the most popular (and fawned over) fad in theoretical physics. "
6,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,5,"I'm not even going to pretend I understand string theory well enough to have an independent opinion on whether it's right or wrong, or even a decent theory or not. I've read pro-string theory books (Brian Greene's are my favorite) and enjoyed them, but this book makes a pretty good argument that string theory is ""not even wrong"" (i.e. not scientific enough to be wrong). It's not an easy book to read, but even if the math and physics portions fly way over your head (which they will unless you yourself are a particle physicist), the history of how string theory came to be so widely accepted despite the lack of evidence for it is absolutely fascinating."
7,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,2,"The first part of this book is a very well-written brief history of particle physics in the past century. The second part is a rant about string theory, which is not even wrong, and string theorists, who engage in mental masturbation. Well, Kip Thorne thinks otherwise; now, who is Peter Woit and who is Kip Thorne?"
8,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30100163-herb-sonny,5,In this well-written and technically accurate book Woit takes 40-year old string theory out to the woodshed for not having any physical demonstrations of its application to the real world. The hidden cost of continuing to fund the string theory conjecture (not a theory) is that it takes the lion's share of physics research funding at the expense of funding for research in other fields.
9,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,3,"Written by mathematician Woit, the book took on the subject of (super)string theories that are supposed to unified general relativity and quantum mechanics. The rating has nothing to do with the quality of the book itself, but a result of a serious ""impedance mismatch"" between the book and me. The concepts themselves (gauge theory, SU groups, etc.) are non-trivial and there is no way Woit can make it completely clear to laymen what physicists took years to master. But if you use blackboxes as a placeholder for the concepts discusses, the statements soon lose ability to convince, and you have to take his words for it. Nevertheless, the broader picture and general criticism are still clear. Exploration in string theory (which is not even a single theory, but a collection of related math models that once held the hope of uniting relativity and quantum mechanism) has not delivered anything that can be experimentally verified nor the type of rigorously precise thought mathematicians produce. In fact, some recent papers from a pair of string theorists were initially thought to be hoax of incoherent rambling. Yet, they are accepted by reputable journal with long and specific comments from reviewers for editing. The book sounds like a good piece for physics students to read before they intend to choose string theory as a field of endeavor. "
10,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7127461-iain,3,"Chiefly interesting as a mathematician's, rather than a physicist's, view of the string theory controversy (has it failed? is it even a science?) The structure is a bit loose—it begins as a fairly detailed history of quantum field theory, then after assessing string theory it ends with a series of random essays—but it's full of intriguing anecdotes throughout. The mathematical detail is very heavy going, but the suggestions for further reading (both heavier and lighter) are excellent.Overall, not as good as Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, which addresses the same topic in a much more cohesive and approachable way. I recommend starting with that book, and moving on to Not Even Wrong if you want to see more of the nitty-gritty details.Addendum: the Not Even Wrong blog is absolutely great. Worth subscribing even if you don't read the book."
11,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6226405-yasiru,4,"I didn't expect this to be as quick a read as it was (it might have helped that I read Frenkel's Love and Math prior to this and had the likes of SU(3) swimming through my head). It's certainly technical in parts, but doesn't go into too much detail (I don't recall seeing an actual equation).The kind of technical things it mentions seem addressed to the physics community where readers would be able to fill in details from a bird's eye view kind of argument. One reviewer here voiced complaint that no explanation of what the exactly the Atiyah-Singer index theorem is was forthcoming, but I don't think even a rough idea of this kind of abstract result can be communicated to anyone's benefit given the space restrictions.This is the closest to an effective exposition I've found, but it doesn't even try to encompass the full generality of the theorem- http://www.quora.com/How-would-you-in...For the maths of group representations, this video might be helpful- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWhQA...As would be the aforementioned Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality.The first couple of chapters describing the standard model and where particle accelerators come in and the last few (including one about the Bogdanov affair) are much lighter and read like the popular science most of us are used to.The reason I've come short a star in the rating is because I have some philosophical sympathy for Susskind's position. Things might in fact not turn out to be as clean and tractable as we'd like and anthropic reasoning might be inevitable. Woit has convinced me to have a read of Weyl, but I'm not convinced there are guarantees. Though on the other hand, some of the research programmes noted as alternatives to string theory (though unfortunately not discussed at any appreciable depth), like that of Connes, sound fascinating.An unforeseen consequence of my reading Not Even Wrong (the title is from Pauli and resonates with the thought of one of my favourite philosophers- Karl Popper), is that it made me curious about what string theory looks like (as a formalism). All this time, popular accounts gave me the impression that the main appeal of string theory was a degree of mathematical elegance and generality, but Woit (who works in a maths department) seems to contradict this. No doubt supersymmetry and M-theory are heavy going (my grasp even of their nature as described here being very tenuous), but they are at least fruitful exercises in geometry, one hopes.What seems another important side to the story of modern physics is the role of information and computation. This is a complicated story, but these slides suggest some of the possibilities- http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preski...as does Scott Aaronson's Quantum Computing since Democritus, though it takes a complexity theorist's point of view.Finally, it should be said that the most important contribution of Woit's book might be a social one, in that it not only questions the intellectual honesty of the orthodoxy but is also critical of the practices in academia that let theorists avoid due reflection. A significant part of the problem appears to be the failure of administrative policy (which controls grants, post-doctorate positions, etc.) to see that plurality and a critical attitude are what help science thrive. This is also a widespread problem of public perception to be overcome more generally. The difficulty is in part due to relaxing the emphasis that 'science is hard' for the sake of popularisation (ruminating 'how pretty the sky looks!' with different kinds of imaging seems to be many a lay person's idea of science). There aren't any easy answers to this conundrum, but having society learn to think critically seems doubtless part of the eventual answer, which brings us back to the titular Pauli quote and category mistakes."
12,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,0,"""…[H]ow can one separate out what is legitimately science from what is irrational wishful thinking…?"" (loc. 3802)Good question, but as an answer this book was far too technical for me. I read what I could comprehend and scanned the rest. Whenever the author described what he was about to present as ""simple,"" I could be assured I wouldn't understand a word that followed. Once I started skipping the hard parts I got through the book fairly quickly. I managed to get through part of the third chapter before I was forced to scan. In Chapter 13, the author returns to language I can understand.What I did get is that superstring theory, though it contains no equations, makes no falsifiable predictions, and in fact can't even be tested, has managed to survive far longer than other failed theories. Its popularity has persisted for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the sunk cost fallacy. I study a bit on critical thinking, and brilliant people aren't immune to self-delusion. Unfortunately it's a brain drain as brilliant young students continue to pursue this ethereal concept at the expense of other, possibly more fruitful avenues.The arguments made by string theory proponents are much like those made by postmodernists, or by true believers in magic, supernatural deities, or other woo. Science is supposed to filter out this sort of mush. Yes, many scientific theories that we now accept as good science began as speculation, but they made testable predictions, and as finer instrumentation allowed for better observations, if they were good, the data supported them. However, string theory by most definitions doesn't even qualify as a theory -- or even science. You might as well argue for intelligent design -- or homeopathy.As someone with virtually no training in math and physics I found this book mostly incomprehensible. For an accessible general interest book on the subject matter I recommend Coming of Age in the Milky Way by Timothy Ferris http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23.... Ferris seems partial to superstring, but he wrote the book when the theory was new and sexy. Many of the same people and concepts are introduced, but in an entertaining, ""light on science"" manner. It goes back further in history for a look at many other fascinating but failed hypotheses. A book that many reviewers recommend as an alternative for the less physics literate is Lee Smolin's The Trouble With Physics.This book is dated as well. Since its writing, the Large Hadron Collider has been built, and observations such as the Higgs boson and gravitational waves have been made. I'm not qualified to know whether the new findings have had any bearing on superstring or any other theories. But I'm not sure I want to read more arguments about it. This book, what I could understand of it anyway, was pretty convincing.Later chapters address string theory adherents' opposition to Woit's stance and his difficulty finding a publisher. He compares the string theory movement as it grows ever older and shakier to a cult or a religion, and he gives many examples as evidence. He hints that there's even a conspiracy aspect to it. He doesn't seem prone to exaggerate, so I checked out the one-star reviews of this book on Amazon. One particularly vituperative one, which equates Woit's arguments to those of William Dembski (the inventor of ""Intelligent Design""), was written by this guy: http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Lubo%C5%.... Thanks, Motl! Though a bad argument against a view doesn't constitute support for it, behavior like yours is useful to the rational side.I don't feel qualified to rate this book since I'm not its intended audience. I think someone who gives a book that he or she doesn't understand five stars is as dishonest as the referees who allow incoherent nonsense to be published in peer-reviewed journals. (See Chapter 15, ""The Bogdanov Affair."") I probably wouldn't have chosen to read it on my own -- my book group voted for it. Does no stars count as a rating? (According to a comment by one ""Lobstergirl"" on a Goodreads discussion board, the answer is no, so that's what I'm giving it.)"
13,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41132825-dennis-swanger,3,"I bought this book in the hope of gaining some understanding of what string theory is all about. Three weeks and 267 pages later, I know little more than when I started the book. Granted, one of the author's principal goals was to offer a condemnation of string theory as unscientific, and in this he succeeds. Scientific theories must be tested by experiments; to date, string theory hasn't proposed a single experiment to validate its authenticity. The string theory practitioners are, according to Woit, totally in awe of the theory's mathematical elegance. Hundreds of peer-reviewed papers have been published on the myriad complexities of the theory's basic assertions (obviously a tenure-earning, grant-funding boon for many theoretical physicists). But, as Woit maintains, if you can't test it, what good is it? My initial hope of gaining some understanding of string theory was probably naive. Woit does attempt to translate some aspects of the theory into English without introducing any of the complex mathematical base of the theory. I'll trust his word that the mathematics describing string theory is incomprehensible to the public; unfortunately I found Woit's English translation mostly fruitless. His failure is not from lack of trying, or lack of expertise: Woit has a theoretical physics PhD from Princeton and teaches mathematics at Columbia. Perhaps his attempt was damned from the beginning by the nature of the beast: complex mathematical formulations rarely translate into written language. The best string theory description is still Brian Greene's The Fabric of the Cosmos. "
14,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"Why postmodernists love string theoryThis came out the same year that Lee Smolin’s The Trouble with Physics (2006) and it carries the same message, namely that particle physicists need to move away from string theory because it is beginning to look like it isn’t valid science. The main point in both books is that after two or three decades of work on string theory—or superstring theory, M-theory, brane theory, etc.—string theorists are unable to make any predictions that can be scientifically tested.The deep problem for the reader of either book is that only particle physicists themselves can know whether progress is being made. For the rest of us we have to accept what they say on—dare I use the word?—faith. Without empirical support string theory is, as Woit has it, “Not Even Wrong” (the phrase is from Wolfgang Pauli).The Preface and the first two chapters up to page 29 are eminently readable and interesting. Starting with Chapter 3 “Quantum Theory” the book becomes difficult and continues to be more than challenging until Chapter 13 “On Beauty and Difficulty” beginning on page 193 where it becomes readable again. The problem? With or without mathematics it really is impossible to make particle physics understandable to a general readership. Woit tries to make QM and string theory clear without equations and I give him credit for trying. But it is the nature of modern science but especially of something like particle physics that it is impossible to really grasp the subject without years of study.Perhaps the beginnings of trouble for particle physics began in May, 1963 when P.A.M. Dirac famously said “It is more important to have beauty in one’s equations than to have them fit experiment.” (p. 195) This view, shared in some respects by Einstein, is the source of the problem today. While it turned out to be true that some mathematical equations that came before experimental support back in the grand old days of physics proved to be valid many did not. And of course it was understood that experimental support would have to follow otherwise the beautiful math would have to be put aside as wrong, arbitrary or perhaps not even wrong. The interesting thing about the equations in string theory, according to Woit, is that they are not beautiful. (p. 196) I would hasten to point out that beauty is indeed in the eye of the beholder and such claims really get to the heart of the matter: without experimental proof or predictive power, it really doesn’t matter from a scientific point of view whether the math is all that beautiful or not. Woit goes into the politics and economics of present day particle physics with his main point being string theorists control access to all the good jobs and that furthermore once you’re on the string theory path it is hard to get off because of the enormous commitment in terms of time and energy required. So those people in string theory tend to support the theory despite its lack of empirical support because it is their livelihood and they have almost nowhere else to go because as Woit says, “It’s the only game in town” (see Chapter 16). Woit compares string theory to postmodern theory in its arrogance saying that “In both cases, there are practitioners that revel in the difficulty and obscurity of their research, often being overly impressed with themselves because of this. The barriers to understanding what this kind of work entails make it very hard for any outsiders to evaluate what, if anything, has been achieved.” (p. 202)The title of the next chapter is “Is Superstring Theory Science?” and Woit’s answer is no. He writes, “…superstring theory is at the moment unarguably an example of a theory that can’t be falsified, since it makes no predictions.” (p. 207) I would add that this is similar to so-called Intelligent Design, another “theory” that fails because it can’t be falsified. This in a nutshell is why string theory is not science. Here is the situation: you have a “theory,” an edifice of equations and ideas about reality. You have an insolated and esoteric cadre of high priests who are the only ones that have access to this “knowledge,” and you have to take their word for it being true since they can’t prove it. Maybe it is true, maybe it isn’t. Maybe God did part the waters and maybe the Pope really is infallible in certain matters. But without experimental support none of this is science.Woit goes on to remind us of “the Bogdanov affair” in which some string theory mumble jumble got past some peer review journal editors. This sort of thing, reminiscent of the Sokal Hoax from a few years back, suggests that things are indeed getting lax in the same way that postmodern literary journals can be lax since so much of what is expressed is either arbitrary or simply a matter of opinion without any sort of scientific rigor.Woit even cites an anonymous scientist as saying that there is a string theory “mafia” in charge of the physic departments in our prestigious universities (p. 223). On the next page he has an “excitable” “Harvard faculty member” say that “those who criticized the funding of superstring theory were terrorists who deserved to be eliminated by the U.S. military.” Woit adds, “I’m afraid he seemed to be serious about this.” (p. 224)I have read books by renowned physicists Leonard Susskind and Brian Greene in which they come out strongly in support of string theory and hopeful that it will someday gain some experimental proof or be formulated in such a way that predictions can be made. But to be candid I feel they are in the unfortunate position of people who have to justify a lifetime of work otherwise admit that they might have better spent their time in other pursuits. The cognitive dissonance they face is difficult to resolve even for august scientists. Richard Feynman is quoted on page 246 as saying, “String theorists make excuses, not predictions.”Okay, why does this really matter? It matters because this unscientific approach from string theory gives aid and comfort to not only postmodernists who believe that all of science is merely a social construction but also to creationists who can now claim that string theory and their intelligent design theory are similar in that neither one is falsifiable. If this is the case, by what authority do we choose one and not the other? In other words, a non-falsifiable string theory is a retreat from science into something akin to religion. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

Not a good introduction to the subject - as an engineer with several pop physics books under my belt, I was dangling by a finger for most of the time I was reading. But it's rewarding and edifying, and provides an answer to the person who reads The Elegant Universe and then talks about it at parties (I admit this with sadness, being the prime example of that flavor of asininity)."

If you want to know his arguments about ST, just read from Ch. 11.This book is exactly what is says on the cover, a critics to String Theory. I just finished a String theory course in my university (I'm a graduate student in Physics), and I really liked it, so I was wondering whether I should get to know it more. Does this book provide some solid critics to it? Since I was interested only in the part against String Theory, I read chapters 1 and 2, skipped the rest and read from the 11th chapter onwards. That is the interesting part, because the rest is interesting only if you want to know more about modern physics, QM, Standard model, and so on. In fact, if you are NOT acquainted with modern physics, you should skip the more technical parts, indicated in some parts by ""mathematical digression"", it will spoil the reading in my opinion, i.e., it will make you tired of it very quickly. You don't need any math here.I do like his intellectual honesty, which perspires from his reading, and in fact I do almost completely agree with most of his arguments against research in ST (mostly concentrated in Ch. 12 and 13). Maybe at some point I will write a more complete review with bullet points argument by argument.In my understanding, what we can take out of ST are the mathematical methods used in it, as he also mentions talking about the fact that ST took theoretical physics and mathematics closer. This is also the reason why I took the course in the first place. I wanted to see what's all the fuss about the subject, and why people say it's beautiful. It indeed is. For the moment I just cannot like the idea of supersymmetry, which I find ridiculous. Isn't there any other way to include fermions in the theory, I wonder?I do like the fact that his arguments are logically connected. About his writing, it's very clear and I can see it was edited very well, usually mathematicians are not champions of clarity. In fact as a physics student I often do struggle in reading their manuscripts. "

He goes in deep into the fundamental issues and the background of modern physical theory, offering a rather thorough overview and history of modern quantum field theories from a mathematician’s standpoint rooted in geometry and topology. I hung in there for a while, I really did, I know what an algebra is, I can mess around with them, I even know what a symmetry, a group, or a representation are, but even so at one point I just had to throw in the towel and start glossing over all the technical details waiting for the talk to return to more understandable ground. This is definitely not your average popular science book, and it may even be debatable whether it is popular science at all despite containing no actual math or physics (as in – equations, derivations, etc.), but I do get why he did what he did. He dared touch a hornets’ nest and he had to throw up a very solid defense against those same hornets responding with “oh, you just don’t understand what you are talking about”, but damn did that approach produce a book with a demanding entry threshold (and from what I gather, some hornets tried the response anyway).Outside that historical overview of the development of modern physics he does present some considerably more readable chapters on philosophy and sociology of science that aim to wrestle with the question of whether string theory is... well, anything at all, other than a clunky mathematical construct with no relations to actual physical reality and why it has become the mainstream. Some of his questions have been answered in the meantime, what with the LHC becoming operational and hitting on the famed Higgs boson, and I get the impression that strings have lost some of their shine in the meantime, but it is nevertheless a fascinating read about some very smart people being, well, people, and about all the problems that modern cutting edge physics has to face after being too successful for its own good."
18,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"This book is a devastating takedown of string theory/theories in all of their current forms. The author starts with a walk through the state of standard model as well as its apparent free parameters (values that need to be empirically measured and don't seem to be determinable from first principles). The author talks about the various mis-steps in the development of the standard model and questions it leaves unanswered. Then the rest of the book is discussion of the largest contenders to extend/replace the standard model. This section is humbling for anyone who things physics will be trivially extended. The flip side is that the book does a commendable job indicating just how powerful, rigorous, and consistent the standard model is.Supersymmetry is shown to either require massive particles orders of magnitude beyond what we can detect or phenomena we should have observed by now but haven't. Following is by far the most rigorous takedown of string theory I've encountered. The author dissects the failures of both 10 and 11 dimensional as well as 24 dimensional models as well as the culture that has generated neither useful experiments nor actual progress. The author quickly calls out those seduced by mathematical beauty and points out places in the past where such pursuits have simply failed compared to the very small number of times (discovery of the positron) where such pursuit presaged a new discovery. String theory as currently understood fails coherency (the set of predictions are not internally consistent), powerful (they don't predict new testable phenomena), nor rigorous (they depend often on a procedurally generated space of parameters leading to a hundred free parameters).The next best section of this book are the chapter end notes where the author lists texts that the curious can use to further investigate a topic. Rare is the book that on reading compels me to buy six more, this is the rare one that does."

29,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2665750-sarah,2,"Kind of disappointed by this one. I recently read Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions as part of an effort to read some books that have been sitting on my to-read shelf for quite a while, and because of when it was published, it's full of references to all kinds of theoretical questions that could be answered by the then-soon-to-activate Large Hadron Collider. Well, the LHC has been operating for the better part of a decade by now, and although we're pretty sure it's allowed us to confirm existence of the Higgs boson, it hasn't seemed to show us extra dimensions or new supersymmetric particles or any other clues that string theory is on the right track. Indeed, it mostly seems to be providing observations in line with the boring old Standard Model. So I was hoping that by reading this book, I might get an idea of where physics could go from here. I was also intrigued by the author's idea that the best fruits of string theory so far might actually be found in the field of mathematics, and I was hoping to understand that better. Unfortunately, after reading the whole book, I didn't feel any more enlightened than I had after reading the cover flap. The author made points that seemed to me to be fair criticisms of string theory - e.g. it doesn't make falsifiable predictions, it's often said to be simple and beautiful but it really isn't, etc. - but I couldn't for the life of me understand the technical details he provided in support. And I remain lost at sea as to where mathematics was before string theory and what new...understandings? techniques? we have now. Maybe I just don't have sufficient background knowledge of the subjects - but I don't know, I've been exposed to the Standard Model and the history of its development in several different tellings, and this was one of the least comprehensible versions I've read. So I'm inclined to think that it must be possible to create more lucid and accessible explanations of the topics that are less familiar to me as well. Too bad I didn't find what I was looking for here."
30,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"A good dissenting voice against the majority string theory hype in pop sci. Since it came out a decade ago in 2006, it's interesting to see how the various references to future experiments at the LHC have played out, mainly in Woit's favor.First half is a zippy recap of particle physics theory & experimental validation over the past decades, with the detail growing thicker as Woit approaches the present. If, like me, you're not already familiar with ideas & terminology in this area, this certainly isn't the book to bring you up to speed. Unlike, eg, Greene's ""Fabric of the Cosmos"", Woit doesn't waste much time trying to explain the concepts he's dishing out by way of analogy or simplification. He deigns to give just a sentence or two of explanation before it's off to the next idea. The best I was able to do was recognize when bits of jargon on symmetry groups, the standard model, and related mathematical theories started to recur, providing if nothing else an indication of which ideas were thriving or falling out of fashion over time. I would have loved if the book were 100 pages longer and contained more thorough concept explanation for non-experts; but, to his credit, Woit does provide useful references for further study at the end of each chapter.Second half brings relief from the jargon train as the writing switches to a thorough, mostly non-technical argument that string theory is a dead end for particle physics. I'm in no position to call his argument correct or not, but it is at the very least convincing. Despite the incendiary title, Woit's arguments are generally polite, and he anchors his opposition to specific, arguably valid failures in string theory over its multi-decade history.Great read that I'd recommend to anybody who's looking for a second popular-level opinion on string theory's strengths & weaknesses."
31,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"I've been following the arguments made by Peter Woit against String Theory for quite some time, and it's a pleasure to be able to have them all in a single volume. His arguments are very persuasive, and his writing clear and to the point. This, however, is not a book that the general audience will find easy to follow. The earlier chapters recount the canonical story of the success of the particle physics in the 20th century, and if you are familiar with that story you can safely skip these chapters. The later chapters are the really interesting ones, but unless you have at least some familiarity with theoretical particle physics and the modern mathematics, you might find yourself lost. Even with that caveat it is still possible to appreciate the central theme of this book: theoretical particle physics took a wrong turn somewhere in the late 70s and the early 80s, and has never been able to recover from this. Woit is appealing in this book to the practitioners in the field to be more honest with their assessments of the direction in which the theoretical particle physics is headed, and the lack of any meaningful progress. Unfortunately, I am very sceptical of the potential impact of this book on the field of particle physics. The Emperor is naked, but he is perceived as irrelevant as well."
32,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4889938-carmen,4,"The first chapters are extremely technical so you are likely to skip them if you are not a specialist. I found the last chapters interesting, which contained the criticism of String Theory. To be honest, I found these criticisms to be rooted in the lack of imagination that often characterizes experimentalists, though the author is a mathematician. He claims that String Theory is not a science because it makes no predictions, but later goes on to say that mathematics does not make predictions eiter, yet it is a science. Get your criteria straight! What do I mean by lack of imagination? Well, one of the problems with String Theory is that it requires more dimensiona than we perceive in order for the math to work. Apparently, this is a problem. But I think it would only be a problem for someone who thinks what we perceive is always all there is to what exists. If we thougt like that we would still thinkthe Sun goes around the Earth.We cannot probe at the scale necessary to make experiments around this stuff. However, I am of the opinion that if the math is consistent, it should tell you something. I find it odd to see a mathematician, who should be very comfortable with the abstract, require something so concrete when it comes to another theoretical science.4 stars for the entertaining value of the last chapters."
33,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,3,"I wanted to like this book so much, because it offers factual backing for my personal dislike of string theory (saying it's hand-waving is a far cry from being able to say why it's hand-waving)...but even with Woit's attempts to simplify information, I think I would have gotten a lot more out of this if I had taken linear algebra. Of course, since I haven't taken linear algebra, this might not be the right math, but the point remains that single-variable calculus eleven years ago doesn't prepare you for a world of gauge symmetries and multidimensional vector transformations.That said, I still learned a lot more about particle physics than sources geared more towards the layman (sorry, particleadventure.org, I still love you)—but I only learned about a fraction of what this book has to offer.A more 'history of science' approach to the interplay of particle physics and pure mathematics, and then the huge movement string theory has become despite its lack of experimental confirmation, would probably be a better read for most people, as the approach here offers a level of grounding in the subject matter that still requires more prior knowledge than most people are likely to have."

As physics overviews for the layman go, this is one math and concept intensive tour du force... and yet I felt like it gave me an insight into particle physics that I've never gotten from the many many other books on the subject that I've read - specifically because it gave me even this tiny glimpse into the mathematics of the subject, and how important that has been in the evolution of the Standard Model.The stuff about gauge theory and symmetries... wow, I've heard of those things, but this very rapidly went beyond anything I've studied before (and beyond what I could really understand). Yet even though I was in over my head I learned the essence of why this particular mathematician/physicist believes (based on his extensive training and work) that string theory is not even a theory. And I buy his explanation.I give the book three stars (and not four or five) only because it's so dense and would probably discourage many readers."

He does raise some compelling arguments relating to the failed science and, surprisingly the elegance of the theory. The second half is a big payoff, but the first -- focused on the interwoven history of mathematics and physics in the 20th Century -- was a bit of a trial for me. Woit could be clearer in his explanations (although admittedly a novice like me is probably not his intended audience), and he's not always successful in tying in this history to his key argument about the failure of string theory.Also interesting, but brief, is his take on the current status of the academy's (and government's) influence on the direction of contemporary physics, and the culture that has arisen in part from those influences."

Like Lee Smolin's ""The Trouble With Physics"" this physicist is a skeptic about String Theory which has become the dominant sub-field in physics in US academia in recent years. And like Smolin's book, it is an interesting blend of non-mathematical discussion of the physics itself, and the problematic sociology of science that has led to what both authors feel is an unhealthy monopoly String Theory and its variations currently holds in the US.

These two unproven (and, I believe, unprovable) notions have convinced modern scientists that the Unknown can somehow be wiped away, as if it were a stain, with a mathematical sponge.But how do scientists believe in something that is not experimentally verified? ...Faith. God help us - Faith!The theologians of the next universal religion are being schooled by physicists today!Again, string theory now frankly involves speculation that is, almost by definition, untestable. Physics is therefore on its way to a cosmological/mythological/theological (cum mathematical) understanding of Reality. It is funny that no one realizes it. So long as there is the 'Unknown' there will be Religion. Various religions come and go; but Religion (very, very broadly conceived) always remains...Like the ancient Ptolemaic System, string theory is a mathematical induced hallucination, and like the ancient geocentric model, it will eventually be overturned, by new observations.Besides this book have a look at ""The Trouble with Physics"" by Lee Smolin."

Since it came out a decade ago in 2006, it's interesting to see how the various references to future experiments at the LHC have played out, mainly in Woit's favor.First half is a zippy recap of particle physics theory & experimental validation over the past decades, with the detail growing thicker as Woit approaches the present. If, like me, you're not already familiar with ideas & terminology in this area, this certainly isn't the book to bring you up to speed. Unlike, eg, Greene's ""Fabric of the Cosmos"", Woit doesn't waste much time trying to explain the concepts he's dishing out by way of analogy or simplification. He deigns to give just a sentence or two of explanation before it's off to the next idea. The best I was able to do was recognize when bits of jargon on symmetry groups, the standard model, and related mathematical theories started to recur, providing if nothing else an indication of which ideas were thriving or falling out of fashion over time. I would have loved if the book were 100 pages longer and contained more thorough concept explanation for non-experts; but, to his credit, Woit does provide useful references for further study at the end of each chapter.Second half brings relief from the jargon train as the writing switches to a thorough, mostly non-technical argument that string theory is a dead end for particle physics. I'm in no position to call his argument correct or not, but it is at the very least convincing. Despite the incendiary title, Woit's arguments are generally polite, and he anchors his opposition to specific, arguably valid failures in string theory over its multi-decade history.Great read that I'd recommend to anybody who's looking for a second popular-level opinion on string theory's strengths & weaknesses."
60,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"I've been following the arguments made by Peter Woit against String Theory for quite some time, and it's a pleasure to be able to have them all in a single volume. His arguments are very persuasive, and his writing clear and to the point. This, however, is not a book that the general audience will find easy to follow. The earlier chapters recount the canonical story of the success of the particle physics in the 20th century, and if you are familiar with that story you can safely skip these chapters. The later chapters are the really interesting ones, but unless you have at least some familiarity with theoretical particle physics and the modern mathematics, you might find yourself lost. Even with that caveat it is still possible to appreciate the central theme of this book: theoretical particle physics took a wrong turn somewhere in the late 70s and the early 80s, and has never been able to recover from this. Woit is appealing in this book to the practitioners in the field to be more honest with their assessments of the direction in which the theoretical particle physics is headed, and the lack of any meaningful progress. Unfortunately, I am very sceptical of the potential impact of this book on the field of particle physics. The Emperor is naked, but he is perceived as irrelevant as well."
61,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4889938-carmen,4,"The first chapters are extremely technical so you are likely to skip them if you are not a specialist. I found the last chapters interesting, which contained the criticism of String Theory. To be honest, I found these criticisms to be rooted in the lack of imagination that often characterizes experimentalists, though the author is a mathematician. He claims that String Theory is not a science because it makes no predictions, but later goes on to say that mathematics does not make predictions eiter, yet it is a science. Get your criteria straight! What do I mean by lack of imagination? Well, one of the problems with String Theory is that it requires more dimensiona than we perceive in order for the math to work. Apparently, this is a problem. But I think it would only be a problem for someone who thinks what we perceive is always all there is to what exists. If we thougt like that we would still thinkthe Sun goes around the Earth.We cannot probe at the scale necessary to make experiments around this stuff. However, I am of the opinion that if the math is consistent, it should tell you something. I find it odd to see a mathematician, who should be very comfortable with the abstract, require something so concrete when it comes to another theoretical science.4 stars for the entertaining value of the last chapters."

Of course, since I haven't taken linear algebra, this might not be the right math, but the point remains that single-variable calculus eleven years ago doesn't prepare you for a world of gauge symmetries and multidimensional vector transformations.That said, I still learned a lot more about particle physics than sources geared more towards the layman (sorry, particleadventure.org, I still love you)—but I only learned about a fraction of what this book has to offer.A more 'history of science' approach to the interplay of particle physics and pure mathematics, and then the huge movement string theory has become despite its lack of experimental confirmation, would probably be a better read for most people, as the approach here offers a level of grounding in the subject matter that still requires more prior knowledge than most people are likely to have."

Yet even though I was in over my head I learned the essence of why this particular mathematician/physicist believes (based on his extensive training and work) that string theory is not even a theory. And I buy his explanation.I give the book three stars (and not four or five) only because it's so dense and would probably discourage many readers."

The second half is a big payoff, but the first -- focused on the interwoven history of mathematics and physics in the 20th Century -- was a bit of a trial for me. Woit could be clearer in his explanations (although admittedly a novice like me is probably not his intended audience), and he's not always successful in tying in this history to his key argument about the failure of string theory.Also interesting, but brief, is his take on the current status of the academy's (and government's) influence on the direction of contemporary physics, and the culture that has arisen in part from those influences."

It's basically an impossible task, but this one seems to do better than most. By which I mean that I was left with the pleasant sensation that I understood....something. At least for a while. Like Lee Smolin's ""The Trouble With Physics"" this physicist is a skeptic about String Theory which has become the dominant sub-field in physics in US academia in recent years. And like Smolin's book, it is an interesting blend of non-mathematical discussion of the physics itself, and the problematic sociology of science that has led to what both authors feel is an unhealthy monopoly String Theory and its variations currently holds in the US.

Still, he makes his main points convincingly, and although the book is now seriously out of date, time seems only to have proved him right.

He chronicles how the field has come to this very disappointing conclusion, and how they have tried, via anthropic arguments, to rescue the theory.Another book, from a different perspective, is Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics""."

God help us - Faith!The theologians of the next universal religion are being schooled by physicists today!Again, string theory now frankly involves speculation that is, almost by definition, untestable. Physics is therefore on its way to a cosmological/mythological/theological (cum mathematical) understanding of Reality. It is funny that no one realizes it. So long as there is the 'Unknown' there will be Religion.

117,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"A good dissenting voice against the majority string theory hype in pop sci. Since it came out a decade ago in 2006, it's interesting to see how the various references to future experiments at the LHC have played out, mainly in Woit's favor.First half is a zippy recap of particle physics theory & experimental validation over the past decades, with the detail growing thicker as Woit approaches the present. If, like me, you're not already familiar with ideas & terminology in this area, this certainly isn't the book to bring you up to speed. Unlike, eg, Greene's ""Fabric of the Cosmos"", Woit doesn't waste much time trying to explain the concepts he's dishing out by way of analogy or simplification. He deigns to give just a sentence or two of explanation before it's off to the next idea. The best I was able to do was recognize when bits of jargon on symmetry groups, the standard model, and related mathematical theories started to recur, providing if nothing else an indication of which ideas were thriving or falling out of fashion over time. I would have loved if the book were 100 pages longer and contained more thorough concept explanation for non-experts; but, to his credit, Woit does provide useful references for further study at the end of each chapter.Second half brings relief from the jargon train as the writing switches to a thorough, mostly non-technical argument that string theory is a dead end for particle physics. I'm in no position to call his argument correct or not, but it is at the very least convincing. Despite the incendiary title, Woit's arguments are generally polite, and he anchors his opposition to specific, arguably valid failures in string theory over its multi-decade history.Great read that I'd recommend to anybody who's looking for a second popular-level opinion on string theory's strengths & weaknesses."
118,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"I've been following the arguments made by Peter Woit against String Theory for quite some time, and it's a pleasure to be able to have them all in a single volume. His arguments are very persuasive, and his writing clear and to the point. This, however, is not a book that the general audience will find easy to follow. The earlier chapters recount the canonical story of the success of the particle physics in the 20th century, and if you are familiar with that story you can safely skip these chapters. The later chapters are the really interesting ones, but unless you have at least some familiarity with theoretical particle physics and the modern mathematics, you might find yourself lost. Even with that caveat it is still possible to appreciate the central theme of this book: theoretical particle physics took a wrong turn somewhere in the late 70s and the early 80s, and has never been able to recover from this. Woit is appealing in this book to the practitioners in the field to be more honest with their assessments of the direction in which the theoretical particle physics is headed, and the lack of any meaningful progress. Unfortunately, I am very sceptical of the potential impact of this book on the field of particle physics. The Emperor is naked, but he is perceived as irrelevant as well."
119,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4889938-carmen,4,"The first chapters are extremely technical so you are likely to skip them if you are not a specialist. I found the last chapters interesting, which contained the criticism of String Theory. To be honest, I found these criticisms to be rooted in the lack of imagination that often characterizes experimentalists, though the author is a mathematician. He claims that String Theory is not a science because it makes no predictions, but later goes on to say that mathematics does not make predictions eiter, yet it is a science. Get your criteria straight! What do I mean by lack of imagination? Well, one of the problems with String Theory is that it requires more dimensiona than we perceive in order for the math to work. Apparently, this is a problem. But I think it would only be a problem for someone who thinks what we perceive is always all there is to what exists. If we thougt like that we would still thinkthe Sun goes around the Earth.We cannot probe at the scale necessary to make experiments around this stuff. However, I am of the opinion that if the math is consistent, it should tell you something. I find it odd to see a mathematician, who should be very comfortable with the abstract, require something so concrete when it comes to another theoretical science.4 stars for the entertaining value of the last chapters."
120,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,3,"I wanted to like this book so much, because it offers factual backing for my personal dislike of string theory (saying it's hand-waving is a far cry from being able to say why it's hand-waving)...but even with Woit's attempts to simplify information, I think I would have gotten a lot more out of this if I had taken linear algebra. Of course, since I haven't taken linear algebra, this might not be the right math, but the point remains that single-variable calculus eleven years ago doesn't prepare you for a world of gauge symmetries and multidimensional vector transformations.That said, I still learned a lot more about particle physics than sources geared more towards the layman (sorry, particleadventure.org, I still love you)—but I only learned about a fraction of what this book has to offer.A more 'history of science' approach to the interplay of particle physics and pure mathematics, and then the huge movement string theory has become despite its lack of experimental confirmation, would probably be a better read for most people, as the approach here offers a level of grounding in the subject matter that still requires more prior knowledge than most people are likely to have."
121,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1595511-kiri,3,"This was particularly useful to me, although to be frank I ended up paging past entire sections that were over my head. As physics overviews for the layman go, this is one math and concept intensive tour du force... and yet I felt like it gave me an insight into particle physics that I've never gotten from the many many other books on the subject that I've read - specifically because it gave me even this tiny glimpse into the mathematics of the subject, and how important that has been in the evolution of the Standard Model.The stuff about gauge theory and symmetries... wow, I've heard of those things, but this very rapidly went beyond anything I've studied before (and beyond what I could really understand). Yet even though I was in over my head I learned the essence of why this particular mathematician/physicist believes (based on his extensive training and work) that string theory is not even a theory. And I buy his explanation.I give the book three stars (and not four or five) only because it's so dense and would probably discourage many readers."
122,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/169481-justin,3,"Woit has some issues with the general approach of string theorists, which he's only partially successful in countering. He does raise some compelling arguments relating to the failed science and, surprisingly the elegance of the theory. The second half is a big payoff, but the first -- focused on the interwoven history of mathematics and physics in the 20th Century -- was a bit of a trial for me. Woit could be clearer in his explanations (although admittedly a novice like me is probably not his intended audience), and he's not always successful in tying in this history to his key argument about the failure of string theory.Also interesting, but brief, is his take on the current status of the academy's (and government's) influence on the direction of contemporary physics, and the culture that has arisen in part from those influences."
123,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639456-tim,4,"Yet another attempt to explain 20th/21st c. physics in a no-math way to a non-technical audience, with the usual less-than-satisfactory results. It's basically an impossible task, but this one seems to do better than most. By which I mean that I was left with the pleasant sensation that I understood....something. At least for a while. Like Lee Smolin's ""The Trouble With Physics"" this physicist is a skeptic about String Theory which has become the dominant sub-field in physics in US academia in recent years. And like Smolin's book, it is an interesting blend of non-mathematical discussion of the physics itself, and the problematic sociology of science that has led to what both authors feel is an unhealthy monopoly String Theory and its variations currently holds in the US. "
124,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42000575-ian-murray-watson,3,"Not in my view a book for the layman. I've read many books on quantum theory in which the basic idea are far better explained for non-physicists (and non-mathematicians). He frequently uses the phrase ""in a sense"" as in ""A is in a sense the negative of B"" - so often that one wants to scream 'in what sense>?' or 'is it or isn't it?' Still, he makes his main points convincingly, and although the book is now seriously out of date, time seems only to have proved him right. Also quite good as a source of impenetrable phrases for my next fantasy - renormalisability, SU(1) + SU(2) = heaven known what, invariant with respect to super-symmetrical transformations according to Yang-Mills theory (I can make them up too) ... "
125,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/170768-jon-larimer,3,"It took me a while to get through this. I read a bunch of other popular-physics books from Kaku, Greene, et al, mostly very pro-string theory, and they were much more accessible. There are a few concepts I had trouble with, but it didn't really detract from the overall message of the book. Woit comes from a math background so he has an outsider's perspective on string theory. I agree with his conclusion that string theory is getting dangerously close to not being science anymore. I enjoyed the first part of the book outlining the history of particle accelerators, and I'd like to read more about that subject."

Woit points out in great detail how that in spite of 25 years of concerted effort by some of the greatest minds of our planet, the proponents of string theory still have not provided any crisp, quantifiable, falsifiable prediction that can be tested in real-world physical experiments. He chronicles how the field has come to this very disappointing conclusion, and how they have tried, via anthropic arguments, to rescue the theory.Another book, from a different perspective, is Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics""."

As physics overviews for the layman go, this is one math and concept intensive tour du force... and yet I felt like it gave me an insight into particle physics that I've never gotten from the many many other books on the subject that I've read - specifically because it gave me even this tiny glimpse into the mathematics of the subject, and how important that has been in the evolution of the Standard Model.The stuff about gauge theory and symmetries... wow, I've heard of those things, but this very rapidly went beyond anything I've studied before (and beyond what I could really understand). Yet even though I was in over my head I learned the essence of why this particular mathematician/physicist believes (based on his extensive training and work) that string theory is not even a theory. And I buy his explanation.I give the book three stars (and not four or five) only because it's so dense and would probably discourage many readers."
151,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/169481-justin,3,"Woit has some issues with the general approach of string theorists, which he's only partially successful in countering. He does raise some compelling arguments relating to the failed science and, surprisingly the elegance of the theory. The second half is a big payoff, but the first -- focused on the interwoven history of mathematics and physics in the 20th Century -- was a bit of a trial for me. Woit could be clearer in his explanations (although admittedly a novice like me is probably not his intended audience), and he's not always successful in tying in this history to his key argument about the failure of string theory.Also interesting, but brief, is his take on the current status of the academy's (and government's) influence on the direction of contemporary physics, and the culture that has arisen in part from those influences."
152,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639456-tim,4,"Yet another attempt to explain 20th/21st c. physics in a no-math way to a non-technical audience, with the usual less-than-satisfactory results. It's basically an impossible task, but this one seems to do better than most. By which I mean that I was left with the pleasant sensation that I understood....something. At least for a while. Like Lee Smolin's ""The Trouble With Physics"" this physicist is a skeptic about String Theory which has become the dominant sub-field in physics in US academia in recent years. And like Smolin's book, it is an interesting blend of non-mathematical discussion of the physics itself, and the problematic sociology of science that has led to what both authors feel is an unhealthy monopoly String Theory and its variations currently holds in the US.

He frequently uses the phrase ""in a sense"" as in ""A is in a sense the negative of B"" - so often that one wants to scream 'in what sense>?' or 'is it or isn't it?' Still, he makes his main points convincingly, and although the book is now seriously out of date, time seems only to have proved him right. Also quite good as a source of impenetrable phrases for my next fantasy - renormalisability, SU(1) + SU(2) = heaven known what, invariant with respect to super-symmetrical transformations according to Yang-Mills theory (I can make them up too) ...

I read a bunch of other popular-physics books from Kaku, Greene, et al, mostly very pro-string theory, and they were much more accessible. There are a few concepts I had trouble with, but it didn't really detract from the overall message of the book. Woit comes from a math background so he has an outsider's perspective on string theory. I agree with his conclusion that string theory is getting dangerously close to not being science anymore.

He chronicles how the field has come to this very disappointing conclusion, and how they have tried, via anthropic arguments, to rescue the theory.Another book, from a different perspective, is Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics""."

God help us - Faith!The theologians of the next universal religion are being schooled by physicists today!Again, string theory now frankly involves speculation that is, almost by definition, untestable. Physics is therefore on its way to a cosmological/mythological/theological (cum mathematical) understanding of Reality. It is funny that no one realizes it. So long as there is the 'Unknown' there will be Religion.

175,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"A good dissenting voice against the majority string theory hype in pop sci. Since it came out a decade ago in 2006, it's interesting to see how the various references to future experiments at the LHC have played out, mainly in Woit's favor.First half is a zippy recap of particle physics theory & experimental validation over the past decades, with the detail growing thicker as Woit approaches the present. If, like me, you're not already familiar with ideas & terminology in this area, this certainly isn't the book to bring you up to speed. Unlike, eg, Greene's ""Fabric of the Cosmos"", Woit doesn't waste much time trying to explain the concepts he's dishing out by way of analogy or simplification. He deigns to give just a sentence or two of explanation before it's off to the next idea. The best I was able to do was recognize when bits of jargon on symmetry groups, the standard model, and related mathematical theories started to recur, providing if nothing else an indication of which ideas were thriving or falling out of fashion over time. I would have loved if the book were 100 pages longer and contained more thorough concept explanation for non-experts; but, to his credit, Woit does provide useful references for further study at the end of each chapter.Second half brings relief from the jargon train as the writing switches to a thorough, mostly non-technical argument that string theory is a dead end for particle physics. I'm in no position to call his argument correct or not, but it is at the very least convincing. Despite the incendiary title, Woit's arguments are generally polite, and he anchors his opposition to specific, arguably valid failures in string theory over its multi-decade history.Great read that I'd recommend to anybody who's looking for a second popular-level opinion on string theory's strengths & weaknesses."
176,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"I've been following the arguments made by Peter Woit against String Theory for quite some time, and it's a pleasure to be able to have them all in a single volume. His arguments are very persuasive, and his writing clear and to the point. This, however, is not a book that the general audience will find easy to follow. The earlier chapters recount the canonical story of the success of the particle physics in the 20th century, and if you are familiar with that story you can safely skip these chapters. The later chapters are the really interesting ones, but unless you have at least some familiarity with theoretical particle physics and the modern mathematics, you might find yourself lost. Even with that caveat it is still possible to appreciate the central theme of this book: theoretical particle physics took a wrong turn somewhere in the late 70s and the early 80s, and has never been able to recover from this. Woit is appealing in this book to the practitioners in the field to be more honest with their assessments of the direction in which the theoretical particle physics is headed, and the lack of any meaningful progress. Unfortunately, I am very sceptical of the potential impact of this book on the field of particle physics. The Emperor is naked, but he is perceived as irrelevant as well."
177,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4889938-carmen,4,"The first chapters are extremely technical so you are likely to skip them if you are not a specialist. I found the last chapters interesting, which contained the criticism of String Theory. To be honest, I found these criticisms to be rooted in the lack of imagination that often characterizes experimentalists, though the author is a mathematician. He claims that String Theory is not a science because it makes no predictions, but later goes on to say that mathematics does not make predictions eiter, yet it is a science. Get your criteria straight! What do I mean by lack of imagination? Well, one of the problems with String Theory is that it requires more dimensiona than we perceive in order for the math to work. Apparently, this is a problem. But I think it would only be a problem for someone who thinks what we perceive is always all there is to what exists. If we thougt like that we would still thinkthe Sun goes around the Earth.We cannot probe at the scale necessary to make experiments around this stuff. However, I am of the opinion that if the math is consistent, it should tell you something. I find it odd to see a mathematician, who should be very comfortable with the abstract, require something so concrete when it comes to another theoretical science.4 stars for the entertaining value of the last chapters."

204,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"A good dissenting voice against the majority string theory hype in pop sci. Since it came out a decade ago in 2006, it's interesting to see how the various references to future experiments at the LHC have played out, mainly in Woit's favor.First half is a zippy recap of particle physics theory & experimental validation over the past decades, with the detail growing thicker as Woit approaches the present. If, like me, you're not already familiar with ideas & terminology in this area, this certainly isn't the book to bring you up to speed. Unlike, eg, Greene's ""Fabric of the Cosmos"", Woit doesn't waste much time trying to explain the concepts he's dishing out by way of analogy or simplification. He deigns to give just a sentence or two of explanation before it's off to the next idea. The best I was able to do was recognize when bits of jargon on symmetry groups, the standard model, and related mathematical theories started to recur, providing if nothing else an indication of which ideas were thriving or falling out of fashion over time. I would have loved if the book were 100 pages longer and contained more thorough concept explanation for non-experts; but, to his credit, Woit does provide useful references for further study at the end of each chapter.Second half brings relief from the jargon train as the writing switches to a thorough, mostly non-technical argument that string theory is a dead end for particle physics. I'm in no position to call his argument correct or not, but it is at the very least convincing. Despite the incendiary title, Woit's arguments are generally polite, and he anchors his opposition to specific, arguably valid failures in string theory over its multi-decade history.Great read that I'd recommend to anybody who's looking for a second popular-level opinion on string theory's strengths & weaknesses."
205,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"I've been following the arguments made by Peter Woit against String Theory for quite some time, and it's a pleasure to be able to have them all in a single volume. His arguments are very persuasive, and his writing clear and to the point. This, however, is not a book that the general audience will find easy to follow. The earlier chapters recount the canonical story of the success of the particle physics in the 20th century, and if you are familiar with that story you can safely skip these chapters. The later chapters are the really interesting ones, but unless you have at least some familiarity with theoretical particle physics and the modern mathematics, you might find yourself lost. Even with that caveat it is still possible to appreciate the central theme of this book: theoretical particle physics took a wrong turn somewhere in the late 70s and the early 80s, and has never been able to recover from this. Woit is appealing in this book to the practitioners in the field to be more honest with their assessments of the direction in which the theoretical particle physics is headed, and the lack of any meaningful progress. Unfortunately, I am very sceptical of the potential impact of this book on the field of particle physics. The Emperor is naked, but he is perceived as irrelevant as well."
206,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4889938-carmen,4,"The first chapters are extremely technical so you are likely to skip them if you are not a specialist. I found the last chapters interesting, which contained the criticism of String Theory. To be honest, I found these criticisms to be rooted in the lack of imagination that often characterizes experimentalists, though the author is a mathematician. He claims that String Theory is not a science because it makes no predictions, but later goes on to say that mathematics does not make predictions eiter, yet it is a science. Get your criteria straight! What do I mean by lack of imagination? Well, one of the problems with String Theory is that it requires more dimensiona than we perceive in order for the math to work. Apparently, this is a problem. But I think it would only be a problem for someone who thinks what we perceive is always all there is to what exists. If we thougt like that we would still thinkthe Sun goes around the Earth.We cannot probe at the scale necessary to make experiments around this stuff. However, I am of the opinion that if the math is consistent, it should tell you something. I find it odd to see a mathematician, who should be very comfortable with the abstract, require something so concrete when it comes to another theoretical science.4 stars for the entertaining value of the last chapters."
207,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,3,"I wanted to like this book so much, because it offers factual backing for my personal dislike of string theory (saying it's hand-waving is a far cry from being able to say why it's hand-waving)...but even with Woit's attempts to simplify information, I think I would have gotten a lot more out of this if I had taken linear algebra. Of course, since I haven't taken linear algebra, this might not be the right math, but the point remains that single-variable calculus eleven years ago doesn't prepare you for a world of gauge symmetries and multidimensional vector transformations.That said, I still learned a lot more about particle physics than sources geared more towards the layman (sorry, particleadventure.org, I still love you)—but I only learned about a fraction of what this book has to offer.A more 'history of science' approach to the interplay of particle physics and pure mathematics, and then the huge movement string theory has become despite its lack of experimental confirmation, would probably be a better read for most people, as the approach here offers a level of grounding in the subject matter that still requires more prior knowledge than most people are likely to have."
208,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1595511-kiri,3,"This was particularly useful to me, although to be frank I ended up paging past entire sections that were over my head. As physics overviews for the layman go, this is one math and concept intensive tour du force... and yet I felt like it gave me an insight into particle physics that I've never gotten from the many many other books on the subject that I've read - specifically because it gave me even this tiny glimpse into the mathematics of the subject, and how important that has been in the evolution of the Standard Model.The stuff about gauge theory and symmetries... wow, I've heard of those things, but this very rapidly went beyond anything I've studied before (and beyond what I could really understand). Yet even though I was in over my head I learned the essence of why this particular mathematician/physicist believes (based on his extensive training and work) that string theory is not even a theory. And I buy his explanation.I give the book three stars (and not four or five) only because it's so dense and would probably discourage many readers."
209,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/169481-justin,3,"Woit has some issues with the general approach of string theorists, which he's only partially successful in countering. He does raise some compelling arguments relating to the failed science and, surprisingly the elegance of the theory. The second half is a big payoff, but the first -- focused on the interwoven history of mathematics and physics in the 20th Century -- was a bit of a trial for me. Woit could be clearer in his explanations (although admittedly a novice like me is probably not his intended audience), and he's not always successful in tying in this history to his key argument about the failure of string theory.Also interesting, but brief, is his take on the current status of the academy's (and government's) influence on the direction of contemporary physics, and the culture that has arisen in part from those influences."
210,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639456-tim,4,"Yet another attempt to explain 20th/21st c. physics in a no-math way to a non-technical audience, with the usual less-than-satisfactory results. It's basically an impossible task, but this one seems to do better than most. By which I mean that I was left with the pleasant sensation that I understood....something. At least for a while. Like Lee Smolin's ""The Trouble With Physics"" this physicist is a skeptic about String Theory which has become the dominant sub-field in physics in US academia in recent years. And like Smolin's book, it is an interesting blend of non-mathematical discussion of the physics itself, and the problematic sociology of science that has led to what both authors feel is an unhealthy monopoly String Theory and its variations currently holds in the US. "
211,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42000575-ian-murray-watson,3,"Not in my view a book for the layman. I've read many books on quantum theory in which the basic idea are far better explained for non-physicists (and non-mathematicians). He frequently uses the phrase ""in a sense"" as in ""A is in a sense the negative of B"" - so often that one wants to scream 'in what sense>?' or 'is it or isn't it?' Still, he makes his main points convincingly, and although the book is now seriously out of date, time seems only to have proved him right. Also quite good as a source of impenetrable phrases for my next fantasy - renormalisability, SU(1) + SU(2) = heaven known what, invariant with respect to super-symmetrical transformations according to Yang-Mills theory (I can make them up too) ... "
212,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/170768-jon-larimer,3,"It took me a while to get through this. I read a bunch of other popular-physics books from Kaku, Greene, et al, mostly very pro-string theory, and they were much more accessible. There are a few concepts I had trouble with, but it didn't really detract from the overall message of the book. Woit comes from a math background so he has an outsider's perspective on string theory. I agree with his conclusion that string theory is getting dangerously close to not being science anymore. I enjoyed the first part of the book outlining the history of particle accelerators, and I'd like to read more about that subject."
213,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,3,"This is one of two recent books that challenge the prevailing ""string theory"" of modern physics. Woit points out in great detail how that in spite of 25 years of concerted effort by some of the greatest minds of our planet, the proponents of string theory still have not provided any crisp, quantifiable, falsifiable prediction that can be tested in real-world physical experiments. He chronicles how the field has come to this very disappointing conclusion, and how they have tried, via anthropic arguments, to rescue the theory.Another book, from a different perspective, is Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics""."

Woit spells out in detail how string theory has failed to provide a single testable hypothesis (a fundamental requirement of the scientific method), and further how this fact seems unlikely to change at least in the foreseeable future.Woit goes on to argue convincingly how the dynamics of modern-day academia work to continue this program, both retaining the best minds in theoretical physics and to draw top young graduate students to the topic, long after rational consideration would otherwise dictate.

These two unproven (and, I believe, unprovable) notions have convinced modern scientists that the Unknown can somehow be wiped away, as if it were a stain, with a mathematical sponge.But how do scientists believe in something that is not experimentally verified? ...Faith. God help us - Faith!The theologians of the next universal religion are being schooled by physicists today!Again, string theory now frankly involves speculation that is, almost by definition, untestable.

Without experimental verification it amounts to a new type of aesthetics, ...or (I fear) theology.This is where, I would argue, the 'scientistic' notions of gradualism and uniformitarianism have led us. These two unproven (and, I believe, unprovable) notions have convinced modern scientists that the Unknown can somehow be wiped away, as if it were a stain, with a mathematical sponge.But how do scientists believe in something that is not experimentally verified? ...Faith. God help us - Faith!The theologians of the next universal religion are being schooled by physicists today!Again, string theory now frankly involves speculation that is, almost by definition, untestable. Physics is therefore on its way to a cosmological/mythological/theological (cum mathematical) understanding of Reality. It is funny that no one realizes it. So long as there is the 'Unknown' there will be Religion. Various religions come and go; but Religion (very, very broadly conceived) always remains...Like the ancient Ptolemaic System, string theory is a mathematical induced hallucination, and like the ancient geocentric model, it will eventually be overturned, by new observations.Besides this book have a look at ""The Trouble with Physics"" by Lee Smolin."
262,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11189571-ben,4,"A good dissenting voice against the majority string theory hype in pop sci. Since it came out a decade ago in 2006, it's interesting to see how the various references to future experiments at the LHC have played out, mainly in Woit's favor.First half is a zippy recap of particle physics theory & experimental validation over the past decades, with the detail growing thicker as Woit approaches the present. If, like me, you're not already familiar with ideas & terminology in this area, this certainly isn't the book to bring you up to speed. Unlike, eg, Greene's ""Fabric of the Cosmos"", Woit doesn't waste much time trying to explain the concepts he's dishing out by way of analogy or simplification. He deigns to give just a sentence or two of explanation before it's off to the next idea. The best I was able to do was recognize when bits of jargon on symmetry groups, the standard model, and related mathematical theories started to recur, providing if nothing else an indication of which ideas were thriving or falling out of fashion over time. I would have loved if the book were 100 pages longer and contained more thorough concept explanation for non-experts; but, to his credit, Woit does provide useful references for further study at the end of each chapter.Second half brings relief from the jargon train as the writing switches to a thorough, mostly non-technical argument that string theory is a dead end for particle physics. I'm in no position to call his argument correct or not, but it is at the very least convincing. Despite the incendiary title, Woit's arguments are generally polite, and he anchors his opposition to specific, arguably valid failures in string theory over its multi-decade history.Great read that I'd recommend to anybody who's looking for a second popular-level opinion on string theory's strengths & weaknesses."
263,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"I've been following the arguments made by Peter Woit against String Theory for quite some time, and it's a pleasure to be able to have them all in a single volume. His arguments are very persuasive, and his writing clear and to the point. This, however, is not a book that the general audience will find easy to follow. The earlier chapters recount the canonical story of the success of the particle physics in the 20th century, and if you are familiar with that story you can safely skip these chapters. The later chapters are the really interesting ones, but unless you have at least some familiarity with theoretical particle physics and the modern mathematics, you might find yourself lost. Even with that caveat it is still possible to appreciate the central theme of this book: theoretical particle physics took a wrong turn somewhere in the late 70s and the early 80s, and has never been able to recover from this. Woit is appealing in this book to the practitioners in the field to be more honest with their assessments of the direction in which the theoretical particle physics is headed, and the lack of any meaningful progress. Unfortunately, I am very sceptical of the potential impact of this book on the field of particle physics. The Emperor is naked, but he is perceived as irrelevant as well."
264,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4889938-carmen,4,"The first chapters are extremely technical so you are likely to skip them if you are not a specialist. I found the last chapters interesting, which contained the criticism of String Theory. To be honest, I found these criticisms to be rooted in the lack of imagination that often characterizes experimentalists, though the author is a mathematician. He claims that String Theory is not a science because it makes no predictions, but later goes on to say that mathematics does not make predictions eiter, yet it is a science. Get your criteria straight! What do I mean by lack of imagination? Well, one of the problems with String Theory is that it requires more dimensiona than we perceive in order for the math to work. Apparently, this is a problem. But I think it would only be a problem for someone who thinks what we perceive is always all there is to what exists. If we thougt like that we would still thinkthe Sun goes around the Earth.We cannot probe at the scale necessary to make experiments around this stuff. However, I am of the opinion that if the math is consistent, it should tell you something. I find it odd to see a mathematician, who should be very comfortable with the abstract, require something so concrete when it comes to another theoretical science.4 stars for the entertaining value of the last chapters."
265,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734097-p-d,3,"I wanted to like this book so much, because it offers factual backing for my personal dislike of string theory (saying it's hand-waving is a far cry from being able to say why it's hand-waving)...but even with Woit's attempts to simplify information, I think I would have gotten a lot more out of this if I had taken linear algebra. Of course, since I haven't taken linear algebra, this might not be the right math, but the point remains that single-variable calculus eleven years ago doesn't prepare you for a world of gauge symmetries and multidimensional vector transformations.That said, I still learned a lot more about particle physics than sources geared more towards the layman (sorry, particleadventure.org, I still love you)—but I only learned about a fraction of what this book has to offer.A more 'history of science' approach to the interplay of particle physics and pure mathematics, and then the huge movement string theory has become despite its lack of experimental confirmation, would probably be a better read for most people, as the approach here offers a level of grounding in the subject matter that still requires more prior knowledge than most people are likely to have."
266,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1595511-kiri,3,"This was particularly useful to me, although to be frank I ended up paging past entire sections that were over my head. As physics overviews for the layman go, this is one math and concept intensive tour du force... and yet I felt like it gave me an insight into particle physics that I've never gotten from the many many other books on the subject that I've read - specifically because it gave me even this tiny glimpse into the mathematics of the subject, and how important that has been in the evolution of the Standard Model.The stuff about gauge theory and symmetries... wow, I've heard of those things, but this very rapidly went beyond anything I've studied before (and beyond what I could really understand). Yet even though I was in over my head I learned the essence of why this particular mathematician/physicist believes (based on his extensive training and work) that string theory is not even a theory. And I buy his explanation.I give the book three stars (and not four or five) only because it's so dense and would probably discourage many readers."
267,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/169481-justin,3,"Woit has some issues with the general approach of string theorists, which he's only partially successful in countering. He does raise some compelling arguments relating to the failed science and, surprisingly the elegance of the theory. The second half is a big payoff, but the first -- focused on the interwoven history of mathematics and physics in the 20th Century -- was a bit of a trial for me. Woit could be clearer in his explanations (although admittedly a novice like me is probably not his intended audience), and he's not always successful in tying in this history to his key argument about the failure of string theory.Also interesting, but brief, is his take on the current status of the academy's (and government's) influence on the direction of contemporary physics, and the culture that has arisen in part from those influences."
268,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639456-tim,4,"Yet another attempt to explain 20th/21st c. physics in a no-math way to a non-technical audience, with the usual less-than-satisfactory results. It's basically an impossible task, but this one seems to do better than most. By which I mean that I was left with the pleasant sensation that I understood....something. At least for a while. Like Lee Smolin's ""The Trouble With Physics"" this physicist is a skeptic about String Theory which has become the dominant sub-field in physics in US academia in recent years. And like Smolin's book, it is an interesting blend of non-mathematical discussion of the physics itself, and the problematic sociology of science that has led to what both authors feel is an unhealthy monopoly String Theory and its variations currently holds in the US. "
269,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42000575-ian-murray-watson,3,"Not in my view a book for the layman. I've read many books on quantum theory in which the basic idea are far better explained for non-physicists (and non-mathematicians). He frequently uses the phrase ""in a sense"" as in ""A is in a sense the negative of B"" - so often that one wants to scream 'in what sense>?' or 'is it or isn't it?' Still, he makes his main points convincingly, and although the book is now seriously out of date, time seems only to have proved him right. Also quite good as a source of impenetrable phrases for my next fantasy - renormalisability, SU(1) + SU(2) = heaven known what, invariant with respect to super-symmetrical transformations according to Yang-Mills theory (I can make them up too) ... "
270,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/170768-jon-larimer,3,"It took me a while to get through this. I read a bunch of other popular-physics books from Kaku, Greene, et al, mostly very pro-string theory, and they were much more accessible. There are a few concepts I had trouble with, but it didn't really detract from the overall message of the book. Woit comes from a math background so he has an outsider's perspective on string theory. I agree with his conclusion that string theory is getting dangerously close to not being science anymore. I enjoyed the first part of the book outlining the history of particle accelerators, and I'd like to read more about that subject."
271,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,3,"This is one of two recent books that challenge the prevailing ""string theory"" of modern physics. Woit points out in great detail how that in spite of 25 years of concerted effort by some of the greatest minds of our planet, the proponents of string theory still have not provided any crisp, quantifiable, falsifiable prediction that can be tested in real-world physical experiments. He chronicles how the field has come to this very disappointing conclusion, and how they have tried, via anthropic arguments, to rescue the theory.Another book, from a different perspective, is Smolin's ""The Trouble with Physics""."
272,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1122120-scott-hotes,4,"A tour de force against the string theory establishment. For thirty years string theory has been the leading contender for uniting general relativity and quantum mechanics. Woit spells out in detail how string theory has failed to provide a single testable hypothesis (a fundamental requirement of the scientific method), and further how this fact seems unlikely to change at least in the foreseeable future.Woit goes on to argue convincingly how the dynamics of modern-day academia work to continue this program, both retaining the best minds in theoretical physics and to draw top young graduate students to the topic, long after rational consideration would otherwise dictate. "
273,0465092756,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1891168-wil-freve,3,"After reading Brian Greene's work that strongly supports superstring theory, I was interested in reading an opposite opinion. Although the book's basic premise that there's no way (yet) to actually prove Superstring theory, and there's really no evidence to support the theory (other than a certain intuitive mathematical elegance), I'm kind of disappointed that doesn't yet sufficiently acknowlege the limitations of particle physics theory. I'll update my review once I'm done."
