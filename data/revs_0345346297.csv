0,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The most hauting question that this book poses is this : Chimpanzees can abstract. Like other mammals, they are capable of strong emotions.Why, exactly, all over the civilized world, in virtually every major city, are apes in prison? For a species that has proclaimed itself to be the rulers of Earth, this is not a very difficult question to answer for us. It is a single word : suppression. We humans never much liked competition from other creatures and history tells us that this was how we overcame all our natural predators through weaponry or guile in the eons past. A moment of reflection on our past brings up that question : why did the other humanoids not survive while our ancestors did ? How did they all gt wiped out ? Natural selection could not have been the only answer.This book is one that shook me out of cerebral complacency and like a good author, Sagan opens the cobweb laden windows of my brain and lets the light in.This is a book length introspection into the nature of human intellect. From the first tottering steps of our primate ancestors to today's technologically addicted life forms, how has the journey been for that mass of tissue between our ears ? This is what Sagan attempts to answer. In simple,lucid and easy to comprehend prose the author breaks down the story of how our brains assumed today's form and reflexes. It is a tour de force that mixes and matches history,paleontology, psychology and other branches of human understanding to come up with a fascinating study.The evolution of the brain and how the most primal fears in our psyche still rule our subconscious is a fascinating observation and forms the best part of this book. The aspect of the Triune brain and the R-complex's involvement in human behavior is what Sagan calls the Dragons chained away in the dungeons of our minds. Our basic aversion to reptiles and the dreams populated with snakes coupled with the dreams of a fall from a height are all speculated upon by Sagan in teh backdrop of our dreams. They were quire revelatory and while I might at a later point in time (with more reading)debate these points, they did rekindle my interest in the human brain's inner workings. I finished reading, put down the book and ran my fingers through my hair and muttered You are a rockstar to my brain. The kind of rockstar who you can never fully figure out is how it might react to that comment ! This book is highly recommended and it is no fluke that I rate all of Sagan's books so far as five stars. This is stuff that will genuinely interest the skeptical mind."

If we had two synapses, then 2^2 = 4 states; three synapses, then 2^3 = 8 states, and, in general, for N synapses, 2^N states. But the human brain is characterized by some 10^13 synapses. Thus the number of different states of a human brain is 2 raised to this power-- i.e., multiplied by itself ten trillion times. This is an unimaginably large number, far greater, for example, than the total number of elementary particles (electrons and protons) in the entire universe."""
2,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"Dragons of Eden by Carl Sagan won the Pulitzer Prize for Non-Fiction in 1978Natural selection has served as a kind of intellectual sieve, producing brains and intelligences increasingly competent to deal with the laws of nature.There isn’t much discussion of dragons, beyond a short snippet on Komodo dragons, in this book but Sagan uses this metaphor as a catchy title to highlight that this fear may be part of our own mammalian evolution. The dragon concept is buttressed by so many old tales throughout numerous civilizations that Sagan implies there must have been a fearsome dragon or related animal in our distant past that shaped our evolution. I am not convinced per se but the rest of the book is much more serious than this topic. Carl Sagan is arguably the greatest science writer and educator of recent times. In this book his mind, through his theories, is on full display for all to see. He steps through various evolutionary ideas about how man (and his brain) has evolved. As has been stated in other reviews of this book, a mark against it is that some sections are now outdated. Science evolves. Yet, for me, it is remarkable even when discussing a mundane game of ‘Pong’ that Sagan is able to foresee many of our challenges we face today. He even talks about the danger of computers and video games pre-empting children from learning the proper fundamentals of math and science. As a parent, there is little argument from me on this point. At its core this is a thought provoking book that resonates. It is short at only nine chapters so I will review the chapters here — because many are true gems and the rest are pretty good.Chapter 1 — The Cosmic CalendarIn this chapter Sagan famously maps the age of the universe, nearly 14 billion years, into a single year. We see that if the Big Bang starts on January 1st at 12:01 am, then humans don’t arrive to the timeline until December 31st at 10:30 pm, and all of our recorded history can be confined to the final 10 seconds of the year! Powerful stuff.Chapter 2 — Genes and BrainsThe average human brain has 10^13 synapses. This means there are 2^(10^13) possible states of a single brain, a number that approaches the number of atoms in the universe. We also learn that “The simplest organisms on Earth today have just as much evolutionary history behind them as the most complex”. In other words even simple diatoms are well honed and efficient machines. Chapter 3 — The Brain and the ChariotHumans have a very high brain to mass ratio relative to any other animal on the planet. Sagan goes on to discuss sleep and posits a theory that land mammals sleep so much because they can hide and are less vulnerable than marine mammals. For example dolphins rarely sleep, sometimes only for a minute at a time. I will take it a step further and say that land mammals may also sleep so much because it is difficult for most, not all, mammals to find food in the dark. Isn’t it better to burn as few calories as possible through sleeping those night time hours away. Whatever the real reason, this trait goes back to the end of the dinosaur era.Chapter 4 — Eden as a Metaphor“paleontologists have deduced that “bipedalism preceded encephalization,” by which they mean that our ancestors walked on two legs before they evolved big brains.” It seems that hunting developed brains further in this regard. Chapter 5 — The Abstractions of the Beasts. My favorite chapter. It’s largely about how humans have developed verbal speech and a large part of our oversized brains are dedicated to this function. But it also discusses how incredibly smart chimpanzees are and how presumptuous humans are about or lack thereof intelligence in all animals. It seems that this view is because they don’t have vocal chords. Scientists have taught select chimps sign language and they have learned to use words correctly and in context (nouns, verbs and adjectives) to the tune of vocabularies in excess of one hundred words. The chimps can even sign curse words when humans introduce illogical steps into a food reward scheme. The average human uses just 1,000 common words in everyday speech and some mentally impaired humans don’t even reach that level. Sagan implies that due to the chimpanzee’s small brain volume it is unlikely they can ever achieve normal human level language. However it is clear that chimps (and many other animals) feel anxiety and think in ways that are much more in line with humans than I ever knew. The implication here is that the inability to verbalize word constructs, i.e. language, is what has kept other animals from evolving. Although dated, this chapter alone is worth the price of the book or a trip to the library.Chapter 6 — Tales of Dim EdenThis chapter primarily revisits the topic of sleep first broached in chapter 3 and talks a good deal about dinosaurs. Maybe this section should have been combined with The Brain and the Chariot.Chapter 7 — Lovers and madmenThis chapter is heavily focused on brain hemisphere functions and the tie-in to evolution. Very informative. “M. S. Gazzaniga of the State University of New York at Stony Brook suggests that hemispheric specialization occurs because language is developed in the left hemisphere before the child acquires substantial competence in manipulative skills and geometrical visualization. According to this view, the specialization of the right hemisphere for geometrical competence is a specialization by default—the left hemisphere’s competence has been redirected toward language.”Chapter 8 — The Future Evolution of our Brain.“In general, human societies are not innovative. They are hierarchical and ritualistic. Suggestions for change are greeted with suspicion: they imply an unpleasant future variation in ritual and hierarchy: an exchange of one set of rituals for another, or perhaps for a less structured society with fewer rituals. And yet there are times when societies must change.”Wow. This is such a well articulated statement. Most of us recognize this type of change is the fundamental impediment to solving many of our country’s problems and by extension in solving the world’s environmental and population problems. Sagan goes on to wade into the abortion debate as well. He also talks about tech and its benefit and possible detriment to children. Not a cohesive chapter by any stretch and outdated perhaps, but still thought provoking. Chapter 9 — Knowledge is our DestinyAn intriguing chapter where Sagan speaks of aliens. It is his belief that while their physical forms will be unfamiliar to us, their minds will be similar“Organisms throughout the universe should therefore be sensitive to optical and/or radio radiation, and, after the development of physics, the idea of electromagnetic radiation for interstellar communication should be a cosmic commonplace—a convergent idea evolving independently on countless worlds throughout the galaxy after the local discovery of elementary astronomy, what we might call the facts of life. If we are fortunate enough to make contact with some of those other beings, I think we will find that much of their biology, psychology, sociology and politics will seem to us stunningly exotic and deeply mysterious. But I suspect we will have little difficulty in understanding each other on the simpler aspects of astronomy, physics, chemistry and perhaps mathematics.”4.5 stars. The writing here warrants five stars. At 40 years and counting and the fact the book could have been longer, this is more like a 4 star book to me. Cosmos and Pale Blue Dot still remain my favorite Sagan books and are beautiful works. Sagan has long since passed away but I greatly miss his insights and his non-righteous quest for the truth. It really shines through in virtually all of his writing. Highly recommended."
3,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301054-stacey-mulvey,5,"I'd read this book a few years ago, and loved it. It's a great introduction to brain anatomy, consciousness/subconsciousness, and evolution. An ""easy"" read, if any book that deals with these types of topics can be considered as such. Sagan is good at presenting complex material in an interesting and palatable way. It made me want to start paying more attention to my dreams. (He also relates one of his personal experiences of smoking marijuana, and his theories of the effects it might have on the brain and consciousness.)"
4,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,3,"Carl Sagan is a big name, or at least he used to be. But other than the series Cosmo or the movie with Jodi Foster, he was known for his speculation in... everything. :) In this case, it's consciousness. By the title, he's referring to the lizard brain. And considering the fact that he was writing this out of the 70's and he disclaimed the hell out of it, it's meant to be a conversation starter for laymen.All good. And it's good, too. If I was reading this 40 years ago or even 30 years ago, I'd nod energetically at a lot of the ideas. The writing is good, the ideas sound, and the subject is still obviously open today.So what did I have a problem with?Actually, my complaint is rather prosaic. It's just dated. HEAVILY dated. It's like the line from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy where Prosser still thinks that digital watches are a good idea.There are better books that do the job of this one, but for the time I'm sure it was pretty fantastic. Not everything was dated. Philosophy and basic math and the broad strokes were good. But the fields of mental health, computers and computer games, the current development of cloning, AIs, and a huge extra list WAS.Alas. Time marches on."

6,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,5,"In this Pulitzer prize winning book, Carl Sagan, indubitably one of the finest scientific minds of our time, expresses his thoughts about life, most particularly about intelligent life, and its relation with the environment that gave it origin and shaped it.Aided by anthropological notions, evolutionary biology, psychology, and computer science, Sagan gives a well balanced perspective of how human intelligence evolved. However, notwithstanding Sagan's expertise in astrophysics, he warns us that in the neurosciences he's more of an amateur scholar than consumed expert. That, added to the age of the book, results in much of the book being speculative work. Interestingly, some of his assumptions have been latter integrated to the commonly accepted model for the evolution of the human brain.One of my favorite sections of the book takes on the biological function behind human intelligence. I particularly like when Sagan considers the complexity of biological life forms, putting in perspective the real significance of our cultural and technological advances. Anyone interested in human evolution will find this book exciting. The meaning of the evolution of extra-genetic intelligence (brains in animals and humans) and extra-somatic intelligence (writing, books, computers) in humans, the nature of instincts buried in our older ""reptilian brain"" regions, the conflict between the left and right neocortex and the purpose of each, this is exciting stuff that we can all see at work in our lives, giving evolution an extra layer of reality.After finishing reading, I was left wondering if the next evolutionary step would imply a complete detachment of our mind from the primate emotional instincts, and reliance only on the rational, more advanced brain. Is our brain on its way to become alike to Artificial Intelligence? I think Sagan did an extraordinary job with this book. His writing is engaging and easy to understand, even if you're not too much into the sciency stuff. Most impressive is how diverse, interesting and mind opening are the many well-informed topics contained in the ca. 250 pages of this book. A more recent book, ""Up from Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence (2002)"" coauthor by Sagan and John Skoyles actualizes the concepts and hypotheses first presented in Dragons of Eden. But, don't get fooled, Up from Dragons is not a replacement reading to Dragons of Eden, it's a follow up for it will be a shame to miss Sagan's great original prose."
7,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3145526-traveller,4,"Interesting read, as long as one takes into account that it's quite old and outdated by now, so it's not exactly cutting edge. (I read it pretty long ago myself).Still, Sagan has a such a pleasant, conversational style, that even reading it for the speculations alone, makes reading the book a not unpleasant way of whiling away your time.I like the angles he chooses to speculate from, especially the bits about instinct and how myths most probably formed in the human collective subconscious."
8,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,4,Interesting questions on the origin and development of human intelligence. Still worth a read despite lots of progress since he wrote this. Gives a good description of left/right brain competencies. Has piqued my interest in evolutionary development. The guy was taken from us too early but sure made a name for himself in what time he had.
9,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633-wilson,3,"This was an interesting book to read after all of the recent research and groundbreaking discoveries of the human brain. Clearly, Sagan smokes weed. However, there are times when he must be coming off his high that his insights are both subtle and poignant. Oxymoronic, to be sure, but so was most of Sagan's keen skepticism amidst his psuedoscientific platitudes.I use big words. That being said, some of the best parts of this book are the drawings related to studies conducted on patients with a severed corpus collosum. If you never read this book, I highly recommend you find it in a bookstore just to check out these studies. Here is a slightly-less technical version: http://nobelprize.org/educational_gam..."

This book is about intelligence, a topic both men dealt with, Gould most notably in his Mismeasure of Man. Sagan, however, deals with all intelligence, ending his book with a discussion of nonhuman intelligences, most particularly certain Cetaceans and primates. Noting that chimpanzees and gorillas appear to be intellectually comparable to human five-year-olds, he ends with a plea to extend some of the rights we afford our own children to members of other intelligent species.I read this book outside at the Ennui Cafe on Sheridan and Lunt in East Rogers Park, Chicago.

11,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56173179-ivana-books-are-magic,4,"I do read non- fiction occasionally, you know. When I do, these are the kind of books I want to be reaching for: educating and fascinating. Dragons of Eden: Speculations on Evolution of Human Intelligence is exactly what the title suggest. If you're interested in evolution, this book is a great choice. It is not very specific, it is more a series of essays but it is easy to read and understand. Indeed, what I like so much about this book is that it is so easily understandable. Sagan must have been a talented teacher; he clearly has a talent for transmitting knowledge. Plus, Sagan obviously had an interesting and curious mind. The way the book was written is simple, but the matters addressed are anything but. There are a lot of complex questions hiding in this book. Evolution as such, the human brain development and the intelligence are some of the topics explored. Since these are the all topics, I always found interesting, it is understandable that I quite liked this book. I don't have some great background knowledge about biology and evolution as such, yet there was not anything that I have not understood in the book. As I said, the book is easy to understand.Intelligence and brain evolution is a fascination topic. How did the human brain develop? However, what I liked most about this book was the question of intelligence in animals. That for me is one of the most fascinating themes. I something feel people invent definitions just to exclude animals from things we call ""human"". Who can claim animals don't have language when chimps are capable of using sing language? Nevertheless, in every linguistic book you'll find: “Language is a solely human accomplishment...."" I don't think it is. I really don't. I think that some highly evolved apes such as chimps and orangutans are perfectly capable of acquiring a language. There are apes that have learned sign language. You cannot take that accomplishment from them, not unless you want to say that sign language isn't a real language. It obviously is, and those apes are using it, so they are quite clearly, capable of mastering a language. "
12,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,4,"I read this one quite long back... and really loved it at that time. I only remember two things from the book, however.The first one is where Sagan speculates that God's curse on Eve, ""you shall bring forth your children in pain"", refers to the increased cranial size of intelligent homo sapiens. It is common knowledge that childbirth in humans is much more painful than in animals because of the larger size of the head due to an enlarged brain: thus, could the story of Eden contain a veiled reference to evolution?The second is a sentence: ""The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" Spoken in the context of missing fossil records, I remember thinking at the time that this could also be applied to God!"
13,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270879-robin,4,"I feel strongly that this book should be included in mythology courses because better than any textbook I've ever encountered it addresses the connections that exist between mythology and science. Not to say that mythology is scientific, but rather the ways of viewing the world, both contemporary and historical, that human beings seem to return to again and again often are the way they are for very sound biological reasons.

""To write a book in a subject so far from one's primary training is at best incautious. But...the temptation was irresistible.""
That quote, found in the acknowledgements, sums up both the problems with this work, and also it's ironic charm. You must read this early work of Sagan not as definitive science, but as a prime example of his inimitable ability to connect science to other intellectual concerns such as myth, religion and history, thus stimulating thought in the process.At least Sagan is completely honest: the subtitle itself indicates these are ""speculations"" which presumably have not been verified. In fact, the book represents a kind of popular science (really, science itself) not seen much anymore. It takes confidence and a willingness to take criticism and the harsh judgement of history, to produce such a work. It's value is of the highest order: that of creative thinking.""This book itself is an exercise in pattern recognition, and attempts to understand something of the nature and evolution of human intelligence, using clues from a wide variety of sciences and myths. It is in significant part a right-hemisphere activity; and in the course of writing I was repeatedly awakened in the middle of night or in the early hours of the morning by the mild exhilaration of a new insight. But whether the insights are genuine – and I expect many of them will require substantial revision – depends on how well my left hemisphere has functioned."" [italics mine]The writing is the usual poetic Sagan style, highly readable and yet capable of conveying deep thoughts. The difficulties, however, are serious. It's hard to know what is speculation, what was accepted as fact in 1977, what has been proved true, and what's been superseded. Read the book to marvel at Sagan's mind, not to learn current knowledge on how the brain works.I could list many factual things wrong: excessive reliance on the triunal brain (putting too much emphasis on the brains's ""reptilian-complex"" as a driver of aggressive behavior and everything else anti-intellectual, for example), offering up the wrong theory for the extinction of the dinosaurs (he says it was a supernova explosion: hard to believe that Sagan, himself a planetary scientist, had not even considered in 1977 the now generally accepted asteroid impact theory!), and I could go on at length. But...there really is no reason to point out the errors. Again, the purpose of this book is not to serve as a textbook, but to stimulate thought—to speculate.The core of the book is his ideas on evolutionary memory, those experiences of proto-humans which to assure species survival were recorded in DNA. This is controversial, for sure, but it's curious how he links several creation myths—Greek, Genesis—to ""dragons,"" which he defines as now-extinct larger, more dangerous reptiles which preyed upon mammals, including humans. ""We are descended from reptiles and mammals both. In the daytime repression of the R-complex, in the nighttime stirring of the dream dragons, we may each of us be replaying the hundred-million-year-old warfare between the reptiles and the mammals."" Maybe he's suggesting these were actually dinosaurs, maybe not, but he is suggesting some sort of evolutionary survival memory preserved to assist success, such as fear of snakes. This following should give you a flavor of the book. He's stretching mightily to merge poetry with science:""The pervasiveness of dragon myths in the folk legends of many cultures is probably no accident. ... Is it possible that dragons posed a problem for our protohuman ancestors of a few million years ago, and that the terror they evoked and the deaths they caused helped bring about the evolution of human intelligence? Or does the metaphor of the serpent refer to the use of the aggressive and ritualistic reptilian component of our brain in the further evolution of the neocortex? With one exception, the Genesis account of the temptation by a reptile in Eden is the only instance in the Bible of humans understanding the language of animals. When we feared the dragons, were we fearing a part of ourselves? One way or another, there were dragons in Eden.""Only Sagan could get away with this poetic image and remain scientific: from almost any other it would be pseudo-science; here it is rational speculation, although certainly offered without any proof.Less seriously, it's fun to read Sagan's view on computers—as of 1977. In almost every book he wrote, he couldn't resist gushing about them! It's possible to string these parts together from his thirty-year-long book publishing career and have a respectable history of computers and their affect on culture and scientific research. Dragons of Eden is a humorous gem in this regard, as, for example: ""The computer terminal is a commonplace on the Dartmouth campus. A very high proportion of Dartmouth undergraduates learn not only to use such programs but also to write their own."" I remember very well the vast rooms full of terminals which all the students used, it felt almost like prison at times!I intend no criticism, but the extended excerpt below is, shall we say, embarrassing in its outright geekiness. You probably won't be able to resist laughing at his amazement with the invention of computer games, now so completely endemic:""Computer graphics are now being extended into the area of play. There is a popular game, sometimes called Pong, which simulates on a television screen a perfectly elastic ball bouncing between two surfaces. Each player is given a dial that permits him to intercept the ball with a movable ""racket."" Points are scored if the motion of the ball is not intercepted by the racket. The game is very interesting. There is a clear learning experience involved which depends exclusively on Newton's second law for linear motion. As a result of Pong, the player can gain a deep intuitive understanding of the simplest Newtonian physics…""Although his book won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1978, Dragons of Eden can no longer be recommended to the general reader. It has aged far too much to be reliable. Still, it retains much interest and beauty for the dedicated Carl Sagan fan."
15,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,4,"Any book on the brain written in the 70s is going to be outdated. For example, Sagan wasn't sure if different parts of the brain affected different things. But an enjoyable read. He does make one important point clear early on: the ""mind"" is just a function of the brain. Dualists who think they are two different things are flat out wrong. I have had people look me straight in the eye without even blinking and say that if a person's brain were destroyed, their mind would still function normally. That's always an end-of-discussion comment for me. "

19,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27248823-vishal,5,"Carl Sagan was a planetary scientist with primary interest in exobiology and extraterrestrial intelligence. He was perfectly aware that speculation, study and understanding of extra-terrestrial intelligence would require a thoroughly comprehensible understanding of terrestrial human and non-human intelligence such as primates and aquatic mammals. If emergence of intelligence is convergent end point of many different evolutionary histories, as evident in our expectations of intelligent aliens, then some universal aspects of intelligence will transcend the evolutionary and biochemical differences. In other words, some features and characteristics of intelligence would be similar in intelligence emerging throughout the Universe. He knew this and he spent considerable time in studying evolution of intelligence on Earth. This book is an outcome of his research, intended to present his insights, speculations and related findings for a reader with enthusiasm in Science, and for the young readers who wish to pursue Science it can work as a book stimulating their interest and teaching them to draw insights.Carl states the premise of the book to be ancient myths which turn out to be remarkably in coherence with modern scientific findings. One of the examples he states is the constant mythological depiction of arch-rivalry of dragon and the man. Now this myth is found to be consistent with findings regarding the fierce competition between Reptiles and Mammals in the early emergence and evolution period of the Mammals, which the Mammals won because of their smarter brains, co-operation and protection of the young; behaviors significantly in contrast with those of the Reptiles. Another is the constant conflict of motives and interest between aggressive R-complex, part of the human brain inherited from our reptilian ancestors, and rational Neo-cortex which is unique to primates. It must be noted that vague correlation of ancient myths with current scientific findings doesn't imply that ancient myths contain any iota of rationally obtained scientific truth in them, but rather the fact that myths are just representations of our vague intuitions and casual observations of our surroundings. This intuition could have been supported by the observation that infants of human and non-human primates are born with an inherent fear of snakes, and this fear could plausibly be related to perennial rivalry and hostility between reptiles and mammals, and consequently giving rise to the aforementioned myth.The book begins with a rudimentary introduction of evolutionary theory, mutation, accretion and propagation of favorable mutations, information content of the DNA and how it manifests itself in living beings and their apparent complexity; eventually arriving on the evolution of brain. He explains the various parts of brains in different taxonomic divisions, their functions and redundancy in the terms of pisces brain, R-complex(reptilian brain), limbic system(mammalian brain), neo-cortex in humans and other primates. He explains the origins of our aggressive, ritualistic, hierarchy and sexual attitudes by attributing them to R-complex and cynically remarks upon his observation that our political and social conditions are predominantly controlled by our reptilian instincts. Then he elaborates upon the origin of our emotions such as love and fear in the limbic system, which is also associated with recognition of smell and keeping of our short-term memories. With examples of different experiments by neurobiologists, he shows the effect of electrical stimulation of different parts of brain to determine their functions and how electrical stimulation gives output that is consistent with the phenomena of perceiving from external stimuli. A remarkable conclusion derived from his intuitions in this book, after comparing working principles of artificial intelligence and biological intelligence, is that free-will can be completely disregarded; and if someone denies consciousness to a fairly intelligence machine on the grounds of ""just being a metallic machine"", then we should disregard the intelligence of machines made of Carbon as well.Next, he embarks on the intelligence of non-human primates, their lifestyles, their symbolic languages and scientific experiments performed on them which show them to be as much intelligent as our ancestors, the Homo Habilis. Then he raises questions about imprisoning and maltreatment of the apes by us, whose level of rationalism and consciousness is shown to be comparable with microencephalic humans and aquatic mammals such as dolphins and whales. He demands compassionate and ethical treatment of our fellow sentient beings, so that we can undo the harm caused by our ancestors who had wiped out all the species from the face of Earth which showed even slight upsurge towards intelligence. Neanderthals, Cro-Magnons, Homo Erectus, Australopithecine robustus and many other species contemporary to our ancestors were brutally massacred by our ancestors in their quest for survival. We can compensate for that harm by ethically treating our fellow sentient primates and helping them develop intelligence, efforts to teach symbolic languages to Chimpanzees can be considered as the first step towards that. We can also cherish in the fact that common communicative language contains about 1000 words and many lab Chimpanzees easily learn around 200 words, they seem capable of abstract reasoning, sense of humor, asking questions, creating new phrases and forming expletives as well.There is a brief account on our interpretation of dreams in a manner consistent with neurobiology, after a brief but lucid interlude on explaining the evolutionary origins of dreams and sleep. The logical incoherence, strong emotional content and fantastic element of our dreams are associated with, respectively, turning off the rational left brain, free reign to limbic and reptilian complex and free association induced in intuitive right brain. It is observed that, during sleep, our left brain indulges in memory buffering and stacking of information which disconnects it from our conscious brain and then right brain shows us patterns without any coherence or correlation while our limbic system and reptilian complex give rise to strong emotional and fear content of our dreams. This phenomena is also explained with help of metaphors and myths which can be considered as aid to our intuitive understanding of these ideas. Then we arrive at vivid descriptions of right brain, left brain and their connecting link: corpus callosum. Corpus callosum works as link to connect our intuitions with our reasoning and is pivotal to almost every advancement in the fields of Science, Art, Humanities and Literature. Our civilization could be said to be a product of corpus callosum. Conclusion resides on the speculations about advancements in association among humans and various artificial intelligence, to enhance our extrasomatic information content as well as develop a sophisticated retrieval system if we connect our brains to the artificial aid. This kind of association may be very crucial to our survival considering the upheaval of dangers posed to our civilization by our emotional immaturity and short-term vision, where swift and rationalized decisions are imperative to our success and prosperity as a species. Developing and associating with artificial intelligence can help us grasp the universal aspects of intelligence, speculate about what kind of non-human intelligence could exist and devising prudent and efficient means of communication with them; these lessons will help us greatly when we acquire messages from any extra-terrestrial civilization because only an intelligent entity comprising of human and artificial intelligence would be able to sift through it and arrive upon comprehension. With remarkably rapid advances in human enterprise and its facilities, the problems caused by it can only be solved with more knowledge and better understanding of our ethics and possible courses of actions which are not possible to be devised by slowly evolving human intelligence. Aid of rapidly evolving artificial intelligence is required to help us in our moment of peril caused by our adolescent technology and our immature civilization whose most of the individual brains are still governed by reptilian brain, with the instincts inherited from billions of years in past."

Each player is given a dial that permits him to intercept the ball with a movable ""racket"". Points are scored if the motion of the ball is not intercepted by the racket. The game is very interesting. There is a clear learning experience involved which depends exclusively on Newton's second law for linear motion. As a result of Pong, the player can gain a deep intuitive understanding of the simplest Newtonian physics - a better understanding even than that provided by billiards, where the collisions are far from perfectly elastic and where the spinning of the pool balls interposes more complicated physics.This sort of information gathering is precisely what we call play. And the important function of play is thus revealed: it permits us to gain, without any particular future application in mind, a holistic understanding of the world, which is both a complement of and a preparation for later analytical activities. But computers permit play in environments otherwise totally inaccessible to the average student."""

Sneak this text into Red State high school libraries! It is still in print despite being dated: a time capsule snapshot of the then state of evolutionary science, primatology, computers and brain science. Despite Sagan’s leaps into speculations it is well written and is still a fine appetizer to the study of the brain and evolutionary psychology. Sagan also tries to tie in the myths of Genesis—esp. the Garden of Eden—into the development of the human mind. Refreshingly naïve, sure. Sagan entertains theories of genetic memory—wouldn’t this be Lamarckian?—to explain the persistence of Western religious myths. Not convincing, but nice try. Note that a movie about genetic memory, Altered States, came out the same year."

The credit goes to the biological backdrop of the book but with time, I realized that my age old belief of biology, being an enigma and a damp squib, was based on all wrong perceptions.As the name suggests, the speculation on human intelligence by the author largely consists of the evolution of mankind from Homo Habilis to Erectus to Sapiens and, to be more specific, of the human brain. Evolution on Earth includes the whole spectrum of intelligence from stupidest to the most intelligent organism but one of the biggest revelation to me in this was the fact that the Brain mass has nothing to do with intelligence. A human Brain roughly weighs 1375 cubic centimeters and the deviations from the average number varies from as low as 1230( Einstein's brain weight) to as high as 2000 cc. The better metric to determine the relation between intelligence and brain mass is the ratio of brain mass to the body mass of the organism. When graphical analysis of the ratios of various organisms was done it was found that the human beings topped the charts with the nearest organism to humans being the dolphins. Considering the individual evolutionary cycle of the family homo, it has been observed that there has been a substantial growth in this ratio from habilis to sapiens. No wonder that artists paint the future depicting humans as people with huge heads, small hands and feet which me may appear horrendous, but in the hindsight, I feel the remoteness of that happening isn't that low. Old historical conflicts. This is what human history majorly consists of isn't it? Who defeated who and whose dynasty went on for how many years. What's funny is that even their evolutionary history is rife with skirmishes forcing them to mold their very lifestyle in such a manner that it ensured safety of their kind from the environment. Mammals and Reptiles have been age old enemies and during the time of dinosaurs, reptiles were known to be diurnal animals. When intelligence was not the primary weapon of the species; as it could never directly be used as a weapon of offense or defense against the perpetrators; the primary weapons were claws, teeth strong muscles basically any physical aspect which could guarantee that either you could fight off the threat or run away from it. This helped the reptiles to win the battle most of the times against mammals as they were gifted with these weapons. Well as the dinosaurs were wiped off the face of the Earth, mammals started to flourish as they transformed from nocturnal to diurnal animals, their nature of protecting their young ones helped them to increase their populations and they started to use their gift of intelligence in a more constructive manner. All the story above was to highlight the significance of sleep in mammals, need of which until now has been inexplicable. We don't really know why do we need sleep. But shouldn't it just be about resting and getting recharged? No, because if that would've been the case, the average sleeping hours wouldn't have shown such large deviations. But some of the sleep related activities can be explained like when we sleep we are at our most vulnerable state and that's why we are protective about our young ones sleeping as they won't be able to defend themselves, like we loose our sleep when we are stressed as that alarms the R-complex part of the brain that some distress is overdue which is perceived by the brain as life threatening. The latter half of the book elucidates on how do we juggle between the two hemispheres of brain. The left hemisphere of the brain is known to be the rational part whereas the right side of the brain is the intuitive one. We all love the right part don't we? it hardly believes in rules and regulations, it's free creative and promotes doing whatever you feel like. Actually what you feel like is controlled by this right side only. It is good with patterns, shapes, creativity and innovation but the most important activity that it has a role to play in is dreaming. When we dream, the right hemisphere shuts down the left hemisphere and that's why we have so many stories that so many famous people found the solution of their problems through a divine manifestation in their dreams. Actually what happened was the right brain has a tendency to form patterns with anything it has got. So it is not always necessarily true that the patterns of that sort exist. Now, here comes the functional requirement of left brain as one of the most important characteristics of human beings which consists of writing and reading resides in left brain and it believes in nothing unless it checks out the validity of that pattern by continuously doing experimentation to validate the hypotheses. Carpos Callosum is the name of the nerve which connects these two sides and helps the two parts to collaborate but as the saying goes:""Carpos Callosum is the charioteer who is trying to direct the chariot to its destiny with the left and right horses pulling the chariot in opposite directions."" I used to equate Science with rationality and by that logic, science should be all about left brain. But the pattern founding has been and will be done by the right brain only. What left brain does is that it just verifies whether the pattern really exists or not. How do we make our right brain more observant you ask? It gets exercised by arts, music, painting-in short, by creating something new. Well that's not so cool isn't it? Owning something something shining and commenting something flashy is the new sexy it seems. Well, it's debatable and who am I to judge.On that note, I should really get going with my guitar classes it seems;);)"

29,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35218012-anirud-thyagharajan,5,"Carl Sagan mesmerizes the reader with his impeccable research abilities, kneading key focal points in neuroscience with a beautiful literary fabric. He gives an educating tour of evolution and its repercussions on our intelligence, and how it impacts everything we do today - technology, lifestyle and possibly even our dreams. Sagan also has the innate ability to speculate about the future in absolute detail, most of the time chillingly accurate (eventhough it is not his primary field of research!). Let me hopelessly attempt to follow his style of quantifying the human brain intelligence, by saying that very few other books will be as useful for the 250 pages that this book enthralls you with. "

Here he examines humanity from a lot of different interesting angles, everything between cosmology, history, biology and morality. Here is something that will touch everyone. In my case i was especially fascinated with the chapter on cross species communication, but every single chapter is insanely intriguing. "
32,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,1,"The copy of the book I got was published in 1977 and what isn't out of date is wrong. The subtitle is ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"",  but little in the book is about that topic. The book rambles from from one subject to another,from cute drawings by everyone's favorite: M.C. Escher,to the chemical composition of distant stars. Perhaps the most interesting part is the chart that shows  Brain mass vs. Body weight. On that chart moles rate quite highly.Probably not the point the author was trying to make. The next time I see a mole I'll watch for signs of intelligence. There are many tidbits of trivia, one is the fact , that the average person has a 10% chance of having a genetic mutation that can be passed on to the next generation. Needless to say, almost all of these are harmful."
33,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,2,"Not one of Sagan's best books, IMHO.While this was not a bad book, I didn't find it overly stimulating or engaging, either.He talks about the cosmic calendar, left brain/right brain research, animal intelligence and other related topics.Some of Sagan's speculations about intelligence in here have now been disproved; ie - that chimps are capable of speech. See Robert Sapolsky's ""Human Behavioural Biology"" for a refutation of this.I also thought the book lacked a decent structure, and found its writing a bit rambing and unfocused.Thankfully, it wasn't that long...2 stars."
34,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey,4,Very good considering that Carl Sagan is writing outside of his field. Great speculations on the evolution of human/animal intelligence. Minus 1 star for being heavily outdated (originally published in 1977). I'll definitely be reading a more recent book on the same topic; written by a neuroscientist rather than an astrophysicist.
35,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33235645-ankan-paul,5,"A concise and exhaustive book of 250 odd pages depicting the exhilarating tale of the evolution of human intelligence, brachiating to exciting topics exploring the ""Cosmic Calendar"", the need for brains to evolve out of limitations in the gene pool, the fascinating abilities and amazing qualities of the human brain, the siphoning of the human brain to its pristine form with layers formed over ages on the reptilian brain, the hidden truths behind us emerging via evolution by natural selection as the dominating species from our arboreal ancestors, the promising thought process of our cousins- the chimps, the significance of dreams in the survival of our species, the striking differences between the two halves of our brains in information processing, the importance of extra-somatic knowledge storing (writing books!), a symbiotic future of human intelligence and machine/artificial intelligence, and finally ending with humanity's search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Who will say that Dr. Sagan wrote a book on a subject so far from his primary training, when every page is as replete with facts and contemporary neuro-science as it is with Dr. Sagan's profound speculations and conjectures? There is a reason why Dr. Carl Sagan is regarded as the teacher one always wished one had. I felt the same when I read the Cosmos, and since then made it my goal to read all his books. The Dragons of Eden is my second Carl Sagan read, and I must say I felt the same exhilaration while turning the pages that I felt while reading the Cosmos. To me, he is as good an artist as he is a scientist. His prose vividly portrays that. His own love for art, music, philosophy and every field that the human brain has produced is evident in his writings. And his appreciation is not just limited to the human species. His admiration encompasses the whole of the biodiversity on earth. And it is not just limited to the earth, it is for the whole cosmos. His writings have such a universal nature. When he writes, it seems he is writing for the whole species, on behalf of the whole world. Such a visionary! His writings makes one feel how small one's problems are in the grand scale of the ever expanding universe (or multiverse...who knows!).This book is no different. Subtitled ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"", the book does justice to the same. It is a fascinating tale of how we reached where we are today, with our connection to the reptiles (""dragons"") being embedded in the innermost core of our brains (the R-complex). Our brains have developed outwards since then, with more human like features being added in layers over the crudest core. There are exciting facts of how walking on two legs freed our hands to make tools, and to make better tools (hunting tools mostly, as that is only how we could have survived) better brains were a necessity. How our species massacred other primate species which showed signs of language (and hence a slight glimmer of intelligence) to ensure its survival. How our brain size is limited to the size of the pelvic cavity during child-birth. How there is a separation of functions in different locales of the brain and yet how our brains tend to be redundant with self-healing abilities. How there is a fight between the intuitive right half of the brain and the analytic/skeptic left half, and how that has led to the bias for the ""right""! I could go on listing all such beautiful stories put forth in the book. Besides recounting such tales and presenting the then recent developments in the field of neuro-science (split-brain experiments, experiments on understanding the localization of functions in the brain, those on deciphering the phenomenon of dreams, effects of neurotic drugs, surgeries on epileptic patients, studies on brain lesion of war soldiers, experiments on rat brains, etc), there are ample references to the myths and historical stories on the subjects, not to mention, the author's own rich and creative speculations, strewn all over the book, which grips the readers imagination and sends one spiraling down the ""what-if-that-is-true"" lane. The speculations were meant for contemporary and future scientists to work on. My favourite chapter from the book is ""The abstractions of beasts"" where Dr. Sagan presents all evidences of chimpanzee intelligence. Chimpanzees do have human like features, but how do you feel about human-like intelligence! Yes! I was really fascinated by the way Washoe, Lana or Lucy (the chimps) grasped the sign language taught to them and used it to communicate so effectively in such human-like manner. Imagine the idea of being able to talk to someone outside your species! The tales of the experiments that the author recounts is bound to touch your heart, make you really feel them. Language binds! The book is truly a gem. Dr. Sagan ploughs through the then recent developments in brain-studies, saturates the existing body of knowledge on the subject, lets loose his creative imagination, all the while weighing his words on a skeptic's scale, and brings forth this rich harvest for us commoners to enjoy. He stresses on the fact knowledge (""reason alloyed with intuition"" - the intelligence that has been so crucial in the survival and dominating nature of our species) is going to be the sole determinant of our race in the future, both for further development and to prevent self-destruction."
36,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57946842-ricardo-ari-sequeira,5,"Em comparação com os últimos livros que peguei, atrevo-me a dizer que as expetativas para este livro eram mais baixas. Considerava-me um fã de Carl Sagan porque conhecia o seu trabalho mas nunca lera nenhum livro da sua autoria nem vi ainda a famosa série Cosmos (cuja recriação brilhante de Neil DeGrasse Tyson é uma das minhas séries preferidas). Esta foi, portanto, a minha primeira experiência com um 'legado' de Sagan e que legado... Sinceramente, acho que não estava pronto para um trabalho tão genial como o que acabei de ler. Depois deste livro, acho que poderia ler Sagan explicar o ciclo de vida das minhocas com o máximo interesse imaginável. Quando dizem que ele é um apaixonado, um inspirador, um génio, um iluminado, um poeta... tudo isso é verdade e eu tive o prazer de comprovar nesta obra. Digo com toda a certeza (e tenho de pedir desculpa a Stephen Hawking neste aspeto, sem querer menosprezar a sua obra-prima) que este é o melhor livro de não-ficção que já li. Dei por mim a absorver todas as ""especulações"" de Sagan, a pensar nelas quando não estava a ler e a chegar a casa e escrever sobre o que havia lido e a fazer as minhas próprias ""especulações"". Tinha mesmo muita coisa para comentar sobre Os Dragões de Eden mas não me quero alongar nesta review.Quanto à escrita, especificamente falando, nada neste livro é muito técnico e o que se aproxima disso é explicado de forma transparente e de todo compreensível (com imagens esclarecedoras). É um trabalho de divulgação científica exemplar e inigualável.Queria deixar um excerto de um dos meus ""diários"" enquanto lia:""Eu estou a devorar e a adorar este livro, porque não é uma resposta a perguntas existentes, bem pelo contrário - é todo um conjunto de novas perguntas, teorias e suspeitas pertinentes sobre a inteligência humana (e animal). Perguntas que nunca teria imaginado que existiam e que eu tinha até ter lido este livro. Para mim esse é o maior legado com que fico. Já Neil DeGrasse Tyson dizia que, se pudesse perguntar qualquer coisa a uma entidade superior (que teria resposta qualquer que fosse a pergunta), a questão seria uma que ele ainda não conhecia neste momento porque questões mais fundamentais irão sempre surgir no futuro, questões que não imaginamos agora. (...) Vejo também a leitura deste livro como uma jornada de auto-conhecimento pois é de facto o nosso cérebro que é retratado nestas páginas. Este é tipo de livros que vale completamente a leitura e valerá uma releitura no futuro."" Por fim, deixo também um excerto do livro que me marcou desde logo e que demonstra também toda a capacidade de comunicação de Carl Sagan e a sua paixão pela ciência, vida e humanidade:""Como consequência das enormes transformações sociais e tecnológicas dos últimos séculos, o mundo não está a funcionar bem. Não vivemos em sociedades tradicionais e estáticas. Mas os nossos governos, ao resistirem à mudança, actuam como se tal acontecesse. A menos que nos venhamos a destruir totalmente, o futuro pertence às sociedades que, embora não ignorem o lado reptilineo e mamífero do nosso ser, permitem um desabrochar dos componentes caracteristicamente humanos da nossa natureza. Sociedades que encorajam a diversidade, e não o conformismo; sociedades que estejam dispostas a investir em recursos numa diversidade de experiências sociais, politicas, económicas e culturais, preparadas para sacrificar vantagens a curto prazo a benefícios a longo prazo; sociedades que tratem as novas ideias como vias delicadas, frágeis e imensamente valiosas que conduzem ao futuro."" (Carl Sagan, 1977)---Compared to the last books I picked up, I dare say that the expectations for this book were lower. I considered myself a fan of Carl Sagan because I knew his work but had never read any of his books or even seen the famous series Cosmos (whose brilliant recreation of Neil DeGrasse Tyson is one of my favorite series). This was, therefore, my first experience with a legacy of Sagan and what a legacy ... Honestly, I think I was not ready for such a brilliant work.After this book, I think I could read Sagan explaining the worm life cycle with the maximum interest imaginable. When they say that he's a passionate, an inspirer, a genius, an enlightened, a poet ... all this is true and I had the pleasure to prove it now.I say with certainty (and I have to apologize to Stephen Hawking in this respect, not wanting to belittle his masterpiece) that this is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. I absorbed all of Sagan's ""speculations"", I thought of them when I was not reading and I would get home and write about what I had read and to make my own ""speculations."" I had a lot to comment on The Dragons of Eden but I do not want to dwell on this review.As for writing, specifically speaking, nothing in this book is very technical and what comes close to it is explained in a transparent and comprehensible way (with enlightening images). It is an exemplary and unequaled scientific dissemination work.I wanted to leave here something I wrote about the book while reading it:""I am devouring and loving this book, because it's not a response to existing questions but quite the contrary - it's a whole set of new pertinent questions, theories, and suspicions about human (and animal) intelligence. Questions I would never have imagined existed and that I would never had if I didn't read this book. To me, that is the greatest legacy I got. Neil DeGrasse Tyson said that if he could ask anything to a superior entity (which would answer whatever the question was), the question Would be one he did not know at the moment because more fundamental questions will always arise in the future, questions that we can not imagine now ... I also see the reading of this book as a journey of self-knowledge because it is indeed our brain Which is portrayed in these pages.This is kind of a book that is worth reading completely and will be worth a re-reading in the future.Finally, I also leave a quote from the book that marked me from the beginning and also demonstrates all the capacity for communication of Carl Sagan and his passion for science, life and humanity:“As a consequence of the enormous social and technological changes of the last few centuries, the world is not working well. We do not live in traditional and static societies. But our government, in resisting change, act as if we did. Unless we destroy ourselves utterly, the future belongs to those societies that, while not ignoring the reptilian and mammalian parts of our being, enable the characteristically human components of our nature to flourish; to those societies that encourage diversity rather than conformity; to those societies willing to invest resources in a variety of social, political, economic and cultural experiments, and prepared to sacrifice short-term advantage for long-term benefit; to those societies that treat new ideas as delicate, fragile and immensely valuable pathways to the future.” (Carl Sagan, 1977)"
37,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"Carl Sagan's on a tear again. He can't stop himself, and you can't help cheering as you watch him go! He's a one man demonstration of evolution as a model for scientific method: cook up a whole lot of crazy mutant ideas and set them all free, unleash them on the World, and see which ones survive. ***Right now, he's working on the Mesozoic, and I'm along for the ride: we've got moronic dinos hunting mammals, which probably sleep all day as a defense mechanism ('cause they're too stupid to be quiet whilst being hunted) and cause ""the demise of the dinosaurs...by nocturnal predation on reptilian eggs. Two chicken eggs for breakfast may be all that is left... of this ancient mammalian cuisine."" This is classic Sagan, with some tenuous but imaginative hypothesis stretched to it's logical conclusion, and an insightful connection to bring it all home at the end. ***A stretched premise is one hallmark of science fiction writing, and I think Sagan's book fits the bill. He is Larry Niven and your favorite high school biology teacher rolled into one. But at the end what we get from Carl is a lot of fun stories and little more. Most are in the common cultural background (too many episodes of ""Cosmos"" perhaps?), but everyone is sure to come across a few delightful new anecdotes they hadn't previously heard: monkeys learning sign language, the endearing stupidities of midget brains,a naked Dr Louis Leaky outrunning his antelope, cannibal insectuous sex, Freud's work as a metaphor for our triply evolved and layered brain, (the reptilian hind brain naturally associated with the corporate board room: I liked that one!), the dad, divorced for cause of insomnia who retains custody of his genetically similar daughter, list goes on. This is all really good stuff and fast fun reading. ***But for all his fecundity, Sagan is not careful about the details of the ideas he sprays over the pages. His evolutionary reasoning is uncareful. Factors of 10 and 100 slip easily in and out in his calculation of brain power, the ratio of brain to body mass vs pure brain volume is a two edged sword he cuts in either direction as it suits him in different chapters, and so forth. He'll pause for air and disavow everything with a hand waving caution, ""just a hypothesis, now,"" but then he's off again. Waiter, I'll have whatever he's smoking. ***I once was teased with a variation on ""boundless youthful enthusiasm"" that transposed to: ""boundful useless enthusiasm"" and it comes, unbidden, to mind now. As an example of excitement overcoming rationality, the idea that an 8 Tonne T-rex, couldn't rouse itself from its numb stupor to prevent feral warm blooded whatevers from eating it's eggs is just an impossible stretch. (And, we can't help imagining the clever whatevers are our very own ancestors. Yeah! Go mammals!) OTOH, just considering the size and surface area, it is hard to imagine such big animals were not kept warm merely through metabolic inefficiency. THEY would have been the nocturnes, while we would have curled into furry balls at night, scampering between moribund overheating dinos during the hot lazy afternoons. Also, fur absorbs UV light, protecting our genetic blueprints from the supernova disaster that eradicated our scaly skinned competitors. ***Ok, ok, that's not in the book, I made it all up, but HE does it too! Yes, I know, HE'S Carl Sagan, and I'm not. ***We miss you Carl, - R.I.P. ***--------------Matt responded: I am curious to know what you think of some of the ""stretched premises"" towards the end. They attempt to apply his 'theories' on intelligence towards attitudes on social issues (computer intelligence, abortion, education, dream theory) and it all culminates in a direct insult of ""right-brain"" ideas diverging us from a utopia-by-intelligence. (Where intelligence is left-brain dominant).-------Ok done now, and my reply (to Matt) is that the book seemed to go out with a whimper, and I was neither opposed to nor enervated by, any of the last of it. I wanted cyborgs and computer super-minds, silicon immortality, x-ray vision and telepathy. Instead we got a pitch to fund wired classrooms and SETI. Ok already! ...I was hoping for more.I was not opposed because I agree with his thesis. Sagan is the consummate vampire slayer; he repudiates mystics of all sorts. Remember Sagan was (we must use the past tense not because he's dead but because, already, he represents a bygone era) still fighting Galileo's fight, one we only THINK is over because we live here: the battle of science against irrationality. REmember, Sagan thinks our right brain is responsible for brilliant flashes of insight, and art. I don't think he means the insult you apprehend.This takes us back to ZaTAoMM. Picture the misty past! The Epoch is BG (before Gates) and nerds are tolerated but joyfully reviled. Technology's evil, computers are laughable. People Do Not Believe ETI is out there and they're sure God is. The World is ruled by USSteel and PONG is the best and only computer game for heaven's sake!. It is hard for you guys to believe this shit (I call into context, regretfully, my advanced relative decrepitude, to remind that I am able to speak to you from the past, before your birth.) My point? It's a *real* battle that really needed to be fought, so we should forgive Sagan any overzealous driving home of the points. You need only think on the Texas and Kansas school systems to worry if the serpent's really truly been slain.Comments on some excellent vignettes towards the end:Witches dreaming of flying by reason of tripping on nightshade ~~ don't get me started! That they ""flew"" using broomsticks, well it's all merely hinted at, but if you listen close you can hear Carl snickering at his own jokes.Computers are conscious, or soon will be. I thought this especially cool, because it will at least be true so far as I can tell, and you can do NO BETTER! I mean, I can't *know* that you are conscious either, (solipsism) only that you're clever. So philosophically, once machines are clever, we may as well ascribe consciousness to them: it's only fair. Carl is very comfortable with this, with the proposition that consciousness is no more than the result of mere complexity, taken to a sufficient extreme. That's very well adjusted of him: I'm somebody who *wants* there to be more to me than there apparently is. (...and I make a lot more of this point than he bothers to.)Another excellent anecdote was Thoth railing against hieroglyphics as the calculators and video games of the age, certain to corrupt young minds which, relieved of the requirement to memorize everything, would grow indolent and weak. At this juncture, Carl reminds us how great written language is with a taunt that it allows an author to leap remotely off the page and into your brain! ...and across the chasm of death, too, I thought: a form of eternal life. For that instant I was again impressed with how very imaginatively Carl Sagan is able to think. So I'll respectfully say, ""No, I don't think it really sensible to imagine that Carl Sagan's prejudiced against the right brain."" To the contrary, he's All About right brain; his own is probably 50% bigger than the left.---------------------post script: as a companion to the chapter on right/left brain thinking I warmly recommend ""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" as a closely related romp through even further stretched conjectures of how our brain structure and thinking may be related.*** added 'cause Facebook publishes these without separating the paragraphs."

Is not an easy book, i know that Carl Sagan tried his best to make this book easy for non-biology experts, it would have been better if the info was some how more organized or more conclusive in some topics. If you are thrilled and interested in topics such as evolution, biology, human’s brain complexity and related topics this book is for you, do not expect a sciencie fiction novel. "

In the beginning, he kind of apologizes to the reader for embarking on such a speculative journey of the origins of mankind, but the stream of his thought is beyond convincing. For such a short read I learned a lot, and especially it made me consider non-human kinds of intelligence from a number of perspectives.I would love to read the updated version as so many things have changed since 40 years ago..."
46,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915487-corey,4,Carl Sagan had a beautiful mind. I would rate this book higher if I were smart enough to understand it all. 
47,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12379384-z-yasemin,5,Carl Sagan continues to impress me...
48,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9096819-simon,4,"I got around to reading this book after finding out that it's a foundational text for the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) movement, which Carl Sagan himself had a huge role in popularising: In ""Dragons of Eden"", Sagan gives laypeople a detailed explanation for how intelligence evolved here on Earth and hence clues for what to look for if they want to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.This book is very, very 1970s in many ways: As other reviewers have pointed out, the results of scientific research into neurobiology since its 1977 publishing date have falsified some of the ideas Sagans present here. There are also chapters where Sagan gets all starry-eyed and optimistic about computer technology's ability to improve human learning, to an extent that feels outright ridiculous to someone reading this in 2020. Despite all that, I am grateful for Sagan writing this book since it's difficult to find other books that present the basics of evolutionary biology, genetics and how the brain functions in this accessible a way to people who do not have an academic background in those scientific fields. It's even more impressive an achievement considering that the author is writing outside his own field of expertise - I doubt that Sam Harris could write as well about astrophysics as Carl Sagan does about neuroscience here!Much of the information presented here is also completely new to me, like how the different specialised parts of the brain have wildly varying proportions in different animal species depending on the animal's lifestyle - or how much easier it is to learn chimpanzees sign language than spoken language, to the point that chimpanzees can master sign language as well as humans. For me, the most interesting part of ""The Dragons of Eden"" has to be Sagan's explanation for how dreaming evolved: He theorises it's an evolutionary adaptation to make sure mammals stay asleep when hiding from nocturnal predators, and that the omnipresence of dragons and vampires in folklore and mythology around the world can be traced back to instincts evolved to help us avoid predatory dinosaurs and reptiles as well as nocturnal predators.I also quite like the psychedelic cover painting of an australopithecine Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden populated by dinosaurs, prehistoric rhinoceri and even scorpions - a painting that probably ended up spraypainted on quite a few VW Microbuses back in the 1970s."
49,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,3,"The book is fun and easy to read, but it doesn’t satisfy the incredible complexities of the subject. The book is a lot like a summary of what people knew about consciousness at the time of writing, plus reflection and speculations from Sagan. Having read many of Richard Dawkins’s books, I didn’t get much out of this, except an entertaining summary.Keep in mind that a lot has changed in the field of the subject since the book was written, and, again, it contains a lot of speculations by Sagan."

51,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71398830-johnny-j,4,"This wasn't actually my first time reading Dragons of Eden, as I had to read it for a certain curriculum based assignment at a private school I attended a few years ago. I forget exactly why we read it, but I can remember that there was a focus on neuroscience and the early life of Earth in what we were learning. My teacher was also just a huge Sagan/popular science fanatic. I remember thinking the book was interesting, but I, more or less... skimmed it back then. Maybe I've matured (I don't really think so), but I wanted to pick it up again and actually process the information that Sagan blissfully bestows on the reader. There wasn't any pressing need for me to read Dragons of Eden, I just kind of saw it sitting on my bookshelf when I was making the reading challenge list for English class and thought it would be nice to re-read. Dragons of Eden is, more or less, chapters upon chapters of Carl Sagan's thoughts and discoveries on the brain and the human condition. From segments that literally give a calendar of the entirety of the universe's events, to chapters that focus solely on the learning capabilities of primates, to findings on the rare deformity of a ""split-brain"" in humans, Sagan provides an insane amount of information in a small book (there are exponentially more topics highlighted in Eden, those mentioned are just some examples). Each subject, while they may seem distantly related, builds on top of one another with various terminologies and fundamental concepts. His overall thesis is that human nature and the neural states of homo sapiens are filled with relics from the distant past, those relics still visible today. It's not often i'll go for something non-fiction, especially something in the field of neuroscience – the topic honestly being a little far removed from my interests. Despite this, found this book a joy to read (re-read), and it's actually made me more interested in neurology than I thought I could. Sagan makes the figurative tons of data in Eden extremely accessible and interesting, connecting each of his refined concepts to create a humble page turner. None of the information ever feels like it drags on at any point, as each chapter is short enough to get to the point without sacrificing any of the important details. It's really impressive how Sagan manages to create a book thats so jam-packed with information and still make it entertaining and accessible.One thing that is an obvious downside to this book is that some of the research and technological terms are outdated, and basically false at this point. This isn't to say that this book is all incorrect data, of course not, but having been released in 1977, there have definitely been some discoveries to prove some things in Eden wrong. This doesn't necessarily make Sagan's points less strong, however. His ideas and thoughts are still strong and poignant, even if some of the data is dated. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I think you'd be surprised at how much you'd enjoy it."
52,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13999805-greg-metcalf,5,"As I was reading this book again, since a first reading close to twenty years ago, a friend mentioned that if he was going to read a popular science book, he'd read a new one, not one from the seventies. That comment kind of got stuck in my head. It would certainly be interesting to read about how far sign language development with chimpanzees, for example, has come, which must have just gotten started when Sagan wrote about it here. But this book is Carl Sagan playing with possibilities. In a chapter on right and left hemisphere brain functioning, he suggests the possibility that the effect of marijuana might be to inhibit left brain reasoning giving the more intuitive right brain more influence over our thinking, which he compares to there always being stars above us but we need the dominant sun to set before they become visible. What a fascinating notion and how poetically stated. If anything Sagan writes about here has been disproven, he would be the first to say, Isn't this new evidence fascinating? We all wish Carl Sagan were alive and writing books about the cutting edge discoveries of today, but his creative thinking remains an inspiration. At one point, he was writing about how the written word manages to put the voice of someone else in your mind and wrote ""(Hello!)"" That alone made this well worth a second read. "
53,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571445-rajat-twit,4,"Not recommended for casual readers, this book is a very informative collection of amazing knowledge for the science enthusiasts. Expanding his knowledge from astrophysics to Biology, anthropology, evolutionary, history and upcoming scientific gadgets, Carl Sagan produces a wonderful literature on what may have been the case for the evolution of human intelligence. The book is a wonderful study of various aspects of human evolution and has given vivid and relevant examples for every point mentioned by Sagan. Not only Sagan is honest about the knowledge available at the time of writing the book, but predicts some wonderful future inventions for computer intelligence which we may see turning into reality today. His sharp predictions at the time of 1980s, which we may witness to becoming a reality, show that many of his speculations for the history of evolution may have many relevant points.The language is lucid and flawless, as is always in the case of Carl Sagan. He is not only one of the most significant science educator of 20 Century but is also a role model for many science enthusiasts. The voice that has ignited the minds of many scientists and engineers has proven through this book that people not from science background may become interested in Science, if science is presented in an entertaining and fun way!"

Not because it is dated, which it really is, but because the subtitle is utterly misleading. ""Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence"" do not actually occur in this book, which is far more concerned with the morphology of the human brain and the functions of its component parts; there is really nothing in this book about selective mechanisms or advantages, nothing about the huge metabolic costs of a 1400 cc brain, and little real discussion of the pressures driving the selection FOR increased encephalization. Nothing about evolution. Sorry, Carl ol' buddy, but this is a diatribe about brain function, quantitative measurements through vivisection experiments on all sorts of critters, and off-topic rambles about the ethics of abortion and extraterrestrial intelligence. This is a good read if you want to sound smart at a party, but that's about it."
55,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19488978-trey-nowell,4,"Pretty interesting book overall, did tend to go from one topic to another and then come back to the topic with a tiny bit of rambling. I also consider the book for its date written, and amazed Sagan could foresee so many things coming to fruition in technology (such as cloning and everyone having multiple computers). It must have been even more amazing 35 plus years ago to see how much information our genes contain. Tackles issues regarding human brain has developed over time, its components, the differences in the evolution of man, reptiles vs. mammals, sleeping in both, dreams, mental illness, the likelihood of aliens, etc. Very cool topics then and today, imagine they will be for millions and billions of years to come."
56,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,3,"This book is dated, but good. I love reading about research on the human brain. Sagan makes lots of corny jokes and asides that are not really appropriate but sort of endearing. The evolution of the brain is the focus and Sagan talks a lot about the ""reptilian"" brain, the part that we had before we became human. Also the discussion of what really makes us human is so interesting. On the radio some modern researcher said that the brain is a record, a story of what has happened to that particular body. Anyways, this book is archaic compared to what they know now, so I am looking for a modern (post-modern?) read on the amazing human brain!"

The book was pretty easy to read, it's a short and basic introduction to the brain. It starts saying some things about the Cosmos, evolution and the brain itself. I recommend this book if you are new to the topic, because if you have more experience in the field, this book may seem too basic, though it doesn't make it less great, I really enjoyed it a lot. Lastly, it's important to know that the book it's a little bit old so some things may be wrong."

Evolutionary Anthropology rewritten for the masses, but still sometimes tedious and hard to follow; I found myself rereading several pages just to absorb all the information.

Here he examines humanity from a lot of different interesting angles, everything between cosmology, history, biology and morality. Here is something that will touch everyone. In my case i was especially fascinated with the chapter on cross species communication, but every single chapter is insanely intriguing. "
62,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,1,"The copy of the book I got was published in 1977 and what isn't out of date is wrong. The subtitle is ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"",  but little in the book is about that topic. The book rambles from from one subject to another,from cute drawings by everyone's favorite: M.C. Escher,to the chemical composition of distant stars. Perhaps the most interesting part is the chart that shows  Brain mass vs. Body weight. On that chart moles rate quite highly.Probably not the point the author was trying to make. The next time I see a mole I'll watch for signs of intelligence. There are many tidbits of trivia, one is the fact , that the average person has a 10% chance of having a genetic mutation that can be passed on to the next generation. Needless to say, almost all of these are harmful."
63,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,2,"Not one of Sagan's best books, IMHO.While this was not a bad book, I didn't find it overly stimulating or engaging, either.He talks about the cosmic calendar, left brain/right brain research, animal intelligence and other related topics.Some of Sagan's speculations about intelligence in here have now been disproved; ie - that chimps are capable of speech. See Robert Sapolsky's ""Human Behavioural Biology"" for a refutation of this.I also thought the book lacked a decent structure, and found its writing a bit rambing and unfocused.Thankfully, it wasn't that long...2 stars."
64,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey,4,Very good considering that Carl Sagan is writing outside of his field. Great speculations on the evolution of human/animal intelligence. Minus 1 star for being heavily outdated (originally published in 1977). I'll definitely be reading a more recent book on the same topic; written by a neuroscientist rather than an astrophysicist.
65,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33235645-ankan-paul,5,"A concise and exhaustive book of 250 odd pages depicting the exhilarating tale of the evolution of human intelligence, brachiating to exciting topics exploring the ""Cosmic Calendar"", the need for brains to evolve out of limitations in the gene pool, the fascinating abilities and amazing qualities of the human brain, the siphoning of the human brain to its pristine form with layers formed over ages on the reptilian brain, the hidden truths behind us emerging via evolution by natural selection as the dominating species from our arboreal ancestors, the promising thought process of our cousins- the chimps, the significance of dreams in the survival of our species, the striking differences between the two halves of our brains in information processing, the importance of extra-somatic knowledge storing (writing books!), a symbiotic future of human intelligence and machine/artificial intelligence, and finally ending with humanity's search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Who will say that Dr. Sagan wrote a book on a subject so far from his primary training, when every page is as replete with facts and contemporary neuro-science as it is with Dr. Sagan's profound speculations and conjectures? There is a reason why Dr. Carl Sagan is regarded as the teacher one always wished one had. I felt the same when I read the Cosmos, and since then made it my goal to read all his books. The Dragons of Eden is my second Carl Sagan read, and I must say I felt the same exhilaration while turning the pages that I felt while reading the Cosmos. To me, he is as good an artist as he is a scientist. His prose vividly portrays that. His own love for art, music, philosophy and every field that the human brain has produced is evident in his writings. And his appreciation is not just limited to the human species. His admiration encompasses the whole of the biodiversity on earth. And it is not just limited to the earth, it is for the whole cosmos. His writings have such a universal nature. When he writes, it seems he is writing for the whole species, on behalf of the whole world. Such a visionary! His writings makes one feel how small one's problems are in the grand scale of the ever expanding universe (or multiverse...who knows!).This book is no different. Subtitled ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"", the book does justice to the same. It is a fascinating tale of how we reached where we are today, with our connection to the reptiles (""dragons"") being embedded in the innermost core of our brains (the R-complex). Our brains have developed outwards since then, with more human like features being added in layers over the crudest core. There are exciting facts of how walking on two legs freed our hands to make tools, and to make better tools (hunting tools mostly, as that is only how we could have survived) better brains were a necessity. How our species massacred other primate species which showed signs of language (and hence a slight glimmer of intelligence) to ensure its survival. How our brain size is limited to the size of the pelvic cavity during child-birth. How there is a separation of functions in different locales of the brain and yet how our brains tend to be redundant with self-healing abilities. How there is a fight between the intuitive right half of the brain and the analytic/skeptic left half, and how that has led to the bias for the ""right""! I could go on listing all such beautiful stories put forth in the book. Besides recounting such tales and presenting the then recent developments in the field of neuro-science (split-brain experiments, experiments on understanding the localization of functions in the brain, those on deciphering the phenomenon of dreams, effects of neurotic drugs, surgeries on epileptic patients, studies on brain lesion of war soldiers, experiments on rat brains, etc), there are ample references to the myths and historical stories on the subjects, not to mention, the author's own rich and creative speculations, strewn all over the book, which grips the readers imagination and sends one spiraling down the ""what-if-that-is-true"" lane. The speculations were meant for contemporary and future scientists to work on. My favourite chapter from the book is ""The abstractions of beasts"" where Dr. Sagan presents all evidences of chimpanzee intelligence. Chimpanzees do have human like features, but how do you feel about human-like intelligence! Yes! I was really fascinated by the way Washoe, Lana or Lucy (the chimps) grasped the sign language taught to them and used it to communicate so effectively in such human-like manner. Imagine the idea of being able to talk to someone outside your species! The tales of the experiments that the author recounts is bound to touch your heart, make you really feel them. Language binds! The book is truly a gem. Dr. Sagan ploughs through the then recent developments in brain-studies, saturates the existing body of knowledge on the subject, lets loose his creative imagination, all the while weighing his words on a skeptic's scale, and brings forth this rich harvest for us commoners to enjoy. He stresses on the fact knowledge (""reason alloyed with intuition"" - the intelligence that has been so crucial in the survival and dominating nature of our species) is going to be the sole determinant of our race in the future, both for further development and to prevent self-destruction."
66,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57946842-ricardo-ari-sequeira,5,"Em comparação com os últimos livros que peguei, atrevo-me a dizer que as expetativas para este livro eram mais baixas. Considerava-me um fã de Carl Sagan porque conhecia o seu trabalho mas nunca lera nenhum livro da sua autoria nem vi ainda a famosa série Cosmos (cuja recriação brilhante de Neil DeGrasse Tyson é uma das minhas séries preferidas). Esta foi, portanto, a minha primeira experiência com um 'legado' de Sagan e que legado... Sinceramente, acho que não estava pronto para um trabalho tão genial como o que acabei de ler. Depois deste livro, acho que poderia ler Sagan explicar o ciclo de vida das minhocas com o máximo interesse imaginável. Quando dizem que ele é um apaixonado, um inspirador, um génio, um iluminado, um poeta... tudo isso é verdade e eu tive o prazer de comprovar nesta obra. Digo com toda a certeza (e tenho de pedir desculpa a Stephen Hawking neste aspeto, sem querer menosprezar a sua obra-prima) que este é o melhor livro de não-ficção que já li. Dei por mim a absorver todas as ""especulações"" de Sagan, a pensar nelas quando não estava a ler e a chegar a casa e escrever sobre o que havia lido e a fazer as minhas próprias ""especulações"". Tinha mesmo muita coisa para comentar sobre Os Dragões de Eden mas não me quero alongar nesta review.Quanto à escrita, especificamente falando, nada neste livro é muito técnico e o que se aproxima disso é explicado de forma transparente e de todo compreensível (com imagens esclarecedoras). É um trabalho de divulgação científica exemplar e inigualável.Queria deixar um excerto de um dos meus ""diários"" enquanto lia:""Eu estou a devorar e a adorar este livro, porque não é uma resposta a perguntas existentes, bem pelo contrário - é todo um conjunto de novas perguntas, teorias e suspeitas pertinentes sobre a inteligência humana (e animal). Perguntas que nunca teria imaginado que existiam e que eu tinha até ter lido este livro. Para mim esse é o maior legado com que fico. Já Neil DeGrasse Tyson dizia que, se pudesse perguntar qualquer coisa a uma entidade superior (que teria resposta qualquer que fosse a pergunta), a questão seria uma que ele ainda não conhecia neste momento porque questões mais fundamentais irão sempre surgir no futuro, questões que não imaginamos agora. (...) Vejo também a leitura deste livro como uma jornada de auto-conhecimento pois é de facto o nosso cérebro que é retratado nestas páginas. Este é tipo de livros que vale completamente a leitura e valerá uma releitura no futuro."" Por fim, deixo também um excerto do livro que me marcou desde logo e que demonstra também toda a capacidade de comunicação de Carl Sagan e a sua paixão pela ciência, vida e humanidade:""Como consequência das enormes transformações sociais e tecnológicas dos últimos séculos, o mundo não está a funcionar bem. Não vivemos em sociedades tradicionais e estáticas. Mas os nossos governos, ao resistirem à mudança, actuam como se tal acontecesse. A menos que nos venhamos a destruir totalmente, o futuro pertence às sociedades que, embora não ignorem o lado reptilineo e mamífero do nosso ser, permitem um desabrochar dos componentes caracteristicamente humanos da nossa natureza. Sociedades que encorajam a diversidade, e não o conformismo; sociedades que estejam dispostas a investir em recursos numa diversidade de experiências sociais, politicas, económicas e culturais, preparadas para sacrificar vantagens a curto prazo a benefícios a longo prazo; sociedades que tratem as novas ideias como vias delicadas, frágeis e imensamente valiosas que conduzem ao futuro."" (Carl Sagan, 1977)---Compared to the last books I picked up, I dare say that the expectations for this book were lower. I considered myself a fan of Carl Sagan because I knew his work but had never read any of his books or even seen the famous series Cosmos (whose brilliant recreation of Neil DeGrasse Tyson is one of my favorite series). This was, therefore, my first experience with a legacy of Sagan and what a legacy ... Honestly, I think I was not ready for such a brilliant work.After this book, I think I could read Sagan explaining the worm life cycle with the maximum interest imaginable. When they say that he's a passionate, an inspirer, a genius, an enlightened, a poet ... all this is true and I had the pleasure to prove it now.I say with certainty (and I have to apologize to Stephen Hawking in this respect, not wanting to belittle his masterpiece) that this is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. I absorbed all of Sagan's ""speculations"", I thought of them when I was not reading and I would get home and write about what I had read and to make my own ""speculations."" I had a lot to comment on The Dragons of Eden but I do not want to dwell on this review.As for writing, specifically speaking, nothing in this book is very technical and what comes close to it is explained in a transparent and comprehensible way (with enlightening images). It is an exemplary and unequaled scientific dissemination work.I wanted to leave here something I wrote about the book while reading it:""I am devouring and loving this book, because it's not a response to existing questions but quite the contrary - it's a whole set of new pertinent questions, theories, and suspicions about human (and animal) intelligence. Questions I would never have imagined existed and that I would never had if I didn't read this book. To me, that is the greatest legacy I got. Neil DeGrasse Tyson said that if he could ask anything to a superior entity (which would answer whatever the question was), the question Would be one he did not know at the moment because more fundamental questions will always arise in the future, questions that we can not imagine now ... I also see the reading of this book as a journey of self-knowledge because it is indeed our brain Which is portrayed in these pages.This is kind of a book that is worth reading completely and will be worth a re-reading in the future.Finally, I also leave a quote from the book that marked me from the beginning and also demonstrates all the capacity for communication of Carl Sagan and his passion for science, life and humanity:“As a consequence of the enormous social and technological changes of the last few centuries, the world is not working well. We do not live in traditional and static societies. But our government, in resisting change, act as if we did. Unless we destroy ourselves utterly, the future belongs to those societies that, while not ignoring the reptilian and mammalian parts of our being, enable the characteristically human components of our nature to flourish; to those societies that encourage diversity rather than conformity; to those societies willing to invest resources in a variety of social, political, economic and cultural experiments, and prepared to sacrifice short-term advantage for long-term benefit; to those societies that treat new ideas as delicate, fragile and immensely valuable pathways to the future.” (Carl Sagan, 1977)"
67,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"Carl Sagan's on a tear again. He can't stop himself, and you can't help cheering as you watch him go! He's a one man demonstration of evolution as a model for scientific method: cook up a whole lot of crazy mutant ideas and set them all free, unleash them on the World, and see which ones survive. ***Right now, he's working on the Mesozoic, and I'm along for the ride: we've got moronic dinos hunting mammals, which probably sleep all day as a defense mechanism ('cause they're too stupid to be quiet whilst being hunted) and cause ""the demise of the dinosaurs...by nocturnal predation on reptilian eggs. Two chicken eggs for breakfast may be all that is left... of this ancient mammalian cuisine."" This is classic Sagan, with some tenuous but imaginative hypothesis stretched to it's logical conclusion, and an insightful connection to bring it all home at the end. ***A stretched premise is one hallmark of science fiction writing, and I think Sagan's book fits the bill. He is Larry Niven and your favorite high school biology teacher rolled into one. But at the end what we get from Carl is a lot of fun stories and little more. Most are in the common cultural background (too many episodes of ""Cosmos"" perhaps?), but everyone is sure to come across a few delightful new anecdotes they hadn't previously heard: monkeys learning sign language, the endearing stupidities of midget brains,a naked Dr Louis Leaky outrunning his antelope, cannibal insectuous sex, Freud's work as a metaphor for our triply evolved and layered brain, (the reptilian hind brain naturally associated with the corporate board room: I liked that one!), the dad, divorced for cause of insomnia who retains custody of his genetically similar daughter, list goes on. This is all really good stuff and fast fun reading. ***But for all his fecundity, Sagan is not careful about the details of the ideas he sprays over the pages. His evolutionary reasoning is uncareful. Factors of 10 and 100 slip easily in and out in his calculation of brain power, the ratio of brain to body mass vs pure brain volume is a two edged sword he cuts in either direction as it suits him in different chapters, and so forth. He'll pause for air and disavow everything with a hand waving caution, ""just a hypothesis, now,"" but then he's off again. Waiter, I'll have whatever he's smoking. ***I once was teased with a variation on ""boundless youthful enthusiasm"" that transposed to: ""boundful useless enthusiasm"" and it comes, unbidden, to mind now. As an example of excitement overcoming rationality, the idea that an 8 Tonne T-rex, couldn't rouse itself from its numb stupor to prevent feral warm blooded whatevers from eating it's eggs is just an impossible stretch. (And, we can't help imagining the clever whatevers are our very own ancestors. Yeah! Go mammals!) OTOH, just considering the size and surface area, it is hard to imagine such big animals were not kept warm merely through metabolic inefficiency. THEY would have been the nocturnes, while we would have curled into furry balls at night, scampering between moribund overheating dinos during the hot lazy afternoons. Also, fur absorbs UV light, protecting our genetic blueprints from the supernova disaster that eradicated our scaly skinned competitors. ***Ok, ok, that's not in the book, I made it all up, but HE does it too! Yes, I know, HE'S Carl Sagan, and I'm not. ***We miss you Carl, - R.I.P. ***--------------Matt responded: I am curious to know what you think of some of the ""stretched premises"" towards the end. They attempt to apply his 'theories' on intelligence towards attitudes on social issues (computer intelligence, abortion, education, dream theory) and it all culminates in a direct insult of ""right-brain"" ideas diverging us from a utopia-by-intelligence. (Where intelligence is left-brain dominant).-------Ok done now, and my reply (to Matt) is that the book seemed to go out with a whimper, and I was neither opposed to nor enervated by, any of the last of it. I wanted cyborgs and computer super-minds, silicon immortality, x-ray vision and telepathy. Instead we got a pitch to fund wired classrooms and SETI. Ok already! ...I was hoping for more.I was not opposed because I agree with his thesis. Sagan is the consummate vampire slayer; he repudiates mystics of all sorts. Remember Sagan was (we must use the past tense not because he's dead but because, already, he represents a bygone era) still fighting Galileo's fight, one we only THINK is over because we live here: the battle of science against irrationality. REmember, Sagan thinks our right brain is responsible for brilliant flashes of insight, and art. I don't think he means the insult you apprehend.This takes us back to ZaTAoMM. Picture the misty past! The Epoch is BG (before Gates) and nerds are tolerated but joyfully reviled. Technology's evil, computers are laughable. People Do Not Believe ETI is out there and they're sure God is. The World is ruled by USSteel and PONG is the best and only computer game for heaven's sake!. It is hard for you guys to believe this shit (I call into context, regretfully, my advanced relative decrepitude, to remind that I am able to speak to you from the past, before your birth.) My point? It's a *real* battle that really needed to be fought, so we should forgive Sagan any overzealous driving home of the points. You need only think on the Texas and Kansas school systems to worry if the serpent's really truly been slain.Comments on some excellent vignettes towards the end:Witches dreaming of flying by reason of tripping on nightshade ~~ don't get me started! That they ""flew"" using broomsticks, well it's all merely hinted at, but if you listen close you can hear Carl snickering at his own jokes.Computers are conscious, or soon will be. I thought this especially cool, because it will at least be true so far as I can tell, and you can do NO BETTER! I mean, I can't *know* that you are conscious either, (solipsism) only that you're clever. So philosophically, once machines are clever, we may as well ascribe consciousness to them: it's only fair. Carl is very comfortable with this, with the proposition that consciousness is no more than the result of mere complexity, taken to a sufficient extreme. That's very well adjusted of him: I'm somebody who *wants* there to be more to me than there apparently is. (...and I make a lot more of this point than he bothers to.)Another excellent anecdote was Thoth railing against hieroglyphics as the calculators and video games of the age, certain to corrupt young minds which, relieved of the requirement to memorize everything, would grow indolent and weak. At this juncture, Carl reminds us how great written language is with a taunt that it allows an author to leap remotely off the page and into your brain! ...and across the chasm of death, too, I thought: a form of eternal life. For that instant I was again impressed with how very imaginatively Carl Sagan is able to think. So I'll respectfully say, ""No, I don't think it really sensible to imagine that Carl Sagan's prejudiced against the right brain."" To the contrary, he's All About right brain; his own is probably 50% bigger than the left.---------------------post script: as a companion to the chapter on right/left brain thinking I warmly recommend ""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" as a closely related romp through even further stretched conjectures of how our brain structure and thinking may be related.*** added 'cause Facebook publishes these without separating the paragraphs."

Is not an easy book, i know that Carl Sagan tried his best to make this book easy for non-biology experts, it would have been better if the info was some how more organized or more conclusive in some topics. If you are thrilled and interested in topics such as evolution, biology, human’s brain complexity and related topics this book is for you, do not expect a sciencie fiction novel. "

In the beginning, he kind of apologizes to the reader for embarking on such a speculative journey of the origins of mankind, but the stream of his thought is beyond convincing. For such a short read I learned a lot, and especially it made me consider non-human kinds of intelligence from a number of perspectives.I would love to read the updated version as so many things have changed since 40 years ago..."
76,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915487-corey,4,Carl Sagan had a beautiful mind. I would rate this book higher if I were smart enough to understand it all. 
77,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12379384-z-yasemin,5,Carl Sagan continues to impress me...
78,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9096819-simon,4,"I got around to reading this book after finding out that it's a foundational text for the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) movement, which Carl Sagan himself had a huge role in popularising: In ""Dragons of Eden"", Sagan gives laypeople a detailed explanation for how intelligence evolved here on Earth and hence clues for what to look for if they want to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.This book is very, very 1970s in many ways: As other reviewers have pointed out, the results of scientific research into neurobiology since its 1977 publishing date have falsified some of the ideas Sagans present here. There are also chapters where Sagan gets all starry-eyed and optimistic about computer technology's ability to improve human learning, to an extent that feels outright ridiculous to someone reading this in 2020. Despite all that, I am grateful for Sagan writing this book since it's difficult to find other books that present the basics of evolutionary biology, genetics and how the brain functions in this accessible a way to people who do not have an academic background in those scientific fields. It's even more impressive an achievement considering that the author is writing outside his own field of expertise - I doubt that Sam Harris could write as well about astrophysics as Carl Sagan does about neuroscience here!Much of the information presented here is also completely new to me, like how the different specialised parts of the brain have wildly varying proportions in different animal species depending on the animal's lifestyle - or how much easier it is to learn chimpanzees sign language than spoken language, to the point that chimpanzees can master sign language as well as humans. For me, the most interesting part of ""The Dragons of Eden"" has to be Sagan's explanation for how dreaming evolved: He theorises it's an evolutionary adaptation to make sure mammals stay asleep when hiding from nocturnal predators, and that the omnipresence of dragons and vampires in folklore and mythology around the world can be traced back to instincts evolved to help us avoid predatory dinosaurs and reptiles as well as nocturnal predators.I also quite like the psychedelic cover painting of an australopithecine Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden populated by dinosaurs, prehistoric rhinoceri and even scorpions - a painting that probably ended up spraypainted on quite a few VW Microbuses back in the 1970s."
79,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,3,"The book is fun and easy to read, but it doesn’t satisfy the incredible complexities of the subject. The book is a lot like a summary of what people knew about consciousness at the time of writing, plus reflection and speculations from Sagan. Having read many of Richard Dawkins’s books, I didn’t get much out of this, except an entertaining summary.Keep in mind that a lot has changed in the field of the subject since the book was written, and, again, it contains a lot of speculations by Sagan."

81,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71398830-johnny-j,4,"This wasn't actually my first time reading Dragons of Eden, as I had to read it for a certain curriculum based assignment at a private school I attended a few years ago. I forget exactly why we read it, but I can remember that there was a focus on neuroscience and the early life of Earth in what we were learning. My teacher was also just a huge Sagan/popular science fanatic. I remember thinking the book was interesting, but I, more or less... skimmed it back then. Maybe I've matured (I don't really think so), but I wanted to pick it up again and actually process the information that Sagan blissfully bestows on the reader. There wasn't any pressing need for me to read Dragons of Eden, I just kind of saw it sitting on my bookshelf when I was making the reading challenge list for English class and thought it would be nice to re-read. Dragons of Eden is, more or less, chapters upon chapters of Carl Sagan's thoughts and discoveries on the brain and the human condition. From segments that literally give a calendar of the entirety of the universe's events, to chapters that focus solely on the learning capabilities of primates, to findings on the rare deformity of a ""split-brain"" in humans, Sagan provides an insane amount of information in a small book (there are exponentially more topics highlighted in Eden, those mentioned are just some examples). Each subject, while they may seem distantly related, builds on top of one another with various terminologies and fundamental concepts. His overall thesis is that human nature and the neural states of homo sapiens are filled with relics from the distant past, those relics still visible today. It's not often i'll go for something non-fiction, especially something in the field of neuroscience – the topic honestly being a little far removed from my interests. Despite this, found this book a joy to read (re-read), and it's actually made me more interested in neurology than I thought I could. Sagan makes the figurative tons of data in Eden extremely accessible and interesting, connecting each of his refined concepts to create a humble page turner. None of the information ever feels like it drags on at any point, as each chapter is short enough to get to the point without sacrificing any of the important details. It's really impressive how Sagan manages to create a book thats so jam-packed with information and still make it entertaining and accessible.One thing that is an obvious downside to this book is that some of the research and technological terms are outdated, and basically false at this point. This isn't to say that this book is all incorrect data, of course not, but having been released in 1977, there have definitely been some discoveries to prove some things in Eden wrong. This doesn't necessarily make Sagan's points less strong, however. His ideas and thoughts are still strong and poignant, even if some of the data is dated. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I think you'd be surprised at how much you'd enjoy it."
82,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13999805-greg-metcalf,5,"As I was reading this book again, since a first reading close to twenty years ago, a friend mentioned that if he was going to read a popular science book, he'd read a new one, not one from the seventies. That comment kind of got stuck in my head. It would certainly be interesting to read about how far sign language development with chimpanzees, for example, has come, which must have just gotten started when Sagan wrote about it here. But this book is Carl Sagan playing with possibilities. In a chapter on right and left hemisphere brain functioning, he suggests the possibility that the effect of marijuana might be to inhibit left brain reasoning giving the more intuitive right brain more influence over our thinking, which he compares to there always being stars above us but we need the dominant sun to set before they become visible. What a fascinating notion and how poetically stated. If anything Sagan writes about here has been disproven, he would be the first to say, Isn't this new evidence fascinating? We all wish Carl Sagan were alive and writing books about the cutting edge discoveries of today, but his creative thinking remains an inspiration. At one point, he was writing about how the written word manages to put the voice of someone else in your mind and wrote ""(Hello!)"" That alone made this well worth a second read. "
83,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571445-rajat-twit,4,"Not recommended for casual readers, this book is a very informative collection of amazing knowledge for the science enthusiasts. Expanding his knowledge from astrophysics to Biology, anthropology, evolutionary, history and upcoming scientific gadgets, Carl Sagan produces a wonderful literature on what may have been the case for the evolution of human intelligence. The book is a wonderful study of various aspects of human evolution and has given vivid and relevant examples for every point mentioned by Sagan. Not only Sagan is honest about the knowledge available at the time of writing the book, but predicts some wonderful future inventions for computer intelligence which we may see turning into reality today. His sharp predictions at the time of 1980s, which we may witness to becoming a reality, show that many of his speculations for the history of evolution may have many relevant points.The language is lucid and flawless, as is always in the case of Carl Sagan. He is not only one of the most significant science educator of 20 Century but is also a role model for many science enthusiasts. The voice that has ignited the minds of many scientists and engineers has proven through this book that people not from science background may become interested in Science, if science is presented in an entertaining and fun way!"

Not because it is dated, which it really is, but because the subtitle is utterly misleading. ""Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence"" do not actually occur in this book, which is far more concerned with the morphology of the human brain and the functions of its component parts; there is really nothing in this book about selective mechanisms or advantages, nothing about the huge metabolic costs of a 1400 cc brain, and little real discussion of the pressures driving the selection FOR increased encephalization. Nothing about evolution. Sorry, Carl ol' buddy, but this is a diatribe about brain function, quantitative measurements through vivisection experiments on all sorts of critters, and off-topic rambles about the ethics of abortion and extraterrestrial intelligence. This is a good read if you want to sound smart at a party, but that's about it."

I also consider the book for its date written, and amazed Sagan could foresee so many things coming to fruition in technology (such as cloning and everyone having multiple computers). It must have been even more amazing 35 plus years ago to see how much information our genes contain. Tackles issues regarding human brain has developed over time, its components, the differences in the evolution of man, reptiles vs. mammals, sleeping in both, dreams, mental illness, the likelihood of aliens, etc. Very cool topics then and today, imagine they will be for millions and billions of years to come."

Sagan makes lots of corny jokes and asides that are not really appropriate but sort of endearing. The evolution of the brain is the focus and Sagan talks a lot about the ""reptilian"" brain, the part that we had before we became human. Also the discussion of what really makes us human is so interesting. On the radio some modern researcher said that the brain is a record, a story of what has happened to that particular body. Anyways, this book is archaic compared to what they know now, so I am looking for a modern (post-modern?) read on the amazing human brain!"

The book was pretty easy to read, it's a short and basic introduction to the brain. It starts saying some things about the Cosmos, evolution and the brain itself. I recommend this book if you are new to the topic, because if you have more experience in the field, this book may seem too basic, though it doesn't make it less great, I really enjoyed it a lot.

The subtitle is ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"",  but little in the book is about that topic. The book rambles from from one subject to another,from cute drawings by everyone's favorite: M.C. Escher,to the chemical composition of distant stars. Perhaps the most interesting part is the chart that shows  Brain mass vs. Body weight. On that chart moles rate quite highly.Probably not the point the author was trying to make. The next time I see a mole I'll watch for signs of intelligence. There are many tidbits of trivia, one is the fact , that the average person has a 10% chance of having a genetic mutation that can be passed on to the next generation. Needless to say, almost all of these are harmful."

See Robert Sapolsky's ""Human Behavioural Biology"" for a refutation of this.I also thought the book lacked a decent structure, and found its writing a bit rambing and unfocused.Thankfully, it wasn't that long...2 stars."

95,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33235645-ankan-paul,5,"A concise and exhaustive book of 250 odd pages depicting the exhilarating tale of the evolution of human intelligence, brachiating to exciting topics exploring the ""Cosmic Calendar"", the need for brains to evolve out of limitations in the gene pool, the fascinating abilities and amazing qualities of the human brain, the siphoning of the human brain to its pristine form with layers formed over ages on the reptilian brain, the hidden truths behind us emerging via evolution by natural selection as the dominating species from our arboreal ancestors, the promising thought process of our cousins- the chimps, the significance of dreams in the survival of our species, the striking differences between the two halves of our brains in information processing, the importance of extra-somatic knowledge storing (writing books!), a symbiotic future of human intelligence and machine/artificial intelligence, and finally ending with humanity's search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Who will say that Dr. Sagan wrote a book on a subject so far from his primary training, when every page is as replete with facts and contemporary neuro-science as it is with Dr. Sagan's profound speculations and conjectures? There is a reason why Dr. Carl Sagan is regarded as the teacher one always wished one had. I felt the same when I read the Cosmos, and since then made it my goal to read all his books. The Dragons of Eden is my second Carl Sagan read, and I must say I felt the same exhilaration while turning the pages that I felt while reading the Cosmos. To me, he is as good an artist as he is a scientist. His prose vividly portrays that. His own love for art, music, philosophy and every field that the human brain has produced is evident in his writings. And his appreciation is not just limited to the human species. His admiration encompasses the whole of the biodiversity on earth. And it is not just limited to the earth, it is for the whole cosmos. His writings have such a universal nature. When he writes, it seems he is writing for the whole species, on behalf of the whole world. Such a visionary! His writings makes one feel how small one's problems are in the grand scale of the ever expanding universe (or multiverse...who knows!).This book is no different. Subtitled ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"", the book does justice to the same. It is a fascinating tale of how we reached where we are today, with our connection to the reptiles (""dragons"") being embedded in the innermost core of our brains (the R-complex). Our brains have developed outwards since then, with more human like features being added in layers over the crudest core. There are exciting facts of how walking on two legs freed our hands to make tools, and to make better tools (hunting tools mostly, as that is only how we could have survived) better brains were a necessity. How our species massacred other primate species which showed signs of language (and hence a slight glimmer of intelligence) to ensure its survival. How our brain size is limited to the size of the pelvic cavity during child-birth. How there is a separation of functions in different locales of the brain and yet how our brains tend to be redundant with self-healing abilities. How there is a fight between the intuitive right half of the brain and the analytic/skeptic left half, and how that has led to the bias for the ""right""! I could go on listing all such beautiful stories put forth in the book. Besides recounting such tales and presenting the then recent developments in the field of neuro-science (split-brain experiments, experiments on understanding the localization of functions in the brain, those on deciphering the phenomenon of dreams, effects of neurotic drugs, surgeries on epileptic patients, studies on brain lesion of war soldiers, experiments on rat brains, etc), there are ample references to the myths and historical stories on the subjects, not to mention, the author's own rich and creative speculations, strewn all over the book, which grips the readers imagination and sends one spiraling down the ""what-if-that-is-true"" lane. The speculations were meant for contemporary and future scientists to work on. My favourite chapter from the book is ""The abstractions of beasts"" where Dr. Sagan presents all evidences of chimpanzee intelligence. Chimpanzees do have human like features, but how do you feel about human-like intelligence! Yes! I was really fascinated by the way Washoe, Lana or Lucy (the chimps) grasped the sign language taught to them and used it to communicate so effectively in such human-like manner. Imagine the idea of being able to talk to someone outside your species! The tales of the experiments that the author recounts is bound to touch your heart, make you really feel them. Language binds! The book is truly a gem. Dr. Sagan ploughs through the then recent developments in brain-studies, saturates the existing body of knowledge on the subject, lets loose his creative imagination, all the while weighing his words on a skeptic's scale, and brings forth this rich harvest for us commoners to enjoy. He stresses on the fact knowledge (""reason alloyed with intuition"" - the intelligence that has been so crucial in the survival and dominating nature of our species) is going to be the sole determinant of our race in the future, both for further development and to prevent self-destruction."
96,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57946842-ricardo-ari-sequeira,5,"Em comparação com os últimos livros que peguei, atrevo-me a dizer que as expetativas para este livro eram mais baixas. Considerava-me um fã de Carl Sagan porque conhecia o seu trabalho mas nunca lera nenhum livro da sua autoria nem vi ainda a famosa série Cosmos (cuja recriação brilhante de Neil DeGrasse Tyson é uma das minhas séries preferidas). Esta foi, portanto, a minha primeira experiência com um 'legado' de Sagan e que legado... Sinceramente, acho que não estava pronto para um trabalho tão genial como o que acabei de ler. Depois deste livro, acho que poderia ler Sagan explicar o ciclo de vida das minhocas com o máximo interesse imaginável. Quando dizem que ele é um apaixonado, um inspirador, um génio, um iluminado, um poeta... tudo isso é verdade e eu tive o prazer de comprovar nesta obra. Digo com toda a certeza (e tenho de pedir desculpa a Stephen Hawking neste aspeto, sem querer menosprezar a sua obra-prima) que este é o melhor livro de não-ficção que já li. Dei por mim a absorver todas as ""especulações"" de Sagan, a pensar nelas quando não estava a ler e a chegar a casa e escrever sobre o que havia lido e a fazer as minhas próprias ""especulações"". Tinha mesmo muita coisa para comentar sobre Os Dragões de Eden mas não me quero alongar nesta review.Quanto à escrita, especificamente falando, nada neste livro é muito técnico e o que se aproxima disso é explicado de forma transparente e de todo compreensível (com imagens esclarecedoras). É um trabalho de divulgação científica exemplar e inigualável.Queria deixar um excerto de um dos meus ""diários"" enquanto lia:""Eu estou a devorar e a adorar este livro, porque não é uma resposta a perguntas existentes, bem pelo contrário - é todo um conjunto de novas perguntas, teorias e suspeitas pertinentes sobre a inteligência humana (e animal). Perguntas que nunca teria imaginado que existiam e que eu tinha até ter lido este livro. Para mim esse é o maior legado com que fico. Já Neil DeGrasse Tyson dizia que, se pudesse perguntar qualquer coisa a uma entidade superior (que teria resposta qualquer que fosse a pergunta), a questão seria uma que ele ainda não conhecia neste momento porque questões mais fundamentais irão sempre surgir no futuro, questões que não imaginamos agora. (...) Vejo também a leitura deste livro como uma jornada de auto-conhecimento pois é de facto o nosso cérebro que é retratado nestas páginas. Este é tipo de livros que vale completamente a leitura e valerá uma releitura no futuro."" Por fim, deixo também um excerto do livro que me marcou desde logo e que demonstra também toda a capacidade de comunicação de Carl Sagan e a sua paixão pela ciência, vida e humanidade:""Como consequência das enormes transformações sociais e tecnológicas dos últimos séculos, o mundo não está a funcionar bem. Não vivemos em sociedades tradicionais e estáticas. Mas os nossos governos, ao resistirem à mudança, actuam como se tal acontecesse. A menos que nos venhamos a destruir totalmente, o futuro pertence às sociedades que, embora não ignorem o lado reptilineo e mamífero do nosso ser, permitem um desabrochar dos componentes caracteristicamente humanos da nossa natureza. Sociedades que encorajam a diversidade, e não o conformismo; sociedades que estejam dispostas a investir em recursos numa diversidade de experiências sociais, politicas, económicas e culturais, preparadas para sacrificar vantagens a curto prazo a benefícios a longo prazo; sociedades que tratem as novas ideias como vias delicadas, frágeis e imensamente valiosas que conduzem ao futuro."" (Carl Sagan, 1977)---Compared to the last books I picked up, I dare say that the expectations for this book were lower. I considered myself a fan of Carl Sagan because I knew his work but had never read any of his books or even seen the famous series Cosmos (whose brilliant recreation of Neil DeGrasse Tyson is one of my favorite series). This was, therefore, my first experience with a legacy of Sagan and what a legacy ... Honestly, I think I was not ready for such a brilliant work.After this book, I think I could read Sagan explaining the worm life cycle with the maximum interest imaginable. When they say that he's a passionate, an inspirer, a genius, an enlightened, a poet ... all this is true and I had the pleasure to prove it now.I say with certainty (and I have to apologize to Stephen Hawking in this respect, not wanting to belittle his masterpiece) that this is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. I absorbed all of Sagan's ""speculations"", I thought of them when I was not reading and I would get home and write about what I had read and to make my own ""speculations."" I had a lot to comment on The Dragons of Eden but I do not want to dwell on this review.As for writing, specifically speaking, nothing in this book is very technical and what comes close to it is explained in a transparent and comprehensible way (with enlightening images). It is an exemplary and unequaled scientific dissemination work.I wanted to leave here something I wrote about the book while reading it:""I am devouring and loving this book, because it's not a response to existing questions but quite the contrary - it's a whole set of new pertinent questions, theories, and suspicions about human (and animal) intelligence. Questions I would never have imagined existed and that I would never had if I didn't read this book. To me, that is the greatest legacy I got. Neil DeGrasse Tyson said that if he could ask anything to a superior entity (which would answer whatever the question was), the question Would be one he did not know at the moment because more fundamental questions will always arise in the future, questions that we can not imagine now ... I also see the reading of this book as a journey of self-knowledge because it is indeed our brain Which is portrayed in these pages.This is kind of a book that is worth reading completely and will be worth a re-reading in the future.Finally, I also leave a quote from the book that marked me from the beginning and also demonstrates all the capacity for communication of Carl Sagan and his passion for science, life and humanity:“As a consequence of the enormous social and technological changes of the last few centuries, the world is not working well. We do not live in traditional and static societies. But our government, in resisting change, act as if we did. Unless we destroy ourselves utterly, the future belongs to those societies that, while not ignoring the reptilian and mammalian parts of our being, enable the characteristically human components of our nature to flourish; to those societies that encourage diversity rather than conformity; to those societies willing to invest resources in a variety of social, political, economic and cultural experiments, and prepared to sacrifice short-term advantage for long-term benefit; to those societies that treat new ideas as delicate, fragile and immensely valuable pathways to the future.” (Carl Sagan, 1977)"
97,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"Carl Sagan's on a tear again. He can't stop himself, and you can't help cheering as you watch him go! He's a one man demonstration of evolution as a model for scientific method: cook up a whole lot of crazy mutant ideas and set them all free, unleash them on the World, and see which ones survive. ***Right now, he's working on the Mesozoic, and I'm along for the ride: we've got moronic dinos hunting mammals, which probably sleep all day as a defense mechanism ('cause they're too stupid to be quiet whilst being hunted) and cause ""the demise of the dinosaurs...by nocturnal predation on reptilian eggs. Two chicken eggs for breakfast may be all that is left... of this ancient mammalian cuisine."" This is classic Sagan, with some tenuous but imaginative hypothesis stretched to it's logical conclusion, and an insightful connection to bring it all home at the end. ***A stretched premise is one hallmark of science fiction writing, and I think Sagan's book fits the bill. He is Larry Niven and your favorite high school biology teacher rolled into one. But at the end what we get from Carl is a lot of fun stories and little more. Most are in the common cultural background (too many episodes of ""Cosmos"" perhaps?), but everyone is sure to come across a few delightful new anecdotes they hadn't previously heard: monkeys learning sign language, the endearing stupidities of midget brains,a naked Dr Louis Leaky outrunning his antelope, cannibal insectuous sex, Freud's work as a metaphor for our triply evolved and layered brain, (the reptilian hind brain naturally associated with the corporate board room: I liked that one!), the dad, divorced for cause of insomnia who retains custody of his genetically similar daughter, list goes on. This is all really good stuff and fast fun reading. ***But for all his fecundity, Sagan is not careful about the details of the ideas he sprays over the pages. His evolutionary reasoning is uncareful. Factors of 10 and 100 slip easily in and out in his calculation of brain power, the ratio of brain to body mass vs pure brain volume is a two edged sword he cuts in either direction as it suits him in different chapters, and so forth. He'll pause for air and disavow everything with a hand waving caution, ""just a hypothesis, now,"" but then he's off again. Waiter, I'll have whatever he's smoking. ***I once was teased with a variation on ""boundless youthful enthusiasm"" that transposed to: ""boundful useless enthusiasm"" and it comes, unbidden, to mind now. As an example of excitement overcoming rationality, the idea that an 8 Tonne T-rex, couldn't rouse itself from its numb stupor to prevent feral warm blooded whatevers from eating it's eggs is just an impossible stretch. (And, we can't help imagining the clever whatevers are our very own ancestors. Yeah! Go mammals!) OTOH, just considering the size and surface area, it is hard to imagine such big animals were not kept warm merely through metabolic inefficiency. THEY would have been the nocturnes, while we would have curled into furry balls at night, scampering between moribund overheating dinos during the hot lazy afternoons. Also, fur absorbs UV light, protecting our genetic blueprints from the supernova disaster that eradicated our scaly skinned competitors. ***Ok, ok, that's not in the book, I made it all up, but HE does it too! Yes, I know, HE'S Carl Sagan, and I'm not. ***We miss you Carl, - R.I.P. ***--------------Matt responded: I am curious to know what you think of some of the ""stretched premises"" towards the end. They attempt to apply his 'theories' on intelligence towards attitudes on social issues (computer intelligence, abortion, education, dream theory) and it all culminates in a direct insult of ""right-brain"" ideas diverging us from a utopia-by-intelligence. (Where intelligence is left-brain dominant).-------Ok done now, and my reply (to Matt) is that the book seemed to go out with a whimper, and I was neither opposed to nor enervated by, any of the last of it. I wanted cyborgs and computer super-minds, silicon immortality, x-ray vision and telepathy. Instead we got a pitch to fund wired classrooms and SETI. Ok already! ...I was hoping for more.I was not opposed because I agree with his thesis. Sagan is the consummate vampire slayer; he repudiates mystics of all sorts. Remember Sagan was (we must use the past tense not because he's dead but because, already, he represents a bygone era) still fighting Galileo's fight, one we only THINK is over because we live here: the battle of science against irrationality. REmember, Sagan thinks our right brain is responsible for brilliant flashes of insight, and art. I don't think he means the insult you apprehend.This takes us back to ZaTAoMM. Picture the misty past! The Epoch is BG (before Gates) and nerds are tolerated but joyfully reviled. Technology's evil, computers are laughable. People Do Not Believe ETI is out there and they're sure God is. The World is ruled by USSteel and PONG is the best and only computer game for heaven's sake!. It is hard for you guys to believe this shit (I call into context, regretfully, my advanced relative decrepitude, to remind that I am able to speak to you from the past, before your birth.) My point? It's a *real* battle that really needed to be fought, so we should forgive Sagan any overzealous driving home of the points. You need only think on the Texas and Kansas school systems to worry if the serpent's really truly been slain.Comments on some excellent vignettes towards the end:Witches dreaming of flying by reason of tripping on nightshade ~~ don't get me started! That they ""flew"" using broomsticks, well it's all merely hinted at, but if you listen close you can hear Carl snickering at his own jokes.Computers are conscious, or soon will be. I thought this especially cool, because it will at least be true so far as I can tell, and you can do NO BETTER! I mean, I can't *know* that you are conscious either, (solipsism) only that you're clever. So philosophically, once machines are clever, we may as well ascribe consciousness to them: it's only fair. Carl is very comfortable with this, with the proposition that consciousness is no more than the result of mere complexity, taken to a sufficient extreme. That's very well adjusted of him: I'm somebody who *wants* there to be more to me than there apparently is. (...and I make a lot more of this point than he bothers to.)Another excellent anecdote was Thoth railing against hieroglyphics as the calculators and video games of the age, certain to corrupt young minds which, relieved of the requirement to memorize everything, would grow indolent and weak. At this juncture, Carl reminds us how great written language is with a taunt that it allows an author to leap remotely off the page and into your brain! ...and across the chasm of death, too, I thought: a form of eternal life. For that instant I was again impressed with how very imaginatively Carl Sagan is able to think. So I'll respectfully say, ""No, I don't think it really sensible to imagine that Carl Sagan's prejudiced against the right brain."" To the contrary, he's All About right brain; his own is probably 50% bigger than the left.---------------------post script: as a companion to the chapter on right/left brain thinking I warmly recommend ""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" as a closely related romp through even further stretched conjectures of how our brain structure and thinking may be related.*** added 'cause Facebook publishes these without separating the paragraphs."

Is not an easy book, i know that Carl Sagan tried his best to make this book easy for non-biology experts, it would have been better if the info was some how more organized or more conclusive in some topics. If you are thrilled and interested in topics such as evolution, biology, human’s brain complexity and related topics this book is for you, do not expect a sciencie fiction novel. "
100,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96116134-sadat-issah,4,"First and foremost, it should be known that Carl Sagan is an amazing writer.Now about the book, as the title gives away, this book is a mixture of speculations and ideas backed by research about the evolution of human intelligence and other related topics.From reading reviews of people who are much acquainted with this field of study the general sentiment is that most of the ideas present in this book are outdated but still thinks it's worth your time(which i wholeheartedly agree)."
101,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34505232-pinskeyl,3,"Parts I found incredibly interesting and thought provoking and parts were so, so dull. Overall a solid 3. "

In the beginning, he kind of apologizes to the reader for embarking on such a speculative journey of the origins of mankind, but the stream of his thought is beyond convincing. For such a short read I learned a lot, and especially it made me consider non-human kinds of intelligence from a number of perspectives.I would love to read the updated version as so many things have changed since 40 years ago..."
106,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915487-corey,4,Carl Sagan had a beautiful mind. I would rate this book higher if I were smart enough to understand it all. 
107,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12379384-z-yasemin,5,Carl Sagan continues to impress me...
108,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9096819-simon,4,"I got around to reading this book after finding out that it's a foundational text for the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) movement, which Carl Sagan himself had a huge role in popularising: In ""Dragons of Eden"", Sagan gives laypeople a detailed explanation for how intelligence evolved here on Earth and hence clues for what to look for if they want to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.This book is very, very 1970s in many ways: As other reviewers have pointed out, the results of scientific research into neurobiology since its 1977 publishing date have falsified some of the ideas Sagans present here. There are also chapters where Sagan gets all starry-eyed and optimistic about computer technology's ability to improve human learning, to an extent that feels outright ridiculous to someone reading this in 2020. Despite all that, I am grateful for Sagan writing this book since it's difficult to find other books that present the basics of evolutionary biology, genetics and how the brain functions in this accessible a way to people who do not have an academic background in those scientific fields. It's even more impressive an achievement considering that the author is writing outside his own field of expertise - I doubt that Sam Harris could write as well about astrophysics as Carl Sagan does about neuroscience here!Much of the information presented here is also completely new to me, like how the different specialised parts of the brain have wildly varying proportions in different animal species depending on the animal's lifestyle - or how much easier it is to learn chimpanzees sign language than spoken language, to the point that chimpanzees can master sign language as well as humans. For me, the most interesting part of ""The Dragons of Eden"" has to be Sagan's explanation for how dreaming evolved: He theorises it's an evolutionary adaptation to make sure mammals stay asleep when hiding from nocturnal predators, and that the omnipresence of dragons and vampires in folklore and mythology around the world can be traced back to instincts evolved to help us avoid predatory dinosaurs and reptiles as well as nocturnal predators.I also quite like the psychedelic cover painting of an australopithecine Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden populated by dinosaurs, prehistoric rhinoceri and even scorpions - a painting that probably ended up spraypainted on quite a few VW Microbuses back in the 1970s."

The book is a lot like a summary of what people knew about consciousness at the time of writing, plus reflection and speculations from Sagan. Having read many of Richard Dawkins’s books, I didn’t get much out of this, except an entertaining summary.Keep in mind that a lot has changed in the field of the subject since the book was written, and, again, it contains a lot of speculations by Sagan."

111,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71398830-johnny-j,4,"This wasn't actually my first time reading Dragons of Eden, as I had to read it for a certain curriculum based assignment at a private school I attended a few years ago. I forget exactly why we read it, but I can remember that there was a focus on neuroscience and the early life of Earth in what we were learning. My teacher was also just a huge Sagan/popular science fanatic. I remember thinking the book was interesting, but I, more or less... skimmed it back then. Maybe I've matured (I don't really think so), but I wanted to pick it up again and actually process the information that Sagan blissfully bestows on the reader. There wasn't any pressing need for me to read Dragons of Eden, I just kind of saw it sitting on my bookshelf when I was making the reading challenge list for English class and thought it would be nice to re-read. Dragons of Eden is, more or less, chapters upon chapters of Carl Sagan's thoughts and discoveries on the brain and the human condition. From segments that literally give a calendar of the entirety of the universe's events, to chapters that focus solely on the learning capabilities of primates, to findings on the rare deformity of a ""split-brain"" in humans, Sagan provides an insane amount of information in a small book (there are exponentially more topics highlighted in Eden, those mentioned are just some examples). Each subject, while they may seem distantly related, builds on top of one another with various terminologies and fundamental concepts. His overall thesis is that human nature and the neural states of homo sapiens are filled with relics from the distant past, those relics still visible today. It's not often i'll go for something non-fiction, especially something in the field of neuroscience – the topic honestly being a little far removed from my interests. Despite this, found this book a joy to read (re-read), and it's actually made me more interested in neurology than I thought I could. Sagan makes the figurative tons of data in Eden extremely accessible and interesting, connecting each of his refined concepts to create a humble page turner. None of the information ever feels like it drags on at any point, as each chapter is short enough to get to the point without sacrificing any of the important details. It's really impressive how Sagan manages to create a book thats so jam-packed with information and still make it entertaining and accessible.One thing that is an obvious downside to this book is that some of the research and technological terms are outdated, and basically false at this point. This isn't to say that this book is all incorrect data, of course not, but having been released in 1977, there have definitely been some discoveries to prove some things in Eden wrong. This doesn't necessarily make Sagan's points less strong, however. His ideas and thoughts are still strong and poignant, even if some of the data is dated. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I think you'd be surprised at how much you'd enjoy it."
112,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13999805-greg-metcalf,5,"As I was reading this book again, since a first reading close to twenty years ago, a friend mentioned that if he was going to read a popular science book, he'd read a new one, not one from the seventies. That comment kind of got stuck in my head. It would certainly be interesting to read about how far sign language development with chimpanzees, for example, has come, which must have just gotten started when Sagan wrote about it here. But this book is Carl Sagan playing with possibilities. In a chapter on right and left hemisphere brain functioning, he suggests the possibility that the effect of marijuana might be to inhibit left brain reasoning giving the more intuitive right brain more influence over our thinking, which he compares to there always being stars above us but we need the dominant sun to set before they become visible. What a fascinating notion and how poetically stated. If anything Sagan writes about here has been disproven, he would be the first to say, Isn't this new evidence fascinating? We all wish Carl Sagan were alive and writing books about the cutting edge discoveries of today, but his creative thinking remains an inspiration. At one point, he was writing about how the written word manages to put the voice of someone else in your mind and wrote ""(Hello!)"" That alone made this well worth a second read. "
113,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571445-rajat-twit,4,"Not recommended for casual readers, this book is a very informative collection of amazing knowledge for the science enthusiasts. Expanding his knowledge from astrophysics to Biology, anthropology, evolutionary, history and upcoming scientific gadgets, Carl Sagan produces a wonderful literature on what may have been the case for the evolution of human intelligence. The book is a wonderful study of various aspects of human evolution and has given vivid and relevant examples for every point mentioned by Sagan. Not only Sagan is honest about the knowledge available at the time of writing the book, but predicts some wonderful future inventions for computer intelligence which we may see turning into reality today. His sharp predictions at the time of 1980s, which we may witness to becoming a reality, show that many of his speculations for the history of evolution may have many relevant points.The language is lucid and flawless, as is always in the case of Carl Sagan. He is not only one of the most significant science educator of 20 Century but is also a role model for many science enthusiasts. The voice that has ignited the minds of many scientists and engineers has proven through this book that people not from science background may become interested in Science, if science is presented in an entertaining and fun way!"

Not because it is dated, which it really is, but because the subtitle is utterly misleading. ""Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence"" do not actually occur in this book, which is far more concerned with the morphology of the human brain and the functions of its component parts; there is really nothing in this book about selective mechanisms or advantages, nothing about the huge metabolic costs of a 1400 cc brain, and little real discussion of the pressures driving the selection FOR increased encephalization. Nothing about evolution. Sorry, Carl ol' buddy, but this is a diatribe about brain function, quantitative measurements through vivisection experiments on all sorts of critters, and off-topic rambles about the ethics of abortion and extraterrestrial intelligence. This is a good read if you want to sound smart at a party, but that's about it."
115,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19488978-trey-nowell,4,"Pretty interesting book overall, did tend to go from one topic to another and then come back to the topic with a tiny bit of rambling. I also consider the book for its date written, and amazed Sagan could foresee so many things coming to fruition in technology (such as cloning and everyone having multiple computers). It must have been even more amazing 35 plus years ago to see how much information our genes contain. Tackles issues regarding human brain has developed over time, its components, the differences in the evolution of man, reptiles vs. mammals, sleeping in both, dreams, mental illness, the likelihood of aliens, etc. Very cool topics then and today, imagine they will be for millions and billions of years to come."
116,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,3,"This book is dated, but good. I love reading about research on the human brain. Sagan makes lots of corny jokes and asides that are not really appropriate but sort of endearing. The evolution of the brain is the focus and Sagan talks a lot about the ""reptilian"" brain, the part that we had before we became human. Also the discussion of what really makes us human is so interesting. On the radio some modern researcher said that the brain is a record, a story of what has happened to that particular body. Anyways, this book is archaic compared to what they know now, so I am looking for a modern (post-modern?) read on the amazing human brain!"

The book was pretty easy to read, it's a short and basic introduction to the brain. It starts saying some things about the Cosmos, evolution and the brain itself. I recommend this book if you are new to the topic, because if you have more experience in the field, this book may seem too basic, though it doesn't make it less great, I really enjoyed it a lot. Lastly, it's important to know that the book it's a little bit old so some things may be wrong."

You may find yourself not too proud to be human, as the origins of our much-touted intellegence which separates us from the beasts comes into focus. Evolutionary Anthropology rewritten for the masses, but still sometimes tedious and hard to follow; I found myself rereading several pages just to absorb all the information. I'm looking forward to more Sagan, as I have collected a number which I have not yet opened."

Here he examines humanity from a lot of different interesting angles, everything between cosmology, history, biology and morality. Here is something that will touch everyone. In my case i was especially fascinated with the chapter on cross species communication, but every single chapter is insanely intriguing. "
122,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,1,"The copy of the book I got was published in 1977 and what isn't out of date is wrong. The subtitle is ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"",  but little in the book is about that topic. The book rambles from from one subject to another,from cute drawings by everyone's favorite: M.C. Escher,to the chemical composition of distant stars. Perhaps the most interesting part is the chart that shows  Brain mass vs. Body weight. On that chart moles rate quite highly.Probably not the point the author was trying to make. The next time I see a mole I'll watch for signs of intelligence. There are many tidbits of trivia, one is the fact , that the average person has a 10% chance of having a genetic mutation that can be passed on to the next generation. Needless to say, almost all of these are harmful."

See Robert Sapolsky's ""Human Behavioural Biology"" for a refutation of this.I also thought the book lacked a decent structure, and found its writing a bit rambing and unfocused.Thankfully, it wasn't that long...2 stars."
124,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey,4,Very good considering that Carl Sagan is writing outside of his field. Great speculations on the evolution of human/animal intelligence. Minus 1 star for being heavily outdated (originally published in 1977). I'll definitely be reading a more recent book on the same topic; written by a neuroscientist rather than an astrophysicist.
125,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33235645-ankan-paul,5,"A concise and exhaustive book of 250 odd pages depicting the exhilarating tale of the evolution of human intelligence, brachiating to exciting topics exploring the ""Cosmic Calendar"", the need for brains to evolve out of limitations in the gene pool, the fascinating abilities and amazing qualities of the human brain, the siphoning of the human brain to its pristine form with layers formed over ages on the reptilian brain, the hidden truths behind us emerging via evolution by natural selection as the dominating species from our arboreal ancestors, the promising thought process of our cousins- the chimps, the significance of dreams in the survival of our species, the striking differences between the two halves of our brains in information processing, the importance of extra-somatic knowledge storing (writing books!), a symbiotic future of human intelligence and machine/artificial intelligence, and finally ending with humanity's search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Who will say that Dr. Sagan wrote a book on a subject so far from his primary training, when every page is as replete with facts and contemporary neuro-science as it is with Dr. Sagan's profound speculations and conjectures? There is a reason why Dr. Carl Sagan is regarded as the teacher one always wished one had. I felt the same when I read the Cosmos, and since then made it my goal to read all his books. The Dragons of Eden is my second Carl Sagan read, and I must say I felt the same exhilaration while turning the pages that I felt while reading the Cosmos. To me, he is as good an artist as he is a scientist. His prose vividly portrays that. His own love for art, music, philosophy and every field that the human brain has produced is evident in his writings. And his appreciation is not just limited to the human species. His admiration encompasses the whole of the biodiversity on earth. And it is not just limited to the earth, it is for the whole cosmos. His writings have such a universal nature. When he writes, it seems he is writing for the whole species, on behalf of the whole world. Such a visionary! His writings makes one feel how small one's problems are in the grand scale of the ever expanding universe (or multiverse...who knows!).This book is no different. Subtitled ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"", the book does justice to the same. It is a fascinating tale of how we reached where we are today, with our connection to the reptiles (""dragons"") being embedded in the innermost core of our brains (the R-complex). Our brains have developed outwards since then, with more human like features being added in layers over the crudest core. There are exciting facts of how walking on two legs freed our hands to make tools, and to make better tools (hunting tools mostly, as that is only how we could have survived) better brains were a necessity. How our species massacred other primate species which showed signs of language (and hence a slight glimmer of intelligence) to ensure its survival. How our brain size is limited to the size of the pelvic cavity during child-birth. How there is a separation of functions in different locales of the brain and yet how our brains tend to be redundant with self-healing abilities. How there is a fight between the intuitive right half of the brain and the analytic/skeptic left half, and how that has led to the bias for the ""right""! I could go on listing all such beautiful stories put forth in the book. Besides recounting such tales and presenting the then recent developments in the field of neuro-science (split-brain experiments, experiments on understanding the localization of functions in the brain, those on deciphering the phenomenon of dreams, effects of neurotic drugs, surgeries on epileptic patients, studies on brain lesion of war soldiers, experiments on rat brains, etc), there are ample references to the myths and historical stories on the subjects, not to mention, the author's own rich and creative speculations, strewn all over the book, which grips the readers imagination and sends one spiraling down the ""what-if-that-is-true"" lane. The speculations were meant for contemporary and future scientists to work on. My favourite chapter from the book is ""The abstractions of beasts"" where Dr. Sagan presents all evidences of chimpanzee intelligence. Chimpanzees do have human like features, but how do you feel about human-like intelligence! Yes! I was really fascinated by the way Washoe, Lana or Lucy (the chimps) grasped the sign language taught to them and used it to communicate so effectively in such human-like manner. Imagine the idea of being able to talk to someone outside your species! The tales of the experiments that the author recounts is bound to touch your heart, make you really feel them. Language binds! The book is truly a gem. Dr. Sagan ploughs through the then recent developments in brain-studies, saturates the existing body of knowledge on the subject, lets loose his creative imagination, all the while weighing his words on a skeptic's scale, and brings forth this rich harvest for us commoners to enjoy. He stresses on the fact knowledge (""reason alloyed with intuition"" - the intelligence that has been so crucial in the survival and dominating nature of our species) is going to be the sole determinant of our race in the future, both for further development and to prevent self-destruction."
126,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57946842-ricardo-ari-sequeira,5,"Em comparação com os últimos livros que peguei, atrevo-me a dizer que as expetativas para este livro eram mais baixas. Considerava-me um fã de Carl Sagan porque conhecia o seu trabalho mas nunca lera nenhum livro da sua autoria nem vi ainda a famosa série Cosmos (cuja recriação brilhante de Neil DeGrasse Tyson é uma das minhas séries preferidas). Esta foi, portanto, a minha primeira experiência com um 'legado' de Sagan e que legado... Sinceramente, acho que não estava pronto para um trabalho tão genial como o que acabei de ler. Depois deste livro, acho que poderia ler Sagan explicar o ciclo de vida das minhocas com o máximo interesse imaginável. Quando dizem que ele é um apaixonado, um inspirador, um génio, um iluminado, um poeta... tudo isso é verdade e eu tive o prazer de comprovar nesta obra. Digo com toda a certeza (e tenho de pedir desculpa a Stephen Hawking neste aspeto, sem querer menosprezar a sua obra-prima) que este é o melhor livro de não-ficção que já li. Dei por mim a absorver todas as ""especulações"" de Sagan, a pensar nelas quando não estava a ler e a chegar a casa e escrever sobre o que havia lido e a fazer as minhas próprias ""especulações"". Tinha mesmo muita coisa para comentar sobre Os Dragões de Eden mas não me quero alongar nesta review.Quanto à escrita, especificamente falando, nada neste livro é muito técnico e o que se aproxima disso é explicado de forma transparente e de todo compreensível (com imagens esclarecedoras). É um trabalho de divulgação científica exemplar e inigualável.Queria deixar um excerto de um dos meus ""diários"" enquanto lia:""Eu estou a devorar e a adorar este livro, porque não é uma resposta a perguntas existentes, bem pelo contrário - é todo um conjunto de novas perguntas, teorias e suspeitas pertinentes sobre a inteligência humana (e animal). Perguntas que nunca teria imaginado que existiam e que eu tinha até ter lido este livro. Para mim esse é o maior legado com que fico. Já Neil DeGrasse Tyson dizia que, se pudesse perguntar qualquer coisa a uma entidade superior (que teria resposta qualquer que fosse a pergunta), a questão seria uma que ele ainda não conhecia neste momento porque questões mais fundamentais irão sempre surgir no futuro, questões que não imaginamos agora. (...) Vejo também a leitura deste livro como uma jornada de auto-conhecimento pois é de facto o nosso cérebro que é retratado nestas páginas. Este é tipo de livros que vale completamente a leitura e valerá uma releitura no futuro."" Por fim, deixo também um excerto do livro que me marcou desde logo e que demonstra também toda a capacidade de comunicação de Carl Sagan e a sua paixão pela ciência, vida e humanidade:""Como consequência das enormes transformações sociais e tecnológicas dos últimos séculos, o mundo não está a funcionar bem. Não vivemos em sociedades tradicionais e estáticas. Mas os nossos governos, ao resistirem à mudança, actuam como se tal acontecesse. A menos que nos venhamos a destruir totalmente, o futuro pertence às sociedades que, embora não ignorem o lado reptilineo e mamífero do nosso ser, permitem um desabrochar dos componentes caracteristicamente humanos da nossa natureza. Sociedades que encorajam a diversidade, e não o conformismo; sociedades que estejam dispostas a investir em recursos numa diversidade de experiências sociais, politicas, económicas e culturais, preparadas para sacrificar vantagens a curto prazo a benefícios a longo prazo; sociedades que tratem as novas ideias como vias delicadas, frágeis e imensamente valiosas que conduzem ao futuro."" (Carl Sagan, 1977)---Compared to the last books I picked up, I dare say that the expectations for this book were lower. I considered myself a fan of Carl Sagan because I knew his work but had never read any of his books or even seen the famous series Cosmos (whose brilliant recreation of Neil DeGrasse Tyson is one of my favorite series). This was, therefore, my first experience with a legacy of Sagan and what a legacy ... Honestly, I think I was not ready for such a brilliant work.After this book, I think I could read Sagan explaining the worm life cycle with the maximum interest imaginable. When they say that he's a passionate, an inspirer, a genius, an enlightened, a poet ... all this is true and I had the pleasure to prove it now.I say with certainty (and I have to apologize to Stephen Hawking in this respect, not wanting to belittle his masterpiece) that this is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. I absorbed all of Sagan's ""speculations"", I thought of them when I was not reading and I would get home and write about what I had read and to make my own ""speculations."" I had a lot to comment on The Dragons of Eden but I do not want to dwell on this review.As for writing, specifically speaking, nothing in this book is very technical and what comes close to it is explained in a transparent and comprehensible way (with enlightening images). It is an exemplary and unequaled scientific dissemination work.I wanted to leave here something I wrote about the book while reading it:""I am devouring and loving this book, because it's not a response to existing questions but quite the contrary - it's a whole set of new pertinent questions, theories, and suspicions about human (and animal) intelligence. Questions I would never have imagined existed and that I would never had if I didn't read this book. To me, that is the greatest legacy I got. Neil DeGrasse Tyson said that if he could ask anything to a superior entity (which would answer whatever the question was), the question Would be one he did not know at the moment because more fundamental questions will always arise in the future, questions that we can not imagine now ... I also see the reading of this book as a journey of self-knowledge because it is indeed our brain Which is portrayed in these pages.This is kind of a book that is worth reading completely and will be worth a re-reading in the future.Finally, I also leave a quote from the book that marked me from the beginning and also demonstrates all the capacity for communication of Carl Sagan and his passion for science, life and humanity:“As a consequence of the enormous social and technological changes of the last few centuries, the world is not working well. We do not live in traditional and static societies. But our government, in resisting change, act as if we did. Unless we destroy ourselves utterly, the future belongs to those societies that, while not ignoring the reptilian and mammalian parts of our being, enable the characteristically human components of our nature to flourish; to those societies that encourage diversity rather than conformity; to those societies willing to invest resources in a variety of social, political, economic and cultural experiments, and prepared to sacrifice short-term advantage for long-term benefit; to those societies that treat new ideas as delicate, fragile and immensely valuable pathways to the future.” (Carl Sagan, 1977)"
127,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"Carl Sagan's on a tear again. He can't stop himself, and you can't help cheering as you watch him go! He's a one man demonstration of evolution as a model for scientific method: cook up a whole lot of crazy mutant ideas and set them all free, unleash them on the World, and see which ones survive. ***Right now, he's working on the Mesozoic, and I'm along for the ride: we've got moronic dinos hunting mammals, which probably sleep all day as a defense mechanism ('cause they're too stupid to be quiet whilst being hunted) and cause ""the demise of the dinosaurs...by nocturnal predation on reptilian eggs. Two chicken eggs for breakfast may be all that is left... of this ancient mammalian cuisine."" This is classic Sagan, with some tenuous but imaginative hypothesis stretched to it's logical conclusion, and an insightful connection to bring it all home at the end. ***A stretched premise is one hallmark of science fiction writing, and I think Sagan's book fits the bill. He is Larry Niven and your favorite high school biology teacher rolled into one. But at the end what we get from Carl is a lot of fun stories and little more. Most are in the common cultural background (too many episodes of ""Cosmos"" perhaps?), but everyone is sure to come across a few delightful new anecdotes they hadn't previously heard: monkeys learning sign language, the endearing stupidities of midget brains,a naked Dr Louis Leaky outrunning his antelope, cannibal insectuous sex, Freud's work as a metaphor for our triply evolved and layered brain, (the reptilian hind brain naturally associated with the corporate board room: I liked that one!), the dad, divorced for cause of insomnia who retains custody of his genetically similar daughter, list goes on. This is all really good stuff and fast fun reading. ***But for all his fecundity, Sagan is not careful about the details of the ideas he sprays over the pages. His evolutionary reasoning is uncareful. Factors of 10 and 100 slip easily in and out in his calculation of brain power, the ratio of brain to body mass vs pure brain volume is a two edged sword he cuts in either direction as it suits him in different chapters, and so forth. He'll pause for air and disavow everything with a hand waving caution, ""just a hypothesis, now,"" but then he's off again. Waiter, I'll have whatever he's smoking. ***I once was teased with a variation on ""boundless youthful enthusiasm"" that transposed to: ""boundful useless enthusiasm"" and it comes, unbidden, to mind now. As an example of excitement overcoming rationality, the idea that an 8 Tonne T-rex, couldn't rouse itself from its numb stupor to prevent feral warm blooded whatevers from eating it's eggs is just an impossible stretch. (And, we can't help imagining the clever whatevers are our very own ancestors. Yeah! Go mammals!) OTOH, just considering the size and surface area, it is hard to imagine such big animals were not kept warm merely through metabolic inefficiency. THEY would have been the nocturnes, while we would have curled into furry balls at night, scampering between moribund overheating dinos during the hot lazy afternoons. Also, fur absorbs UV light, protecting our genetic blueprints from the supernova disaster that eradicated our scaly skinned competitors. ***Ok, ok, that's not in the book, I made it all up, but HE does it too! Yes, I know, HE'S Carl Sagan, and I'm not. ***We miss you Carl, - R.I.P. ***--------------Matt responded: I am curious to know what you think of some of the ""stretched premises"" towards the end. They attempt to apply his 'theories' on intelligence towards attitudes on social issues (computer intelligence, abortion, education, dream theory) and it all culminates in a direct insult of ""right-brain"" ideas diverging us from a utopia-by-intelligence. (Where intelligence is left-brain dominant).-------Ok done now, and my reply (to Matt) is that the book seemed to go out with a whimper, and I was neither opposed to nor enervated by, any of the last of it. I wanted cyborgs and computer super-minds, silicon immortality, x-ray vision and telepathy. Instead we got a pitch to fund wired classrooms and SETI. Ok already! ...I was hoping for more.I was not opposed because I agree with his thesis. Sagan is the consummate vampire slayer; he repudiates mystics of all sorts. Remember Sagan was (we must use the past tense not because he's dead but because, already, he represents a bygone era) still fighting Galileo's fight, one we only THINK is over because we live here: the battle of science against irrationality. REmember, Sagan thinks our right brain is responsible for brilliant flashes of insight, and art. I don't think he means the insult you apprehend.This takes us back to ZaTAoMM. Picture the misty past! The Epoch is BG (before Gates) and nerds are tolerated but joyfully reviled. Technology's evil, computers are laughable. People Do Not Believe ETI is out there and they're sure God is. The World is ruled by USSteel and PONG is the best and only computer game for heaven's sake!. It is hard for you guys to believe this shit (I call into context, regretfully, my advanced relative decrepitude, to remind that I am able to speak to you from the past, before your birth.) My point? It's a *real* battle that really needed to be fought, so we should forgive Sagan any overzealous driving home of the points. You need only think on the Texas and Kansas school systems to worry if the serpent's really truly been slain.Comments on some excellent vignettes towards the end:Witches dreaming of flying by reason of tripping on nightshade ~~ don't get me started! That they ""flew"" using broomsticks, well it's all merely hinted at, but if you listen close you can hear Carl snickering at his own jokes.Computers are conscious, or soon will be. I thought this especially cool, because it will at least be true so far as I can tell, and you can do NO BETTER! I mean, I can't *know* that you are conscious either, (solipsism) only that you're clever. So philosophically, once machines are clever, we may as well ascribe consciousness to them: it's only fair. Carl is very comfortable with this, with the proposition that consciousness is no more than the result of mere complexity, taken to a sufficient extreme. That's very well adjusted of him: I'm somebody who *wants* there to be more to me than there apparently is. (...and I make a lot more of this point than he bothers to.)Another excellent anecdote was Thoth railing against hieroglyphics as the calculators and video games of the age, certain to corrupt young minds which, relieved of the requirement to memorize everything, would grow indolent and weak. At this juncture, Carl reminds us how great written language is with a taunt that it allows an author to leap remotely off the page and into your brain! ...and across the chasm of death, too, I thought: a form of eternal life. For that instant I was again impressed with how very imaginatively Carl Sagan is able to think. So I'll respectfully say, ""No, I don't think it really sensible to imagine that Carl Sagan's prejudiced against the right brain."" To the contrary, he's All About right brain; his own is probably 50% bigger than the left.---------------------post script: as a companion to the chapter on right/left brain thinking I warmly recommend ""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" as a closely related romp through even further stretched conjectures of how our brain structure and thinking may be related.*** added 'cause Facebook publishes these without separating the paragraphs."

138,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9096819-simon,4,"I got around to reading this book after finding out that it's a foundational text for the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) movement, which Carl Sagan himself had a huge role in popularising: In ""Dragons of Eden"", Sagan gives laypeople a detailed explanation for how intelligence evolved here on Earth and hence clues for what to look for if they want to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.This book is very, very 1970s in many ways: As other reviewers have pointed out, the results of scientific research into neurobiology since its 1977 publishing date have falsified some of the ideas Sagans present here. There are also chapters where Sagan gets all starry-eyed and optimistic about computer technology's ability to improve human learning, to an extent that feels outright ridiculous to someone reading this in 2020. Despite all that, I am grateful for Sagan writing this book since it's difficult to find other books that present the basics of evolutionary biology, genetics and how the brain functions in this accessible a way to people who do not have an academic background in those scientific fields. It's even more impressive an achievement considering that the author is writing outside his own field of expertise - I doubt that Sam Harris could write as well about astrophysics as Carl Sagan does about neuroscience here!Much of the information presented here is also completely new to me, like how the different specialised parts of the brain have wildly varying proportions in different animal species depending on the animal's lifestyle - or how much easier it is to learn chimpanzees sign language than spoken language, to the point that chimpanzees can master sign language as well as humans. For me, the most interesting part of ""The Dragons of Eden"" has to be Sagan's explanation for how dreaming evolved: He theorises it's an evolutionary adaptation to make sure mammals stay asleep when hiding from nocturnal predators, and that the omnipresence of dragons and vampires in folklore and mythology around the world can be traced back to instincts evolved to help us avoid predatory dinosaurs and reptiles as well as nocturnal predators.I also quite like the psychedelic cover painting of an australopithecine Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden populated by dinosaurs, prehistoric rhinoceri and even scorpions - a painting that probably ended up spraypainted on quite a few VW Microbuses back in the 1970s."

The book is a lot like a summary of what people knew about consciousness at the time of writing, plus reflection and speculations from Sagan. Having read many of Richard Dawkins’s books, I didn’t get much out of this, except an entertaining summary.Keep in mind that a lot has changed in the field of the subject since the book was written, and, again, it contains a lot of speculations by Sagan."

I forget exactly why we read it, but I can remember that there was a focus on neuroscience and the early life of Earth in what we were learning. My teacher was also just a huge Sagan/popular science fanatic. I remember thinking the book was interesting, but I, more or less... skimmed it back then. Maybe I've matured (I don't really think so), but I wanted to pick it up again and actually process the information that Sagan blissfully bestows on the reader. There wasn't any pressing need for me to read Dragons of Eden, I just kind of saw it sitting on my bookshelf when I was making the reading challenge list for English class and thought it would be nice to re-read. Dragons of Eden is, more or less, chapters upon chapters of Carl Sagan's thoughts and discoveries on the brain and the human condition. From segments that literally give a calendar of the entirety of the universe's events, to chapters that focus solely on the learning capabilities of primates, to findings on the rare deformity of a ""split-brain"" in humans, Sagan provides an insane amount of information in a small book (there are exponentially more topics highlighted in Eden, those mentioned are just some examples). Each subject, while they may seem distantly related, builds on top of one another with various terminologies and fundamental concepts. His overall thesis is that human nature and the neural states of homo sapiens are filled with relics from the distant past, those relics still visible today. It's not often i'll go for something non-fiction, especially something in the field of neuroscience – the topic honestly being a little far removed from my interests. Despite this, found this book a joy to read (re-read), and it's actually made me more interested in neurology than I thought I could. Sagan makes the figurative tons of data in Eden extremely accessible and interesting, connecting each of his refined concepts to create a humble page turner. None of the information ever feels like it drags on at any point, as each chapter is short enough to get to the point without sacrificing any of the important details. It's really impressive how Sagan manages to create a book thats so jam-packed with information and still make it entertaining and accessible.One thing that is an obvious downside to this book is that some of the research and technological terms are outdated, and basically false at this point. This isn't to say that this book is all incorrect data, of course not, but having been released in 1977, there have definitely been some discoveries to prove some things in Eden wrong. This doesn't necessarily make Sagan's points less strong, however. His ideas and thoughts are still strong and poignant, even if some of the data is dated. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I think you'd be surprised at how much you'd enjoy it."
142,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13999805-greg-metcalf,5,"As I was reading this book again, since a first reading close to twenty years ago, a friend mentioned that if he was going to read a popular science book, he'd read a new one, not one from the seventies. That comment kind of got stuck in my head. It would certainly be interesting to read about how far sign language development with chimpanzees, for example, has come, which must have just gotten started when Sagan wrote about it here. But this book is Carl Sagan playing with possibilities. In a chapter on right and left hemisphere brain functioning, he suggests the possibility that the effect of marijuana might be to inhibit left brain reasoning giving the more intuitive right brain more influence over our thinking, which he compares to there always being stars above us but we need the dominant sun to set before they become visible. What a fascinating notion and how poetically stated. If anything Sagan writes about here has been disproven, he would be the first to say, Isn't this new evidence fascinating? We all wish Carl Sagan were alive and writing books about the cutting edge discoveries of today, but his creative thinking remains an inspiration. At one point, he was writing about how the written word manages to put the voice of someone else in your mind and wrote ""(Hello!)"" That alone made this well worth a second read. "
143,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571445-rajat-twit,4,"Not recommended for casual readers, this book is a very informative collection of amazing knowledge for the science enthusiasts. Expanding his knowledge from astrophysics to Biology, anthropology, evolutionary, history and upcoming scientific gadgets, Carl Sagan produces a wonderful literature on what may have been the case for the evolution of human intelligence. The book is a wonderful study of various aspects of human evolution and has given vivid and relevant examples for every point mentioned by Sagan. Not only Sagan is honest about the knowledge available at the time of writing the book, but predicts some wonderful future inventions for computer intelligence which we may see turning into reality today. His sharp predictions at the time of 1980s, which we may witness to becoming a reality, show that many of his speculations for the history of evolution may have many relevant points.The language is lucid and flawless, as is always in the case of Carl Sagan. He is not only one of the most significant science educator of 20 Century but is also a role model for many science enthusiasts. The voice that has ignited the minds of many scientists and engineers has proven through this book that people not from science background may become interested in Science, if science is presented in an entertaining and fun way!"
144,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73953091-matt-shaw,2,"While this is a well-researched Essay on Many Things, I found it truly disappointing. Not because it is dated, which it really is, but because the subtitle is utterly misleading. ""Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence"" do not actually occur in this book, which is far more concerned with the morphology of the human brain and the functions of its component parts; there is really nothing in this book about selective mechanisms or advantages, nothing about the huge metabolic costs of a 1400 cc brain, and little real discussion of the pressures driving the selection FOR increased encephalization. Nothing about evolution. Sorry, Carl ol' buddy, but this is a diatribe about brain function, quantitative measurements through vivisection experiments on all sorts of critters, and off-topic rambles about the ethics of abortion and extraterrestrial intelligence. This is a good read if you want to sound smart at a party, but that's about it."
145,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19488978-trey-nowell,4,"Pretty interesting book overall, did tend to go from one topic to another and then come back to the topic with a tiny bit of rambling. I also consider the book for its date written, and amazed Sagan could foresee so many things coming to fruition in technology (such as cloning and everyone having multiple computers). It must have been even more amazing 35 plus years ago to see how much information our genes contain. Tackles issues regarding human brain has developed over time, its components, the differences in the evolution of man, reptiles vs. mammals, sleeping in both, dreams, mental illness, the likelihood of aliens, etc. Very cool topics then and today, imagine they will be for millions and billions of years to come."
146,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,3,"This book is dated, but good. I love reading about research on the human brain. Sagan makes lots of corny jokes and asides that are not really appropriate but sort of endearing. The evolution of the brain is the focus and Sagan talks a lot about the ""reptilian"" brain, the part that we had before we became human. Also the discussion of what really makes us human is so interesting. On the radio some modern researcher said that the brain is a record, a story of what has happened to that particular body. Anyways, this book is archaic compared to what they know now, so I am looking for a modern (post-modern?) read on the amazing human brain!"

The book was pretty easy to read, it's a short and basic introduction to the brain. It starts saying some things about the Cosmos, evolution and the brain itself. I recommend this book if you are new to the topic, because if you have more experience in the field, this book may seem too basic, though it doesn't make it less great, I really enjoyed it a lot. Lastly, it's important to know that the book it's a little bit old so some things may be wrong."

You may find yourself not too proud to be human, as the origins of our much-touted intellegence which separates us from the beasts comes into focus. Evolutionary Anthropology rewritten for the masses, but still sometimes tedious and hard to follow; I found myself rereading several pages just to absorb all the information. I'm looking forward to more Sagan, as I have collected a number which I have not yet opened."

Here he examines humanity from a lot of different interesting angles, everything between cosmology, history, biology and morality. Here is something that will touch everyone. In my case i was especially fascinated with the chapter on cross species communication, but every single chapter is insanely intriguing. "
152,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,1,"The copy of the book I got was published in 1977 and what isn't out of date is wrong. The subtitle is ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"",  but little in the book is about that topic. The book rambles from from one subject to another,from cute drawings by everyone's favorite: M.C. Escher,to the chemical composition of distant stars. Perhaps the most interesting part is the chart that shows  Brain mass vs. Body weight. On that chart moles rate quite highly.Probably not the point the author was trying to make. The next time I see a mole I'll watch for signs of intelligence. There are many tidbits of trivia, one is the fact , that the average person has a 10% chance of having a genetic mutation that can be passed on to the next generation. Needless to say, almost all of these are harmful."
153,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,2,"Not one of Sagan's best books, IMHO.While this was not a bad book, I didn't find it overly stimulating or engaging, either.He talks about the cosmic calendar, left brain/right brain research, animal intelligence and other related topics.Some of Sagan's speculations about intelligence in here have now been disproved; ie - that chimps are capable of speech. See Robert Sapolsky's ""Human Behavioural Biology"" for a refutation of this.I also thought the book lacked a decent structure, and found its writing a bit rambing and unfocused.Thankfully, it wasn't that long...2 stars."
154,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey,4,Very good considering that Carl Sagan is writing outside of his field. Great speculations on the evolution of human/animal intelligence. Minus 1 star for being heavily outdated (originally published in 1977). I'll definitely be reading a more recent book on the same topic; written by a neuroscientist rather than an astrophysicist.
155,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33235645-ankan-paul,5,"A concise and exhaustive book of 250 odd pages depicting the exhilarating tale of the evolution of human intelligence, brachiating to exciting topics exploring the ""Cosmic Calendar"", the need for brains to evolve out of limitations in the gene pool, the fascinating abilities and amazing qualities of the human brain, the siphoning of the human brain to its pristine form with layers formed over ages on the reptilian brain, the hidden truths behind us emerging via evolution by natural selection as the dominating species from our arboreal ancestors, the promising thought process of our cousins- the chimps, the significance of dreams in the survival of our species, the striking differences between the two halves of our brains in information processing, the importance of extra-somatic knowledge storing (writing books!), a symbiotic future of human intelligence and machine/artificial intelligence, and finally ending with humanity's search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Who will say that Dr. Sagan wrote a book on a subject so far from his primary training, when every page is as replete with facts and contemporary neuro-science as it is with Dr. Sagan's profound speculations and conjectures? There is a reason why Dr. Carl Sagan is regarded as the teacher one always wished one had. I felt the same when I read the Cosmos, and since then made it my goal to read all his books. The Dragons of Eden is my second Carl Sagan read, and I must say I felt the same exhilaration while turning the pages that I felt while reading the Cosmos. To me, he is as good an artist as he is a scientist. His prose vividly portrays that. His own love for art, music, philosophy and every field that the human brain has produced is evident in his writings. And his appreciation is not just limited to the human species. His admiration encompasses the whole of the biodiversity on earth. And it is not just limited to the earth, it is for the whole cosmos. His writings have such a universal nature. When he writes, it seems he is writing for the whole species, on behalf of the whole world. Such a visionary! His writings makes one feel how small one's problems are in the grand scale of the ever expanding universe (or multiverse...who knows!).This book is no different. Subtitled ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"", the book does justice to the same. It is a fascinating tale of how we reached where we are today, with our connection to the reptiles (""dragons"") being embedded in the innermost core of our brains (the R-complex). Our brains have developed outwards since then, with more human like features being added in layers over the crudest core. There are exciting facts of how walking on two legs freed our hands to make tools, and to make better tools (hunting tools mostly, as that is only how we could have survived) better brains were a necessity. How our species massacred other primate species which showed signs of language (and hence a slight glimmer of intelligence) to ensure its survival. How our brain size is limited to the size of the pelvic cavity during child-birth. How there is a separation of functions in different locales of the brain and yet how our brains tend to be redundant with self-healing abilities. How there is a fight between the intuitive right half of the brain and the analytic/skeptic left half, and how that has led to the bias for the ""right""! I could go on listing all such beautiful stories put forth in the book. Besides recounting such tales and presenting the then recent developments in the field of neuro-science (split-brain experiments, experiments on understanding the localization of functions in the brain, those on deciphering the phenomenon of dreams, effects of neurotic drugs, surgeries on epileptic patients, studies on brain lesion of war soldiers, experiments on rat brains, etc), there are ample references to the myths and historical stories on the subjects, not to mention, the author's own rich and creative speculations, strewn all over the book, which grips the readers imagination and sends one spiraling down the ""what-if-that-is-true"" lane. The speculations were meant for contemporary and future scientists to work on. My favourite chapter from the book is ""The abstractions of beasts"" where Dr. Sagan presents all evidences of chimpanzee intelligence. Chimpanzees do have human like features, but how do you feel about human-like intelligence! Yes! I was really fascinated by the way Washoe, Lana or Lucy (the chimps) grasped the sign language taught to them and used it to communicate so effectively in such human-like manner. Imagine the idea of being able to talk to someone outside your species! The tales of the experiments that the author recounts is bound to touch your heart, make you really feel them. Language binds! The book is truly a gem. Dr. Sagan ploughs through the then recent developments in brain-studies, saturates the existing body of knowledge on the subject, lets loose his creative imagination, all the while weighing his words on a skeptic's scale, and brings forth this rich harvest for us commoners to enjoy. He stresses on the fact knowledge (""reason alloyed with intuition"" - the intelligence that has been so crucial in the survival and dominating nature of our species) is going to be the sole determinant of our race in the future, both for further development and to prevent self-destruction."
156,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57946842-ricardo-ari-sequeira,5,"Em comparação com os últimos livros que peguei, atrevo-me a dizer que as expetativas para este livro eram mais baixas. Considerava-me um fã de Carl Sagan porque conhecia o seu trabalho mas nunca lera nenhum livro da sua autoria nem vi ainda a famosa série Cosmos (cuja recriação brilhante de Neil DeGrasse Tyson é uma das minhas séries preferidas). Esta foi, portanto, a minha primeira experiência com um 'legado' de Sagan e que legado... Sinceramente, acho que não estava pronto para um trabalho tão genial como o que acabei de ler. Depois deste livro, acho que poderia ler Sagan explicar o ciclo de vida das minhocas com o máximo interesse imaginável. Quando dizem que ele é um apaixonado, um inspirador, um génio, um iluminado, um poeta... tudo isso é verdade e eu tive o prazer de comprovar nesta obra. Digo com toda a certeza (e tenho de pedir desculpa a Stephen Hawking neste aspeto, sem querer menosprezar a sua obra-prima) que este é o melhor livro de não-ficção que já li. Dei por mim a absorver todas as ""especulações"" de Sagan, a pensar nelas quando não estava a ler e a chegar a casa e escrever sobre o que havia lido e a fazer as minhas próprias ""especulações"". Tinha mesmo muita coisa para comentar sobre Os Dragões de Eden mas não me quero alongar nesta review.Quanto à escrita, especificamente falando, nada neste livro é muito técnico e o que se aproxima disso é explicado de forma transparente e de todo compreensível (com imagens esclarecedoras). É um trabalho de divulgação científica exemplar e inigualável.Queria deixar um excerto de um dos meus ""diários"" enquanto lia:""Eu estou a devorar e a adorar este livro, porque não é uma resposta a perguntas existentes, bem pelo contrário - é todo um conjunto de novas perguntas, teorias e suspeitas pertinentes sobre a inteligência humana (e animal). Perguntas que nunca teria imaginado que existiam e que eu tinha até ter lido este livro. Para mim esse é o maior legado com que fico. Já Neil DeGrasse Tyson dizia que, se pudesse perguntar qualquer coisa a uma entidade superior (que teria resposta qualquer que fosse a pergunta), a questão seria uma que ele ainda não conhecia neste momento porque questões mais fundamentais irão sempre surgir no futuro, questões que não imaginamos agora. (...) Vejo também a leitura deste livro como uma jornada de auto-conhecimento pois é de facto o nosso cérebro que é retratado nestas páginas. Este é tipo de livros que vale completamente a leitura e valerá uma releitura no futuro."" Por fim, deixo também um excerto do livro que me marcou desde logo e que demonstra também toda a capacidade de comunicação de Carl Sagan e a sua paixão pela ciência, vida e humanidade:""Como consequência das enormes transformações sociais e tecnológicas dos últimos séculos, o mundo não está a funcionar bem. Não vivemos em sociedades tradicionais e estáticas. Mas os nossos governos, ao resistirem à mudança, actuam como se tal acontecesse. A menos que nos venhamos a destruir totalmente, o futuro pertence às sociedades que, embora não ignorem o lado reptilineo e mamífero do nosso ser, permitem um desabrochar dos componentes caracteristicamente humanos da nossa natureza. Sociedades que encorajam a diversidade, e não o conformismo; sociedades que estejam dispostas a investir em recursos numa diversidade de experiências sociais, politicas, económicas e culturais, preparadas para sacrificar vantagens a curto prazo a benefícios a longo prazo; sociedades que tratem as novas ideias como vias delicadas, frágeis e imensamente valiosas que conduzem ao futuro."" (Carl Sagan, 1977)---Compared to the last books I picked up, I dare say that the expectations for this book were lower. I considered myself a fan of Carl Sagan because I knew his work but had never read any of his books or even seen the famous series Cosmos (whose brilliant recreation of Neil DeGrasse Tyson is one of my favorite series). This was, therefore, my first experience with a legacy of Sagan and what a legacy ... Honestly, I think I was not ready for such a brilliant work.After this book, I think I could read Sagan explaining the worm life cycle with the maximum interest imaginable. When they say that he's a passionate, an inspirer, a genius, an enlightened, a poet ... all this is true and I had the pleasure to prove it now.I say with certainty (and I have to apologize to Stephen Hawking in this respect, not wanting to belittle his masterpiece) that this is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. I absorbed all of Sagan's ""speculations"", I thought of them when I was not reading and I would get home and write about what I had read and to make my own ""speculations."" I had a lot to comment on The Dragons of Eden but I do not want to dwell on this review.As for writing, specifically speaking, nothing in this book is very technical and what comes close to it is explained in a transparent and comprehensible way (with enlightening images). It is an exemplary and unequaled scientific dissemination work.I wanted to leave here something I wrote about the book while reading it:""I am devouring and loving this book, because it's not a response to existing questions but quite the contrary - it's a whole set of new pertinent questions, theories, and suspicions about human (and animal) intelligence. Questions I would never have imagined existed and that I would never had if I didn't read this book. To me, that is the greatest legacy I got. Neil DeGrasse Tyson said that if he could ask anything to a superior entity (which would answer whatever the question was), the question Would be one he did not know at the moment because more fundamental questions will always arise in the future, questions that we can not imagine now ... I also see the reading of this book as a journey of self-knowledge because it is indeed our brain Which is portrayed in these pages.This is kind of a book that is worth reading completely and will be worth a re-reading in the future.Finally, I also leave a quote from the book that marked me from the beginning and also demonstrates all the capacity for communication of Carl Sagan and his passion for science, life and humanity:“As a consequence of the enormous social and technological changes of the last few centuries, the world is not working well. We do not live in traditional and static societies. But our government, in resisting change, act as if we did. Unless we destroy ourselves utterly, the future belongs to those societies that, while not ignoring the reptilian and mammalian parts of our being, enable the characteristically human components of our nature to flourish; to those societies that encourage diversity rather than conformity; to those societies willing to invest resources in a variety of social, political, economic and cultural experiments, and prepared to sacrifice short-term advantage for long-term benefit; to those societies that treat new ideas as delicate, fragile and immensely valuable pathways to the future.” (Carl Sagan, 1977)"
157,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"Carl Sagan's on a tear again. He can't stop himself, and you can't help cheering as you watch him go! He's a one man demonstration of evolution as a model for scientific method: cook up a whole lot of crazy mutant ideas and set them all free, unleash them on the World, and see which ones survive. ***Right now, he's working on the Mesozoic, and I'm along for the ride: we've got moronic dinos hunting mammals, which probably sleep all day as a defense mechanism ('cause they're too stupid to be quiet whilst being hunted) and cause ""the demise of the dinosaurs...by nocturnal predation on reptilian eggs. Two chicken eggs for breakfast may be all that is left... of this ancient mammalian cuisine."" This is classic Sagan, with some tenuous but imaginative hypothesis stretched to it's logical conclusion, and an insightful connection to bring it all home at the end. ***A stretched premise is one hallmark of science fiction writing, and I think Sagan's book fits the bill. He is Larry Niven and your favorite high school biology teacher rolled into one. But at the end what we get from Carl is a lot of fun stories and little more. Most are in the common cultural background (too many episodes of ""Cosmos"" perhaps?), but everyone is sure to come across a few delightful new anecdotes they hadn't previously heard: monkeys learning sign language, the endearing stupidities of midget brains,a naked Dr Louis Leaky outrunning his antelope, cannibal insectuous sex, Freud's work as a metaphor for our triply evolved and layered brain, (the reptilian hind brain naturally associated with the corporate board room: I liked that one!), the dad, divorced for cause of insomnia who retains custody of his genetically similar daughter, list goes on. This is all really good stuff and fast fun reading. ***But for all his fecundity, Sagan is not careful about the details of the ideas he sprays over the pages. His evolutionary reasoning is uncareful. Factors of 10 and 100 slip easily in and out in his calculation of brain power, the ratio of brain to body mass vs pure brain volume is a two edged sword he cuts in either direction as it suits him in different chapters, and so forth. He'll pause for air and disavow everything with a hand waving caution, ""just a hypothesis, now,"" but then he's off again. Waiter, I'll have whatever he's smoking. ***I once was teased with a variation on ""boundless youthful enthusiasm"" that transposed to: ""boundful useless enthusiasm"" and it comes, unbidden, to mind now. As an example of excitement overcoming rationality, the idea that an 8 Tonne T-rex, couldn't rouse itself from its numb stupor to prevent feral warm blooded whatevers from eating it's eggs is just an impossible stretch. (And, we can't help imagining the clever whatevers are our very own ancestors. Yeah! Go mammals!) OTOH, just considering the size and surface area, it is hard to imagine such big animals were not kept warm merely through metabolic inefficiency. THEY would have been the nocturnes, while we would have curled into furry balls at night, scampering between moribund overheating dinos during the hot lazy afternoons. Also, fur absorbs UV light, protecting our genetic blueprints from the supernova disaster that eradicated our scaly skinned competitors. ***Ok, ok, that's not in the book, I made it all up, but HE does it too! Yes, I know, HE'S Carl Sagan, and I'm not. ***We miss you Carl, - R.I.P. ***--------------Matt responded: I am curious to know what you think of some of the ""stretched premises"" towards the end. They attempt to apply his 'theories' on intelligence towards attitudes on social issues (computer intelligence, abortion, education, dream theory) and it all culminates in a direct insult of ""right-brain"" ideas diverging us from a utopia-by-intelligence. (Where intelligence is left-brain dominant).-------Ok done now, and my reply (to Matt) is that the book seemed to go out with a whimper, and I was neither opposed to nor enervated by, any of the last of it. I wanted cyborgs and computer super-minds, silicon immortality, x-ray vision and telepathy. Instead we got a pitch to fund wired classrooms and SETI. Ok already! ...I was hoping for more.I was not opposed because I agree with his thesis. Sagan is the consummate vampire slayer; he repudiates mystics of all sorts. Remember Sagan was (we must use the past tense not because he's dead but because, already, he represents a bygone era) still fighting Galileo's fight, one we only THINK is over because we live here: the battle of science against irrationality. REmember, Sagan thinks our right brain is responsible for brilliant flashes of insight, and art. I don't think he means the insult you apprehend.This takes us back to ZaTAoMM. Picture the misty past! The Epoch is BG (before Gates) and nerds are tolerated but joyfully reviled. Technology's evil, computers are laughable. People Do Not Believe ETI is out there and they're sure God is. The World is ruled by USSteel and PONG is the best and only computer game for heaven's sake!. It is hard for you guys to believe this shit (I call into context, regretfully, my advanced relative decrepitude, to remind that I am able to speak to you from the past, before your birth.) My point? It's a *real* battle that really needed to be fought, so we should forgive Sagan any overzealous driving home of the points. You need only think on the Texas and Kansas school systems to worry if the serpent's really truly been slain.Comments on some excellent vignettes towards the end:Witches dreaming of flying by reason of tripping on nightshade ~~ don't get me started! That they ""flew"" using broomsticks, well it's all merely hinted at, but if you listen close you can hear Carl snickering at his own jokes.Computers are conscious, or soon will be. I thought this especially cool, because it will at least be true so far as I can tell, and you can do NO BETTER! I mean, I can't *know* that you are conscious either, (solipsism) only that you're clever. So philosophically, once machines are clever, we may as well ascribe consciousness to them: it's only fair. Carl is very comfortable with this, with the proposition that consciousness is no more than the result of mere complexity, taken to a sufficient extreme. That's very well adjusted of him: I'm somebody who *wants* there to be more to me than there apparently is. (...and I make a lot more of this point than he bothers to.)Another excellent anecdote was Thoth railing against hieroglyphics as the calculators and video games of the age, certain to corrupt young minds which, relieved of the requirement to memorize everything, would grow indolent and weak. At this juncture, Carl reminds us how great written language is with a taunt that it allows an author to leap remotely off the page and into your brain! ...and across the chasm of death, too, I thought: a form of eternal life. For that instant I was again impressed with how very imaginatively Carl Sagan is able to think. So I'll respectfully say, ""No, I don't think it really sensible to imagine that Carl Sagan's prejudiced against the right brain."" To the contrary, he's All About right brain; his own is probably 50% bigger than the left.---------------------post script: as a companion to the chapter on right/left brain thinking I warmly recommend ""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" as a closely related romp through even further stretched conjectures of how our brain structure and thinking may be related.*** added 'cause Facebook publishes these without separating the paragraphs."

Is not an easy book, i know that Carl Sagan tried his best to make this book easy for non-biology experts, it would have been better if the info was some how more organized or more conclusive in some topics. If you are thrilled and interested in topics such as evolution, biology, human’s brain complexity and related topics this book is for you, do not expect a sciencie fiction novel. "

In the beginning, he kind of apologizes to the reader for embarking on such a speculative journey of the origins of mankind, but the stream of his thought is beyond convincing. For such a short read I learned a lot, and especially it made me consider non-human kinds of intelligence from a number of perspectives.I would love to read the updated version as so many things have changed since 40 years ago..."
166,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915487-corey,4,Carl Sagan had a beautiful mind. I would rate this book higher if I were smart enough to understand it all. 
167,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12379384-z-yasemin,5,Carl Sagan continues to impress me...
168,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9096819-simon,4,"I got around to reading this book after finding out that it's a foundational text for the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) movement, which Carl Sagan himself had a huge role in popularising: In ""Dragons of Eden"", Sagan gives laypeople a detailed explanation for how intelligence evolved here on Earth and hence clues for what to look for if they want to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.This book is very, very 1970s in many ways: As other reviewers have pointed out, the results of scientific research into neurobiology since its 1977 publishing date have falsified some of the ideas Sagans present here. There are also chapters where Sagan gets all starry-eyed and optimistic about computer technology's ability to improve human learning, to an extent that feels outright ridiculous to someone reading this in 2020. Despite all that, I am grateful for Sagan writing this book since it's difficult to find other books that present the basics of evolutionary biology, genetics and how the brain functions in this accessible a way to people who do not have an academic background in those scientific fields. It's even more impressive an achievement considering that the author is writing outside his own field of expertise - I doubt that Sam Harris could write as well about astrophysics as Carl Sagan does about neuroscience here!Much of the information presented here is also completely new to me, like how the different specialised parts of the brain have wildly varying proportions in different animal species depending on the animal's lifestyle - or how much easier it is to learn chimpanzees sign language than spoken language, to the point that chimpanzees can master sign language as well as humans. For me, the most interesting part of ""The Dragons of Eden"" has to be Sagan's explanation for how dreaming evolved: He theorises it's an evolutionary adaptation to make sure mammals stay asleep when hiding from nocturnal predators, and that the omnipresence of dragons and vampires in folklore and mythology around the world can be traced back to instincts evolved to help us avoid predatory dinosaurs and reptiles as well as nocturnal predators.I also quite like the psychedelic cover painting of an australopithecine Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden populated by dinosaurs, prehistoric rhinoceri and even scorpions - a painting that probably ended up spraypainted on quite a few VW Microbuses back in the 1970s."
169,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,3,"The book is fun and easy to read, but it doesn’t satisfy the incredible complexities of the subject. The book is a lot like a summary of what people knew about consciousness at the time of writing, plus reflection and speculations from Sagan. Having read many of Richard Dawkins’s books, I didn’t get much out of this, except an entertaining summary.Keep in mind that a lot has changed in the field of the subject since the book was written, and, again, it contains a lot of speculations by Sagan."

171,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71398830-johnny-j,4,"This wasn't actually my first time reading Dragons of Eden, as I had to read it for a certain curriculum based assignment at a private school I attended a few years ago. I forget exactly why we read it, but I can remember that there was a focus on neuroscience and the early life of Earth in what we were learning. My teacher was also just a huge Sagan/popular science fanatic. I remember thinking the book was interesting, but I, more or less... skimmed it back then. Maybe I've matured (I don't really think so), but I wanted to pick it up again and actually process the information that Sagan blissfully bestows on the reader. There wasn't any pressing need for me to read Dragons of Eden, I just kind of saw it sitting on my bookshelf when I was making the reading challenge list for English class and thought it would be nice to re-read. Dragons of Eden is, more or less, chapters upon chapters of Carl Sagan's thoughts and discoveries on the brain and the human condition. From segments that literally give a calendar of the entirety of the universe's events, to chapters that focus solely on the learning capabilities of primates, to findings on the rare deformity of a ""split-brain"" in humans, Sagan provides an insane amount of information in a small book (there are exponentially more topics highlighted in Eden, those mentioned are just some examples). Each subject, while they may seem distantly related, builds on top of one another with various terminologies and fundamental concepts. His overall thesis is that human nature and the neural states of homo sapiens are filled with relics from the distant past, those relics still visible today. It's not often i'll go for something non-fiction, especially something in the field of neuroscience – the topic honestly being a little far removed from my interests. Despite this, found this book a joy to read (re-read), and it's actually made me more interested in neurology than I thought I could. Sagan makes the figurative tons of data in Eden extremely accessible and interesting, connecting each of his refined concepts to create a humble page turner. None of the information ever feels like it drags on at any point, as each chapter is short enough to get to the point without sacrificing any of the important details. It's really impressive how Sagan manages to create a book thats so jam-packed with information and still make it entertaining and accessible.One thing that is an obvious downside to this book is that some of the research and technological terms are outdated, and basically false at this point. This isn't to say that this book is all incorrect data, of course not, but having been released in 1977, there have definitely been some discoveries to prove some things in Eden wrong. This doesn't necessarily make Sagan's points less strong, however. His ideas and thoughts are still strong and poignant, even if some of the data is dated. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I think you'd be surprised at how much you'd enjoy it."
172,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13999805-greg-metcalf,5,"As I was reading this book again, since a first reading close to twenty years ago, a friend mentioned that if he was going to read a popular science book, he'd read a new one, not one from the seventies. That comment kind of got stuck in my head. It would certainly be interesting to read about how far sign language development with chimpanzees, for example, has come, which must have just gotten started when Sagan wrote about it here. But this book is Carl Sagan playing with possibilities. In a chapter on right and left hemisphere brain functioning, he suggests the possibility that the effect of marijuana might be to inhibit left brain reasoning giving the more intuitive right brain more influence over our thinking, which he compares to there always being stars above us but we need the dominant sun to set before they become visible. What a fascinating notion and how poetically stated. If anything Sagan writes about here has been disproven, he would be the first to say, Isn't this new evidence fascinating? We all wish Carl Sagan were alive and writing books about the cutting edge discoveries of today, but his creative thinking remains an inspiration. At one point, he was writing about how the written word manages to put the voice of someone else in your mind and wrote ""(Hello!)"" That alone made this well worth a second read. "
173,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571445-rajat-twit,4,"Not recommended for casual readers, this book is a very informative collection of amazing knowledge for the science enthusiasts. Expanding his knowledge from astrophysics to Biology, anthropology, evolutionary, history and upcoming scientific gadgets, Carl Sagan produces a wonderful literature on what may have been the case for the evolution of human intelligence. The book is a wonderful study of various aspects of human evolution and has given vivid and relevant examples for every point mentioned by Sagan. Not only Sagan is honest about the knowledge available at the time of writing the book, but predicts some wonderful future inventions for computer intelligence which we may see turning into reality today. His sharp predictions at the time of 1980s, which we may witness to becoming a reality, show that many of his speculations for the history of evolution may have many relevant points.The language is lucid and flawless, as is always in the case of Carl Sagan. He is not only one of the most significant science educator of 20 Century but is also a role model for many science enthusiasts. The voice that has ignited the minds of many scientists and engineers has proven through this book that people not from science background may become interested in Science, if science is presented in an entertaining and fun way!"

Not because it is dated, which it really is, but because the subtitle is utterly misleading. ""Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence"" do not actually occur in this book, which is far more concerned with the morphology of the human brain and the functions of its component parts; there is really nothing in this book about selective mechanisms or advantages, nothing about the huge metabolic costs of a 1400 cc brain, and little real discussion of the pressures driving the selection FOR increased encephalization. Nothing about evolution. Sorry, Carl ol' buddy, but this is a diatribe about brain function, quantitative measurements through vivisection experiments on all sorts of critters, and off-topic rambles about the ethics of abortion and extraterrestrial intelligence. This is a good read if you want to sound smart at a party, but that's about it."
175,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19488978-trey-nowell,4,"Pretty interesting book overall, did tend to go from one topic to another and then come back to the topic with a tiny bit of rambling. I also consider the book for its date written, and amazed Sagan could foresee so many things coming to fruition in technology (such as cloning and everyone having multiple computers). It must have been even more amazing 35 plus years ago to see how much information our genes contain. Tackles issues regarding human brain has developed over time, its components, the differences in the evolution of man, reptiles vs. mammals, sleeping in both, dreams, mental illness, the likelihood of aliens, etc. Very cool topics then and today, imagine they will be for millions and billions of years to come."
176,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,3,"This book is dated, but good. I love reading about research on the human brain. Sagan makes lots of corny jokes and asides that are not really appropriate but sort of endearing. The evolution of the brain is the focus and Sagan talks a lot about the ""reptilian"" brain, the part that we had before we became human. Also the discussion of what really makes us human is so interesting. On the radio some modern researcher said that the brain is a record, a story of what has happened to that particular body. Anyways, this book is archaic compared to what they know now, so I am looking for a modern (post-modern?) read on the amazing human brain!"

The book was pretty easy to read, it's a short and basic introduction to the brain. It starts saying some things about the Cosmos, evolution and the brain itself. I recommend this book if you are new to the topic, because if you have more experience in the field, this book may seem too basic, though it doesn't make it less great, I really enjoyed it a lot. Lastly, it's important to know that the book it's a little bit old so some things may be wrong."

Evolutionary Anthropology rewritten for the masses, but still sometimes tedious and hard to follow; I found myself rereading several pages just to absorb all the information. I'm looking forward to more Sagan, as I have collected a number which I have not yet opened."

Here he examines humanity from a lot of different interesting angles, everything between cosmology, history, biology and morality. Here is something that will touch everyone. In my case i was especially fascinated with the chapter on cross species communication, but every single chapter is insanely intriguing. "
182,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,1,"The copy of the book I got was published in 1977 and what isn't out of date is wrong. The subtitle is ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"",  but little in the book is about that topic. The book rambles from from one subject to another,from cute drawings by everyone's favorite: M.C. Escher,to the chemical composition of distant stars. Perhaps the most interesting part is the chart that shows  Brain mass vs. Body weight. On that chart moles rate quite highly.Probably not the point the author was trying to make. The next time I see a mole I'll watch for signs of intelligence. There are many tidbits of trivia, one is the fact , that the average person has a 10% chance of having a genetic mutation that can be passed on to the next generation. Needless to say, almost all of these are harmful."
183,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,2,"Not one of Sagan's best books, IMHO.While this was not a bad book, I didn't find it overly stimulating or engaging, either.He talks about the cosmic calendar, left brain/right brain research, animal intelligence and other related topics.Some of Sagan's speculations about intelligence in here have now been disproved; ie - that chimps are capable of speech. See Robert Sapolsky's ""Human Behavioural Biology"" for a refutation of this.I also thought the book lacked a decent structure, and found its writing a bit rambing and unfocused.Thankfully, it wasn't that long...2 stars."
184,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey,4,Very good considering that Carl Sagan is writing outside of his field. Great speculations on the evolution of human/animal intelligence. Minus 1 star for being heavily outdated (originally published in 1977). I'll definitely be reading a more recent book on the same topic; written by a neuroscientist rather than an astrophysicist.
185,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33235645-ankan-paul,5,"A concise and exhaustive book of 250 odd pages depicting the exhilarating tale of the evolution of human intelligence, brachiating to exciting topics exploring the ""Cosmic Calendar"", the need for brains to evolve out of limitations in the gene pool, the fascinating abilities and amazing qualities of the human brain, the siphoning of the human brain to its pristine form with layers formed over ages on the reptilian brain, the hidden truths behind us emerging via evolution by natural selection as the dominating species from our arboreal ancestors, the promising thought process of our cousins- the chimps, the significance of dreams in the survival of our species, the striking differences between the two halves of our brains in information processing, the importance of extra-somatic knowledge storing (writing books!), a symbiotic future of human intelligence and machine/artificial intelligence, and finally ending with humanity's search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Who will say that Dr. Sagan wrote a book on a subject so far from his primary training, when every page is as replete with facts and contemporary neuro-science as it is with Dr. Sagan's profound speculations and conjectures? There is a reason why Dr. Carl Sagan is regarded as the teacher one always wished one had. I felt the same when I read the Cosmos, and since then made it my goal to read all his books. The Dragons of Eden is my second Carl Sagan read, and I must say I felt the same exhilaration while turning the pages that I felt while reading the Cosmos. To me, he is as good an artist as he is a scientist. His prose vividly portrays that. His own love for art, music, philosophy and every field that the human brain has produced is evident in his writings. And his appreciation is not just limited to the human species. His admiration encompasses the whole of the biodiversity on earth. And it is not just limited to the earth, it is for the whole cosmos. His writings have such a universal nature. When he writes, it seems he is writing for the whole species, on behalf of the whole world. Such a visionary! His writings makes one feel how small one's problems are in the grand scale of the ever expanding universe (or multiverse...who knows!).This book is no different. Subtitled ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"", the book does justice to the same. It is a fascinating tale of how we reached where we are today, with our connection to the reptiles (""dragons"") being embedded in the innermost core of our brains (the R-complex). Our brains have developed outwards since then, with more human like features being added in layers over the crudest core. There are exciting facts of how walking on two legs freed our hands to make tools, and to make better tools (hunting tools mostly, as that is only how we could have survived) better brains were a necessity. How our species massacred other primate species which showed signs of language (and hence a slight glimmer of intelligence) to ensure its survival. How our brain size is limited to the size of the pelvic cavity during child-birth. How there is a separation of functions in different locales of the brain and yet how our brains tend to be redundant with self-healing abilities. How there is a fight between the intuitive right half of the brain and the analytic/skeptic left half, and how that has led to the bias for the ""right""! I could go on listing all such beautiful stories put forth in the book. Besides recounting such tales and presenting the then recent developments in the field of neuro-science (split-brain experiments, experiments on understanding the localization of functions in the brain, those on deciphering the phenomenon of dreams, effects of neurotic drugs, surgeries on epileptic patients, studies on brain lesion of war soldiers, experiments on rat brains, etc), there are ample references to the myths and historical stories on the subjects, not to mention, the author's own rich and creative speculations, strewn all over the book, which grips the readers imagination and sends one spiraling down the ""what-if-that-is-true"" lane. The speculations were meant for contemporary and future scientists to work on. My favourite chapter from the book is ""The abstractions of beasts"" where Dr. Sagan presents all evidences of chimpanzee intelligence. Chimpanzees do have human like features, but how do you feel about human-like intelligence! Yes! I was really fascinated by the way Washoe, Lana or Lucy (the chimps) grasped the sign language taught to them and used it to communicate so effectively in such human-like manner. Imagine the idea of being able to talk to someone outside your species! The tales of the experiments that the author recounts is bound to touch your heart, make you really feel them. Language binds! The book is truly a gem. Dr. Sagan ploughs through the then recent developments in brain-studies, saturates the existing body of knowledge on the subject, lets loose his creative imagination, all the while weighing his words on a skeptic's scale, and brings forth this rich harvest for us commoners to enjoy. He stresses on the fact knowledge (""reason alloyed with intuition"" - the intelligence that has been so crucial in the survival and dominating nature of our species) is going to be the sole determinant of our race in the future, both for further development and to prevent self-destruction."
186,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57946842-ricardo-ari-sequeira,5,"Em comparação com os últimos livros que peguei, atrevo-me a dizer que as expetativas para este livro eram mais baixas. Considerava-me um fã de Carl Sagan porque conhecia o seu trabalho mas nunca lera nenhum livro da sua autoria nem vi ainda a famosa série Cosmos (cuja recriação brilhante de Neil DeGrasse Tyson é uma das minhas séries preferidas). Esta foi, portanto, a minha primeira experiência com um 'legado' de Sagan e que legado... Sinceramente, acho que não estava pronto para um trabalho tão genial como o que acabei de ler. Depois deste livro, acho que poderia ler Sagan explicar o ciclo de vida das minhocas com o máximo interesse imaginável. Quando dizem que ele é um apaixonado, um inspirador, um génio, um iluminado, um poeta... tudo isso é verdade e eu tive o prazer de comprovar nesta obra. Digo com toda a certeza (e tenho de pedir desculpa a Stephen Hawking neste aspeto, sem querer menosprezar a sua obra-prima) que este é o melhor livro de não-ficção que já li. Dei por mim a absorver todas as ""especulações"" de Sagan, a pensar nelas quando não estava a ler e a chegar a casa e escrever sobre o que havia lido e a fazer as minhas próprias ""especulações"". Tinha mesmo muita coisa para comentar sobre Os Dragões de Eden mas não me quero alongar nesta review.Quanto à escrita, especificamente falando, nada neste livro é muito técnico e o que se aproxima disso é explicado de forma transparente e de todo compreensível (com imagens esclarecedoras). É um trabalho de divulgação científica exemplar e inigualável.Queria deixar um excerto de um dos meus ""diários"" enquanto lia:""Eu estou a devorar e a adorar este livro, porque não é uma resposta a perguntas existentes, bem pelo contrário - é todo um conjunto de novas perguntas, teorias e suspeitas pertinentes sobre a inteligência humana (e animal). Perguntas que nunca teria imaginado que existiam e que eu tinha até ter lido este livro. Para mim esse é o maior legado com que fico. Já Neil DeGrasse Tyson dizia que, se pudesse perguntar qualquer coisa a uma entidade superior (que teria resposta qualquer que fosse a pergunta), a questão seria uma que ele ainda não conhecia neste momento porque questões mais fundamentais irão sempre surgir no futuro, questões que não imaginamos agora. (...) Vejo também a leitura deste livro como uma jornada de auto-conhecimento pois é de facto o nosso cérebro que é retratado nestas páginas. Este é tipo de livros que vale completamente a leitura e valerá uma releitura no futuro."" Por fim, deixo também um excerto do livro que me marcou desde logo e que demonstra também toda a capacidade de comunicação de Carl Sagan e a sua paixão pela ciência, vida e humanidade:""Como consequência das enormes transformações sociais e tecnológicas dos últimos séculos, o mundo não está a funcionar bem. Não vivemos em sociedades tradicionais e estáticas. Mas os nossos governos, ao resistirem à mudança, actuam como se tal acontecesse. A menos que nos venhamos a destruir totalmente, o futuro pertence às sociedades que, embora não ignorem o lado reptilineo e mamífero do nosso ser, permitem um desabrochar dos componentes caracteristicamente humanos da nossa natureza. Sociedades que encorajam a diversidade, e não o conformismo; sociedades que estejam dispostas a investir em recursos numa diversidade de experiências sociais, politicas, económicas e culturais, preparadas para sacrificar vantagens a curto prazo a benefícios a longo prazo; sociedades que tratem as novas ideias como vias delicadas, frágeis e imensamente valiosas que conduzem ao futuro."" (Carl Sagan, 1977)---Compared to the last books I picked up, I dare say that the expectations for this book were lower. I considered myself a fan of Carl Sagan because I knew his work but had never read any of his books or even seen the famous series Cosmos (whose brilliant recreation of Neil DeGrasse Tyson is one of my favorite series). This was, therefore, my first experience with a legacy of Sagan and what a legacy ... Honestly, I think I was not ready for such a brilliant work.After this book, I think I could read Sagan explaining the worm life cycle with the maximum interest imaginable. When they say that he's a passionate, an inspirer, a genius, an enlightened, a poet ... all this is true and I had the pleasure to prove it now.I say with certainty (and I have to apologize to Stephen Hawking in this respect, not wanting to belittle his masterpiece) that this is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. I absorbed all of Sagan's ""speculations"", I thought of them when I was not reading and I would get home and write about what I had read and to make my own ""speculations."" I had a lot to comment on The Dragons of Eden but I do not want to dwell on this review.As for writing, specifically speaking, nothing in this book is very technical and what comes close to it is explained in a transparent and comprehensible way (with enlightening images). It is an exemplary and unequaled scientific dissemination work.I wanted to leave here something I wrote about the book while reading it:""I am devouring and loving this book, because it's not a response to existing questions but quite the contrary - it's a whole set of new pertinent questions, theories, and suspicions about human (and animal) intelligence. Questions I would never have imagined existed and that I would never had if I didn't read this book. To me, that is the greatest legacy I got. Neil DeGrasse Tyson said that if he could ask anything to a superior entity (which would answer whatever the question was), the question Would be one he did not know at the moment because more fundamental questions will always arise in the future, questions that we can not imagine now ... I also see the reading of this book as a journey of self-knowledge because it is indeed our brain Which is portrayed in these pages.This is kind of a book that is worth reading completely and will be worth a re-reading in the future.Finally, I also leave a quote from the book that marked me from the beginning and also demonstrates all the capacity for communication of Carl Sagan and his passion for science, life and humanity:“As a consequence of the enormous social and technological changes of the last few centuries, the world is not working well. We do not live in traditional and static societies. But our government, in resisting change, act as if we did. Unless we destroy ourselves utterly, the future belongs to those societies that, while not ignoring the reptilian and mammalian parts of our being, enable the characteristically human components of our nature to flourish; to those societies that encourage diversity rather than conformity; to those societies willing to invest resources in a variety of social, political, economic and cultural experiments, and prepared to sacrifice short-term advantage for long-term benefit; to those societies that treat new ideas as delicate, fragile and immensely valuable pathways to the future.” (Carl Sagan, 1977)"
187,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"Carl Sagan's on a tear again. He can't stop himself, and you can't help cheering as you watch him go! He's a one man demonstration of evolution as a model for scientific method: cook up a whole lot of crazy mutant ideas and set them all free, unleash them on the World, and see which ones survive. ***Right now, he's working on the Mesozoic, and I'm along for the ride: we've got moronic dinos hunting mammals, which probably sleep all day as a defense mechanism ('cause they're too stupid to be quiet whilst being hunted) and cause ""the demise of the dinosaurs...by nocturnal predation on reptilian eggs. Two chicken eggs for breakfast may be all that is left... of this ancient mammalian cuisine."" This is classic Sagan, with some tenuous but imaginative hypothesis stretched to it's logical conclusion, and an insightful connection to bring it all home at the end. ***A stretched premise is one hallmark of science fiction writing, and I think Sagan's book fits the bill. He is Larry Niven and your favorite high school biology teacher rolled into one. But at the end what we get from Carl is a lot of fun stories and little more. Most are in the common cultural background (too many episodes of ""Cosmos"" perhaps?), but everyone is sure to come across a few delightful new anecdotes they hadn't previously heard: monkeys learning sign language, the endearing stupidities of midget brains,a naked Dr Louis Leaky outrunning his antelope, cannibal insectuous sex, Freud's work as a metaphor for our triply evolved and layered brain, (the reptilian hind brain naturally associated with the corporate board room: I liked that one!), the dad, divorced for cause of insomnia who retains custody of his genetically similar daughter, list goes on. This is all really good stuff and fast fun reading. ***But for all his fecundity, Sagan is not careful about the details of the ideas he sprays over the pages. His evolutionary reasoning is uncareful. Factors of 10 and 100 slip easily in and out in his calculation of brain power, the ratio of brain to body mass vs pure brain volume is a two edged sword he cuts in either direction as it suits him in different chapters, and so forth. He'll pause for air and disavow everything with a hand waving caution, ""just a hypothesis, now,"" but then he's off again. Waiter, I'll have whatever he's smoking. ***I once was teased with a variation on ""boundless youthful enthusiasm"" that transposed to: ""boundful useless enthusiasm"" and it comes, unbidden, to mind now. As an example of excitement overcoming rationality, the idea that an 8 Tonne T-rex, couldn't rouse itself from its numb stupor to prevent feral warm blooded whatevers from eating it's eggs is just an impossible stretch. (And, we can't help imagining the clever whatevers are our very own ancestors. Yeah! Go mammals!) OTOH, just considering the size and surface area, it is hard to imagine such big animals were not kept warm merely through metabolic inefficiency. THEY would have been the nocturnes, while we would have curled into furry balls at night, scampering between moribund overheating dinos during the hot lazy afternoons. Also, fur absorbs UV light, protecting our genetic blueprints from the supernova disaster that eradicated our scaly skinned competitors. ***Ok, ok, that's not in the book, I made it all up, but HE does it too! Yes, I know, HE'S Carl Sagan, and I'm not. ***We miss you Carl, - R.I.P. ***--------------Matt responded: I am curious to know what you think of some of the ""stretched premises"" towards the end. They attempt to apply his 'theories' on intelligence towards attitudes on social issues (computer intelligence, abortion, education, dream theory) and it all culminates in a direct insult of ""right-brain"" ideas diverging us from a utopia-by-intelligence. (Where intelligence is left-brain dominant).-------Ok done now, and my reply (to Matt) is that the book seemed to go out with a whimper, and I was neither opposed to nor enervated by, any of the last of it. I wanted cyborgs and computer super-minds, silicon immortality, x-ray vision and telepathy. Instead we got a pitch to fund wired classrooms and SETI. Ok already! ...I was hoping for more.I was not opposed because I agree with his thesis. Sagan is the consummate vampire slayer; he repudiates mystics of all sorts. Remember Sagan was (we must use the past tense not because he's dead but because, already, he represents a bygone era) still fighting Galileo's fight, one we only THINK is over because we live here: the battle of science against irrationality. REmember, Sagan thinks our right brain is responsible for brilliant flashes of insight, and art. I don't think he means the insult you apprehend.This takes us back to ZaTAoMM. Picture the misty past! The Epoch is BG (before Gates) and nerds are tolerated but joyfully reviled. Technology's evil, computers are laughable. People Do Not Believe ETI is out there and they're sure God is. The World is ruled by USSteel and PONG is the best and only computer game for heaven's sake!. It is hard for you guys to believe this shit (I call into context, regretfully, my advanced relative decrepitude, to remind that I am able to speak to you from the past, before your birth.) My point? It's a *real* battle that really needed to be fought, so we should forgive Sagan any overzealous driving home of the points. You need only think on the Texas and Kansas school systems to worry if the serpent's really truly been slain.Comments on some excellent vignettes towards the end:Witches dreaming of flying by reason of tripping on nightshade ~~ don't get me started! That they ""flew"" using broomsticks, well it's all merely hinted at, but if you listen close you can hear Carl snickering at his own jokes.Computers are conscious, or soon will be. I thought this especially cool, because it will at least be true so far as I can tell, and you can do NO BETTER! I mean, I can't *know* that you are conscious either, (solipsism) only that you're clever. So philosophically, once machines are clever, we may as well ascribe consciousness to them: it's only fair. Carl is very comfortable with this, with the proposition that consciousness is no more than the result of mere complexity, taken to a sufficient extreme. That's very well adjusted of him: I'm somebody who *wants* there to be more to me than there apparently is. (...and I make a lot more of this point than he bothers to.)Another excellent anecdote was Thoth railing against hieroglyphics as the calculators and video games of the age, certain to corrupt young minds which, relieved of the requirement to memorize everything, would grow indolent and weak. At this juncture, Carl reminds us how great written language is with a taunt that it allows an author to leap remotely off the page and into your brain! ...and across the chasm of death, too, I thought: a form of eternal life. For that instant I was again impressed with how very imaginatively Carl Sagan is able to think. So I'll respectfully say, ""No, I don't think it really sensible to imagine that Carl Sagan's prejudiced against the right brain."" To the contrary, he's All About right brain; his own is probably 50% bigger than the left.---------------------post script: as a companion to the chapter on right/left brain thinking I warmly recommend ""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" as a closely related romp through even further stretched conjectures of how our brain structure and thinking may be related.*** added 'cause Facebook publishes these without separating the paragraphs."

Is not an easy book, i know that Carl Sagan tried his best to make this book easy for non-biology experts, it would have been better if the info was some how more organized or more conclusive in some topics. If you are thrilled and interested in topics such as evolution, biology, human’s brain complexity and related topics this book is for you, do not expect a sciencie fiction novel. "

In the beginning, he kind of apologizes to the reader for embarking on such a speculative journey of the origins of mankind, but the stream of his thought is beyond convincing. For such a short read I learned a lot, and especially it made me consider non-human kinds of intelligence from a number of perspectives.I would love to read the updated version as so many things have changed since 40 years ago..."
196,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915487-corey,4,Carl Sagan had a beautiful mind. I would rate this book higher if I were smart enough to understand it all. 
197,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12379384-z-yasemin,5,Carl Sagan continues to impress me...
198,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9096819-simon,4,"I got around to reading this book after finding out that it's a foundational text for the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) movement, which Carl Sagan himself had a huge role in popularising: In ""Dragons of Eden"", Sagan gives laypeople a detailed explanation for how intelligence evolved here on Earth and hence clues for what to look for if they want to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.This book is very, very 1970s in many ways: As other reviewers have pointed out, the results of scientific research into neurobiology since its 1977 publishing date have falsified some of the ideas Sagans present here. There are also chapters where Sagan gets all starry-eyed and optimistic about computer technology's ability to improve human learning, to an extent that feels outright ridiculous to someone reading this in 2020. Despite all that, I am grateful for Sagan writing this book since it's difficult to find other books that present the basics of evolutionary biology, genetics and how the brain functions in this accessible a way to people who do not have an academic background in those scientific fields. It's even more impressive an achievement considering that the author is writing outside his own field of expertise - I doubt that Sam Harris could write as well about astrophysics as Carl Sagan does about neuroscience here!Much of the information presented here is also completely new to me, like how the different specialised parts of the brain have wildly varying proportions in different animal species depending on the animal's lifestyle - or how much easier it is to learn chimpanzees sign language than spoken language, to the point that chimpanzees can master sign language as well as humans. For me, the most interesting part of ""The Dragons of Eden"" has to be Sagan's explanation for how dreaming evolved: He theorises it's an evolutionary adaptation to make sure mammals stay asleep when hiding from nocturnal predators, and that the omnipresence of dragons and vampires in folklore and mythology around the world can be traced back to instincts evolved to help us avoid predatory dinosaurs and reptiles as well as nocturnal predators.I also quite like the psychedelic cover painting of an australopithecine Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden populated by dinosaurs, prehistoric rhinoceri and even scorpions - a painting that probably ended up spraypainted on quite a few VW Microbuses back in the 1970s."
199,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,3,"The book is fun and easy to read, but it doesn’t satisfy the incredible complexities of the subject. The book is a lot like a summary of what people knew about consciousness at the time of writing, plus reflection and speculations from Sagan. Having read many of Richard Dawkins’s books, I didn’t get much out of this, except an entertaining summary.Keep in mind that a lot has changed in the field of the subject since the book was written, and, again, it contains a lot of speculations by Sagan."

201,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71398830-johnny-j,4,"This wasn't actually my first time reading Dragons of Eden, as I had to read it for a certain curriculum based assignment at a private school I attended a few years ago. I forget exactly why we read it, but I can remember that there was a focus on neuroscience and the early life of Earth in what we were learning. My teacher was also just a huge Sagan/popular science fanatic. I remember thinking the book was interesting, but I, more or less... skimmed it back then. Maybe I've matured (I don't really think so), but I wanted to pick it up again and actually process the information that Sagan blissfully bestows on the reader. There wasn't any pressing need for me to read Dragons of Eden, I just kind of saw it sitting on my bookshelf when I was making the reading challenge list for English class and thought it would be nice to re-read. Dragons of Eden is, more or less, chapters upon chapters of Carl Sagan's thoughts and discoveries on the brain and the human condition. From segments that literally give a calendar of the entirety of the universe's events, to chapters that focus solely on the learning capabilities of primates, to findings on the rare deformity of a ""split-brain"" in humans, Sagan provides an insane amount of information in a small book (there are exponentially more topics highlighted in Eden, those mentioned are just some examples). Each subject, while they may seem distantly related, builds on top of one another with various terminologies and fundamental concepts. His overall thesis is that human nature and the neural states of homo sapiens are filled with relics from the distant past, those relics still visible today. It's not often i'll go for something non-fiction, especially something in the field of neuroscience – the topic honestly being a little far removed from my interests. Despite this, found this book a joy to read (re-read), and it's actually made me more interested in neurology than I thought I could. Sagan makes the figurative tons of data in Eden extremely accessible and interesting, connecting each of his refined concepts to create a humble page turner. None of the information ever feels like it drags on at any point, as each chapter is short enough to get to the point without sacrificing any of the important details. It's really impressive how Sagan manages to create a book thats so jam-packed with information and still make it entertaining and accessible.One thing that is an obvious downside to this book is that some of the research and technological terms are outdated, and basically false at this point. This isn't to say that this book is all incorrect data, of course not, but having been released in 1977, there have definitely been some discoveries to prove some things in Eden wrong. This doesn't necessarily make Sagan's points less strong, however. His ideas and thoughts are still strong and poignant, even if some of the data is dated. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I think you'd be surprised at how much you'd enjoy it."
202,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13999805-greg-metcalf,5,"As I was reading this book again, since a first reading close to twenty years ago, a friend mentioned that if he was going to read a popular science book, he'd read a new one, not one from the seventies. That comment kind of got stuck in my head. It would certainly be interesting to read about how far sign language development with chimpanzees, for example, has come, which must have just gotten started when Sagan wrote about it here. But this book is Carl Sagan playing with possibilities. In a chapter on right and left hemisphere brain functioning, he suggests the possibility that the effect of marijuana might be to inhibit left brain reasoning giving the more intuitive right brain more influence over our thinking, which he compares to there always being stars above us but we need the dominant sun to set before they become visible. What a fascinating notion and how poetically stated. If anything Sagan writes about here has been disproven, he would be the first to say, Isn't this new evidence fascinating? We all wish Carl Sagan were alive and writing books about the cutting edge discoveries of today, but his creative thinking remains an inspiration. At one point, he was writing about how the written word manages to put the voice of someone else in your mind and wrote ""(Hello!)"" That alone made this well worth a second read. "
203,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571445-rajat-twit,4,"Not recommended for casual readers, this book is a very informative collection of amazing knowledge for the science enthusiasts. Expanding his knowledge from astrophysics to Biology, anthropology, evolutionary, history and upcoming scientific gadgets, Carl Sagan produces a wonderful literature on what may have been the case for the evolution of human intelligence. The book is a wonderful study of various aspects of human evolution and has given vivid and relevant examples for every point mentioned by Sagan. Not only Sagan is honest about the knowledge available at the time of writing the book, but predicts some wonderful future inventions for computer intelligence which we may see turning into reality today. His sharp predictions at the time of 1980s, which we may witness to becoming a reality, show that many of his speculations for the history of evolution may have many relevant points.The language is lucid and flawless, as is always in the case of Carl Sagan. He is not only one of the most significant science educator of 20 Century but is also a role model for many science enthusiasts. The voice that has ignited the minds of many scientists and engineers has proven through this book that people not from science background may become interested in Science, if science is presented in an entertaining and fun way!"

Not because it is dated, which it really is, but because the subtitle is utterly misleading. ""Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence"" do not actually occur in this book, which is far more concerned with the morphology of the human brain and the functions of its component parts; there is really nothing in this book about selective mechanisms or advantages, nothing about the huge metabolic costs of a 1400 cc brain, and little real discussion of the pressures driving the selection FOR increased encephalization. Nothing about evolution. Sorry, Carl ol' buddy, but this is a diatribe about brain function, quantitative measurements through vivisection experiments on all sorts of critters, and off-topic rambles about the ethics of abortion and extraterrestrial intelligence. This is a good read if you want to sound smart at a party, but that's about it."
205,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19488978-trey-nowell,4,"Pretty interesting book overall, did tend to go from one topic to another and then come back to the topic with a tiny bit of rambling. I also consider the book for its date written, and amazed Sagan could foresee so many things coming to fruition in technology (such as cloning and everyone having multiple computers). It must have been even more amazing 35 plus years ago to see how much information our genes contain. Tackles issues regarding human brain has developed over time, its components, the differences in the evolution of man, reptiles vs. mammals, sleeping in both, dreams, mental illness, the likelihood of aliens, etc. Very cool topics then and today, imagine they will be for millions and billions of years to come."
206,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,3,"This book is dated, but good. I love reading about research on the human brain. Sagan makes lots of corny jokes and asides that are not really appropriate but sort of endearing. The evolution of the brain is the focus and Sagan talks a lot about the ""reptilian"" brain, the part that we had before we became human. Also the discussion of what really makes us human is so interesting. On the radio some modern researcher said that the brain is a record, a story of what has happened to that particular body. Anyways, this book is archaic compared to what they know now, so I am looking for a modern (post-modern?) read on the amazing human brain!"

The book was pretty easy to read, it's a short and basic introduction to the brain. It starts saying some things about the Cosmos, evolution and the brain itself. I recommend this book if you are new to the topic, because if you have more experience in the field, this book may seem too basic, though it doesn't make it less great, I really enjoyed it a lot. Lastly, it's important to know that the book it's a little bit old so some things may be wrong."

Evolutionary Anthropology rewritten for the masses, but still sometimes tedious and hard to follow; I found myself rereading several pages just to absorb all the information.

The subtitle is ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"",  but little in the book is about that topic. The book rambles from from one subject to another,from cute drawings by everyone's favorite: M.C. Escher,to the chemical composition of distant stars. Perhaps the most interesting part is the chart that shows  Brain mass vs. Body weight. On that chart moles rate quite highly.Probably not the point the author was trying to make. The next time I see a mole I'll watch for signs of intelligence. There are many tidbits of trivia, one is the fact , that the average person has a 10% chance of having a genetic mutation that can be passed on to the next generation. Needless to say, almost all of these are harmful."

See Robert Sapolsky's ""Human Behavioural Biology"" for a refutation of this.I also thought the book lacked a decent structure, and found its writing a bit rambing and unfocused.Thankfully, it wasn't that long...2 stars."
214,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey,4,Very good considering that Carl Sagan is writing outside of his field. Great speculations on the evolution of human/animal intelligence. Minus 1 star for being heavily outdated (originally published in 1977). I'll definitely be reading a more recent book on the same topic; written by a neuroscientist rather than an astrophysicist.
215,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33235645-ankan-paul,5,"A concise and exhaustive book of 250 odd pages depicting the exhilarating tale of the evolution of human intelligence, brachiating to exciting topics exploring the ""Cosmic Calendar"", the need for brains to evolve out of limitations in the gene pool, the fascinating abilities and amazing qualities of the human brain, the siphoning of the human brain to its pristine form with layers formed over ages on the reptilian brain, the hidden truths behind us emerging via evolution by natural selection as the dominating species from our arboreal ancestors, the promising thought process of our cousins- the chimps, the significance of dreams in the survival of our species, the striking differences between the two halves of our brains in information processing, the importance of extra-somatic knowledge storing (writing books!), a symbiotic future of human intelligence and machine/artificial intelligence, and finally ending with humanity's search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Who will say that Dr. Sagan wrote a book on a subject so far from his primary training, when every page is as replete with facts and contemporary neuro-science as it is with Dr. Sagan's profound speculations and conjectures? There is a reason why Dr. Carl Sagan is regarded as the teacher one always wished one had. I felt the same when I read the Cosmos, and since then made it my goal to read all his books. The Dragons of Eden is my second Carl Sagan read, and I must say I felt the same exhilaration while turning the pages that I felt while reading the Cosmos. To me, he is as good an artist as he is a scientist. His prose vividly portrays that. His own love for art, music, philosophy and every field that the human brain has produced is evident in his writings. And his appreciation is not just limited to the human species. His admiration encompasses the whole of the biodiversity on earth. And it is not just limited to the earth, it is for the whole cosmos. His writings have such a universal nature. When he writes, it seems he is writing for the whole species, on behalf of the whole world. Such a visionary! His writings makes one feel how small one's problems are in the grand scale of the ever expanding universe (or multiverse...who knows!).This book is no different. Subtitled ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"", the book does justice to the same. It is a fascinating tale of how we reached where we are today, with our connection to the reptiles (""dragons"") being embedded in the innermost core of our brains (the R-complex). Our brains have developed outwards since then, with more human like features being added in layers over the crudest core. There are exciting facts of how walking on two legs freed our hands to make tools, and to make better tools (hunting tools mostly, as that is only how we could have survived) better brains were a necessity. How our species massacred other primate species which showed signs of language (and hence a slight glimmer of intelligence) to ensure its survival. How our brain size is limited to the size of the pelvic cavity during child-birth. How there is a separation of functions in different locales of the brain and yet how our brains tend to be redundant with self-healing abilities. How there is a fight between the intuitive right half of the brain and the analytic/skeptic left half, and how that has led to the bias for the ""right""! I could go on listing all such beautiful stories put forth in the book. Besides recounting such tales and presenting the then recent developments in the field of neuro-science (split-brain experiments, experiments on understanding the localization of functions in the brain, those on deciphering the phenomenon of dreams, effects of neurotic drugs, surgeries on epileptic patients, studies on brain lesion of war soldiers, experiments on rat brains, etc), there are ample references to the myths and historical stories on the subjects, not to mention, the author's own rich and creative speculations, strewn all over the book, which grips the readers imagination and sends one spiraling down the ""what-if-that-is-true"" lane. The speculations were meant for contemporary and future scientists to work on. My favourite chapter from the book is ""The abstractions of beasts"" where Dr. Sagan presents all evidences of chimpanzee intelligence. Chimpanzees do have human like features, but how do you feel about human-like intelligence! Yes! I was really fascinated by the way Washoe, Lana or Lucy (the chimps) grasped the sign language taught to them and used it to communicate so effectively in such human-like manner. Imagine the idea of being able to talk to someone outside your species! The tales of the experiments that the author recounts is bound to touch your heart, make you really feel them. Language binds! The book is truly a gem. Dr. Sagan ploughs through the then recent developments in brain-studies, saturates the existing body of knowledge on the subject, lets loose his creative imagination, all the while weighing his words on a skeptic's scale, and brings forth this rich harvest for us commoners to enjoy. He stresses on the fact knowledge (""reason alloyed with intuition"" - the intelligence that has been so crucial in the survival and dominating nature of our species) is going to be the sole determinant of our race in the future, both for further development and to prevent self-destruction."

Considerava-me um fã de Carl Sagan porque conhecia o seu trabalho mas nunca lera nenhum livro da sua autoria nem vi ainda a famosa série Cosmos (cuja recriação brilhante de Neil DeGrasse Tyson é uma das minhas séries preferidas). Esta foi, portanto, a minha primeira experiência com um 'legado' de Sagan e que legado... Sinceramente, acho que não estava pronto para um trabalho tão genial como o que acabei de ler. Depois deste livro, acho que poderia ler Sagan explicar o ciclo de vida das minhocas com o máximo interesse imaginável. Quando dizem que ele é um apaixonado, um inspirador, um génio, um iluminado, um poeta... tudo isso é verdade e eu tive o prazer de comprovar nesta obra. Digo com toda a certeza (e tenho de pedir desculpa a Stephen Hawking neste aspeto, sem querer menosprezar a sua obra-prima) que este é o melhor livro de não-ficção que já li. Dei por mim a absorver todas as ""especulações"" de Sagan, a pensar nelas quando não estava a ler e a chegar a casa e escrever sobre o que havia lido e a fazer as minhas próprias ""especulações"". Tinha mesmo muita coisa para comentar sobre Os Dragões de Eden mas não me quero alongar nesta review.Quanto à escrita, especificamente falando, nada neste livro é muito técnico e o que se aproxima disso é explicado de forma transparente e de todo compreensível (com imagens esclarecedoras). É um trabalho de divulgação científica exemplar e inigualável.Queria deixar um excerto de um dos meus ""diários"" enquanto lia:""Eu estou a devorar e a adorar este livro, porque não é uma resposta a perguntas existentes, bem pelo contrário - é todo um conjunto de novas perguntas, teorias e suspeitas pertinentes sobre a inteligência humana (e animal). Perguntas que nunca teria imaginado que existiam e que eu tinha até ter lido este livro. Para mim esse é o maior legado com que fico. Já Neil DeGrasse Tyson dizia que, se pudesse perguntar qualquer coisa a uma entidade superior (que teria resposta qualquer que fosse a pergunta), a questão seria uma que ele ainda não conhecia neste momento porque questões mais fundamentais irão sempre surgir no futuro, questões que não imaginamos agora. (...) Vejo também a leitura deste livro como uma jornada de auto-conhecimento pois é de facto o nosso cérebro que é retratado nestas páginas. Este é tipo de livros que vale completamente a leitura e valerá uma releitura no futuro."" Por fim, deixo também um excerto do livro que me marcou desde logo e que demonstra também toda a capacidade de comunicação de Carl Sagan e a sua paixão pela ciência, vida e humanidade:""Como consequência das enormes transformações sociais e tecnológicas dos últimos séculos, o mundo não está a funcionar bem. Não vivemos em sociedades tradicionais e estáticas. Mas os nossos governos, ao resistirem à mudança, actuam como se tal acontecesse. A menos que nos venhamos a destruir totalmente, o futuro pertence às sociedades que, embora não ignorem o lado reptilineo e mamífero do nosso ser, permitem um desabrochar dos componentes caracteristicamente humanos da nossa natureza. Sociedades que encorajam a diversidade, e não o conformismo; sociedades que estejam dispostas a investir em recursos numa diversidade de experiências sociais, politicas, económicas e culturais, preparadas para sacrificar vantagens a curto prazo a benefícios a longo prazo; sociedades que tratem as novas ideias como vias delicadas, frágeis e imensamente valiosas que conduzem ao futuro."" (Carl Sagan, 1977)---Compared to the last books I picked up, I dare say that the expectations for this book were lower. I considered myself a fan of Carl Sagan because I knew his work but had never read any of his books or even seen the famous series Cosmos (whose brilliant recreation of Neil DeGrasse Tyson is one of my favorite series). This was, therefore, my first experience with a legacy of Sagan and what a legacy ... Honestly, I think I was not ready for such a brilliant work.After this book, I think I could read Sagan explaining the worm life cycle with the maximum interest imaginable. When they say that he's a passionate, an inspirer, a genius, an enlightened, a poet ... all this is true and I had the pleasure to prove it now.I say with certainty (and I have to apologize to Stephen Hawking in this respect, not wanting to belittle his masterpiece) that this is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. I absorbed all of Sagan's ""speculations"", I thought of them when I was not reading and I would get home and write about what I had read and to make my own ""speculations."" I had a lot to comment on The Dragons of Eden but I do not want to dwell on this review.As for writing, specifically speaking, nothing in this book is very technical and what comes close to it is explained in a transparent and comprehensible way (with enlightening images). It is an exemplary and unequaled scientific dissemination work.I wanted to leave here something I wrote about the book while reading it:""I am devouring and loving this book, because it's not a response to existing questions but quite the contrary - it's a whole set of new pertinent questions, theories, and suspicions about human (and animal) intelligence. Questions I would never have imagined existed and that I would never had if I didn't read this book. To me, that is the greatest legacy I got. Neil DeGrasse Tyson said that if he could ask anything to a superior entity (which would answer whatever the question was), the question Would be one he did not know at the moment because more fundamental questions will always arise in the future, questions that we can not imagine now ... I also see the reading of this book as a journey of self-knowledge because it is indeed our brain Which is portrayed in these pages.This is kind of a book that is worth reading completely and will be worth a re-reading in the future.Finally, I also leave a quote from the book that marked me from the beginning and also demonstrates all the capacity for communication of Carl Sagan and his passion for science, life and humanity:“As a consequence of the enormous social and technological changes of the last few centuries, the world is not working well. We do not live in traditional and static societies. But our government, in resisting change, act as if we did. Unless we destroy ourselves utterly, the future belongs to those societies that, while not ignoring the reptilian and mammalian parts of our being, enable the characteristically human components of our nature to flourish; to those societies that encourage diversity rather than conformity; to those societies willing to invest resources in a variety of social, political, economic and cultural experiments, and prepared to sacrifice short-term advantage for long-term benefit; to those societies that treat new ideas as delicate, fragile and immensely valuable pathways to the future.” (Carl Sagan, 1977)"
217,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"Carl Sagan's on a tear again. He can't stop himself, and you can't help cheering as you watch him go! He's a one man demonstration of evolution as a model for scientific method: cook up a whole lot of crazy mutant ideas and set them all free, unleash them on the World, and see which ones survive. ***Right now, he's working on the Mesozoic, and I'm along for the ride: we've got moronic dinos hunting mammals, which probably sleep all day as a defense mechanism ('cause they're too stupid to be quiet whilst being hunted) and cause ""the demise of the dinosaurs...by nocturnal predation on reptilian eggs. Two chicken eggs for breakfast may be all that is left... of this ancient mammalian cuisine."" This is classic Sagan, with some tenuous but imaginative hypothesis stretched to it's logical conclusion, and an insightful connection to bring it all home at the end. ***A stretched premise is one hallmark of science fiction writing, and I think Sagan's book fits the bill. He is Larry Niven and your favorite high school biology teacher rolled into one. But at the end what we get from Carl is a lot of fun stories and little more. Most are in the common cultural background (too many episodes of ""Cosmos"" perhaps?), but everyone is sure to come across a few delightful new anecdotes they hadn't previously heard: monkeys learning sign language, the endearing stupidities of midget brains,a naked Dr Louis Leaky outrunning his antelope, cannibal insectuous sex, Freud's work as a metaphor for our triply evolved and layered brain, (the reptilian hind brain naturally associated with the corporate board room: I liked that one!), the dad, divorced for cause of insomnia who retains custody of his genetically similar daughter, list goes on. This is all really good stuff and fast fun reading. ***But for all his fecundity, Sagan is not careful about the details of the ideas he sprays over the pages. His evolutionary reasoning is uncareful. Factors of 10 and 100 slip easily in and out in his calculation of brain power, the ratio of brain to body mass vs pure brain volume is a two edged sword he cuts in either direction as it suits him in different chapters, and so forth. He'll pause for air and disavow everything with a hand waving caution, ""just a hypothesis, now,"" but then he's off again. Waiter, I'll have whatever he's smoking. ***I once was teased with a variation on ""boundless youthful enthusiasm"" that transposed to: ""boundful useless enthusiasm"" and it comes, unbidden, to mind now. As an example of excitement overcoming rationality, the idea that an 8 Tonne T-rex, couldn't rouse itself from its numb stupor to prevent feral warm blooded whatevers from eating it's eggs is just an impossible stretch. (And, we can't help imagining the clever whatevers are our very own ancestors. Yeah! Go mammals!) OTOH, just considering the size and surface area, it is hard to imagine such big animals were not kept warm merely through metabolic inefficiency. THEY would have been the nocturnes, while we would have curled into furry balls at night, scampering between moribund overheating dinos during the hot lazy afternoons. Also, fur absorbs UV light, protecting our genetic blueprints from the supernova disaster that eradicated our scaly skinned competitors. ***Ok, ok, that's not in the book, I made it all up, but HE does it too! Yes, I know, HE'S Carl Sagan, and I'm not. ***We miss you Carl, - R.I.P. ***--------------Matt responded: I am curious to know what you think of some of the ""stretched premises"" towards the end. They attempt to apply his 'theories' on intelligence towards attitudes on social issues (computer intelligence, abortion, education, dream theory) and it all culminates in a direct insult of ""right-brain"" ideas diverging us from a utopia-by-intelligence. (Where intelligence is left-brain dominant).-------Ok done now, and my reply (to Matt) is that the book seemed to go out with a whimper, and I was neither opposed to nor enervated by, any of the last of it. I wanted cyborgs and computer super-minds, silicon immortality, x-ray vision and telepathy. Instead we got a pitch to fund wired classrooms and SETI. Ok already! ...I was hoping for more.I was not opposed because I agree with his thesis. Sagan is the consummate vampire slayer; he repudiates mystics of all sorts. Remember Sagan was (we must use the past tense not because he's dead but because, already, he represents a bygone era) still fighting Galileo's fight, one we only THINK is over because we live here: the battle of science against irrationality. REmember, Sagan thinks our right brain is responsible for brilliant flashes of insight, and art. I don't think he means the insult you apprehend.This takes us back to ZaTAoMM. Picture the misty past! The Epoch is BG (before Gates) and nerds are tolerated but joyfully reviled. Technology's evil, computers are laughable. People Do Not Believe ETI is out there and they're sure God is. The World is ruled by USSteel and PONG is the best and only computer game for heaven's sake!. It is hard for you guys to believe this shit (I call into context, regretfully, my advanced relative decrepitude, to remind that I am able to speak to you from the past, before your birth.) My point? It's a *real* battle that really needed to be fought, so we should forgive Sagan any overzealous driving home of the points. You need only think on the Texas and Kansas school systems to worry if the serpent's really truly been slain.Comments on some excellent vignettes towards the end:Witches dreaming of flying by reason of tripping on nightshade ~~ don't get me started! That they ""flew"" using broomsticks, well it's all merely hinted at, but if you listen close you can hear Carl snickering at his own jokes.Computers are conscious, or soon will be. I thought this especially cool, because it will at least be true so far as I can tell, and you can do NO BETTER! I mean, I can't *know* that you are conscious either, (solipsism) only that you're clever. So philosophically, once machines are clever, we may as well ascribe consciousness to them: it's only fair. Carl is very comfortable with this, with the proposition that consciousness is no more than the result of mere complexity, taken to a sufficient extreme. That's very well adjusted of him: I'm somebody who *wants* there to be more to me than there apparently is. (...and I make a lot more of this point than he bothers to.)Another excellent anecdote was Thoth railing against hieroglyphics as the calculators and video games of the age, certain to corrupt young minds which, relieved of the requirement to memorize everything, would grow indolent and weak. At this juncture, Carl reminds us how great written language is with a taunt that it allows an author to leap remotely off the page and into your brain! ...and across the chasm of death, too, I thought: a form of eternal life. For that instant I was again impressed with how very imaginatively Carl Sagan is able to think. So I'll respectfully say, ""No, I don't think it really sensible to imagine that Carl Sagan's prejudiced against the right brain."" To the contrary, he's All About right brain; his own is probably 50% bigger than the left.---------------------post script: as a companion to the chapter on right/left brain thinking I warmly recommend ""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" as a closely related romp through even further stretched conjectures of how our brain structure and thinking may be related.*** added 'cause Facebook publishes these without separating the paragraphs."

Is not an easy book, i know that Carl Sagan tried his best to make this book easy for non-biology experts, it would have been better if the info was some how more organized or more conclusive in some topics. If you are thrilled and interested in topics such as evolution, biology, human’s brain complexity and related topics this book is for you, do not expect a sciencie fiction novel. "
220,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96116134-sadat-issah,4,"First and foremost, it should be known that Carl Sagan is an amazing writer.Now about the book, as the title gives away, this book is a mixture of speculations and ideas backed by research about the evolution of human intelligence and other related topics.From reading reviews of people who are much acquainted with this field of study the general sentiment is that most of the ideas present in this book are outdated but still thinks it's worth your time(which i wholeheartedly agree)."
221,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34505232-pinskeyl,3,"Parts I found incredibly interesting and thought provoking and parts were so, so dull. Overall a solid 3. "

223,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57539558-noah-graham,3,Some of it is obsolete. But that makes Sagan more impressive. He correctly anticipated how computer technology would develop.

In the beginning, he kind of apologizes to the reader for embarking on such a speculative journey of the origins of mankind, but the stream of his thought is beyond convincing. For such a short read I learned a lot, and especially it made me consider non-human kinds of intelligence from a number of perspectives.I would love to read the updated version as so many things have changed since 40 years ago..."
226,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915487-corey,4,Carl Sagan had a beautiful mind. I would rate this book higher if I were smart enough to understand it all. 
227,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12379384-z-yasemin,5,Carl Sagan continues to impress me...
228,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9096819-simon,4,"I got around to reading this book after finding out that it's a foundational text for the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) movement, which Carl Sagan himself had a huge role in popularising: In ""Dragons of Eden"", Sagan gives laypeople a detailed explanation for how intelligence evolved here on Earth and hence clues for what to look for if they want to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.This book is very, very 1970s in many ways: As other reviewers have pointed out, the results of scientific research into neurobiology since its 1977 publishing date have falsified some of the ideas Sagans present here. There are also chapters where Sagan gets all starry-eyed and optimistic about computer technology's ability to improve human learning, to an extent that feels outright ridiculous to someone reading this in 2020. Despite all that, I am grateful for Sagan writing this book since it's difficult to find other books that present the basics of evolutionary biology, genetics and how the brain functions in this accessible a way to people who do not have an academic background in those scientific fields. It's even more impressive an achievement considering that the author is writing outside his own field of expertise - I doubt that Sam Harris could write as well about astrophysics as Carl Sagan does about neuroscience here!Much of the information presented here is also completely new to me, like how the different specialised parts of the brain have wildly varying proportions in different animal species depending on the animal's lifestyle - or how much easier it is to learn chimpanzees sign language than spoken language, to the point that chimpanzees can master sign language as well as humans. For me, the most interesting part of ""The Dragons of Eden"" has to be Sagan's explanation for how dreaming evolved: He theorises it's an evolutionary adaptation to make sure mammals stay asleep when hiding from nocturnal predators, and that the omnipresence of dragons and vampires in folklore and mythology around the world can be traced back to instincts evolved to help us avoid predatory dinosaurs and reptiles as well as nocturnal predators.I also quite like the psychedelic cover painting of an australopithecine Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden populated by dinosaurs, prehistoric rhinoceri and even scorpions - a painting that probably ended up spraypainted on quite a few VW Microbuses back in the 1970s."
229,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,3,"The book is fun and easy to read, but it doesn’t satisfy the incredible complexities of the subject. The book is a lot like a summary of what people knew about consciousness at the time of writing, plus reflection and speculations from Sagan. Having read many of Richard Dawkins’s books, I didn’t get much out of this, except an entertaining summary.Keep in mind that a lot has changed in the field of the subject since the book was written, and, again, it contains a lot of speculations by Sagan."
230,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101825144-tashaffi,5,Too many 'Mind freaking blown' moments in this book * _ *
231,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71398830-johnny-j,4,"This wasn't actually my first time reading Dragons of Eden, as I had to read it for a certain curriculum based assignment at a private school I attended a few years ago. I forget exactly why we read it, but I can remember that there was a focus on neuroscience and the early life of Earth in what we were learning. My teacher was also just a huge Sagan/popular science fanatic. I remember thinking the book was interesting, but I, more or less... skimmed it back then. Maybe I've matured (I don't really think so), but I wanted to pick it up again and actually process the information that Sagan blissfully bestows on the reader. There wasn't any pressing need for me to read Dragons of Eden, I just kind of saw it sitting on my bookshelf when I was making the reading challenge list for English class and thought it would be nice to re-read. Dragons of Eden is, more or less, chapters upon chapters of Carl Sagan's thoughts and discoveries on the brain and the human condition. From segments that literally give a calendar of the entirety of the universe's events, to chapters that focus solely on the learning capabilities of primates, to findings on the rare deformity of a ""split-brain"" in humans, Sagan provides an insane amount of information in a small book (there are exponentially more topics highlighted in Eden, those mentioned are just some examples). Each subject, while they may seem distantly related, builds on top of one another with various terminologies and fundamental concepts. His overall thesis is that human nature and the neural states of homo sapiens are filled with relics from the distant past, those relics still visible today. It's not often i'll go for something non-fiction, especially something in the field of neuroscience – the topic honestly being a little far removed from my interests. Despite this, found this book a joy to read (re-read), and it's actually made me more interested in neurology than I thought I could. Sagan makes the figurative tons of data in Eden extremely accessible and interesting, connecting each of his refined concepts to create a humble page turner. None of the information ever feels like it drags on at any point, as each chapter is short enough to get to the point without sacrificing any of the important details. It's really impressive how Sagan manages to create a book thats so jam-packed with information and still make it entertaining and accessible.One thing that is an obvious downside to this book is that some of the research and technological terms are outdated, and basically false at this point. This isn't to say that this book is all incorrect data, of course not, but having been released in 1977, there have definitely been some discoveries to prove some things in Eden wrong. This doesn't necessarily make Sagan's points less strong, however. His ideas and thoughts are still strong and poignant, even if some of the data is dated. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I think you'd be surprised at how much you'd enjoy it."
232,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13999805-greg-metcalf,5,"As I was reading this book again, since a first reading close to twenty years ago, a friend mentioned that if he was going to read a popular science book, he'd read a new one, not one from the seventies. That comment kind of got stuck in my head. It would certainly be interesting to read about how far sign language development with chimpanzees, for example, has come, which must have just gotten started when Sagan wrote about it here. But this book is Carl Sagan playing with possibilities. In a chapter on right and left hemisphere brain functioning, he suggests the possibility that the effect of marijuana might be to inhibit left brain reasoning giving the more intuitive right brain more influence over our thinking, which he compares to there always being stars above us but we need the dominant sun to set before they become visible. What a fascinating notion and how poetically stated. If anything Sagan writes about here has been disproven, he would be the first to say, Isn't this new evidence fascinating? We all wish Carl Sagan were alive and writing books about the cutting edge discoveries of today, but his creative thinking remains an inspiration. At one point, he was writing about how the written word manages to put the voice of someone else in your mind and wrote ""(Hello!)"" That alone made this well worth a second read. "
233,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571445-rajat-twit,4,"Not recommended for casual readers, this book is a very informative collection of amazing knowledge for the science enthusiasts. Expanding his knowledge from astrophysics to Biology, anthropology, evolutionary, history and upcoming scientific gadgets, Carl Sagan produces a wonderful literature on what may have been the case for the evolution of human intelligence. The book is a wonderful study of various aspects of human evolution and has given vivid and relevant examples for every point mentioned by Sagan. Not only Sagan is honest about the knowledge available at the time of writing the book, but predicts some wonderful future inventions for computer intelligence which we may see turning into reality today. His sharp predictions at the time of 1980s, which we may witness to becoming a reality, show that many of his speculations for the history of evolution may have many relevant points.The language is lucid and flawless, as is always in the case of Carl Sagan. He is not only one of the most significant science educator of 20 Century but is also a role model for many science enthusiasts. The voice that has ignited the minds of many scientists and engineers has proven through this book that people not from science background may become interested in Science, if science is presented in an entertaining and fun way!"

Not because it is dated, which it really is, but because the subtitle is utterly misleading. ""Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence"" do not actually occur in this book, which is far more concerned with the morphology of the human brain and the functions of its component parts; there is really nothing in this book about selective mechanisms or advantages, nothing about the huge metabolic costs of a 1400 cc brain, and little real discussion of the pressures driving the selection FOR increased encephalization. Nothing about evolution. Sorry, Carl ol' buddy, but this is a diatribe about brain function, quantitative measurements through vivisection experiments on all sorts of critters, and off-topic rambles about the ethics of abortion and extraterrestrial intelligence. This is a good read if you want to sound smart at a party, but that's about it."

I also consider the book for its date written, and amazed Sagan could foresee so many things coming to fruition in technology (such as cloning and everyone having multiple computers). It must have been even more amazing 35 plus years ago to see how much information our genes contain. Tackles issues regarding human brain has developed over time, its components, the differences in the evolution of man, reptiles vs. mammals, sleeping in both, dreams, mental illness, the likelihood of aliens, etc. Very cool topics then and today, imagine they will be for millions and billions of years to come."
236,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,3,"This book is dated, but good. I love reading about research on the human brain. Sagan makes lots of corny jokes and asides that are not really appropriate but sort of endearing. The evolution of the brain is the focus and Sagan talks a lot about the ""reptilian"" brain, the part that we had before we became human. Also the discussion of what really makes us human is so interesting. On the radio some modern researcher said that the brain is a record, a story of what has happened to that particular body. Anyways, this book is archaic compared to what they know now, so I am looking for a modern (post-modern?) read on the amazing human brain!"

The book was pretty easy to read, it's a short and basic introduction to the brain. It starts saying some things about the Cosmos, evolution and the brain itself. I recommend this book if you are new to the topic, because if you have more experience in the field, this book may seem too basic, though it doesn't make it less great, I really enjoyed it a lot. Lastly, it's important to know that the book it's a little bit old so some things may be wrong."

242,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,1,"The copy of the book I got was published in 1977 and what isn't out of date is wrong. The subtitle is ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"",  but little in the book is about that topic. The book rambles from from one subject to another,from cute drawings by everyone's favorite: M.C. Escher,to the chemical composition of distant stars. Perhaps the most interesting part is the chart that shows  Brain mass vs. Body weight. On that chart moles rate quite highly.Probably not the point the author was trying to make. The next time I see a mole I'll watch for signs of intelligence. There are many tidbits of trivia, one is the fact , that the average person has a 10% chance of having a genetic mutation that can be passed on to the next generation. Needless to say, almost all of these are harmful."
243,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,2,"Not one of Sagan's best books, IMHO.While this was not a bad book, I didn't find it overly stimulating or engaging, either.He talks about the cosmic calendar, left brain/right brain research, animal intelligence and other related topics.Some of Sagan's speculations about intelligence in here have now been disproved; ie - that chimps are capable of speech. See Robert Sapolsky's ""Human Behavioural Biology"" for a refutation of this.I also thought the book lacked a decent structure, and found its writing a bit rambing and unfocused.Thankfully, it wasn't that long...2 stars."
244,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey,4,Very good considering that Carl Sagan is writing outside of his field. Great speculations on the evolution of human/animal intelligence. Minus 1 star for being heavily outdated (originally published in 1977). I'll definitely be reading a more recent book on the same topic; written by a neuroscientist rather than an astrophysicist.
245,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33235645-ankan-paul,5,"A concise and exhaustive book of 250 odd pages depicting the exhilarating tale of the evolution of human intelligence, brachiating to exciting topics exploring the ""Cosmic Calendar"", the need for brains to evolve out of limitations in the gene pool, the fascinating abilities and amazing qualities of the human brain, the siphoning of the human brain to its pristine form with layers formed over ages on the reptilian brain, the hidden truths behind us emerging via evolution by natural selection as the dominating species from our arboreal ancestors, the promising thought process of our cousins- the chimps, the significance of dreams in the survival of our species, the striking differences between the two halves of our brains in information processing, the importance of extra-somatic knowledge storing (writing books!), a symbiotic future of human intelligence and machine/artificial intelligence, and finally ending with humanity's search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Who will say that Dr. Sagan wrote a book on a subject so far from his primary training, when every page is as replete with facts and contemporary neuro-science as it is with Dr. Sagan's profound speculations and conjectures? There is a reason why Dr. Carl Sagan is regarded as the teacher one always wished one had. I felt the same when I read the Cosmos, and since then made it my goal to read all his books. The Dragons of Eden is my second Carl Sagan read, and I must say I felt the same exhilaration while turning the pages that I felt while reading the Cosmos. To me, he is as good an artist as he is a scientist. His prose vividly portrays that. His own love for art, music, philosophy and every field that the human brain has produced is evident in his writings. And his appreciation is not just limited to the human species. His admiration encompasses the whole of the biodiversity on earth. And it is not just limited to the earth, it is for the whole cosmos. His writings have such a universal nature. When he writes, it seems he is writing for the whole species, on behalf of the whole world. Such a visionary! His writings makes one feel how small one's problems are in the grand scale of the ever expanding universe (or multiverse...who knows!).This book is no different. Subtitled ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"", the book does justice to the same. It is a fascinating tale of how we reached where we are today, with our connection to the reptiles (""dragons"") being embedded in the innermost core of our brains (the R-complex). Our brains have developed outwards since then, with more human like features being added in layers over the crudest core. There are exciting facts of how walking on two legs freed our hands to make tools, and to make better tools (hunting tools mostly, as that is only how we could have survived) better brains were a necessity. How our species massacred other primate species which showed signs of language (and hence a slight glimmer of intelligence) to ensure its survival. How our brain size is limited to the size of the pelvic cavity during child-birth. How there is a separation of functions in different locales of the brain and yet how our brains tend to be redundant with self-healing abilities. How there is a fight between the intuitive right half of the brain and the analytic/skeptic left half, and how that has led to the bias for the ""right""! I could go on listing all such beautiful stories put forth in the book. Besides recounting such tales and presenting the then recent developments in the field of neuro-science (split-brain experiments, experiments on understanding the localization of functions in the brain, those on deciphering the phenomenon of dreams, effects of neurotic drugs, surgeries on epileptic patients, studies on brain lesion of war soldiers, experiments on rat brains, etc), there are ample references to the myths and historical stories on the subjects, not to mention, the author's own rich and creative speculations, strewn all over the book, which grips the readers imagination and sends one spiraling down the ""what-if-that-is-true"" lane. The speculations were meant for contemporary and future scientists to work on. My favourite chapter from the book is ""The abstractions of beasts"" where Dr. Sagan presents all evidences of chimpanzee intelligence. Chimpanzees do have human like features, but how do you feel about human-like intelligence! Yes! I was really fascinated by the way Washoe, Lana or Lucy (the chimps) grasped the sign language taught to them and used it to communicate so effectively in such human-like manner. Imagine the idea of being able to talk to someone outside your species! The tales of the experiments that the author recounts is bound to touch your heart, make you really feel them. Language binds! The book is truly a gem. Dr. Sagan ploughs through the then recent developments in brain-studies, saturates the existing body of knowledge on the subject, lets loose his creative imagination, all the while weighing his words on a skeptic's scale, and brings forth this rich harvest for us commoners to enjoy. He stresses on the fact knowledge (""reason alloyed with intuition"" - the intelligence that has been so crucial in the survival and dominating nature of our species) is going to be the sole determinant of our race in the future, both for further development and to prevent self-destruction."
246,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57946842-ricardo-ari-sequeira,5,"Em comparação com os últimos livros que peguei, atrevo-me a dizer que as expetativas para este livro eram mais baixas. Considerava-me um fã de Carl Sagan porque conhecia o seu trabalho mas nunca lera nenhum livro da sua autoria nem vi ainda a famosa série Cosmos (cuja recriação brilhante de Neil DeGrasse Tyson é uma das minhas séries preferidas). Esta foi, portanto, a minha primeira experiência com um 'legado' de Sagan e que legado... Sinceramente, acho que não estava pronto para um trabalho tão genial como o que acabei de ler. Depois deste livro, acho que poderia ler Sagan explicar o ciclo de vida das minhocas com o máximo interesse imaginável. Quando dizem que ele é um apaixonado, um inspirador, um génio, um iluminado, um poeta... tudo isso é verdade e eu tive o prazer de comprovar nesta obra. Digo com toda a certeza (e tenho de pedir desculpa a Stephen Hawking neste aspeto, sem querer menosprezar a sua obra-prima) que este é o melhor livro de não-ficção que já li. Dei por mim a absorver todas as ""especulações"" de Sagan, a pensar nelas quando não estava a ler e a chegar a casa e escrever sobre o que havia lido e a fazer as minhas próprias ""especulações"". Tinha mesmo muita coisa para comentar sobre Os Dragões de Eden mas não me quero alongar nesta review.Quanto à escrita, especificamente falando, nada neste livro é muito técnico e o que se aproxima disso é explicado de forma transparente e de todo compreensível (com imagens esclarecedoras). É um trabalho de divulgação científica exemplar e inigualável.Queria deixar um excerto de um dos meus ""diários"" enquanto lia:""Eu estou a devorar e a adorar este livro, porque não é uma resposta a perguntas existentes, bem pelo contrário - é todo um conjunto de novas perguntas, teorias e suspeitas pertinentes sobre a inteligência humana (e animal). Perguntas que nunca teria imaginado que existiam e que eu tinha até ter lido este livro. Para mim esse é o maior legado com que fico. Já Neil DeGrasse Tyson dizia que, se pudesse perguntar qualquer coisa a uma entidade superior (que teria resposta qualquer que fosse a pergunta), a questão seria uma que ele ainda não conhecia neste momento porque questões mais fundamentais irão sempre surgir no futuro, questões que não imaginamos agora. (...) Vejo também a leitura deste livro como uma jornada de auto-conhecimento pois é de facto o nosso cérebro que é retratado nestas páginas. Este é tipo de livros que vale completamente a leitura e valerá uma releitura no futuro."" Por fim, deixo também um excerto do livro que me marcou desde logo e que demonstra também toda a capacidade de comunicação de Carl Sagan e a sua paixão pela ciência, vida e humanidade:""Como consequência das enormes transformações sociais e tecnológicas dos últimos séculos, o mundo não está a funcionar bem. Não vivemos em sociedades tradicionais e estáticas. Mas os nossos governos, ao resistirem à mudança, actuam como se tal acontecesse. A menos que nos venhamos a destruir totalmente, o futuro pertence às sociedades que, embora não ignorem o lado reptilineo e mamífero do nosso ser, permitem um desabrochar dos componentes caracteristicamente humanos da nossa natureza. Sociedades que encorajam a diversidade, e não o conformismo; sociedades que estejam dispostas a investir em recursos numa diversidade de experiências sociais, politicas, económicas e culturais, preparadas para sacrificar vantagens a curto prazo a benefícios a longo prazo; sociedades que tratem as novas ideias como vias delicadas, frágeis e imensamente valiosas que conduzem ao futuro."" (Carl Sagan, 1977)---Compared to the last books I picked up, I dare say that the expectations for this book were lower. I considered myself a fan of Carl Sagan because I knew his work but had never read any of his books or even seen the famous series Cosmos (whose brilliant recreation of Neil DeGrasse Tyson is one of my favorite series). This was, therefore, my first experience with a legacy of Sagan and what a legacy ... Honestly, I think I was not ready for such a brilliant work.After this book, I think I could read Sagan explaining the worm life cycle with the maximum interest imaginable. When they say that he's a passionate, an inspirer, a genius, an enlightened, a poet ... all this is true and I had the pleasure to prove it now.I say with certainty (and I have to apologize to Stephen Hawking in this respect, not wanting to belittle his masterpiece) that this is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. I absorbed all of Sagan's ""speculations"", I thought of them when I was not reading and I would get home and write about what I had read and to make my own ""speculations."" I had a lot to comment on The Dragons of Eden but I do not want to dwell on this review.As for writing, specifically speaking, nothing in this book is very technical and what comes close to it is explained in a transparent and comprehensible way (with enlightening images). It is an exemplary and unequaled scientific dissemination work.I wanted to leave here something I wrote about the book while reading it:""I am devouring and loving this book, because it's not a response to existing questions but quite the contrary - it's a whole set of new pertinent questions, theories, and suspicions about human (and animal) intelligence. Questions I would never have imagined existed and that I would never had if I didn't read this book. To me, that is the greatest legacy I got. Neil DeGrasse Tyson said that if he could ask anything to a superior entity (which would answer whatever the question was), the question Would be one he did not know at the moment because more fundamental questions will always arise in the future, questions that we can not imagine now ... I also see the reading of this book as a journey of self-knowledge because it is indeed our brain Which is portrayed in these pages.This is kind of a book that is worth reading completely and will be worth a re-reading in the future.Finally, I also leave a quote from the book that marked me from the beginning and also demonstrates all the capacity for communication of Carl Sagan and his passion for science, life and humanity:“As a consequence of the enormous social and technological changes of the last few centuries, the world is not working well. We do not live in traditional and static societies. But our government, in resisting change, act as if we did. Unless we destroy ourselves utterly, the future belongs to those societies that, while not ignoring the reptilian and mammalian parts of our being, enable the characteristically human components of our nature to flourish; to those societies that encourage diversity rather than conformity; to those societies willing to invest resources in a variety of social, political, economic and cultural experiments, and prepared to sacrifice short-term advantage for long-term benefit; to those societies that treat new ideas as delicate, fragile and immensely valuable pathways to the future.” (Carl Sagan, 1977)"
247,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"Carl Sagan's on a tear again. He can't stop himself, and you can't help cheering as you watch him go! He's a one man demonstration of evolution as a model for scientific method: cook up a whole lot of crazy mutant ideas and set them all free, unleash them on the World, and see which ones survive. ***Right now, he's working on the Mesozoic, and I'm along for the ride: we've got moronic dinos hunting mammals, which probably sleep all day as a defense mechanism ('cause they're too stupid to be quiet whilst being hunted) and cause ""the demise of the dinosaurs...by nocturnal predation on reptilian eggs. Two chicken eggs for breakfast may be all that is left... of this ancient mammalian cuisine."" This is classic Sagan, with some tenuous but imaginative hypothesis stretched to it's logical conclusion, and an insightful connection to bring it all home at the end. ***A stretched premise is one hallmark of science fiction writing, and I think Sagan's book fits the bill. He is Larry Niven and your favorite high school biology teacher rolled into one. But at the end what we get from Carl is a lot of fun stories and little more. Most are in the common cultural background (too many episodes of ""Cosmos"" perhaps?), but everyone is sure to come across a few delightful new anecdotes they hadn't previously heard: monkeys learning sign language, the endearing stupidities of midget brains,a naked Dr Louis Leaky outrunning his antelope, cannibal insectuous sex, Freud's work as a metaphor for our triply evolved and layered brain, (the reptilian hind brain naturally associated with the corporate board room: I liked that one!), the dad, divorced for cause of insomnia who retains custody of his genetically similar daughter, list goes on. This is all really good stuff and fast fun reading. ***But for all his fecundity, Sagan is not careful about the details of the ideas he sprays over the pages. His evolutionary reasoning is uncareful. Factors of 10 and 100 slip easily in and out in his calculation of brain power, the ratio of brain to body mass vs pure brain volume is a two edged sword he cuts in either direction as it suits him in different chapters, and so forth. He'll pause for air and disavow everything with a hand waving caution, ""just a hypothesis, now,"" but then he's off again. Waiter, I'll have whatever he's smoking. ***I once was teased with a variation on ""boundless youthful enthusiasm"" that transposed to: ""boundful useless enthusiasm"" and it comes, unbidden, to mind now. As an example of excitement overcoming rationality, the idea that an 8 Tonne T-rex, couldn't rouse itself from its numb stupor to prevent feral warm blooded whatevers from eating it's eggs is just an impossible stretch. (And, we can't help imagining the clever whatevers are our very own ancestors. Yeah! Go mammals!) OTOH, just considering the size and surface area, it is hard to imagine such big animals were not kept warm merely through metabolic inefficiency. THEY would have been the nocturnes, while we would have curled into furry balls at night, scampering between moribund overheating dinos during the hot lazy afternoons. Also, fur absorbs UV light, protecting our genetic blueprints from the supernova disaster that eradicated our scaly skinned competitors. ***Ok, ok, that's not in the book, I made it all up, but HE does it too! Yes, I know, HE'S Carl Sagan, and I'm not. ***We miss you Carl, - R.I.P. ***--------------Matt responded: I am curious to know what you think of some of the ""stretched premises"" towards the end. They attempt to apply his 'theories' on intelligence towards attitudes on social issues (computer intelligence, abortion, education, dream theory) and it all culminates in a direct insult of ""right-brain"" ideas diverging us from a utopia-by-intelligence. (Where intelligence is left-brain dominant).-------Ok done now, and my reply (to Matt) is that the book seemed to go out with a whimper, and I was neither opposed to nor enervated by, any of the last of it. I wanted cyborgs and computer super-minds, silicon immortality, x-ray vision and telepathy. Instead we got a pitch to fund wired classrooms and SETI. Ok already! ...I was hoping for more.I was not opposed because I agree with his thesis. Sagan is the consummate vampire slayer; he repudiates mystics of all sorts. Remember Sagan was (we must use the past tense not because he's dead but because, already, he represents a bygone era) still fighting Galileo's fight, one we only THINK is over because we live here: the battle of science against irrationality. REmember, Sagan thinks our right brain is responsible for brilliant flashes of insight, and art. I don't think he means the insult you apprehend.This takes us back to ZaTAoMM. Picture the misty past! The Epoch is BG (before Gates) and nerds are tolerated but joyfully reviled. Technology's evil, computers are laughable. People Do Not Believe ETI is out there and they're sure God is. The World is ruled by USSteel and PONG is the best and only computer game for heaven's sake!. It is hard for you guys to believe this shit (I call into context, regretfully, my advanced relative decrepitude, to remind that I am able to speak to you from the past, before your birth.) My point? It's a *real* battle that really needed to be fought, so we should forgive Sagan any overzealous driving home of the points. You need only think on the Texas and Kansas school systems to worry if the serpent's really truly been slain.Comments on some excellent vignettes towards the end:Witches dreaming of flying by reason of tripping on nightshade ~~ don't get me started! That they ""flew"" using broomsticks, well it's all merely hinted at, but if you listen close you can hear Carl snickering at his own jokes.Computers are conscious, or soon will be. I thought this especially cool, because it will at least be true so far as I can tell, and you can do NO BETTER! I mean, I can't *know* that you are conscious either, (solipsism) only that you're clever. So philosophically, once machines are clever, we may as well ascribe consciousness to them: it's only fair. Carl is very comfortable with this, with the proposition that consciousness is no more than the result of mere complexity, taken to a sufficient extreme. That's very well adjusted of him: I'm somebody who *wants* there to be more to me than there apparently is. (...and I make a lot more of this point than he bothers to.)Another excellent anecdote was Thoth railing against hieroglyphics as the calculators and video games of the age, certain to corrupt young minds which, relieved of the requirement to memorize everything, would grow indolent and weak. At this juncture, Carl reminds us how great written language is with a taunt that it allows an author to leap remotely off the page and into your brain! ...and across the chasm of death, too, I thought: a form of eternal life. For that instant I was again impressed with how very imaginatively Carl Sagan is able to think. So I'll respectfully say, ""No, I don't think it really sensible to imagine that Carl Sagan's prejudiced against the right brain."" To the contrary, he's All About right brain; his own is probably 50% bigger than the left.---------------------post script: as a companion to the chapter on right/left brain thinking I warmly recommend ""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" as a closely related romp through even further stretched conjectures of how our brain structure and thinking may be related.*** added 'cause Facebook publishes these without separating the paragraphs."

Is not an easy book, i know that Carl Sagan tried his best to make this book easy for non-biology experts, it would have been better if the info was some how more organized or more conclusive in some topics. If you are thrilled and interested in topics such as evolution, biology, human’s brain complexity and related topics this book is for you, do not expect a sciencie fiction novel. "

For such a short read I learned a lot, and especially it made me consider non-human kinds of intelligence from a number of perspectives.I would love to read the updated version as so many things have changed since 40 years ago..."
256,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915487-corey,4,Carl Sagan had a beautiful mind. I would rate this book higher if I were smart enough to understand it all. 
257,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12379384-z-yasemin,5,Carl Sagan continues to impress me...
258,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9096819-simon,4,"I got around to reading this book after finding out that it's a foundational text for the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) movement, which Carl Sagan himself had a huge role in popularising: In ""Dragons of Eden"", Sagan gives laypeople a detailed explanation for how intelligence evolved here on Earth and hence clues for what to look for if they want to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.This book is very, very 1970s in many ways: As other reviewers have pointed out, the results of scientific research into neurobiology since its 1977 publishing date have falsified some of the ideas Sagans present here. There are also chapters where Sagan gets all starry-eyed and optimistic about computer technology's ability to improve human learning, to an extent that feels outright ridiculous to someone reading this in 2020. Despite all that, I am grateful for Sagan writing this book since it's difficult to find other books that present the basics of evolutionary biology, genetics and how the brain functions in this accessible a way to people who do not have an academic background in those scientific fields. It's even more impressive an achievement considering that the author is writing outside his own field of expertise - I doubt that Sam Harris could write as well about astrophysics as Carl Sagan does about neuroscience here!Much of the information presented here is also completely new to me, like how the different specialised parts of the brain have wildly varying proportions in different animal species depending on the animal's lifestyle - or how much easier it is to learn chimpanzees sign language than spoken language, to the point that chimpanzees can master sign language as well as humans. For me, the most interesting part of ""The Dragons of Eden"" has to be Sagan's explanation for how dreaming evolved: He theorises it's an evolutionary adaptation to make sure mammals stay asleep when hiding from nocturnal predators, and that the omnipresence of dragons and vampires in folklore and mythology around the world can be traced back to instincts evolved to help us avoid predatory dinosaurs and reptiles as well as nocturnal predators.I also quite like the psychedelic cover painting of an australopithecine Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden populated by dinosaurs, prehistoric rhinoceri and even scorpions - a painting that probably ended up spraypainted on quite a few VW Microbuses back in the 1970s."

The book is a lot like a summary of what people knew about consciousness at the time of writing, plus reflection and speculations from Sagan. Having read many of Richard Dawkins’s books, I didn’t get much out of this, except an entertaining summary.Keep in mind that a lot has changed in the field of the subject since the book was written, and, again, it contains a lot of speculations by Sagan."

261,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71398830-johnny-j,4,"This wasn't actually my first time reading Dragons of Eden, as I had to read it for a certain curriculum based assignment at a private school I attended a few years ago. I forget exactly why we read it, but I can remember that there was a focus on neuroscience and the early life of Earth in what we were learning. My teacher was also just a huge Sagan/popular science fanatic. I remember thinking the book was interesting, but I, more or less... skimmed it back then. Maybe I've matured (I don't really think so), but I wanted to pick it up again and actually process the information that Sagan blissfully bestows on the reader. There wasn't any pressing need for me to read Dragons of Eden, I just kind of saw it sitting on my bookshelf when I was making the reading challenge list for English class and thought it would be nice to re-read. Dragons of Eden is, more or less, chapters upon chapters of Carl Sagan's thoughts and discoveries on the brain and the human condition. From segments that literally give a calendar of the entirety of the universe's events, to chapters that focus solely on the learning capabilities of primates, to findings on the rare deformity of a ""split-brain"" in humans, Sagan provides an insane amount of information in a small book (there are exponentially more topics highlighted in Eden, those mentioned are just some examples). Each subject, while they may seem distantly related, builds on top of one another with various terminologies and fundamental concepts. His overall thesis is that human nature and the neural states of homo sapiens are filled with relics from the distant past, those relics still visible today. It's not often i'll go for something non-fiction, especially something in the field of neuroscience – the topic honestly being a little far removed from my interests. Despite this, found this book a joy to read (re-read), and it's actually made me more interested in neurology than I thought I could. Sagan makes the figurative tons of data in Eden extremely accessible and interesting, connecting each of his refined concepts to create a humble page turner. None of the information ever feels like it drags on at any point, as each chapter is short enough to get to the point without sacrificing any of the important details. It's really impressive how Sagan manages to create a book thats so jam-packed with information and still make it entertaining and accessible.One thing that is an obvious downside to this book is that some of the research and technological terms are outdated, and basically false at this point. This isn't to say that this book is all incorrect data, of course not, but having been released in 1977, there have definitely been some discoveries to prove some things in Eden wrong. This doesn't necessarily make Sagan's points less strong, however. His ideas and thoughts are still strong and poignant, even if some of the data is dated. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I think you'd be surprised at how much you'd enjoy it."
262,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13999805-greg-metcalf,5,"As I was reading this book again, since a first reading close to twenty years ago, a friend mentioned that if he was going to read a popular science book, he'd read a new one, not one from the seventies. That comment kind of got stuck in my head. It would certainly be interesting to read about how far sign language development with chimpanzees, for example, has come, which must have just gotten started when Sagan wrote about it here. But this book is Carl Sagan playing with possibilities. In a chapter on right and left hemisphere brain functioning, he suggests the possibility that the effect of marijuana might be to inhibit left brain reasoning giving the more intuitive right brain more influence over our thinking, which he compares to there always being stars above us but we need the dominant sun to set before they become visible. What a fascinating notion and how poetically stated. If anything Sagan writes about here has been disproven, he would be the first to say, Isn't this new evidence fascinating? We all wish Carl Sagan were alive and writing books about the cutting edge discoveries of today, but his creative thinking remains an inspiration. At one point, he was writing about how the written word manages to put the voice of someone else in your mind and wrote ""(Hello!)"" That alone made this well worth a second read. "
263,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571445-rajat-twit,4,"Not recommended for casual readers, this book is a very informative collection of amazing knowledge for the science enthusiasts. Expanding his knowledge from astrophysics to Biology, anthropology, evolutionary, history and upcoming scientific gadgets, Carl Sagan produces a wonderful literature on what may have been the case for the evolution of human intelligence. The book is a wonderful study of various aspects of human evolution and has given vivid and relevant examples for every point mentioned by Sagan. Not only Sagan is honest about the knowledge available at the time of writing the book, but predicts some wonderful future inventions for computer intelligence which we may see turning into reality today. His sharp predictions at the time of 1980s, which we may witness to becoming a reality, show that many of his speculations for the history of evolution may have many relevant points.The language is lucid and flawless, as is always in the case of Carl Sagan. He is not only one of the most significant science educator of 20 Century but is also a role model for many science enthusiasts. The voice that has ignited the minds of many scientists and engineers has proven through this book that people not from science background may become interested in Science, if science is presented in an entertaining and fun way!"

Not because it is dated, which it really is, but because the subtitle is utterly misleading. ""Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence"" do not actually occur in this book, which is far more concerned with the morphology of the human brain and the functions of its component parts; there is really nothing in this book about selective mechanisms or advantages, nothing about the huge metabolic costs of a 1400 cc brain, and little real discussion of the pressures driving the selection FOR increased encephalization. Nothing about evolution. Sorry, Carl ol' buddy, but this is a diatribe about brain function, quantitative measurements through vivisection experiments on all sorts of critters, and off-topic rambles about the ethics of abortion and extraterrestrial intelligence. This is a good read if you want to sound smart at a party, but that's about it."
265,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19488978-trey-nowell,4,"Pretty interesting book overall, did tend to go from one topic to another and then come back to the topic with a tiny bit of rambling. I also consider the book for its date written, and amazed Sagan could foresee so many things coming to fruition in technology (such as cloning and everyone having multiple computers). It must have been even more amazing 35 plus years ago to see how much information our genes contain. Tackles issues regarding human brain has developed over time, its components, the differences in the evolution of man, reptiles vs. mammals, sleeping in both, dreams, mental illness, the likelihood of aliens, etc. Very cool topics then and today, imagine they will be for millions and billions of years to come."
266,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,3,"This book is dated, but good. I love reading about research on the human brain. Sagan makes lots of corny jokes and asides that are not really appropriate but sort of endearing. The evolution of the brain is the focus and Sagan talks a lot about the ""reptilian"" brain, the part that we had before we became human. Also the discussion of what really makes us human is so interesting. On the radio some modern researcher said that the brain is a record, a story of what has happened to that particular body. Anyways, this book is archaic compared to what they know now, so I am looking for a modern (post-modern?) read on the amazing human brain!"

The book was pretty easy to read, it's a short and basic introduction to the brain. It starts saying some things about the Cosmos, evolution and the brain itself. I recommend this book if you are new to the topic, because if you have more experience in the field, this book may seem too basic, though it doesn't make it less great, I really enjoyed it a lot. Lastly, it's important to know that the book it's a little bit old so some things may be wrong."

You may find yourself not too proud to be human, as the origins of our much-touted intellegence which separates us from the beasts comes into focus. Evolutionary Anthropology rewritten for the masses, but still sometimes tedious and hard to follow; I found myself rereading several pages just to absorb all the information. I'm looking forward to more Sagan, as I have collected a number which I have not yet opened."

271,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90956220-alexander-schach,5,"This books is bloody amazing. Carl Sagan always write with genuine wonder, curiosity and humbleness. Here he examines humanity from a lot of different interesting angles, everything between cosmology, history, biology and morality. Here is something that will touch everyone. In my case i was especially fascinated with the chapter on cross species communication, but every single chapter is insanely intriguing. "
272,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,1,"The copy of the book I got was published in 1977 and what isn't out of date is wrong. The subtitle is ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"",  but little in the book is about that topic. The book rambles from from one subject to another,from cute drawings by everyone's favorite: M.C. Escher,to the chemical composition of distant stars. Perhaps the most interesting part is the chart that shows  Brain mass vs. Body weight. On that chart moles rate quite highly.Probably not the point the author was trying to make. The next time I see a mole I'll watch for signs of intelligence. There are many tidbits of trivia, one is the fact , that the average person has a 10% chance of having a genetic mutation that can be passed on to the next generation. Needless to say, almost all of these are harmful."
273,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,2,"Not one of Sagan's best books, IMHO.While this was not a bad book, I didn't find it overly stimulating or engaging, either.He talks about the cosmic calendar, left brain/right brain research, animal intelligence and other related topics.Some of Sagan's speculations about intelligence in here have now been disproved; ie - that chimps are capable of speech. See Robert Sapolsky's ""Human Behavioural Biology"" for a refutation of this.I also thought the book lacked a decent structure, and found its writing a bit rambing and unfocused.Thankfully, it wasn't that long...2 stars."
274,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey,4,Very good considering that Carl Sagan is writing outside of his field. Great speculations on the evolution of human/animal intelligence. Minus 1 star for being heavily outdated (originally published in 1977). I'll definitely be reading a more recent book on the same topic; written by a neuroscientist rather than an astrophysicist.
275,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33235645-ankan-paul,5,"A concise and exhaustive book of 250 odd pages depicting the exhilarating tale of the evolution of human intelligence, brachiating to exciting topics exploring the ""Cosmic Calendar"", the need for brains to evolve out of limitations in the gene pool, the fascinating abilities and amazing qualities of the human brain, the siphoning of the human brain to its pristine form with layers formed over ages on the reptilian brain, the hidden truths behind us emerging via evolution by natural selection as the dominating species from our arboreal ancestors, the promising thought process of our cousins- the chimps, the significance of dreams in the survival of our species, the striking differences between the two halves of our brains in information processing, the importance of extra-somatic knowledge storing (writing books!), a symbiotic future of human intelligence and machine/artificial intelligence, and finally ending with humanity's search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Who will say that Dr. Sagan wrote a book on a subject so far from his primary training, when every page is as replete with facts and contemporary neuro-science as it is with Dr. Sagan's profound speculations and conjectures? There is a reason why Dr. Carl Sagan is regarded as the teacher one always wished one had. I felt the same when I read the Cosmos, and since then made it my goal to read all his books. The Dragons of Eden is my second Carl Sagan read, and I must say I felt the same exhilaration while turning the pages that I felt while reading the Cosmos. To me, he is as good an artist as he is a scientist. His prose vividly portrays that. His own love for art, music, philosophy and every field that the human brain has produced is evident in his writings. And his appreciation is not just limited to the human species. His admiration encompasses the whole of the biodiversity on earth. And it is not just limited to the earth, it is for the whole cosmos. His writings have such a universal nature. When he writes, it seems he is writing for the whole species, on behalf of the whole world. Such a visionary! His writings makes one feel how small one's problems are in the grand scale of the ever expanding universe (or multiverse...who knows!).This book is no different. Subtitled ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"", the book does justice to the same. It is a fascinating tale of how we reached where we are today, with our connection to the reptiles (""dragons"") being embedded in the innermost core of our brains (the R-complex). Our brains have developed outwards since then, with more human like features being added in layers over the crudest core. There are exciting facts of how walking on two legs freed our hands to make tools, and to make better tools (hunting tools mostly, as that is only how we could have survived) better brains were a necessity. How our species massacred other primate species which showed signs of language (and hence a slight glimmer of intelligence) to ensure its survival. How our brain size is limited to the size of the pelvic cavity during child-birth. How there is a separation of functions in different locales of the brain and yet how our brains tend to be redundant with self-healing abilities. How there is a fight between the intuitive right half of the brain and the analytic/skeptic left half, and how that has led to the bias for the ""right""! I could go on listing all such beautiful stories put forth in the book. Besides recounting such tales and presenting the then recent developments in the field of neuro-science (split-brain experiments, experiments on understanding the localization of functions in the brain, those on deciphering the phenomenon of dreams, effects of neurotic drugs, surgeries on epileptic patients, studies on brain lesion of war soldiers, experiments on rat brains, etc), there are ample references to the myths and historical stories on the subjects, not to mention, the author's own rich and creative speculations, strewn all over the book, which grips the readers imagination and sends one spiraling down the ""what-if-that-is-true"" lane. The speculations were meant for contemporary and future scientists to work on. My favourite chapter from the book is ""The abstractions of beasts"" where Dr. Sagan presents all evidences of chimpanzee intelligence. Chimpanzees do have human like features, but how do you feel about human-like intelligence! Yes! I was really fascinated by the way Washoe, Lana or Lucy (the chimps) grasped the sign language taught to them and used it to communicate so effectively in such human-like manner. Imagine the idea of being able to talk to someone outside your species! The tales of the experiments that the author recounts is bound to touch your heart, make you really feel them. Language binds! The book is truly a gem. Dr. Sagan ploughs through the then recent developments in brain-studies, saturates the existing body of knowledge on the subject, lets loose his creative imagination, all the while weighing his words on a skeptic's scale, and brings forth this rich harvest for us commoners to enjoy. He stresses on the fact knowledge (""reason alloyed with intuition"" - the intelligence that has been so crucial in the survival and dominating nature of our species) is going to be the sole determinant of our race in the future, both for further development and to prevent self-destruction."
276,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57946842-ricardo-ari-sequeira,5,"Em comparação com os últimos livros que peguei, atrevo-me a dizer que as expetativas para este livro eram mais baixas. Considerava-me um fã de Carl Sagan porque conhecia o seu trabalho mas nunca lera nenhum livro da sua autoria nem vi ainda a famosa série Cosmos (cuja recriação brilhante de Neil DeGrasse Tyson é uma das minhas séries preferidas). Esta foi, portanto, a minha primeira experiência com um 'legado' de Sagan e que legado... Sinceramente, acho que não estava pronto para um trabalho tão genial como o que acabei de ler. Depois deste livro, acho que poderia ler Sagan explicar o ciclo de vida das minhocas com o máximo interesse imaginável. Quando dizem que ele é um apaixonado, um inspirador, um génio, um iluminado, um poeta... tudo isso é verdade e eu tive o prazer de comprovar nesta obra. Digo com toda a certeza (e tenho de pedir desculpa a Stephen Hawking neste aspeto, sem querer menosprezar a sua obra-prima) que este é o melhor livro de não-ficção que já li. Dei por mim a absorver todas as ""especulações"" de Sagan, a pensar nelas quando não estava a ler e a chegar a casa e escrever sobre o que havia lido e a fazer as minhas próprias ""especulações"". Tinha mesmo muita coisa para comentar sobre Os Dragões de Eden mas não me quero alongar nesta review.Quanto à escrita, especificamente falando, nada neste livro é muito técnico e o que se aproxima disso é explicado de forma transparente e de todo compreensível (com imagens esclarecedoras). É um trabalho de divulgação científica exemplar e inigualável.Queria deixar um excerto de um dos meus ""diários"" enquanto lia:""Eu estou a devorar e a adorar este livro, porque não é uma resposta a perguntas existentes, bem pelo contrário - é todo um conjunto de novas perguntas, teorias e suspeitas pertinentes sobre a inteligência humana (e animal). Perguntas que nunca teria imaginado que existiam e que eu tinha até ter lido este livro. Para mim esse é o maior legado com que fico. Já Neil DeGrasse Tyson dizia que, se pudesse perguntar qualquer coisa a uma entidade superior (que teria resposta qualquer que fosse a pergunta), a questão seria uma que ele ainda não conhecia neste momento porque questões mais fundamentais irão sempre surgir no futuro, questões que não imaginamos agora. (...) Vejo também a leitura deste livro como uma jornada de auto-conhecimento pois é de facto o nosso cérebro que é retratado nestas páginas. Este é tipo de livros que vale completamente a leitura e valerá uma releitura no futuro."" Por fim, deixo também um excerto do livro que me marcou desde logo e que demonstra também toda a capacidade de comunicação de Carl Sagan e a sua paixão pela ciência, vida e humanidade:""Como consequência das enormes transformações sociais e tecnológicas dos últimos séculos, o mundo não está a funcionar bem. Não vivemos em sociedades tradicionais e estáticas. Mas os nossos governos, ao resistirem à mudança, actuam como se tal acontecesse. A menos que nos venhamos a destruir totalmente, o futuro pertence às sociedades que, embora não ignorem o lado reptilineo e mamífero do nosso ser, permitem um desabrochar dos componentes caracteristicamente humanos da nossa natureza. Sociedades que encorajam a diversidade, e não o conformismo; sociedades que estejam dispostas a investir em recursos numa diversidade de experiências sociais, politicas, económicas e culturais, preparadas para sacrificar vantagens a curto prazo a benefícios a longo prazo; sociedades que tratem as novas ideias como vias delicadas, frágeis e imensamente valiosas que conduzem ao futuro."" (Carl Sagan, 1977)---Compared to the last books I picked up, I dare say that the expectations for this book were lower. I considered myself a fan of Carl Sagan because I knew his work but had never read any of his books or even seen the famous series Cosmos (whose brilliant recreation of Neil DeGrasse Tyson is one of my favorite series). This was, therefore, my first experience with a legacy of Sagan and what a legacy ... Honestly, I think I was not ready for such a brilliant work.After this book, I think I could read Sagan explaining the worm life cycle with the maximum interest imaginable. When they say that he's a passionate, an inspirer, a genius, an enlightened, a poet ... all this is true and I had the pleasure to prove it now.I say with certainty (and I have to apologize to Stephen Hawking in this respect, not wanting to belittle his masterpiece) that this is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. I absorbed all of Sagan's ""speculations"", I thought of them when I was not reading and I would get home and write about what I had read and to make my own ""speculations."" I had a lot to comment on The Dragons of Eden but I do not want to dwell on this review.As for writing, specifically speaking, nothing in this book is very technical and what comes close to it is explained in a transparent and comprehensible way (with enlightening images). It is an exemplary and unequaled scientific dissemination work.I wanted to leave here something I wrote about the book while reading it:""I am devouring and loving this book, because it's not a response to existing questions but quite the contrary - it's a whole set of new pertinent questions, theories, and suspicions about human (and animal) intelligence. Questions I would never have imagined existed and that I would never had if I didn't read this book. To me, that is the greatest legacy I got. Neil DeGrasse Tyson said that if he could ask anything to a superior entity (which would answer whatever the question was), the question Would be one he did not know at the moment because more fundamental questions will always arise in the future, questions that we can not imagine now ... I also see the reading of this book as a journey of self-knowledge because it is indeed our brain Which is portrayed in these pages.This is kind of a book that is worth reading completely and will be worth a re-reading in the future.Finally, I also leave a quote from the book that marked me from the beginning and also demonstrates all the capacity for communication of Carl Sagan and his passion for science, life and humanity:“As a consequence of the enormous social and technological changes of the last few centuries, the world is not working well. We do not live in traditional and static societies. But our government, in resisting change, act as if we did. Unless we destroy ourselves utterly, the future belongs to those societies that, while not ignoring the reptilian and mammalian parts of our being, enable the characteristically human components of our nature to flourish; to those societies that encourage diversity rather than conformity; to those societies willing to invest resources in a variety of social, political, economic and cultural experiments, and prepared to sacrifice short-term advantage for long-term benefit; to those societies that treat new ideas as delicate, fragile and immensely valuable pathways to the future.” (Carl Sagan, 1977)"
277,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"Carl Sagan's on a tear again. He can't stop himself, and you can't help cheering as you watch him go! He's a one man demonstration of evolution as a model for scientific method: cook up a whole lot of crazy mutant ideas and set them all free, unleash them on the World, and see which ones survive. ***Right now, he's working on the Mesozoic, and I'm along for the ride: we've got moronic dinos hunting mammals, which probably sleep all day as a defense mechanism ('cause they're too stupid to be quiet whilst being hunted) and cause ""the demise of the dinosaurs...by nocturnal predation on reptilian eggs. Two chicken eggs for breakfast may be all that is left... of this ancient mammalian cuisine."" This is classic Sagan, with some tenuous but imaginative hypothesis stretched to it's logical conclusion, and an insightful connection to bring it all home at the end. ***A stretched premise is one hallmark of science fiction writing, and I think Sagan's book fits the bill. He is Larry Niven and your favorite high school biology teacher rolled into one. But at the end what we get from Carl is a lot of fun stories and little more. Most are in the common cultural background (too many episodes of ""Cosmos"" perhaps?), but everyone is sure to come across a few delightful new anecdotes they hadn't previously heard: monkeys learning sign language, the endearing stupidities of midget brains,a naked Dr Louis Leaky outrunning his antelope, cannibal insectuous sex, Freud's work as a metaphor for our triply evolved and layered brain, (the reptilian hind brain naturally associated with the corporate board room: I liked that one!), the dad, divorced for cause of insomnia who retains custody of his genetically similar daughter, list goes on. This is all really good stuff and fast fun reading. ***But for all his fecundity, Sagan is not careful about the details of the ideas he sprays over the pages. His evolutionary reasoning is uncareful. Factors of 10 and 100 slip easily in and out in his calculation of brain power, the ratio of brain to body mass vs pure brain volume is a two edged sword he cuts in either direction as it suits him in different chapters, and so forth. He'll pause for air and disavow everything with a hand waving caution, ""just a hypothesis, now,"" but then he's off again. Waiter, I'll have whatever he's smoking. ***I once was teased with a variation on ""boundless youthful enthusiasm"" that transposed to: ""boundful useless enthusiasm"" and it comes, unbidden, to mind now. As an example of excitement overcoming rationality, the idea that an 8 Tonne T-rex, couldn't rouse itself from its numb stupor to prevent feral warm blooded whatevers from eating it's eggs is just an impossible stretch. (And, we can't help imagining the clever whatevers are our very own ancestors. Yeah! Go mammals!) OTOH, just considering the size and surface area, it is hard to imagine such big animals were not kept warm merely through metabolic inefficiency. THEY would have been the nocturnes, while we would have curled into furry balls at night, scampering between moribund overheating dinos during the hot lazy afternoons. Also, fur absorbs UV light, protecting our genetic blueprints from the supernova disaster that eradicated our scaly skinned competitors. ***Ok, ok, that's not in the book, I made it all up, but HE does it too! Yes, I know, HE'S Carl Sagan, and I'm not. ***We miss you Carl, - R.I.P. ***--------------Matt responded: I am curious to know what you think of some of the ""stretched premises"" towards the end. They attempt to apply his 'theories' on intelligence towards attitudes on social issues (computer intelligence, abortion, education, dream theory) and it all culminates in a direct insult of ""right-brain"" ideas diverging us from a utopia-by-intelligence. (Where intelligence is left-brain dominant).-------Ok done now, and my reply (to Matt) is that the book seemed to go out with a whimper, and I was neither opposed to nor enervated by, any of the last of it. I wanted cyborgs and computer super-minds, silicon immortality, x-ray vision and telepathy. Instead we got a pitch to fund wired classrooms and SETI. Ok already! ...I was hoping for more.I was not opposed because I agree with his thesis. Sagan is the consummate vampire slayer; he repudiates mystics of all sorts. Remember Sagan was (we must use the past tense not because he's dead but because, already, he represents a bygone era) still fighting Galileo's fight, one we only THINK is over because we live here: the battle of science against irrationality. REmember, Sagan thinks our right brain is responsible for brilliant flashes of insight, and art. I don't think he means the insult you apprehend.This takes us back to ZaTAoMM. Picture the misty past! The Epoch is BG (before Gates) and nerds are tolerated but joyfully reviled. Technology's evil, computers are laughable. People Do Not Believe ETI is out there and they're sure God is. The World is ruled by USSteel and PONG is the best and only computer game for heaven's sake!. It is hard for you guys to believe this shit (I call into context, regretfully, my advanced relative decrepitude, to remind that I am able to speak to you from the past, before your birth.) My point? It's a *real* battle that really needed to be fought, so we should forgive Sagan any overzealous driving home of the points. You need only think on the Texas and Kansas school systems to worry if the serpent's really truly been slain.Comments on some excellent vignettes towards the end:Witches dreaming of flying by reason of tripping on nightshade ~~ don't get me started! That they ""flew"" using broomsticks, well it's all merely hinted at, but if you listen close you can hear Carl snickering at his own jokes.Computers are conscious, or soon will be. I thought this especially cool, because it will at least be true so far as I can tell, and you can do NO BETTER! I mean, I can't *know* that you are conscious either, (solipsism) only that you're clever. So philosophically, once machines are clever, we may as well ascribe consciousness to them: it's only fair. Carl is very comfortable with this, with the proposition that consciousness is no more than the result of mere complexity, taken to a sufficient extreme. That's very well adjusted of him: I'm somebody who *wants* there to be more to me than there apparently is. (...and I make a lot more of this point than he bothers to.)Another excellent anecdote was Thoth railing against hieroglyphics as the calculators and video games of the age, certain to corrupt young minds which, relieved of the requirement to memorize everything, would grow indolent and weak. At this juncture, Carl reminds us how great written language is with a taunt that it allows an author to leap remotely off the page and into your brain! ...and across the chasm of death, too, I thought: a form of eternal life. For that instant I was again impressed with how very imaginatively Carl Sagan is able to think. So I'll respectfully say, ""No, I don't think it really sensible to imagine that Carl Sagan's prejudiced against the right brain."" To the contrary, he's All About right brain; his own is probably 50% bigger than the left.---------------------post script: as a companion to the chapter on right/left brain thinking I warmly recommend ""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" as a closely related romp through even further stretched conjectures of how our brain structure and thinking may be related.*** added 'cause Facebook publishes these without separating the paragraphs."

288,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9096819-simon,4,"I got around to reading this book after finding out that it's a foundational text for the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) movement, which Carl Sagan himself had a huge role in popularising: In ""Dragons of Eden"", Sagan gives laypeople a detailed explanation for how intelligence evolved here on Earth and hence clues for what to look for if they want to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.This book is very, very 1970s in many ways: As other reviewers have pointed out, the results of scientific research into neurobiology since its 1977 publishing date have falsified some of the ideas Sagans present here. There are also chapters where Sagan gets all starry-eyed and optimistic about computer technology's ability to improve human learning, to an extent that feels outright ridiculous to someone reading this in 2020. Despite all that, I am grateful for Sagan writing this book since it's difficult to find other books that present the basics of evolutionary biology, genetics and how the brain functions in this accessible a way to people who do not have an academic background in those scientific fields. It's even more impressive an achievement considering that the author is writing outside his own field of expertise - I doubt that Sam Harris could write as well about astrophysics as Carl Sagan does about neuroscience here!Much of the information presented here is also completely new to me, like how the different specialised parts of the brain have wildly varying proportions in different animal species depending on the animal's lifestyle - or how much easier it is to learn chimpanzees sign language than spoken language, to the point that chimpanzees can master sign language as well as humans. For me, the most interesting part of ""The Dragons of Eden"" has to be Sagan's explanation for how dreaming evolved: He theorises it's an evolutionary adaptation to make sure mammals stay asleep when hiding from nocturnal predators, and that the omnipresence of dragons and vampires in folklore and mythology around the world can be traced back to instincts evolved to help us avoid predatory dinosaurs and reptiles as well as nocturnal predators.I also quite like the psychedelic cover painting of an australopithecine Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden populated by dinosaurs, prehistoric rhinoceri and even scorpions - a painting that probably ended up spraypainted on quite a few VW Microbuses back in the 1970s."

The book is a lot like a summary of what people knew about consciousness at the time of writing, plus reflection and speculations from Sagan. Having read many of Richard Dawkins’s books, I didn’t get much out of this, except an entertaining summary.Keep in mind that a lot has changed in the field of the subject since the book was written, and, again, it contains a lot of speculations by Sagan."

291,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71398830-johnny-j,4,"This wasn't actually my first time reading Dragons of Eden, as I had to read it for a certain curriculum based assignment at a private school I attended a few years ago. I forget exactly why we read it, but I can remember that there was a focus on neuroscience and the early life of Earth in what we were learning. My teacher was also just a huge Sagan/popular science fanatic. I remember thinking the book was interesting, but I, more or less... skimmed it back then. Maybe I've matured (I don't really think so), but I wanted to pick it up again and actually process the information that Sagan blissfully bestows on the reader. There wasn't any pressing need for me to read Dragons of Eden, I just kind of saw it sitting on my bookshelf when I was making the reading challenge list for English class and thought it would be nice to re-read. Dragons of Eden is, more or less, chapters upon chapters of Carl Sagan's thoughts and discoveries on the brain and the human condition. From segments that literally give a calendar of the entirety of the universe's events, to chapters that focus solely on the learning capabilities of primates, to findings on the rare deformity of a ""split-brain"" in humans, Sagan provides an insane amount of information in a small book (there are exponentially more topics highlighted in Eden, those mentioned are just some examples). Each subject, while they may seem distantly related, builds on top of one another with various terminologies and fundamental concepts. His overall thesis is that human nature and the neural states of homo sapiens are filled with relics from the distant past, those relics still visible today. It's not often i'll go for something non-fiction, especially something in the field of neuroscience – the topic honestly being a little far removed from my interests. Despite this, found this book a joy to read (re-read), and it's actually made me more interested in neurology than I thought I could. Sagan makes the figurative tons of data in Eden extremely accessible and interesting, connecting each of his refined concepts to create a humble page turner. None of the information ever feels like it drags on at any point, as each chapter is short enough to get to the point without sacrificing any of the important details. It's really impressive how Sagan manages to create a book thats so jam-packed with information and still make it entertaining and accessible.One thing that is an obvious downside to this book is that some of the research and technological terms are outdated, and basically false at this point. This isn't to say that this book is all incorrect data, of course not, but having been released in 1977, there have definitely been some discoveries to prove some things in Eden wrong. This doesn't necessarily make Sagan's points less strong, however. His ideas and thoughts are still strong and poignant, even if some of the data is dated. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I think you'd be surprised at how much you'd enjoy it."
292,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13999805-greg-metcalf,5,"As I was reading this book again, since a first reading close to twenty years ago, a friend mentioned that if he was going to read a popular science book, he'd read a new one, not one from the seventies. That comment kind of got stuck in my head. It would certainly be interesting to read about how far sign language development with chimpanzees, for example, has come, which must have just gotten started when Sagan wrote about it here. But this book is Carl Sagan playing with possibilities. In a chapter on right and left hemisphere brain functioning, he suggests the possibility that the effect of marijuana might be to inhibit left brain reasoning giving the more intuitive right brain more influence over our thinking, which he compares to there always being stars above us but we need the dominant sun to set before they become visible. What a fascinating notion and how poetically stated. If anything Sagan writes about here has been disproven, he would be the first to say, Isn't this new evidence fascinating? We all wish Carl Sagan were alive and writing books about the cutting edge discoveries of today, but his creative thinking remains an inspiration. At one point, he was writing about how the written word manages to put the voice of someone else in your mind and wrote ""(Hello!)"" That alone made this well worth a second read. "
293,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571445-rajat-twit,4,"Not recommended for casual readers, this book is a very informative collection of amazing knowledge for the science enthusiasts. Expanding his knowledge from astrophysics to Biology, anthropology, evolutionary, history and upcoming scientific gadgets, Carl Sagan produces a wonderful literature on what may have been the case for the evolution of human intelligence. The book is a wonderful study of various aspects of human evolution and has given vivid and relevant examples for every point mentioned by Sagan. Not only Sagan is honest about the knowledge available at the time of writing the book, but predicts some wonderful future inventions for computer intelligence which we may see turning into reality today. His sharp predictions at the time of 1980s, which we may witness to becoming a reality, show that many of his speculations for the history of evolution may have many relevant points.The language is lucid and flawless, as is always in the case of Carl Sagan. He is not only one of the most significant science educator of 20 Century but is also a role model for many science enthusiasts. The voice that has ignited the minds of many scientists and engineers has proven through this book that people not from science background may become interested in Science, if science is presented in an entertaining and fun way!"
294,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73953091-matt-shaw,2,"While this is a well-researched Essay on Many Things, I found it truly disappointing. Not because it is dated, which it really is, but because the subtitle is utterly misleading. ""Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence"" do not actually occur in this book, which is far more concerned with the morphology of the human brain and the functions of its component parts; there is really nothing in this book about selective mechanisms or advantages, nothing about the huge metabolic costs of a 1400 cc brain, and little real discussion of the pressures driving the selection FOR increased encephalization. Nothing about evolution. Sorry, Carl ol' buddy, but this is a diatribe about brain function, quantitative measurements through vivisection experiments on all sorts of critters, and off-topic rambles about the ethics of abortion and extraterrestrial intelligence. This is a good read if you want to sound smart at a party, but that's about it."
295,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19488978-trey-nowell,4,"Pretty interesting book overall, did tend to go from one topic to another and then come back to the topic with a tiny bit of rambling. I also consider the book for its date written, and amazed Sagan could foresee so many things coming to fruition in technology (such as cloning and everyone having multiple computers). It must have been even more amazing 35 plus years ago to see how much information our genes contain. Tackles issues regarding human brain has developed over time, its components, the differences in the evolution of man, reptiles vs. mammals, sleeping in both, dreams, mental illness, the likelihood of aliens, etc. Very cool topics then and today, imagine they will be for millions and billions of years to come."
296,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,3,"This book is dated, but good. I love reading about research on the human brain. Sagan makes lots of corny jokes and asides that are not really appropriate but sort of endearing. The evolution of the brain is the focus and Sagan talks a lot about the ""reptilian"" brain, the part that we had before we became human. Also the discussion of what really makes us human is so interesting. On the radio some modern researcher said that the brain is a record, a story of what has happened to that particular body. Anyways, this book is archaic compared to what they know now, so I am looking for a modern (post-modern?) read on the amazing human brain!"
297,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4200470-doctor,5,"whilst i was in doctor school i worked part time as an artist designing 3-d holographic pictures that were sold as prizes in carnival midways. my most popular piece was entitled 'the dragons of eden'. it depicted the biblical fall of man with medieval viking characters straight from the fucking round table. adam, eve, god, and satan were portrayed in an erotic he-man meets led zepplin song stylee. merlin, as a righteous god of wizard vahalla, was zapping a tastefully nude eve's fig leafs off while a badass dragon satan was eating shirtless viking knight warrior adam's head. it is still the number one prize in the 'throw a dart at a balloon' game today, and it fucking deserves to be."
298,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20989544-laura,4,"Interesting and easy-redable, though a bit basic.When I found this book, I couldn't believe Sagan had written a book about one of my favorite topics: the brain, so I knew I had to read it. The book was pretty easy to read, it's a short and basic introduction to the brain. It starts saying some things about the Cosmos, evolution and the brain itself. I recommend this book if you are new to the topic, because if you have more experience in the field, this book may seem too basic, though it doesn't make it less great, I really enjoyed it a lot. Lastly, it's important to know that the book it's a little bit old so some things may be wrong."
299,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016703-mike,4,"This somewhat difficult read will certainly open your eyes to who and what we are, and how we came to be the dominant species on the planet. You may find yourself not too proud to be human, as the origins of our much-touted intellegence which separates us from the beasts comes into focus. Evolutionary Anthropology rewritten for the masses, but still sometimes tedious and hard to follow; I found myself rereading several pages just to absorb all the information. I'm looking forward to more Sagan, as I have collected a number which I have not yet opened."
