0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,2,"Every year there's always one non-fiction book that the entire literate world raves about and that I hate. In 2009 it was Richard Holmes's ""The Age of Wonder"", the following year it was ""The Emperor of All Maladies"".Universally admired, winner of a Pulitzer prize, this book annoyed me so profoundly when I first read it that I've had to wait almost a year to be able to write anything vaguely coherent about it. The flaws that I found so infuriating a year ago seem less important upon a second reading. Though I still think it is a poorly conceived book, executed in a manner that lacks all restraint, it's nowhere near as terrible as I remembered. As I recall, the aspects of the book that most annoyed me were:(a) the author's anthropomorphism of cancer -- a stupid, unhelpful, and ineffective metaphor. In general, I detest this practice of attributing personalities to diseases. Perhaps it's a necessary psychological strategy for oncologists. But it's particularly inappropriate in the case of cancer, as it perpetuates the incorrect belief that cancer is a single disease, as opposed to a ""shape-shifting disease of colossal diversity"". For the same reason, it makes little sense to speak of a ""war on cancer"", as if it were a sentient villain with plans for world domination, one that can somehow be vanquished if we just find the magic formula. Mukherjee correctly deplores this view as simplistic and reductive, but he then proceeds to adopt it hook, line, and sinker. It's a baffling and unfortunate choice, because its inherent deficiencies lead to a kind of narrative incoherence, as well as a damaging lack of clarity about the nature and scope of the book. It's a symptom of Mukherjee's vagueness of purpose that he often refers to the book as a ""biography of cancer"", as if that phrase had meaning.(b) A complete, fatal, inability to leave anything out. There is a certain type of non-fiction writer who seems hellbent on inflicting everything he or she learned while researching the book on the misfortunate reader. No detail is spared. Everyone the author spoke to during the five years researching the book gets a mention, it would seem. As do a bunch of dead folks, some of them very dead, not all clearly particularly relevant.If, by doing this, the author is trying to impress with the breadth of his research, then he fails. Leaving everything in is the simple, intellectually lazy, option. Where non-fiction is concerned, the reader has a right to expect the author to take the trouble to shape his material into some kind of coherent whole, recognizing that while some details are critical, others are not, and pruning accordingly. All too often, though, authors forget this. Their enthusiasm about the subject leads them to lose perspective: ""the reader needs the whole story and will be thirsting for all the gory details; it would be criminal to leave anything out"".Well, actually, NO. We want you, the author, to point out to us what's important and what's not.  (c) The author includes stories of his own patients' experience with cancers of various types. I have nothing against this per se - it's entirely sensible to do so. However, it requires delicacy and finesse to report on his patients' stories without seeming exploitative or emotionally manipulative. Writers like Jerome Groopman and Oliver Sachs regularly navigate this terrain with grace and sensitivity. Mukherjee, a much less experienced writer, repeatedly crosses the line into bathos and melodrama. The language is overly dramatic; one senses also that Mukherjee succumbs to the oncologist's fallacy of believing that cancer is intrinsically ""worse"", or more serious, than all other ailments. Actually, I guess that's already evident from the book's title.(d) He has a particularly unfortunate habit of prefacing each chapter with at least one ""literary quote"", and when the book reaches a new section (there are six in all), he tends to go hog wild and give us a whole page of quotes. These seem like a minor distraction at first, but their cumulative effect is to leave the reader with the impression that (i) it is very important to the author to let the world know that he is a well-read, Renaissance dude (ii) chances are the author is a bit of a poser. The bard, the bible, St Thomas Aquinas, Sophocles, Kafka, Hegel, Voltaire, Plato, Sun Tzu, and William Blake are all mined for a portentous snippet or two about mortality and the evils that the flesh is heir to. Not to mention Gertrude Stein, Jack London, Czeslaw Milosz, W.H. Auden, Hilaire Belloc, D.H. Lawrence, Lewis Carroll, Conan Doyle, Italo Calvino, Woody Allen, Solzhenitsyn, Akhmatova... . Using just the right quote to frame an argument, or introduce a topic, can be an extremely effective device, but its effectiveness diminishes rapidly with overuse. One gets the distinct impression that the author ransacked some quotation website in the mistaken idea that sprinkling them copiously throughout the manuscript would magically confer some kind of gravitas. I reached my eye-rolling moment on page 190, introducing part three, when Doctor Mukherjee felt impelled to quote T.S. Eliot:""... I have seen the Eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker.And in short, I was afraid.""  (e) As I mentioned, I think the structure and organization of the material leaves much to be desired. The writing is generally adequate, if a little verbose, though one tic of the author's drove me nuts. Each of the apparently infinite number of characters in the book is introduced in Mukherjee's characteristically breezy style, then immediately fixed in amber by means of a trio of adjectives. Accurate information about the personality and character of many of these historical characters being limited, one suspects that these adjective triplets may well have been chosen at random from a thesaurus. This kind of thing:childless, socially awkward, and notoriously reclusivewealthy, politically savvy, and well-connectedwealthy, gracious, and enterprisingambitious, canny, and restlessself-composed, fiery, and energeticproud, guarded, and secretiveflamboyant, hot-tempered, and adventurouscool, composed, and cautiousintellectual, deliberate, and imposingcharming, soft-spoken and carefuloutspoken, pugnacious, and boldimpatient, aggressive and goal-drivenbrackish, ambitious, dogged, and feistysuave, personable, and sophisticated (impeccably dressed in custom-cut Milanese suits)brilliant, brash and single-mindedlaconic and secretive, with a slippery quicksilver temperObviously, Dr Mukherjee is an adherent of the ""Adjectives are Your Friends"" school of writing. If this kind of tic bothers you, be warned that it really runs rampant in this book. In the general scheme of things, it's a minor detail.Enough caviling. What has the author accomplished in this book? I think he has written an overly detailed*, partially complete**, suboptimally organized*** account of the evolution of our understanding of cancer and the development of treatment options to counteract it. The result is a very readable account, though I imagine some of the second half of the book may be hard for non-scientists to understand. In general, he seems to get things right, though there are a few lapses -- most notably in his discussion of the use of mustard gas in WWI. I can find no corroboration of his statement that ""in a single year it left hundreds of thousands dead in its wake""; one wonders if he may have confused 'casualties' with 'fatalities'. His ability to explain biomedical ideas in terms a layperson can understand seems decent, though not exceptional. I don't think the writing is of a caliber that deserves the Pulitzer prize, but what do I know?*: ""overly detailed"" - to give just one example, was it really necessary to devote a page and a half to reviewing Lister's introduction of antiseptics? And in a book which appeared to be focused on diagnostic and therapeutic options, why devote 40 pages to the link between smoking and cancer with the emphasis firmly on the legal and regulatory aspects?**: eye-glazing detail about kinase inhibitors, but nothing about anti-angiogenesis agents (Avastin was approved around 2003, as I recall, so it's clearly well within the time horizon)***: a person could get whiplash from all the zipping up and back down the historical timeline, for no obvious reason.Thank you. Now that I've got that out of my system, I feel much better."

With beautiful metaphors, poignant case studies, breath-taking science and delectable literary allusions, Siddhartha Mukherjee takes us on a detailed yet panoramic trip spanning centuries. Probably one of the best science books I have ever read.My favorite parts in the book are the literary allusions that capture the depth and feeling of what is being described so well, such as Cancer Ward, Alice in Wonderland, Invisible Cities, Oedipus Rex and many more. The most memorable of all is when he encapsulates Cancer with a play on the favorite opening lines from Anna Karenina - ""Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" becomes ""Normal cells are identically normal; malignant cells become unhappily malignant in unique ways."" This unacknowledged transmutation of the famous lines encapsulates the book for me, in more ways than one.For a comprehensive take on the influence of cancer as a metaphor in our daily lives and societies, go here."

I kept it on the kitchen counter and as the left-hand page pile got bigger there was me standing on the right, getting smaller. It was my diet book. A couple of pages and a pound or so every week. What I was doing was either boiling the kettle or making my own concoction of a fat and cholesterol-busting mousse that involved just holding an immersion whisk for a couple of minutes. I have such a low threshold for boredom I had to do something, so I read Emperor of All Maladies. I had previously tried to read the book in the proper way but failed. It is very heavy and not all of it is equally fascinating, but it all hangs together in the end and has given me a proper education in genes, dna, mutations, what cancer actually is and why it has been so impossible to find a panacea. It's a bit like fighting a guerrilla war. You can only defeat the insurgents where you find them and where you think they might be. It might seem as if all the rogue cells have been annhilated. But if you didn't find them or one is high in the hills watching, or there are reinforcements coming from abroad in the next few months, then the battle will resume as soon as numbers have built up and the enemy is attacking once again. That is not to say there aren't victories, but they are victories of battles, not of the war, but the war against cancer is one from which we can never withdraw.One thing struck me that was full of hope, was Mukherjee was talking about a previously rare cancer that is now quite common. It might be assumed that the cancer itself is on the upsurge, but no, it was rare because people died from it, now they live with it, so just like AIDS, it is no longer a killer but a chronic disease.7-star book. 8 even... it was that good."
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"I think this is a really good and accessible book about cancer that traces the history of our understanding of it. I'm not sure if it qualifies as a biography of cancer per se and I only mentioned this because I kind of feel ambivalent about the anthropomorphizing of cancer through out the book. I feel like it wasn't really even anthropomorphizing really, especially not when compared to the way a lot of biologist speak of things like genes, but more metaphorical and a way of relating cancer to a larger cultural feeling and tone. I just found Mukherjee's attention to etymology and to larger metaphorical meaning in terms of the language used and the approach taken to treating cancer a really salient part of this book. I haven't decided how I feel about it though, whether I liked it or not. I enjoyed reading this though and found it really informative. I can see why everyone was recommending it. "
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5085284-julia-hayes,5,"This is personal. Cancer entered my life uninvited trying to consume the body of my daughter, Aria. It was January 2008 when I heard the words, “We think she has leukemia.” She was four years old.In the prologue of “The Emperor of All Maladies—A Biography of Cancer” by Siddartha Mukherjee, he wrote, “…the arrival of a patient with acute leukemia still sends a shiver down the hospital’s spine—all the way from the cancer wards on its upper floors to the clinical laboratories buried deep in the basement. Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells—cancer in one of its most explosive, violent incarnations.” What caught my attention was the word ‘still’. Leukemia happens to be one of the more successful cancers in terms lengthy high quality remissions and even cure, yet still…Cancer governed every facet of our lives throughout her chemotherapy treatment, which lasted 794 days followed by 90 days of continued maintenance antibiotics, antacids and anti-nausea medication. She was lucky. Trust me, you CAN imagine my relief, my sense of humility, my inexpressible gratitude and my continued fear of its return.That fear is now what governs me and it is an awful burden to carry. I have discovered many things but there are two worth mentioning. I’ve discovered that one can have fear and be unafraid and I have learned that cancer is indeed Death. It may not always bring physical death but it always brings the death of a life once lived. Deeply held convictions die. The illusion of control is smothered. Friendships and relationships wither. Its victims are forever scarred with raw oozing reminders. Pure and simple it is a scary way to have to live life.So as part of survivorship, I committed myself to figuring out how to have this fear and be unafraid. No doubt about it, information is everything! There was no way I would have been able to read this book during Aria’s treatment and I’m not certain I would have been able to read it had she died. It is only upon the perch of her wellness that I can dig deep into the darkest corners of cancer and extract understanding.I hold this book, this gem, like a shield of valor as I continue to face the beast that is cancer—even in remission it’s there. “The Emperor of All Maladies” has empowered and humbled me. Dr. Mukherjee writes with grace and elegance about a topic that strikes fear like little else and takes the reader from a horrifying history, the effects of which still linger and haunt, to the fever-pitched decades of discovery, experimentation, fearlessness and compassion, to where we are now, which I am convinced is the cusp of medicine’s finest hour.The early experimentation with cytotoxic therapies following WWII on young leukemia patients was particularly impressive, for obvious reasons. Three of those early identified successful agents are the very ones Aria had in addition to 5 other cocktails. I am indebted to those researchers. I am indebted to the parents of the children whose lives hung in balance of life and death for the sake of an unknown future. I’m indebted to those children.It is overwhelming to consider that this exquisite and brilliant person decided to tackle medicine from its ‘humors’ to the ‘genome atlas’ detailing every twist and turn in between all the while tenderly weaving in the real life stories of real life people.We are on other side of cancer. I would like nothing more than to tell you that I feel safe. I do not. Every step I take I hear the echoed voices of the thousands of children who perished in order that my daughter’s life would be spared. Still, it wasn’t until I read the last few chapters of this book that I felt tangibly hopeful. I won’t lie. Those chapters were hard to digest. It would be easy to dismiss them criticizing Dr. Mukherjee for losing steam or failing to keep non-medical people engaged, but this would be a gross injustice to what I think was beautifully accomplished. Namely, our understanding of cancer is at the genetic level where just a mere 100+ years ago blood and its constituents were identified and understood. Now we can get into those individual cells and understand and map the universe within them. I am in awe of this science and I am deeply, profoundly indebted to Dr. Mukherjee for explaining it to me. Yes, to me. I told you this was personal.He doesn’t over simplify because the complexity of what we know now and continue to question and understand can’t be toned down, cut away or reduced for easier swallowing in the layman’s mouth. Cancer in all of its presentation is almost impossible to stomach and so these last chapters require the highest degree of concentration, attention and care. It is the place where anyone suffering the effects of cancer or fearing cancer can grasp a firm thread of promise.When I read the last sentence, “In that haunted last night, hanging on to her life by no more than a tenuous thread, summoning all her strength and dignity as she wheeled herself to the privacy of her bathroom, it was as if she had encapsulated the essence of a four-thousand-year-old war.” I closed the book, brought it to my chest and smiled. This is an old battle. This is a known battle. This is a battle for which I was called to arms as witness to the battle my daughter fought. This is a battle that continues to terrify me. This is a battle that I can face with confidence despite my fear. This is a battle that will remain but with weapons like the minds of Dr. Mukherjee and others, this is a battle whose field will continue to shift in the favor of human well-being and dignity. Thank you Dr. Mukherjee. On behalf of my family, I bow deeply."

I don't think anyone else could take on the challenge of writing about cancer, from the first rearing of its ugly head. He gives us a sweeping look at the beginning treatments, trials, operations, and research. Leukemia, breast cancer, Hodgkin's, and other cancers flit in and out throughout this book. Reading about children with this horrible disease always tears at my heart, I think this was the hardest part. Although it was all quite hard, but so informative.How doctors think at times, when confronted with patients they are not sure they can cure.

I anticipated a similarity to a favorite book of 2010, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, but this book dives much deeper into the history of cancer, while interweaving personal accounts of patients the author treated. This biography is different from anything I have read this year; poignant, lyrical, accessible- and most of all, real. Living, and breathing along with his patients, Siddhartha Mukherjee dives deep into the dark and the light side of cancer, and explores not only how the diseases spreads within the body, but through the lives of his patients, and the doctors and scientists who strived to defeat this complicated, deadly disease. Great read. "
8,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,4,"I've been wanting to read this since it first appeared, but I was just too nervous. Call it superstition. This is far scarier than any of your Barkers, your Kings or your Koontzes: there are no such things as zombies or bogeymen, but cancer is out there. Waiting for us.In The Great War and Modern Memory, Paul Fussell talks a lot about the irony of the First World War. Cancer, in the same way, is a deeply ironic disease. As Peyton Rous said, ‘Nature sometimes seems possessed of a sardonic humor.’The ability cancer cells have to reproduce themselves is the same biochemical magic that normal cells use to self-replicate; it's the whole reason we're alive. Cancer has weaponised our own life force; its ‘life is a recapitulation of the body's life, its existence a pathological mirror of our own.’Similarly cancer rates have gone up, in historical terms, not because there are more carcinogens but because (more irony) we are living longer.Civilization did not cause cancer, but by extending human life spans – civilization unveiled it.Now that so many people are surviving into their seventies and eighties, cancer has a better chance to pull off its mask – like a Scooby-Doo villain – to reveal that it was lurking there inside us all along. And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you pesky oncologists.So this book is frightening, and you do have to brace yourself to read endless variants on the phrase ‘unfortunately it had metastasized inoperably into her liver and brain’ over and over again; however, balancing this terror is the very real intellectual thrill of following the generations of doctors and scientists who have tried to understand and fight the disease.The fight has got a bit more sophisticated than it used to be. Not a lot, but a bit. The prevailing approach for a long time was that pioneered by William Halsted, who insisted on (literally) ‘radical’ surgery to cut out as much tissue as physically possible, in order to maximize the chances of removing all the cancerous cells. One disciple, for instance, ‘evacuated three ribs and other parts of the rib cage and amputated a shoulder and a collarbone from a woman with breast cancer’. Gradually, advances in biochemistry and, latterly, genetics, have allowed for more targeted non-surgical solutions, although so far only really for certain specific cancers.In fact the most progress has been made not in dealing with cancer, but in avoiding it in the first place. Anti-smoking campaigns, lifestyle advice, along with Pap smears and other screening programmes, have been very successful at least in the West (elsewhere, things are going backwards in many cases). Once it actually develops, your options remain fairly limited, and the metric of success is still often how many years of remission one can hope for, rather than the chances of an outright ‘cure’. Mukherjee is thorough with his story and writes pretty well, although the focus is very much on the American scene, with researchers from Europe and elsewhere sometimes dealt with in a cursory fashion; at one point he even describes France and England as lying on the ‘far peripheries’ of medicine! He also goes a bit overboard with his literary credentials, bookending every chapter and section with multiple epigraphs from poets and other thinkers. It's not clear how well he understands his sources here, though, especially when you see that he's dated Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy to 1893, when Burton had been dead for two hundred and fifty years.Still, this is overall a very rich and rewarding book, full of scientific discovery and packed with historical detail. It's a thriller, it's a sci-fi, it's a horror story. Let's just hope that future editions have even more to report in the way of progress."
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90798-christina,5,"Deep breath. This book is elegant, extraordinarily insightful, and most of all important. Despite the big words and the complicated science, Mukherjee had me riveted from start to finish. I thought I had a knowledge of cancer before this book, but now I understand it, in all of its feverish complexity and horrifying beauty. In the history of cancer research, there have been bright flashes of brilliance combined with truths that are stupidly rediscovered centuries too late (such as the carcinogenic nature of tobacco, which was delineated by an amateur scientist in a pamphlet in 1761 but that was still, somehow, up for ""debate"" in the 1960s). What sticks with me most is that no one in cancer research really knows what they're doing, but the strength of truly great doctors lies in knowing that, instead of assuming the arrogant position that you've found the only way and other possibilities are laughable.I did not know that this book won the Pullitzer this year when I read it, but it deserves every piece of praise it gets. I will admit it was very hard to read this book with my 29-year-old sister so struck by (and dying of) breast cancer. On every page are patients suffering through cancer and its treatments, losing their battle only a few chapters before the particular solution they needed is found. Cancer is a formidable foe that, for better or worse, is tightly intertwined within our genes. One of the doctors profiled in the book had a favorite aphorism about how death in old age is not something to be beaten, but death before old age is the enemy to fight. That is what I hope for. Not extravagant medical ""advances"" aiming for immortality — just the opportunity for each of us to fully experience our mortality for a period of time that does not rob of our best years, or the chance to have children, or the chance to find love and find ourselves. Sigh."

Yet I waited over two years, a reading eternity for those who know me. See, I tend to the obsessional in my reading, and I do not need hypnosis to be suggestible. Oh, you can't sway me with your opinions -- I'm too contrarian for that. But if I was drinking Pinot Noir and I offered you a glass of it and you said, no, that Pinot Noir made your mouth too dry, then my mouth would instantly turn to chalk. In other words, should a psychosomatic read a biography of cancer?And, being both male and American, I have done my share of dumb things.Demagogues don't scare me, but snakes do. And ageing doesn't scare me. But, cancer does. Perhaps like you, I have seen it up close, and with someone who bequeathed her DNA to me.----- ----- ----- ----- -----Like An Intimate History of The Gene, the subtitle here - A Biography of Cancer - is cutesy. It's actually a mix of things. There's a history of our knowledge of cancer and also a history of the scientific and medical attempts to combat it. It's multiple biographies of the scientists in the lab, the crusaders, and the victims. It's legal fights, as innovative as the scientific research; and it's about prevention. The author's patients are here too, poignantly.Retroviruses. Cytotoxic chemotherapy. Retinoblastoma tumorigenesis. Words on the right side of the colon are supposed to be illuminating. But here: myc, neu, fos, ret, akt (all oncogenes), and p53, VHL, APC (all tumor suppressors).And yet, this was a page-turner. Because Mukherjee can write! And he doesn't talk down, and he honors other writers, but just enough not to insult the reader. So he can write a sentence like this: Normal cells are identically normal; malignant cells become unhappily malignant in unique ways.And he has an ear to quote others. Like Rose Kushner: When doctors say that the side effects are tolerable or acceptable, they are talking about life-threatening things. But if you just vomit so hard that you break the blood vessels in your eyes . . . they don't consider that even mentionable. And they certainly don't care if you're bald. The smiling oncologist does not know whether his patients vomit or not.But nurses do, and Mukherjee honors them in appropriately subtle ways.I learned, of course, many things. Trite things, like that the Pap smear was named after George Papanicolaou, who kind of invented them. But also that In autopsies of men over sixty years old, nearly one in every three specimens will bear some evidence of prostate malignancy. Most cases are indolent though, so we tend to die with prostate cancer rather than because of it.I read with fascination about biases in testing and the perils of statistics. So, a drug 'curing' cancer can actually increase the prevalence of it.But long after I forget the names of the researchers and the initials of the life-saving drugs, I will remember this one supremely well-crafted sentence:Old sins have long shadows.You could start a novel with that. Or, an autobiography.Here's the whole thought:Yet, old sins have long shadows, and carcinogenic sins especially so. The lag time between tobacco exposure and lung cancer is nearly three decades, and the lung cancer epidemic in America will have an afterlife long after smoking incidence has dropped.The math is that I quit 30 years ago - little cigars, intensely inhaled - a few years after my mother died of lung cancer. That I'm rehabilitated might not matter.This is a wonderful book, extremely well-written. Nine years old, it might actually be dated. But the messages are timeless.Old sins have long shadows."

Suffers noticeably from a lack of editorial quality control -- several passages are repeated almost word-for-word (why does this happen so often in high-grade pop science? what's up with the lack of good, scientifically-literate editors?), and insufficient detail -- the book would have benefited from entire extra chapters detailing pathway-based drug discovery, the physics and mathematics of random mutation (a quick nod is paid to Schrodinger's What is Life, of which I fully approve), the use of statistical and combinatorial analyses in drug discovery, etc. Then again, less technically-minded readers are probably thankful for these lacunae. Overall, I'd have appreciated more focus on the past 20 years of oncological research, rooted as they are more deeply in the hard sciences of molecular biology and targeted pharmocology; cancer treatment has, until quite recently, been a story of observation-driven research, which (no matter how complete the collection or analysis of data points) is (and must remain) both fundamentally less effective and less interesting than the ineluctable march of theory.Then again, one of Mukherjee's major points is that ""cancer"" is a collection of protean, complex, multifaceted things, evolution in situ possessing its own elegance and beauty, a noble and almost clever opponent. So often thought hovering on the brink of defeat, it has always managed to elude its pursuers, and perhaps the proliferation of pathways hints that protein folding and recombinance will form no more a panacea than did adjuvant radiotherapy forty years ago.warning, the following are personal conjectures of a precocious computer scientist: The evolution, for instance, of repressed metastasis suppressors or disabled anti-oncogenes coding for ""undruggable"" proteins -- those lacking differentiated bonding sites along the cell membrane (see breast and ovarian cancer's infamous HER2/neu, so efficaciously targeted by Herceptin, for a counterexample), or deeply interwoven with non-renewable, inaccessible host material (eg meningioma, gliosarcoma) -- would require wholly new avenues of treatment (hence the sprezzaturic gamma knife -- ""from the rain of the cobalt, O Lord, deliver us"". Hence the radiolabeled polyethylene glycol-coated hexadecylcyanoacrylate nanospheres, in all their evanescent busting of the blood-brain barrier -- and in all their depositive despair). Cancer's accelerated evolution suggests convergence of mortality toward such rough beasts. Pathway-oriented research is critical.Anyway! This is a pretty goddamn good book. I recommend it.* Extreme ENTP here, of course."

However, diagrams involving the targeting of proto-/oncogenes and diagrams explaining the signalling cascade of some kinases could perhaps have helped those without a science background to understand with greater ease what exactly an oncogene is and the impact of disrupting/altering these pathways. Good explanations into the research behind the mechanism of action and the targets of some cancer drugs in use today. For more completion I would have liked a chapter on angiogenesis inhibitors though. Siddhartha Mukherjee writes with a style that is not dry or indigestible like a lot of science-heavy material but instead gives a very human touch to a topic that could seem tough and difficult to grasp in lesser hands. Highly recommended.If you enjoy the section on cancer biology and want to know more about basic human genetics then I would also highly recommend The Gene: An Intimate History also written by Siddhartha Mukherjee."

It’s likely that those that were treated at this clinic had no other treatment options available in conventional medicine, and so turned to alternative medicine as a last resort. Therefore, a high death rate seems unavoidable either way. Yet, authorities have reason to believe that patients at this clinic died under suspicious circumstances.The drug in question, 3BP, has shown promising results in early testing and is cautiously referred to as a potential breakthrough treatment for cancer by some researchers. A Dutch boy called Yvar Verhoeven was treated with 3BP several years ago after his dad refused to give up on him. He wrote to over 500 cancer specialists begging for the experimental treatment. Finally, a specialist in Frankfurt was willing and treatment ensued. The drug managed to completely, spectacularly, eradicate Yvar’s liver cancer. As often is the case with cancer, there was no happy ending: Yvar passed away due to related complications a year later. But not before he’d toured the States during his short revival to discuss what turned out a miracle drug for him. Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant ran an article on Yvar’s treatment and the progression of his cancer that’s recommended reading to get the backgrounds, but unfortunately is also in Dutch. For multilinguals.At the time, Dutch professor of medical oncology at the Acadamisch Medisch Centrum, called the mechanism of action of 3BP ""very interesting"", but warned that a lot of additional research was required before it could be use in humans. Alternative clinics like the one in Germany latched onto the drug anyway. The investigation of the sudden deaths at that clinic is still in full swing, but early reports point in the direction of the clinic possibly carelessly administering manually mixed dosages of (the highly unstable) 3BP. If unprofessional usage is to blame, then hopefully 3BP’s reputation will overcome the bad light it’s now put in.Indeed it is 2016 now, and still cancer patients look for last-ditch options and visit quacks in their hopelessness. It's 2016 and still cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 8.2 million deaths in 2012 alone.What even is this ""emperor of all maladies"", this mysterious killer that in one way or another is a haunting part of everyone’s life? What exactly does cancer entail? I didn’t realize I was so fuzzy on the details myself until after I started reading this book. Mukherjee expertly explains all the what’s, why’s, when’s and how’s when it comes to cancer. He intersperses his book with compelling patient stories and mini-biographies. Just as easily, he throws around in-depth scientific information to explain the difficulties the medical world faces. And so the unthinkable happened: Mukherjee made me read 600 pages on cancer in a little over a week, and he didn't even hold a gun to my head. Cancer is a collective noun for hundreds of diseases, and every time we think we have figured out one tiny piece of the puzzle for one of those diseases, cancer races ahead of us, adapting and evolving to wreak havoc again, undisturbed for yet another decade. Or several. Mukherjee will lead you through all those decades, stretching into centuries. Starting with the queen of Persia, Atossa, who somewhere in 400 BC discovered a bleeding lump in her breast in what is the first recorded instance of cancer. With interest and horror I read how Medieval doctors experimented with a wide range of dubious treatments like mercury and lead concoctions and a whack, whack here and a whack, whack there (oh, dark, dark Middle Ages). But as the book crept closer to our modern age, something else happened to me as a reader. When reaching the late 50’s and early 60’s, I found myself starting to add my own anecdotes to Mukherjee’s timeline. I don’t think there are families who manage to escape cancer altogether, and mine’s no exception. And so when Mukherjee discussed the unfortunate rise of radical mastectomy to beat cancer, I couldn’t help but think of my aunt. She was diagnosed with a tiny lump, breast cancer, in the early 70’s, and like 90% of women with a similar diagnoses underwent what would later be considered a morbid, disfiguring and unnecessary mastectomy. The increasing popularity of smoking and the campaign against it, too, reminded me of a personal anecdote. My granddad, who started smoking ""healthy, doctor-approved"" cigs as a boy and steadily smoked for years (even during his years in Nazi-Germany, when “Arbeitseinsatz” forced him to work in a bomb factory) once told me that what made him stop was a TV item in the 60’s in which a doctor showed two pairs of lungs: those of a smoker and those of a non-smoker. Black and white TV did little to disguise the sorry state of the smoker’s lungs. The same day, he went cold turkey. He was in his eighties when he succumbed to lung cancer’s little brother: lung emphysema.This is an odd book, in the sense that it evokes so many emotions at once. Due to Mukherjee’s engrossing writing style it’s highly entertaining, which I find an embarrassing word to describe a book on this topic. It’s also both a hopeful book (the remarkable, sometimes purely accidental discoveries of scientists and medical professionals throughout the years are encouraging: forms of cancer that used to be 100% lethal can now be treated well) and a hopeless one... Mukherjee points out that when you’re diagnosed with pancreas cancer, you might as well have lived in the Middle Ages: regardless of cancer experts making headlines since the 30’s by claiming that “cancer will be cured within the next 20 years”, pancreas cancer is still as deadly today as it was centuries ago. Everything considered, this book was incredibly informative and compelling. It might well be the best book I read in 2016. It made me smarter, and I didn’t even have to work for it.;) What’s more, I’m excited to read Mukherjee's 600 pages long book on genetics next, another topic I didn’t think I’d be dying to dive into."

My stars make more sense when you align them with genre or category than title perhaps.Take a book like The Emperor of Maladies: A Biography of Cancer by Siddhartha Mukherjee. How do the 5 stars I’m going to rate this book stand along side a butcher thriller that I’ve rated this highly too?This was a book group book and I worried that some would find the topic overally depressing to read or that others, cancer survivors themselves, might be emotionally upset. I was right and yet, I was wrong too. Yes, some of our group just couldn’t read it, but most did, and found it fascinating and informative. None felt it would have made any difference when they were going through their own illness but thought it might have helped if they had read it cancer free. It also would be useful for family members.Considering there are few of us who will not either have some form of cancer ourselves, or have a love one in need of treatment, this is a book for to equip you with knowledge. Dr. Mukherjee presents a well researched book, though not easy to read, one in layman’s terms and simple to understand. He begins at the beginning, giving us a timeline over many centuries, of what cancer is, isn’t, what we know, what we don’t, treatment tried, treatment failed, treatment success; taking us on a journey in the war against cancer. Our group learned much, shed a few tears, ate chocolate and marmite (one concoction used for cure long ago), and laughed as all living people must. In the end we felt hopeful that with dedicated doctors, committed researchers, and palliative treatment, we can live longer and better, if not cured, at least, living with cancer. Dr. Mukherjee won a Pulitzer Prize in general non-fiction for his effort. I highly recommend this book for someone needing to understand the structure of this disease, and for persons interested in science and medicine. "
17,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"This is an elegant, well-written book. Parts of the book read like a detective story, and are very engrossing. However, I really take issue with the short shrift that the book gives to research on cancer prevention. Now, the author readily admits that big strides toward conquering cancer will not occur by only finding cures--prevention is just as important. But, while the book has several chapters on the connection between smoking and lung cancer, no attention is paid to research related to other important lifestyle changes in preventing cancer. For example, a large body of research, both epidemiological and experiments with laboratory animals, have found strong connections between nutrition and cancer prevention. It simply stuns me that in a huge, comprehensive book like this, absolutely zero attention is paid to this very important topic."
18,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,4,"For me the word CANCER has always felt like that weird little creature in the movie Beetlejuice. If you say its name too often it may just manifest in front if you. Especially because both my parents are cancer survivors and my extended family is also riddled with cancer cases.And I know I am not alone in my fear of this disease. The stigma around cancer is mentioned frequently in this book.But knowledge is power, and I was determined to tackle this Beetlejuice head-on. Yet it seems the more we know about cancer the more difficult a cure-all feels.There is a plethora of cancers out there so the book mainly focuses on leukaemia, breast cancer, but also lesser known ones like Hodgkin’s disease and an eye-opening chapter on lung cancer.It starts with looking at the history of medicine and advancement of surgery. With the use of ether and discovery of radium, so did cancer treatment advance right along with it. End of life care was only fought for and introduced in the 1950s – before that incurable patients were all but forgotten in the dusty corners of hospitals.But be forewarned, this is a dense book and not one to just breeze through. Half of the book deals with clinical trials and a good portion of it focuses on quite complex genetic concepts such as mutation genes (ras, myc, rb, neu). I did not find these sections as riveting as I thought I would but at least now I know what retrovirus really means.I understand that cancer is complicated, VERY complicated so although this extremely well researched piece of work is highly informative it is also at times a little academic and dry. My rating is based on my personal preference of how scientific work is presented to a layman like me. Books like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, When the Air Hits Your Brain: Tales of Neurosurgery, and my favourite Pandora's Lab: Seven Stories of Science Gone Wrong presents scientific facts in a slightly more engaging way.Recommended for readers who have a personal interest in cancer and who will be willing to slog through some complicated concepts to get to the nuggets."
19,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4472055-cee,4,"Informative. The first hundred pages trace cancer's history, even way back to the Egyptian civilization. The next two hundred pages are about the long struggles in surgery, radiation and chemotherapy to fight cancer. Then the last two hundred pages launch into prevention, genetics and more pharmacology.With the scientific terminology toned down and explained as best as the author could, I felt I was reading a quasi-textbook. Before the topic would become monotonous there were breaks in form of stories, whether heartwarming or heartwrenching. And when not being technical, Mukherjee's writing can also be lyrical.I really like how the more common cancers: leukemia, breast, lung, etc. came into the picture one at a time as the account traveled through discovery, treatment, prevention and palliation. And then each cancer's backstory, current status and future is written about.Mukherjee used the word serendipitous several times. I think I understand. We may never know the cure for cancer but everything we now know and may learn to fight it with is serendipitous."

This statement is so terrifying that it always rings in your subconscious mind while reading this book. The book is beautifully written and an epic tome on cancer. Full marks to Siddhartha Mukherjee for his detailed analysis and extensive research on the disease. Each chapter starts with quotes by people associated with the disease and about half-way down the book, you realise that it is not a book but a work of art painstakingly brought to life by Siddhartha. A gamut of emotions overwhelm you while reading this book. You feel sad when you read that people who have strived to fight cancer and find a cure themselves died of the disease (ironic isn't it ?). You will be horrified to learn that mastectomies (or for that matter, surgeries) were performed on patients without anaesthesia in the 18th century. You will feel the unbearable and mind-numbing pain of patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. You feel happy when patients are cured and do not relapse . You feel a sense of despondency and helplessness when doctors break the news of diagnosis of the disease to their patients, especially so, when it has reached a stage beyond cure. You feel gloomy for patients clamouring for a ray of hope to find a cure.Folks, it would be apt if you read on kindle. There are medical terms / jargons used which might require a dictionary / wiki to refer to. The book is a heavy read. It took me two months to finish this. It has been a wonderful journey!!"
21,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,5,"This magisterial history of cancer won a 2011 Pulitzer Prize, though not for History (that went to a new book about the Civil War) or, as Mukherjee more whimsically categorizes his own book, Biography (that went to a biography of George Washington); instead, he won in the General Nonfiction category, which, though prosaic, is certainly appropriate for a work of scientific journalism. The Emperor of all Maladies reminded me most of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, the previous year’s popular science blockbuster, with both focusing on bringing complicated science to laypeople through the life stories of ordinary individuals.What Mukherjee has achieved in less than 500 pages is truly remarkable: a fairly comprehensive history, from ancient Egypt to the present day, of the discovery of cancer, its different manifestations, its causes, and the development of treatments ranging from radical surgery to sophisticated pharmaceuticals. That he manages this without alienating people who come to the material with no more knowledge than one could glean from newspaper articles and high school biology is impressive. Only in the last third of the book did I find the science stretching the limits of my imaginative capacity and my memory of AP Biology and Genetics classes, as he goes into details of oncogenes, tumor suppressors, retroviruses, etc. I managed to stay just the right side of comprehension, but I can guess that others with less patience or brain power to devote to their chosen leisure reading might have started skimming or, worse, given up.When meditating on cancer there is a fine line between depression and hope, and Mukherjee proceeds carefully to prove that there is reason for both. On the negative side, it seems likely that in the near future one in two men and one in three women in America will suffer from some form of cancer in their lifetime. All the 1950s talk about a ‘magic bullet’ to cure cancer has fizzled; there are so many disparate types of cancer that it seems impossible that there could one day be a panacea. Furthermore, the search for environmental and manmade carcinogens faces ongoing resistance from lobby groups. The most discouraging sections of the book were about smoking and the nation’s reluctance to warn of the high risk of lung cancer. And it wasn’t just the tobacco industry that opposed measures such as strongly-worded warning labels on cigarette packets; doctors, politicians, and smokers in general (who formed more than 40% of the population at the height of smoking’s appeal in the 1940s-1950s) denied the truth that was in front of their eyes.However, this book offers the reader plenty of reasons to be hopeful. Mukherjee follows the treatment trajectory of a number of his patients, including Carla Reed, a young mother with leukemia. Her story opens the book and, as Mukherjee reveals in the last chapter, he assumed his book would also finish with the end of her story – her death. But this was not the case; instead, he comes to a close with an anecdote about going to visit Carla on the fifth anniversary of her remission, to celebrate her new chance at life. My overwhelming sense from this book is that most cancers are indeed treatable, and new medications and procedures are being developed all the time. When cancer affects us – because, for our families if not for ourselves, it is a question of when, not if – there should be no cause for despair. The ‘biography’ of cancer probably does not have an end point, but there is every chance that we can live long lives alongside it."

I'm not a doctor or a nurse, though I've had a close member of the family pass away from Cancer, and perhaps that's what keeps me going, since I've been morbidly fascinated and terrified of the disease since.The chapters I've read have been so hard to get through (it has so far covered childhood Lukemia (lord, the tears!), mastectomies, surgery without anesthesia, disfigurement, tumors erupting from the bone and through the skin, surgeons with over-sized egos, and other such terrible things) but I'm still reading, and I'm still enthralled/moved/disturbed.Cancer is a terrible, terrible disease, and this book captures the essence of how it has changed history, medicine, and our lives as we know it. More to come...On edit:And so I finished this book about a month ago and I still couldn't wrap my head around how epic is is. There is a lot of information to get through, but I have learned more about cancer in the hours I've had with this book than I ever did in a lifetime--not even as I watched my own loved-one die of the disease. Cancer, the phantom, has now become cancer, the complex, amazing, all-consuming, aggressive, immortal, microscopic, biological, genetic disease. I don't understand everything about it, but it has become real and tangible--no longer the abstract ""concept"" that it once was to me. This book has, in fact, helped me quit smoking better than any fad psychobabble. I quit smoking half-way through the book. I had been smoking for over a decade, and while there was a two-year interval somewhere when I quit because I was pregnant and then because I wanted to take care of my child, I ""relapsed"" into my habits and my addiction. The entire time I *wasn't* smoking, I just wanted to smoke. Now it's different. Now all I can remember when I think about smoking is THE EMPEROR OF ALL MALADIES and how it moves me to understand in a split second why I don't want to smoke anymore. This book has truly made an impact on me. "
23,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,5,"A terrific, comprehensive look at the history and mechanics of cancer, starting at Imhotep and ending at the no-longer-quite-literal bleeding edge of science. Mukherjee is an engaging and very careful writer; you get the sense that he pored over each sentence to make it as clear as possible. It worked, too.For we book nerds, he's scattered references to a wonderful variety of books throughout: Herodotus, Italo Calvino and Joan Didion all make their way in here, as well as this sentence, to which he adds no comment: ""Normal cells are identically normal; malignant cells become unhappily malignant in unique ways."" How great is that? You know how sometimes you read a book like this and your impression is, ""Here's an average scientist who's a pretty good writer, so I guess he's doing an okay job at conveying basic information to a lay person like me""? That's not the impression you get here. You feel like you're in the presence of a rare brain here.*You should know ahead of time that this is not a quick read. It's dense; Mukherjee has a lot of information for you, and he means to put it all down. I read this at about half my usual reading pace. You should be prepared for a commitment. Also, it's kindof a bummer. It turns out that cancer is bad for you.But it's absolutely worth it. The book, not cancer. Cancer: bad.My book club ran a poll recently about the best book of the 21st century thus far, and Emperor of All Maladies was the only nonfiction finalist. I thought it was an interesting choice. Now I totally get it. Cancer is a modern disease**; this book, laying out what we thought we knew and what we now know we don't, feels like it describes where the world is now in a peculiarly fitting way. I loved it.* By the way, check out his sources occasionally as you go. You'll be amazed at how many of them are primary: he seems to have personally interviewed practically everyone.** Modern largely because, as Mukherjee points out, people used to die before they got a chance to develop it."

As said, it is huge and tells so many things, but worth reading anyhow. From my point of view, the view of a trained scientist with some cancer knowledge, and a lover of medicine, science and history, this book is fantastic. Absolutelly recommended.

Though I took over five months to read it, I found everything about it fascinating.I have to say that I felt an urgency to read this book before receiving a cancer diagnosis. My mother died of cancer before my twelfth birthday, and ever since then I’ve enjoyed reading books about cancer (fiction, biographies, general non-fiction, medical textbooks, all of them) and have been terrified about getting it. In fact, with my genes and some of my behaviors/environments, it’s amazing I’ve made it at least this far cancer free. I have a feeling if/when I get cancer, I won’t be as addicted to cancer themed books, at least not for entertainment purposes.In 1965 my uncle, a doctor, said he thought that in a decade there would be a cure, and that nobody would die from cancer. Was he ever wrong! And the author of this book does a masterful job of explaining why, and why cancers are so complicated. I enjoyed the quotes that started off each chapter, and how they stem from both science and literature. I admired how cancer is covered from the very personal (the author’s thoughts and perspective, and stories of a very few patients he’s known), the historical all the way through history, the research and its successes and failures, to date, the science, the various cancers touched on, so many aspects, and that’s very fitting for this subject, a biography of cancer. I would have liked a bit more on the individual patients, but since I wouldn’t want any cuts in the other portions, we’d most likely be talking about a 1,000 page book; actually, that would have been fine with me.This book is definitely for laypeople, but for me it helped to have a bit of medical/oncology background/experience; it’s not necessary though. I often love books by doctor writers and I’ll definitely read (almost) all other books this author writes. He’s an excellent writer, I love his writing style, and he made every aspect of this subject so interesting.I didn’t thoroughly read the notes pages 473-532 or the index pages 545-571, but I read everything else.Highly recommended for anyone interested in cancer."
27,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7943826-moumeeta,5,"I first heard about this book a year back and was sure I would never read it. Medical non-fiction is not something I want to wrap my head around. So finally when I did pick it up from the library it was because a young acquaintance was undergoing chemotherapy and I thought it was perhaps ""important"" to understand cancer. I am surprised at what a gripping read the book turned out to be. I ran through the initial 100 or so pages that chronicle the first instances of cancer in history. Mukherjee's ability with words is obvious from the very first page. He makes the whole guided tour of cancer a fascinating one. At the same time, there is an emotional undertone to the whole story. There is the evil enemy cancer and there are the good guys........a mixed bunch of chemists, biologists and doctors who are fighting valiantly against a seemingly undefeatable evil. The personality of each of these contributors to the fight against cancer, is charmingly analysed by the writer and is one of the things I especially liked about the book.But after a fortnight and with more than half the book left, I realised I was losing the thread because of the numerous people and events that had been explained. So I actually (and geekily) made notes at the back of the book in pencil so that the basic developments would be clear to me. It still took me another month or so to complete the book. I cried, felt triumphant and figuratively bit my nails as I waited for some sort of denoument. The cure of course was never coming but I still felt there SHOULD be something. Mukherjee makes this whole labyrinthine journey seem like some Greek adventure. In the end, a basic understanding of the disease was all that decades of research arrived at. However, with an opponent as formidable as that described by the writer, this was as good a climax as those I have come across in any good thriller. The book reads like a dedication to all those who lost their lives to the disease and to those who made it their live's purpose to vanquish it. There is a strong ""personal"" sense to the writing that elevates the book. It is definitely among the most significant books that I have ever read.  quotes from the book:""I explained the situation as best as I could.......And it is - I paused here for emphasis, lifting my eyes up - often curable. Curable. Carla nodded at that word, her eyes sharpening..........We spoke for an hour, perhaps longer. It was now nine thirty in the morning. The city below us had stirred fully awake. The door shut behind me as I left, and a whoosh of air blew me outward and sealed Carla in.""""Nature,"" Rouss wrote in 1966 ""sometimes seems possessed of a sardonic humour."" And the final lesson of Rous sarcoma virus had been its most sardonic by far. For nearly six decades, the Rous virus had seduced biologists - Spiegelman most sadly among them - down a false path. Yet the false path had ultimately circled back to the right destination - from viral src toward cellular src and to the notion of internal proto-oncogenes sitting omnipresently in the normal cell's genome.In Lewis Carroll's poem, when the hunters finally capture the deceptive snark, it reveals itself, not to be a foreign beast, but one of the human hunters sent to trap it. And so it turned out with cancer. Cancer genes came from within the human genome. Indeed the Greeks had been peculiarly prescient yet again in their use of the term oncos. Cancer was intrinsically ""loaded"" in our genome, awaiting activation.We were destined to carry this fatal burden in our genes - our own genetic ""oncos""."

It's extremely well written and intensely, compellingly readable, with some pretty terrifying details, and completely clear even for this scientific illiterate. Mukherjee never loses sight of the humanity of researchers or patients, which helps us understand decisions, responses and deductions that look pretty shonky from the outside. Some of this is rage inducing, no less because of the extremely calm presentation of stories that, you sense, probably had the author throwing things as he wrote. The appalling history of 'radical mastectomy' where male surgeons competed to cut off as much of women's bodies as they could on the untested theory that this would prevent metastasis. Lump in your breast? Say goodbye to your shoulder muscle and chest wall. One of the small triumphs in this book is the way we see women rising up to demand a say in their own treatment. As for the story of how the tobacco companies conspired to obfuscate or hide the link between smoking and cancer...holy god there's a lot of people who should have spent the rest of their lives in prison for corporate manslaughter. It's seriously informative about a disease that probably more than 1 in 3 of us will get, and eye opening about the reality of a cure and the difficulties entailed in finding one and then keeping up with cancer's malignant ingenuity. A real tour de force of popular science, highly recommended. "

It's interesting and engaging, and I'm learning a lot!But at 150 pages, my attention started to flag, and so did my enjoyment. Thank God, I'm just not that curious about cancer. Not enough to slog through 500 pages about it. All that detail, much of which felt repetitive after a while -- yet another misunderstood scientist with some personality quirks, lots of failures and then discovery, recognized or maybe not recognized until after his death, names of chemicals, cellular action, whatever whatever. Basically, I had a stack of more appealing (and way shorter) books on my nightstand calling out to me, and my ego finally lost the war because life is too short.I'm giving it three stars because I recognize its greatness, and it probably deserves more than three.

At first I thought I was just out of shape, then I thought it was a recurrence of childhood asthma, then I went to the clinic of the university where I was attending grad school at the time to get chest x-rays, and the next day someone was sent to pull me out of class and tell me I should go see a doctor like, now.They thought I had pneumonia, but in fact, it turned out to be a grapefruit-size tumor pressing against my lungs. It was Hodgkin's Lymphoma.The Emperor of All Maladies, by research oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee, is a biography of cancer — its appearance throughout history, starting with a mention by the Egyptian physician Imhotep, circa 2600 B.C., and Queen Atossa of Persia, who underwent what was probably the first recorded mastectomy in history, our growing understanding and misunderstanding of the nature of this dreaded mutant cellular monster, which is really an entire family of monsters, all uniquely and spitefully different, and the eternal search for a ""cure.""Mukherjee is an engaging writer, mixing history and social commentary, from a fairly detached perspective, with very detailed explanations of the biochemistry and genetics of cancer and its treatments. He does this in an accessible way, but this is definitely a ""sciencey"" book which will require you to draw on at least your high school-level biology and chemistry. Even if the chapters on researching the origins and cellular makeup of cancer make your eyes glaze over, though, the contemporary history of cancer research, mixed with some of Mukherjee's own cases, will keep you focused on the relevance of the topic.I suppose the weakness of the book (and the reason why it only got 4 stars) is that denseness - while Mukherjee is a good writer, at times it was like reading abstracts from a medical journal. But for anyone who's had a brush with cancer, first, second, or third-hand, there's plenty to find interesting.Cancer isn't a single disease, and there will probably be no single ""cure for cancer."" Oncologists seem to be moving towards a model similar to that of AIDS treatment — many forms of cancer are becoming something that, while not yet, ""curable,"" are no longer inevitably terminal either. Something manageable. Not all of them, but some of them are cancers you ""die with"" rather than ""die of.""And then there are the success stories. By the time of my diagnosis in 2001, Hodgkin's Disease was one of the ""good cancers"" — easily treatable, with a five-year survival rate of better than 90%.""Easily treatable,"" is relative of course — chemo and radiation still sucked. I understand treatment for Hodgkin's has continued to improve in the last fifteen years or so, and now they are working on administering smaller doses.I have been cancer-free for almost fourteen years now.

As a doctor it was great to read about stuff we take for granted and we don't even think anymore who invented them, how were they produced. Big mistake. We should ask ourselves all the time, we should be critical all the time, and we should not take things for granted. Paradoxically, nowadays we have so much information literally in our hands (wikipedia and smartphones and internet) but we are lest interested for history of things. Elder generations knew more then we do nowadays. I feel great that I read this book. As I said, informative, I found out sooo many stuff about diseases I meet almost on a daily basis on the intensive care. And also emotional. When you work on the intensive care unit for years and see so much suffering and dying, you start judging diseases emotionless, procentually and often you stop seeing the person behind the disease. When we receive a patient with leukemia and a generalised infection because he has no immune system anymore, we stamp the chances from the beginning. ""He doesnt have long to live"", ""he /she is as good as dead"". I have seen such patients who got well and resumed their therapies. This book was also refresher courser in careness and a lesson in empathy. Anyway, nice job, reading was a pleasure most of the time, akribically researched. The minus star - because sometimes was just toooo much information. Pages after pages about clinical trials were sometimes boring. And also some minus - Mukherjee did a fantastic monography of cancer, but he forgot to mention one thing - that alternative therapies a lot of people turn to when they lose their hope in medicine - acupuncture, yoga, vitamines,antioxidants, alternative therapies. The way a lot of publicity nowadays is manipulating our fears, thus making us buy a lot of crap that is scientifically bullshit. I would have dedicated a chapter to that. For example, I think ketonic diets were proved to be of some importance in some type of cancers. Also, i know somebody who is a fruitarian, thinks he is going to get purified by eating only certain sorts of fruit. The whole natural remedy stuff, that would have brought probably another 200 pages to this book. But still, this is just something small in the great job the author did writing this book. I really and strongly recommend this book. There is also the whole philosophical way of looking at this disease, and Mukherjee talks a great deal about it and leaves doors open for thinking - the tumor cell, the body working against itself. The tumor cell is ""immortal"", one of the main wishes of the main kind. To live forever. But is this good? Saramago has a book about that. Wanting not to die is a good thing? Dying is a normal process. Every normal cell is programmed to die. We are our cells => we are programmed to die, no matter what. Of course, unnatural causes are excluded but are also avoidable sometimes. The whole philosophical aspect is also hugely interesting. And there is also the chaos that these cancer cells bring with themselves. Is it chaos, is there a pattern in there? Are the cancer cells the ultimate survivors. If we die, they die too. So, they are not very intelligent after all. Because they destroy their host, the host that keeps them alive. Ah, There are still so many questions. Read the book, it will worth your time."

If somebody had told me a book about cancer could be such a page turner, I would have never believed it. As far as I can understand, this is a very accurate book from the scientific point of view, it has a lot about the history of medicine, from ancient times until the present but it also has real stories about real people, that help us understand the challenges this disease (or better said, diseases) represents. I reached the end thinking that maybe I would have liked to study molecular biology after all..."
33,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce,5,"This book is subtitled “A Biography of Cancer.” Mukherjee is an oncologist at Columbia University, and he writes well; the text reads less like a history than as a novel. Yet Mukherjee is scrupulously factual. This history, with a few gestures toward the confusions and mysteries of cancer and treatment in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, really begins with the research of Sidney Farber at Boston Children’s Hospital in the late 1940’s, when Farber began approaching the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia with anti-folates. To me, as a pediatrician, Farber’s name is legendary, as is that of Louis Diamond who worked with him. About twenty years later, when I was just an intern, prospects for these children were marginally better, but the outcome of their courses were often heartbreaking. The cases that Mukherjee describes affected me markedly as I read about them; they were so nearly the same as those children I cared for. “To name an illness is to describe a certain condition of suffering – a literary act before it becomes a medical one.” With the naming, with the diagnosis, begins a seemingly inexorable process of evaluation, treatment, and waiting. As Mukherjee states, “The only way out would be the way through,” a statement and fact that hauntingly remind me of Dante’s journey through the Inferno, probably an apt metaphor. Reading this book makes me want to return to a reading of medical and surgical pioneers whom Mukherjee mentions – Vesalius, Galen, Hippocrates, Virchow, Baillie, and even the author of the ancient Edwin Smith papyrus, all works that I read many years ago when in the thrall of reading original works in the history of medicine. The books are still on my shelves, and I itch to reopen them.Equally fascinating is the only gradual application of true scientific principles to cancer therapy, the surge in the use of controlled studies and statistical analysis that we so much take for granted today. Too often grand theorizing, anecdotal descriptions, and reliance on the word and reputations of authoritative physicians guided therapy. Mukherjee traces cancer treatment from doing nothing (because there seemed nothing to do), to surgery, on to the application of radiation to tumors, and then to the introduction of chemotherapy and beyond. The story is one of science – sometimes methodical, sometimes serendipitous – human egos and personalities – sometimes arrogant, sometimes humble – and politics – often driven by simplistic notions and individual agendas. It is a fascinating story, fascinatingly told. (Sometimes I wished for more of the perspectives of the patients themselves.) When discussing the political initiatives and maneuverings with regard to legislation funding “the war on cancer,” Mukherjee provides important insights as to how a national mood can drive legislation; during the fifties and sixties the national threat was seen as external, fueling the Cold War and its responses, whereas by the seventies the locus of anxieties was more internal – political cynicism, spiritual rot, etc – and the focus on cancer as an ultimate threat burgeoned. I was pleased to see that Mukherjee has included information about the history of hospice and palliative medicine; I had not known that the first hospice program in the US was launched in 1974 at the Yale-New Haven Hospital, just five years after I graduated from the Yale School of Medicine.Preventing cancer attracted more interest during the past thirty years or so. Often these investigations required the method of statistical correlation, tobacco smoking and lung cancer being a case in point. Mukherjee is not shy about outlining the strategies and deceptions of the tobacco industry to escape culpability and regulation, and he is equally forthright about acknowledging the resistance on the part of patients to quitting smoking, all leading to a continuing exposure on the part of millions of future patients to a potent carcinogen. Infectious agents also – viruses and bacteria – were found to be related to the development of cancer. What was really needed, however, was a better understanding of carcinogenesis, why and how cancers develop. With the recognition that early diagnosis and the institution of earlier treatment was important in curing cancer, a new emphasis on early detection through screening procedures developed – Pap smears for cervical cancer, mammograms for breast cancer. At the same time, in the 1980’s, with the onset of the AIDS epidemic and further chemotherapeutic advances with a variety of cancers, oncologists pushed for ever more aggressive treatment regimens, often combined with bone marrow transplants. Complicating this period, rife with both unwarranted optimism and vigorous skepticism, were the appearance of shoddy scientific studies and even cases of researcher fraud, often accompanied by the relaxation of FDA oversight in the release of drugs being used. Eventually the realization came that cancer was a variety of diseases, each requiring different understandings and treatments. Attention by necessity turned back to basic science, the study of fundamental mechanisms, back to the cancer cell itself. I found Mukherjee’s discussion of virology, retroviruses, and oncogenes especially clear and interesting. The genetics of cancer is absolutely fascinating, with new knowledge, new drugs, and new insights appearing all the time.“Medicine begins with storytelling. Patients tell stories to describe illness; doctors tell stories to understand it.” Mukherjee has captured these stories into a compelling and sensitive narrative.Now retired, I have less immediate access to information at the frontiers of medical knowledge and research. But information is increasingly all around us, in the print media, on the internet. Granted, much of this information is sensationalized and unreliable, but nevertheless there are many sources which present good science, carefully reviewed and reported. I shall be reading these sources now more diligently. Mukherjee’s book reads like a thriller, a thriller chock full of frustrations, coincidences, missed chances and brilliant insights. It is gripping at the same time that it is deeply humane. It enables the reader to understand current articles and scientific findings in a fresh way, putting current research into a comprehensible context. The journey is fascinating and ongoing. And, perhaps above all, it brings one back again and again to the lives and experiences of those who have encountered and lived with cancer in its many forms. It was a privilege to have read this book, and I am grateful to Mukherjee for it."

Like Gawande, who influenced him, the author is a rare practicing physician who has great writing talent. He covers well the bases on the history of cancer science and treatment while rendering the enlightening personal experiences of his own patients and the political context of the enterprise. Written with a journalist's flair for story and drama and an educator's gift for conveying complex scientific and medical issues for the layman and savvy reader alike. His insider's insight and perceptions on the key breakthroughs and disappointments in the progress in both prevention and treatment realms made this relatively lengthy read worth the effort."

We've been reading some of the books from previous shortlists for the Wellcome Book Prize, and this was by far the longest of the ones I have so far read. It's also a non-fiction, a pretty heavy and dense non-fiction, which means it's a pretty time-consuming read for me, but with all of that said it was a mixed bag overall. This follows the 'life' of Cancer and what we know of the illness which claims so many lives yearly in so many forms. Cancer is something I had limited and vague knowledge of before reading this, and even now I feel like I learned a lot about some of it, but not a lot about other parts. This is a fairly objective look at the history, the discoveries and the progress we have made towards determining the cause and cures for Cancers. One element I found a bit lacking in this read was the connection. I tend to find biographies or factual books pretty dry when there's no people to really connect to, and although there are plenty of cancer-patient cases and discoveries cited in this book, most of them are cited by way of explaining a discovery or development, rather than to show what it's truly like. I personally like to get a bit more invested in a story, and heaven knows there are plenty of very tragic cancer-based stories both fiction and non-fiction out there so I don't mean I wanted this to be another one, but I would have enjoyed a bit more of a personal driver for the topics this book covered. We are being told the story of Cancer from the author who is clearly incredibly knowledgeable about the topic. There are some elements of Cancer which are hugely complicated and took generations to fully uncover and unwind, but I think the author does a pretty good job of helping the reader to understand most of these discoveries. There were some moments (quite a few) in this book where I felt like we had a fair bit of repetition. We're focused on various types of treatments and diagnosis and Cancer strains, and it can all get a little bit too same-y as a reader sometimes, especially if you start out with limited knowledge of genes, genomes, chromosomes etc. I do think that lots of it is explained in a simple way, but it can become a bit overwhelming at times to be bombarded with all the scientific language of the Cancer sector and try to take it all in. There were a few elements of the book I particularly liked and those mostly focused on the historical elements of the illness and the initial break-through discoveries. I found the more modern discoveries to be a little too baffling at times or a bit too similar to things I already knew from studying in School, but the older treatments and break-throughs were a mixture of grotesque, fascinating and horrible all at once which kept me quite engaged.I also found the more recent discussion of causes, e.g. smoking, to be a really eye-opening and highly interesting facet. The fact that we had huge corporations denying the science to boost their money intake and eventually we had to push out tobacco companies by removing advertising and adding large warnings to packaging...Maybe it's just because I love learning about packaging and advertising anyways, but I loved that whole section.I also found the discussions of money and wider-world organisations to be pretty intriguing. Of course doing scientific research costs a lot, and so to gather the money to research there were things like the jimmy fund and other charities and organisations which were set up explicitly to research Cancer. These campaigns started off the advertising boom for science and also played upon the guilt and fear of the population and I found that element to be very cool and a new angle I hadn't thought of much when it came to Cancer. On the flip side, along with the repetitive nature of some sections of the book we also have a fair few occasions where the author goes off on tangents and discusses things we already know or that weren't all that relevant/interesting to me personally. I think there were certainly some parts of this book which really could have been cut and filed down a bit... Overall I learned a lot, not least that the journey has a long way to go, and it's incredibly complicated. I do think there's been a whole lot of progress and it's great to see it laid out comprehensively in a book like this, but I also think that new discoveries and plans which are discussed at the end of the book could really change things. I think this is a book I would recommend to people, but probably only if you have a real desire for the intimate details of Cancer as this book does go into a fair bit of detail. It's long and sometimes tedious, but ultimately very fascinating too, and I would rate it a 3*s in the end. "
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) released a report on February 4th, 2015 stating that in 2012 an estimate of 8.2 million deaths were due to cancer. In 2030, this number is expected to rise to 13 million people around the world (mostly in economically developing countries). Cancer is expected to surpass heart disease to become the most common cause of death in coming years. 	It is against this backdrop that I started this book, the colossal significance of cancer baffled me and I wanted to know the whole story. What is cancer?	Cancer is not one disease but many diseases. We call them all “cancer” because they share a fundamental feature: the abnormal growth of cells. Beyond biological commonalities, there are cultural, political and psychological themes that justify a unifying narrative. 	Siddhartha Mukherjee describes our interaction with cancer through a narrative that relies heavily on metaphors. Cancer is our own living system gone amok. It pits us against our very own selves and in this war the line between friend and foe, us and them, is almost nonexistent. A civil war right in our blood and flesh, annihilating the very body that it feeds on, this is a story of betrayal and desecration. 	Mukherjee writes with the flair of a poet and exuberance of a historian. Starting from the great Egyptian physician Imhotep, he illustrates the confusion that has surround cancer ever since. From the stretcher of renaissance surgeons to the modernized clinics of oncology, from proponents of radical mastectomy to the advocates of intensive chemotherapy, the story of cancer is deeply humane and utterly tragic. For the author too, the story is a very personal one, it is his way of empathizing with all those who are fight this disease. 	There are multiple narratives that go side by side, scientific evolution is a slow process and unfortunately there is never a paucity of hurdles that halt scientific advancement. Scientists and surgeons tried to fight cancer with surgical knife, high frequency radiation and toxic chemotherapies it has been tiresome but rewarding struggle. Mukherjee meticulously describes this struggle with a focus on USA, where major research was being carried out, and educates the reader not only about the scientific but the political and cultural struggle that had to fought by victims of cancer. This book is full of technical and scientific details, and written for serious readers who want to understand the nature and character of this malady. I loved the literary approach and the historical struggle between science and society, the politics involved and the sheer magnanimity of some individuals who dedicated their entire lives for this cause. But the fight goes on, and there is no respite yet. As the authors puts it 	“In Lewis Carroll’s ‘Through the looking glass’, the Red Queen tells Alice that the world keeps shifting so quickly under her feet that she has to keep running just to keep her position. This is our predicament with cancer: We are forced to keep running merely to keep still.”Cancer is always changing itself; it recurs in different shapes and invades our body from within with utmost precision and secrecy. But we have to keep fighting, fiercely and courageously. Here is a poem that kept coming to my mind all the while I was reading this book…. It is deeply reminiscent of the struggle agianst this “Emperor of all Maladies”.Do not go gentle into that good night,Old age should burn and rave at close of day;Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Though wise men at their end know dark is right,Because their words had forked no lightning theyDo not go gentle into that good night.Good men, the last wave by, crying how brightTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,Do not go gentle into that good night.Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sightBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light.								- Dylan Thomas"
38,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"The specter of brain cancer has been haunting the headlines lately: Senator Ted Kennedy, 2009; Beau Biden, son of then Vice-President Joe Biden, 2015; and Senator John McCain, diagnosed in 2017. In his State of the Union address of 2016, President Obama declared a national commitment to finding a cure for cancer. This is not the first time a call for national resources to find a cure has been made. It certainly will not be the last.Cancer's history goes back at least 4000 years. Both the disease and the scientific study of it have left complicated legacies. It is these legacies that Mukherjee captures in what he calls a biography of cancer, but which is also a biography of medicine.Mukherjee notes the accomplishments of William Halsted, a brilliant surgeon who performed mastectomies at the end of the 19th century. To combat the re-occurrence of the disease he pioneered radical mastectomies, surmising that the relapses were due to incomplete excision of the malignant cells. Halsted's skill and daring were inspirational. Yet, the aggressive technique evolved into an ethically troubling result:  “A macabre marathon was in progress. Halsted and his disciples would rather evacuate the entire contents of the body than be faced with cancer recurrences. In Europe, one surgeon evacuated three ribs and other parts of the rib cage and amputated a shoulder and a collarbone from a woman with breast cancer.” (p.65) The result of these heroic surgeries was lackluster.  “Of the seventy-six patients with breast cancer treated with the 'radical method,' only forty had survived more than three years. Thirty-six, or nearly half the original number, had died within three years of surgery — consumed by a disease supposedly 'uprooted' from the body.” (p.68)Chemotherapy's path followed a similar trajectory. Early successes with cytotoxic drugs failed to eliminate later relapses. Even keeping the patients alive as the poisons infiltrated their bodies was a problem.  “It was trial and error on a giant human scale — with the emphasis, it seemed at times, distinctly on error....In...[a] particularly tenacious trial, known as the eight-in-one study, children with brain tumors were given eight drugs in a single day. Predictably, horrific complications ensued. Fifteen of the patients needed blood transfusions. Six percent were hospitalized with life-threatening infections. Fourteen percent of the children suffered kidney damage; three lost their hearing. One patient died of septic shock. Yet, despite the punishing escalation of drugs and doses, the efficacy of the drug regimen remained minimal. Most of the children in the eight-in-one trial died soon afterward, having only marginally responded to chemotherapy.” (p.208)Despite these set-backs, an infectious optimism sparked the nation in the sixties. What was needed was a convergence of national will and resources. Mukherjee likens that optimism to a religious movement.  “Religious movements and cults are often founded on a tetrad of elements: a prophet, a prophecy, a book, and a revelation.” (p.177) (Publicity genius and well-connected socialite Mary Lasker was the prophet; the work at Sidney Farber's Cancer Center was the prophecy, and Solomon Garb's CURE FOR CANCER; A NATIONAL GOAL was the book). Mukherjee cites the 1969 moon landing as the revelation. He withholds judgment on the mixed results. A magic bullet continued to elude researchers. Medical endeavor entered a schizophrenic phase. Lab researchers continued to ask questions about cause, anatomy and mechanics. Clinicians demanded more effective drugs. In 1973 Stewart Alsop was confined in an NIH ward for a rare blood condition. He later wrote:  “Saving the individual patient is not the essential mission. Enormous efforts are made to do so, or at least to prolong the patient's life to the last possible moment. But the basic purpose is not to save that patient's particular life but to find means of saving the lives of others.” (p.203) Lab research and clinical research diverged into separate paths. Mukherjee describes the Tenth International Cancer Congress held in Houston on May 27, 1970. Howard Temin, an immunologist described how RNA could generate DNA.  “...the conference epitomized the virtually insurmountable segregation between cancer therapy and cancer science. Chemotherapy and surgery were discussed in one room. Viral carcinogenesis was discussed in another. It was as if a sealed divider had been constructed through the middle of the world of cancer, with 'cause' on one side and 'cure' on the other. Few scientists or clinical oncologists crossed between the two isolated worlds.” (p.355)In 1982 Robert Weinberg and Lakshmi Charon Padhy began isolating the actual genes in a cancer cell that caused pathological symptoms. One such oncogene, neu was comprised of a protruding fragment located outside the cell membrane. Neu was the perfect target for antibody attack. Such an antibody could have led to a targeted anti-cancer drug. However, Weinberg pursued other interests.In the late 1980's Axel Ullrich discovered the human version of the neu oncogene, Her-2/neu at Genentech's lab. However, it was Dennis Slalom, a UCLA oncologist, who tested the oncogene on his vast collection of cancer tissue samples. He found two types of breast cancer, those whose growth was amplified by the oncogene, and those that were unreactive. With this knowledge, Ullrich searched for a drug that would incapacitate the oncogene's amplification signal. However, Genentech had decided to abandon the high risk area of cancer drug development. Ullrich ultimately left Genentech for a lab in Germany. Fortunately, Slalom exploited his contacts at Genentech and in 1990 one of them, Paul Carter, had produced Herceptin, an antibody designed to inhibit the action of the Her-2/neu oncogene.The scientific discoveries chronicled in the latter half of the book are dramatic. There is the discovery of kinases, proteins that function as on/off switches to other proteins. There is the discovery of chimeras, dislocations of genes on to different chromosomes, and the application of gene mapping to tumor chromosomes. Yet, Mukherjee never neglects the legacy of the countless human cancer patients. At one point he memorializes the list of his own patients who have died. He speaks of his own balancing act between stoking his patient's imagination but avoiding delusional thinking. He comes as close as possible to depicting what it must feel like to be a cancer patient: the world implodes. He describes one of his patients, Carla Reed.  “Her melancholy hardened into something impenetrable, a carapace, and she pulled into it instinctually, shutting everything out.” He notes that a friend who normally accompanied Carla had stopped coming. Carla explains.  “'We had a falling-out.' There was something steely, mechanical in her voice. 'She needed to be needed, and I just couldn't fulfill that demand. Not now.'” (p.169). We speak today of empowering patients, of “informed consent.” In the end, the consent boils down to a combination of determination and trust. In that sense, we are linked to generations of past cancer patients. No one knows if they would have consented to those heroic surgeries or deadly chemo cocktails, given the chance to do it over again. As human longevity increases, one day many of us will be confronted with the same dilemma. We cannot know how we will choose until we get there. Yet, there is some solace in knowing that regardless, we will never be helpless victims. Mukherjee's book helps us to step back and see our lives as part of an ongoing process.This is a book meant to appeal both to scientists and laypersons. Although difficult, it rewards the reader's effort. Its narrative covers both the political and medical landscapes of cancer research."

These little imbalances of the bodily functions fade into obscurity when a human being comes face to face with the non-contagious, lethal killers. A harmless looking lump somewhere in the body, a little pain while swallowing food or water are all precursors of the most dreaded aberration of them all : Cancer. Siddhartha Mukherjee explores this elusive, advanced and highly adaptable predator in this exhaustive volume.The most humbling experience in my life was a visit to the most renowned Cancer ward in Kerala. The person I went to meet was a bubbly, cheerful and exuberant young girl in her early 20's and had just joined for her studies to become a staff nurse when she had frequent bouts of exhaustion that left her helpless. One test lead to another and finally the horrific realization hit the family : it was cancer of the lungs and slowly moving into a malignant phase. A few hours before we were visiting, the girl tried to leap out of the window in a desperate attempt to take her own life but was restrained by the hospital staff. Bitter and downright acerbic she refused to see anyone including her parents during that day. All that I could do was to stay outside the room with her blank looking parents and a few other acquaintances. What shook me most was the sights around me : little children who have no inkling of why they are there, the relatives with their expressions of equal parts despair and hope and the hospital staff who go about their duties briskly. It took me a while to recover and I have always looked at health a little more reverently from then on. These lines were not meant to convey a touch of melodrama but the way this book looked at the disease reminded me of that evening.After finishing the book, I spent a little time scouring the internet for reviews and a lot many reviewers called it a detective story. There is a lot of truth in this for this is a slow unfolding of the engima surrounding Cancer through the decades. But I felt this to be more of a horror story for at least until the late 80's till humanity figured out the basis of carcinogenesis, treatment was little short of butchery. You simply cannot read of the surgical procedure like radical mastectomy without cringing in your seat ! But no matter how horrific they were, each of these treatment methods had a part to play in understanding this monster. As much as this is a story of a disease, its victims and survivors, it is also a story of gigantic mistakes, unbelievable arrogance and egoes of men that sacrificed hundreds of lives in the name of medical practice. Mukherjee is a wonderful storyteller for his prose is not cut and dried like non fiction and flows like good fiction is supposed to, effortless and easy to comprehend.It is a poignant, moving, horrifying and brilliant history of the most powerful disease man has ever encountered. As two reasearchers said Cancer is a distorted version of our own selves. Undoubtedly, this distorted twin of ours is far more advanced and versatile entity than we ever will be !The points of contention I had was that while a lot of attention and detail is given to Leukemia, Breast and Lung Cancer the other forms of the disease like Brain Tumor is just hinted upon. To be fair to the author, such a discussion would also have resulted in a book more than a thousand pages big. Also missing is that pivotal part on Cancer prevention. Which are the do's and dont's for a normal human being to avoid carcinogens and lead a reasonably safe life ? This again is barely touched upon here.A solid five stars and highly recommended. For want of a better classification - This is a magesterial work !"

The case studies are great and really helped keep the novel from getting overrun because there was A LOT of science, only a small bit of which I could accurately follow. At the same time, I learned a ton about the history of cancer, which was the point. I wanted to read this for that reason. The larger story about breast cancer and the smaller (but important) story concerning the discovery that, yes!, cigarettes can cause cancer, were two parts that I found incredibly interesting and maddening. In between, you hear about a lot of different people doing all they can to fight such an intense enemy. This book isn't for everyone, but if you're willing to work through some science-heavy moments, you'll learn a lot and may even find yourself moved by the stories. "

Medicine begins with storytelling. Patients tell stories to describe illness; doctors tell stories to understand it. Science tells its own stories to explain diseases. The story of one cancer's genesis – of carcinogens causing mutations in internal genes, unleashing cascading pathways in cells that then cycle through mutation, selection, and survival – represents the most cogent outline we have of cancer's birth.
The Emperor of All Maladies is a book of stories: author and cancer physician/researcher Siddhartha Mukherjee states that his intention with this book was to write the “biography” of cancer, and to achieve this, he looks back to the earliest account of the disease (found on a forty-five-hundred-year-old Egyptian papyrus), traces the standards of care for the afflicted through the millenia, and along the way, provides biographies for the cancer physicians/researchers who sought “the” cure, and intermittently, shares the details of his own patients' battles. This is a lot of information, and while I appreciate the ambition of Mukherjee's project, it didn't quite synthesise into a cohesive whole for me. Sometimes dull and frequently overwritten, I also found much fascinating in this book and am happy to have picked it up.
Normal cells are identically normal; malignant cells become unhappily malignant in unique ways.
As I noted recently when I reviewed Mukherjee's The Gene, I was interested in reading Emperor in order to have information to combat those conspiracy theorists who blithely aver that “they” have found the cure for cancer and are suppressing it “for profit”. If nothing else, this book makes it clear that cancer is no one thing (other than out-of-control cell growth, various cancers present in wildly different ways), with no one cause (we learn of the HP virus that causes cervical cancer, the environmental origin of mesothelioma, the dizzying variety of genetic and environmental factors that can trigger breast cancers), and no one cure applies to every case. It was interesting to learn of the evolution of cancer cures – from surgery to radiation to chemotherapy to today's gene-targeting medicines – and that a combination of these techniques still makes for best practises. Learning the stories of the people who dedicated their professional lives to the development of these techniques – researchers who often succumbed to cancer themselves – it's impossible to imagine that any of them, rushing to make advances and being the first to publish results, would be capable of suppressing “the” cure under orders from some mysterious “they”; research builds upon previous research in such a way that even if one lab is somehow gagged, another will eventually make the same links.As for the researchers, these were some of my favourites: Andreas Vesalius – the sixteenth century anatomist who made the first thorough study of the human body and failed to find the “black bile” that Galen had imagined as the cause for cancer in ancient Rome, and which physicians had accepted as fact for centuries; Sidney Farber – the researcher turned clinician who essentially invented chemotherapy to battle childhood leukemia (and I know that Mukherjee wanted me to be equally interested in Mary Lasker – the socialite who partnered with Farber to push for national funding for the “War on Cancer” – but her story felt peripheral to me); Barry Marshall – so convinced that stomach cancer is caused by an infection that he created a broth of the bacteria from a patient's stomach, drank it, and gave himself a precancerous ulcer (which was then cured with antibiotics; which is today's standard of care in early stage stomach cancer); Cecily Saunders – the British physician who created the field of palliative medicine in response to the terminal patients who weren't of much interest to those oncologists who were fighting only for victories in the war on cancer; George Crile – who fought back against the idea of the radical mastectomy as the only cure for breast cancer (and the related stories of generations of surgeons removing ever more muscle and bone during mastectomies to prevent relapse, those same generations of women who helplessly submitted themselves to the scalpels and advice of their well-intentioned doctors, and the link between the rise in political feminism and the birth of medical feminism, The fact that one of the most common and most disfiguring operations performed on women's bodies had never been formally tested in a trial stood out as even more starkly disturbing to a new generation of women).I was fascinated by how so many specific cures were invented through the back door, as it were – “Hey, I've incidentally created an antifolate in the lab, anybody need that?” “Over here!” – and as we have only recently been mapping the human genome, the future of gene-targeting cures sounds exciting (and especially as there are apparently all of these synthesised molecules awaiting a purpose). For example: In 1993, researcher Brian Druker (with others) isolated a transgenic molecule – a chemical kinase inhibitor derived from sea bacteria, of all things – that would turn off the cancer causing mutation in CML (a rare form of leukemia), but when the astonishing results were presented to the executives of the drug company where he worked, they weren't excited to spend 100-200 million dollars on years of clinical trials for the benefit of the few thousand Americans afflicted with CML each year. Eventually, the company allowed Druker to do a very small scale trial, and as patient after patient went quickly into complete remission – and as the dawn of the internet chatroom alerted other sufferers to the existence of this miracle treatment – “Gleevec” rapidly made the jump to market, where it is today considered the cure. (And perhaps not incidentally, people with CML need to be on Gleevec for the rest of their lives to remain cancer-free, so in this case, “the cure for cancer” is certainly in a drug company's best long-term interest.)So, much was interesting, but in a long book, I grew to resent those parts that weren't so interesting (for me anyway): there could have been less about the missteps and deadends in cancer research; the battle with tobacco companies to acknowledge their contribution to lung cancer is well known and unnecessary (and covered at length here); the drawn out history of funding for (American) cancer research didn't pique my interest; and while I understand the connection between the AIDS activists of the 1980's and later terminal cancer patients – people on the brink of death shouldn't be forced to wait for a decade of safety trials before being offered a new medicine; they are more than willing to be the trial if it offers any hope at all – the foray into AIDS felt off-topic. Mukherjee certainly has a talent for explaining science to the layperson, but with his jumps forward and backwards in time, I'd say he has less skill with putting it all in historical perspective (I had to keep doing this for myself, “Ah, he's talking about the Fifties again, when this research was going on over there and this political pressure was affecting things here”.) And he frequently overwrites the prosey bits: when I'm concentrating to follow the science, I don't want to be slowed down by trying to parse out, “Women wrote to their surgeons in admiration and awe, begging them not to spare their surgical extirpations, as if surgery were an anagogical ritual that would simultaneously rid them of cancer and uplift them into health”. Ultimately, I do understand cancer better now – its history, its variety, its methods and weaknesses – and I do believe I have what I need to combat the conspiracy theorists; so mission accomplished. As for the future of cancer, this thought was sobering:
Perhaps cancer, the scrappy, fecund, invasive, adaptable twin to our own scrappy, fecund, invasive, adaptable cells and genes, is impossible to disconnect from our bodies. Perhaps cancer defines the inherent outer limit of our survival. As our cells divide and our bodies age, and as mutations accumulate inexorably upon mutations, cancer might well be the final terminus in our development as organisms.
We're all going to die of something. And as the population ages – having (in the West) mostly eliminated the historic midlife killers like cholera, typhus and tuberculosis – we're more and more likely to die of some form of cancer; even if that cancer is controllable and our deaths are delayed by decades, some novel mutation in our aging cells will likely make us vulnerable to some other form. I can make peace with that knowledge and am glad to have read the book that taught me this."

We travel from a time when cancer doctors tucked away their children leukemia patients in the back of the hospital to die to the dawn of real hope with the advent of chemotherapy. My interest in the subject was peaked my own cancer diagnosis. As grueling as treatment has been, it is hard to feel sorry for yourself when you are tucked snuggly into your heated, massaging infusion chair and you read about a boy who endured some of the first chemotherapy treatments, without anti nausea medication, getting to his treatments by riding into Boston in the back of whatever neighbors pick up truck was heading that way. I stand in amazement at the strength of all of the people who have battled this disease before me. It was their stories that moved me so deeply. Often people are mentioned so briefly and I longed for more information. Sadly when it was provided the update was often a brief they passed away. I also loved the stories of the scientists who were always trying to stay one step ahead of the disease, sometimes suffering from the very cancer they were looking to cure. I was somewhat less interested in the heavy scientific sections that dealt with DNA sequencing. Those parts were a little dry but still readable. It was the patients and doctors who really brought the book to life for me.Whether the year is 1716 or 2016 the outcome of stage IV cancer is inevitably terminal. What has changed is that people are living longer with cancer. The new focus may not be a cure but a better quality of life for those living with cancer. Even if you aren't a cancer patient chances are you know someone. Cancer is in all of us and one in three of us will develop it in our lifetime. This book gave me the push to join the research arm I was asked to participate in order to write the next chapter in my kind of cancer treatment. The story of cancer is far from finished and I for one am looking forward to the future that Mukherjee envisions and the chapters of triumph yet to be written.If you would like to know more about this book from the author himself here is an interesting piece that recently aired on CBS Sunday morning: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-histo..."

This is pitched perfectly for me, the well-educated not-a-doctor. And like the very best nonfiction, this book is clearly written from a place of deep passion for the subject. He has the exact right balance here between cool, researcher's zeal, and human grasp of the ""charring, personal war"" each of his patients is fighting. This book made me tired and sad and amazed and hopeful and scared, and then everything all at once.I've been reading a lot about cancer this year. I realized this just a minute ago, flipping back through reviews. Post processing, probably. But funnily enough, I wasn't thinking about my girlfriend while I was reading this. I don't know, for her, treatment was a series of gates to enter, pre-set paths to walk, tokens to collect. Have this surgery, starve yourself for a month, get irradiated in this precise way, do it again, do it again – no wait, psych, don't. It was like being passed from one set of highly competent hands to another and another in a baton race – everyone seemed to know exactly what ought to come next. This book isn't about those kinds of fights, as much.Mostly I thought about B. How we used to sit together on my patio at night, knee-to-knee on the cement. Our guide dogs would curl up in front of us, tucked back-to-back, my sleek, creamy, fierce little girl lab and his giant, silly, shaggy black lab. He had retinal blastoma as a baby. They took out both eyes. I was only eight months out from my last eye surgery, I still have both eyes, but at that point it was more likely that I wouldn't, always. He talked me through his prosthetics, let me touch them, told me how one eye still hurt even though the doctors said it shouldn't. He was a drummer and a bit of a stoner; he wrote me strange emails sometimes in the middle of the night. He died before his twenty-third birthday. It took the cancer twenty years to catch up, but it got him.This book is about his kind of cancer. His specific disease type, but also more broadly the type of cancer that becomes a companion. A lifelong companion, for however long life is. The kind that requires enormous creativity, endurance, brutality. It's a very, very good book."

This is one such books which is meticulously researched and bring forth something new this is one such book. And I wanted to read this book so much for so many years but somehow I kept on leaving it back or couldn't read further but this time I decided to start it and after some time where it again lay neglected I corrected my way and finally finished this masterpiece. It is a non-fiction book but reads better than many thrillers.This book charts the history of Cancer thankfully this malady hasn't touched my family (Touchwood) but I have known people suffering from it and lost friends to it so I know how terrifying this can be. The book is wonderful because of the heart of the story and how wonderfully it travels from one era to other and charting the work done in identifying this terrible disease and different work done to fight it and all the work that has been done to ensure that we find the solution for it and the reality of the matter too. And it's no surprise that this won the Pulitzer prize when this book was released. This deserves all the awards and praise and gets and then some more. i would soon look to start and finish the next book 'Gene' by the same author but I need to finish the streamlining of my currently reading list and work towards finishing the books which are pending for a long time due to this reason or that but it shall be done.If you have wondered whether to read this book wonder no more and get it and read it.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is, of course, Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."
46,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer is a book about the history of cancer and long winding road to conquer and to understand cancer. The topics move swiftly from ancient Egypt to modern time, from surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, to modern day targeted cancer therapy, and from the glory and folly of the American's War on Cancer to the sin of tobacco industry. Treatment or prevention? What is the true evaluation of the mammogram screening for public health? The cellular biology of cancer, cancer and genetics, etc...Siddhartha Mukherjee is an excellent writer who mixes broad brush strokes of cancer history with close-up details of cancer patients. He is a good tension builder too--Did the drug work? Was the patient saved? The new treatment a scam or a miracle cure? A lot of excellent writings in the book. Following are a few:“The art of medicine is long, Hippocrates tells us, ""and life is short; opportunity fleeting; the experiment perilous; judgment flawed.” “In God we trust. All others must have data. - Bernard Fisher” “Cancer was not disorganized chromosomal chaos. It was organized chromosomal chaos” “Cancer's life is a recapitulation of the body's life, its existence a pathological mirror of our own.” “Cancer is an expansionist disease; it invades through tissues, sets up colonies in hostile landscapes, seeking “sanctuary” in one organ and then immigrating to another. It lives desperately, inventively, fiercely, territorially, cannily, and defensively—at times, as if teaching us how to survive. To confront cancer is to encounter a parallel species, one perhaps more adapted to survival than even we are.” “If we, as a species, are the ultimate product of Darwinian selection, then so, too, is this incredible disease that lurks inside us.”“Nineteenth-century doctors often linked cancer to civilization: cancer, they imagined, was caused by the rush and whirl of modern life, which somehow incited pathological growth in the body. The link was correct, but the causality was not: civilization did not cause cancer, but by extending human life spans—civilization unveiled it.” "

More in-depth review will follow at a later point but I will say that this is one of the most impactful reads of my life. To me personally, as a cancer survivor myself, from a family suffering from a genetic cancer syndrome, as a medical student now minoring in onco-immunology: this hit close to home... This did everything a book could do for a person: It educated me. Even though having a lot of knowledge going in, I learned so much reading this, especially about the history of cancer research, which was humbling as well as horrifying. I deeply felt the highs and the lows of this true story. As I have close experiences with so many of the things described, I cried, I got angry, I felt proud, I felt hopeful and hopeless at the same time. In the end it also inspired me for he future. I was already invested in oncology and immunotherapy and aspire to work in this field, but experiencing this cemented this idea even more in my mind.No novel, or non-fiction book for that matter, had made me experience such an array of emotions. Nor did many hit this close to home. This book combines the hard truth and facts of non-fiction, with the honest voice and the human factor to make it a harrowing and emotional read. In the best way possible. Updates on this review may follow at a later point. I will now immediately start my first reread, this time taking copious notes."
48,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"Mukherjee is a very gifted storyteller. He crafted this book with care, telling the personal history of cancer through his eyes as an oncologist and cancer researcher, and through the lives of some of his patients. He begins the book talking about the earliest mentions of cancer in literature (an Egyptian papyrus that mentions a breast tumor) and a Persian queen who had her slave perform a mastectomy to remove her cancer in 500 BCE. Mukherjee discusses the highlights of cancer research and the general history of medical science through time. Woven throughout the histories, he intersperses stories of patients he has treated - most notably following Carla, the young mother with lymphoma as she goes through treatment for her form of cancer. From the ""black bile"" humor theory, the quack treatments, and the extremely damaging and invasive ""surgeries"" performed in the medieval and early modern period, the true advances in understanding cancer (as much as it can be understood) began in the nineteenth-century. Science in general reached new heights, and the advances of chemistry and physics led to advances in cancer treatment, i.e. chemotherapy and drug development, and radiation treatment. The discovery of carcinogens began the shift towards preventative medicine (fascinating / sad story about the chimney sweep children in Industrial England with their cancers from years of soot and ash inhalation) and the history behind the early screening tests that we so often take for granted (pioneers in mammography and Dr. Paponikolau, the researcher behind the Pap smear, who developed the test with guinea pigs), and the advancements in laboratory and research medicine. Some of the most interesting parts of the book are the social histories around the cancer research. Mukherjee writes a detailed history about the research and the advocacy partnership of Sidney Farber and Mary Lasker, and the founding of the National Cancer Institute and the political push for scientific and cancer-research funding. Among the most interesting and revelatory sections for me was the research that went into discovering the correlation between tobacco and cigarette-smoking and lung cancer in the 1960s. Mukherjee gives great context for the battle to educate people about lung cancer and prevention. Many of the scientists that were researching did not believe that they would find any correlation - and many of them were chain smokers themselves.The last section of the book describes the modern cancer research from the late 1970s to today; the discoveries of genetic roles in cancer formation, and the formulation of drugs. This section is the most scientific of the book, and a cursory knowledge of genetics might come in handy. Mukherjee is a realist, and states it from the outset. Cancer effects us all, and as we age, it will effect everyone in some way - whether personally or with a family member or close friend. As an oncologist, he sees many patients and also sees many deaths. While cancer research has progressed, he is not shy to say that there may never be a way to beat this disease, as it is constantly changing and mutating into something new, something more destructive and invasive. He does say that many treatments now can prolong lives for months and years, and he has also seen long and ""successful"" remissions, but each case of cancer is different in each individual, and treatments for each case have different results. He encourages us to not think of it as a ""War on Cancer"" as was the common language in the 1950s-70s, and says that our culture may need to redefine ""victory"" in this war. Highly recommend if you are interested in medical/scientific history, and in learning more about the social history, as well as the modern developments in cancer research. "
49,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2964817-marc-kozak,5,"Sometimes I'll get excited when I read science-related articles that suggest that some time in the future, we will know so much about our body that we'll be able to cure anything that's wrong, and replace anything that's old and worn down. Some have even suggested that immortality is an actual possibility. Heart not working? 3D-print a new one. Brain shutdown? No big deal.It's hard not to believe this when constantly confronted with sensational articles that come out on an almost daily basis: 100% Effective Ebola Vaccine Found. Enzyme Created that Changes Donated Blood Into Universal Type. HIV Pill Found to be 100% Effective in Trials. Extrapolated over time, why WOULDN'T we cure everything in the next 10,50,100 years?But then you have something like cancer. Cancer is, well, it's a son of a bitch. There's a haunting passage in the very last pages of this 600+ page book that suggest maybe cancer is the great equalizer. Maybe it's nature's way of saying, ""that's it, you've lived long enough. This is the limit."" Cancer is embedded into our very genes. Even if nothing external gives it a helping hand, there's still a possibility of one cell copying information wrong, and boom, there it is. And guess how many cells are in your body? 37.2 trillion, in a constant state of flux, death, and multiplication. It's easy to see what makes finding a universal ""magic cure"" seem so impossible. It's also freaked me out a little, and now every time I have a headache, I'm worried it's a tumor.That feeling of inevitability is an interesting note to end on, because most of the book strikes a pretty optimistic tone. Mukherjee takes us through the history of cancer research, and doesn't leave a single thing out. Hundreds of doctors and surgeons are named, each doing their own part to build on our knowledge base. Huge breakthroughs are made. Many speeches are given at medical conferences that leave the audiences ""shocked to their core."" Frustration is undoubtedly expressed, but it always seems like the next big discovery comes right around the corner.I was utterly shocked to learn that most of cancer research in general is barely 100 years old. In 1975, people still thought the best solution to breast cancer was to perform extremely radical surgery that essentially removed the entire top half of your body. In fact, the genetic aspects of cancer weren't even discovered until the 90s. I mean, I was alive in the 90s! It's kind of heartening to know that we will still learn so much more about the disease in the coming decades.The first 400 pages are extremely readable -- and utterly engrossing. Only in the latter stages (when genetics come into play), do things get a little harder to understand, but it's definitely not overwhelming. As a non-doctor layperson, I learned an incredible amount of things from this book. I found myself Googling certain things to find out more, and for me that's always the sign of a complete state of being absorbed in a book. The only parts that really took me out of it were the brief sections where Mukherjee talks about his own patients. He seemed to want to insert little anecdotes from his own experience to make some kind of poignant, emotional point, but these were placed so randomly that they had almost no effect. He also kept referring to them by their first names (which were made up names anyway), and I could never remember who he was talking about because the last time he mentioned them was many pages ago.All in all, if you have even a passing interest in understanding more about cancer, I can't recommend this highly enough. It took me quite a long time to get through, but I was never bored. If anything, I was overwhelmed with new information that I wanted to know about. Apparently this was also made into a PBS film, that I will be checking out immediately."

It’s a foregone conclusion, but when my mother and father were born and in their teen years it was still seen as a cool thing to do. Cigarette companies marketed their product towards a variety of different groups and got them hooked. As Mukherjee puts it “like a virus, too, the cigarette mutated, adapting itself to diverse contexts. In the Soviet gulag, it became an informal currency; among English suffragettes, a symbol of rebellion; among American suburbanites, of rugged machismo, among disaffected youth, of generational rift.”Companies hid information so that their users wouldn’t know the dangers they were facing. My mom and my dad are both avid smokers no matter how many times they’ve tried to quit. My mom lost her mom to cancer and even when she was dying she would go outside and smoke. This wasn’t some kind of defeatist attitude of “well, I’m dying anyway so I might as well” this was the addiction. Mukherjee states that patients going through chemo or waking up after a cancer-related surgery will wander the halls like zombies begging for cigarettes.“By the early 1960’s, the gross annual sale of cigarettes in America peaked at nearly $5 billion… On average, Americans were consuming nearly four thousand cigarettes per year or about eleven cigarettes per day—nearly one for every waking hour.”This would have been approximately the time my father started smoking. For years he measured how much he smoked in packs rather than in cigarettes. I hounded him until he was only smoking 11 or so cigarettes a day, but it took time. Most people in this day and age don’t have an excuse to start smoking: we know it is awful for us and may kill us. If you smoke please try to stop and if you don’t smoke yet don’t ever, ever start. If you are desperate for some relaxation read a book, go for a walk, turn on some music, eat chocolate or talk to someone. Now, rant aside this book had a lot of feeling.

51,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,5,"I'm late coming to this book, but it was a great read that significantly updated my view of a difficult topic. Mukherjee pursues the history of three ways of attacking cancer: eradication through surgery or toxic medicines, prevention, and thwarting cancer's progress with targeted molecular drugs. He marshals an incredible amount of historical, biographical, and scientific information, and it's only in the last part of the book where the weight of the complexity bows it down. There's no way for him to make the Ras-Mek-Erk pathway as easy to picture as the surgeries of the 19th century. (Which, after reading this book, you will be glad not to live in.)Instead of just enumerating the relevant events, the author describes the worldview that affected the path of opinion, fact, questioning, and discovery. For example: ""They lacked formal proof, and as they went further up the isolated promontories of their own beliefs, proof became irrelevant and trials impossible to run. The more fervently surgeons believed in the inherent good of their operations, the more untenable it became to put these to a formal scientific trial. Radical surgery thus drew the blinds of circular logic around itself for nearly a century."" In this way, the advances he describes follow logically even for the non-expert reader.I thought Mukherjee was an excellent writer who could be clear and simple as well as playful: ""a pukka Englishman and his puckish counterpart"" is how he describes one scientific partnership. His editor, however, does not deserve a Pulitzer and I'd use this work as a textbook example of why you need an author, a copyeditor (to prevent misspellings and other blatant errors), and a line editor, even with a really good writer. The first time Mukherjee used the word ""retinue,"" I consciously remarked on this excellent word choice. The next few times it came up, I thought it was overused, and at one point it appears twice in back to back sentences. We hear about ""the final rondo of legal assaults against tobacco""--he simply must mean ""salvo."" Elsewhere, ""within three months of treatment, [a patient] gained nearly half his body weight and shot up two feet in height""--this does not seem possible, even as a medical miracle. I'm not suggesting that this spoiled my interest in the book; I'm just mentioning it because other people have already discussed the material so thoroughly, and I can't recall any comparably obvious mismatch of author (great) and editor (out to lunch)."

That the subject would be traumatizing, that the scientific detail would be too great and the material too dry. I was wrong on every account. I did not find this book frightening. I found it enlightening. Knowledge is a great quencher of fear. There is plenty to be fearful of, that's not why I'm saying, but that is not what this book dwells on. It's interesting that there is so much ""find a cure for cancer"" floating around on the internet. That which is called cancer encompasses a great variety of illnesses with wildly differing prognosis with a single thing in common: uncontrolled cell growth. If I found a cancerous tumour in my breast without any spreading today, I would be fairly confident of my own survival. If I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, I would settle my worldy affairs. This book does a great job of conveying the huge variety of cancer.The author certainly explains scientific details when required, but it does not weigh the book down. Of course you have to have technical details in a book like this. Some of the things I understood since sciency and biology in particular have always been my favorite subjects, other things passed above my head without bothering me. There is nothing in this book to daunt the average lay person.The very last thing this book is, is dry. It is devastatingly human. In parts, it reads like a thriller. The first patient we're introduced to is Clara and her fate and prognosis carries through the book like the proverbial red thread. I was anxious for her. There are many other patients in this book, some who live and some who die and all whom contribute to a better understanding.Do not let the size or subject of this book daunt you. This is very readable. Highly recommended."
53,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,3,"This is nicely written, but from a health policy perspective there are some troubling aspects to the content. The author is very much part of the academic medical establishment and so he appears to be biased towards medical treatment and laboratory research as opposed to prevention. Even when Mukherjee fantasizes at the end of the book about the future of breast cancer, all he can imagine is more computers and chemicals for treatment. He doesn't seem to get that people would rather not have cancer in the first place, as opposed to suffering with cancer and its therapies. Why not eliminate the causes, like cigarettes? Prevention is not completely ignored but it is buried in the middle of this very long book under the title ""Prevention is the Cure."" This phraseology is bizarre. Preventing is different from curing. In fact, prevention is commonly understood in our culture as being better than cure: ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" is attributed to Ben Franklin. Mukherjee goes out of his way to try to diminish the relative contribution of prevention to the improvement in cancer mortality. But even if prevention were only equal to treatment, this would still be remarkable given that only a tiny fraction of healthcare and ""War on Cancer"" spending has gone to epidemiology and public health. This is where there has been enormous bang for the buck in successfully fighting cancer. I think that should be clearer. Overall this is not so much a ""biography of cancer"" as it is a biography of cancer doctors. For a highly informative and paradigm-challenging ""biography"" of a disease, I would recommend

In fact, I recommend it for everyone. This is an incredibly honest accounting of where we've come from in cancer treatment and where we stand now while also succeeding in a feat rare to such works: Mukharjee capably demonstrates compassion for cancer patients, treating them as humans and not abstract intellectual concepts. Mukharjee is a very talented writer and scientific/medical concepts are built up in a logical progression, starting from simple principles. I will hang on to this book as an important reference work. Highly recommended for everyone. "

Just if you might be interested.The explanations for cancer have varied since the beginning of the historiography. They were often similar to the ideas of religions and ceremonies and thus, politely expressed, were egocentric to esoteric. What is striking is that, unlike other plagues or common infectious diseases, the disease has always occupied a unique position. Whether it is due to the often associated disfigurement, the extremely long ordeal or the implications of why you got such a disease. People interpreted very much into the disease and linked it to their other beliefs. As so often, it was also associated with guilt and a divorce. Thus, the victim did not only have to contend with a life-threatening illness. However, even with the stigma and social isolation. It is strange that diseases in ordinary living persons were always interpreted as a sign of punishment for sin in the current or previous life. Saints and martyrs of religions, on the other hand, were noble and dignified, bearing disease and pain as a sign that they were the chosen ones. Mukherjee describes the development of various cancers and the processes that it uses to spread in the body. He gives the disease a face by detailing the fates of patients. However, this is partially enriched with too little distance to the sufferers and too much emotional ballast, which sometimes exceeds the limit to sensationalism. More scientific reach and seriousness would have counteracted this. The treatments of shamans, bloodletting, simple surgery on radiotherapy, chemotherapy to the more individualized treatment approaches of the near future are explained.A good guarantor of premature death is smoking. It was a stroke of genius of marketing to define smoking as an elitist sign. Those who did not smoke were poor, so smoking was a status symbol. Much like obesity thousands of years ago was a sign of wealth and therefore attractive. As a war profiteer, the tobacco industry insisted on giving the soldiers their daily packet of cigarettes. If not the enemy, it killed at least that. Unfortunately, the usual formerly generous ration of rum had fallen into disrepute. So that was a good substitute. Also, drunken soldiers might be useful for group morals, but not for killing efficiency. Since other drugs were more appropriate and were also used. As tobacco companies in the industrialized countries are becoming increasingly uncomfortable today, they are looking for their future sales in developing and emerging countries. The governments there are even more relaxed and cheaper lubricated than in Europe and North America. Thanks to this, the number of smokers, for example in Mexico or Uzbekistan, is rising sharply. Although people have also remembered the carcinogenicity of alcohol consumption, it is not as strong as with smoking. Notably, because the social stigma is missing. Drinking is not associated with anything antisocial in the form of harm to bystanders. There is no passive drinking.It is difficult to classify how the epidemic of obesity and a diet of low-quality, addictive industrial foods will effect the health system. The basic constellation is fatal. Almost no movement, very difficult check-ups and the vast amounts of chemicals, artificially produced food supplements and genetically modified organisms. The interactions of these thousands of components in the bodies of humans are barely explored. There are either no studies, and it would be too expensive or only not feasible severe. Because it is difficult to find a factor in such complex diseases. So one takes mice as a test object. Not even pigs or at least monkeys. Both would be too expensive. Moreover, of course, the food industry prefers to cite lack of exercise and being overweight as causes. Sounds better than blaming food chemistry. Also, conveniently, it makes the victims guilty, who just can not control themselves and who have no willpower. Not the product would be harmful, but the chosen form of underage consumption. As with liquor bottles, which encourage a responsible approach. So those who use and abuse it to destroy their lives are weak-willed. Not the fault of manufacturers of the drugs and their dealers. One could draw parallels with other business models that profit people's addictions and misery. About organized crime. Politicians preferred to exclaim a ""war on cancer,"" rather than investigating the causes. Big lobby is watching them. In principle, the same concept as blaming people. So you make the disease the culprit, without taking a closer look at the way until it breaks out. It is the same logic to always look at the result regardless of the causative factors. Alternatively, to name deliberately confusing elements and place false leads to disguise the real causes.It is a pity that so little attention has been paid to these factors and the complex relationships. It would have been good for the versatility of the book to cut some of the suffering stories of patients or historical digressions and to illuminate this acute problem instead. Of course, such complex contexts are not part of the author's profession. However, why he has left them almost wholly remains a mystery. Also, many useful, alternative healing approaches that worked and have been known for decades are not mentioned. Primarily, the conventional forms of therapy are used, but almost never the alternatives discussed.Especially the gentler, cheaper and more successful alternatives to chemotherapy stand out. In less severe cases where this mallet method would not be necessary, patients are more threatened by the therapy than by the disease. Unfortunately, it is impossible to separate the reputable from the dubious alternatives. With the despair and fear of dying of the people, much falsehood is driven. The author would, confronted with that, probably disproportionately point out this fact to justify his blinders to conventional medicine. Only the cheating of some miracle healers does not warrant the consideration of all alternatives as irrelevant and therefore not worth mentioning.The narrative style is therefore often reduced only to the disease and the patients. The complex relationships and mechanisms are thus missing. Just like the effects of environmental toxins and their accumulation in food and people. It is noticeable that often just such one-page non-fiction books are heavily hyped by the system media, discussed and disproportionately often overwhelmed with prices.The awareness of people that their lifestyle is directly linked to their cancer risk seems to be far too limited. As when driving a car. One knows about the danger and if an accident happens or a loved one is injured, is carefully for a few days. Until the realization seeps out of perception and one continues to treat her or his health as irresponsibly as before.With a look into the year 2050, the potentials of progressive healing methods, still to be researched medical procedures and the improved use of technology are illustrated.The dreaded adaptability, reproductive capacity, resilience and immortality of cancer is also one of the keys to immortality. Another is hidden in genetic engineering.It seems like a cruel irony that in one of the worst hostages the cure for death should lie at the same time. However, what, after countless dead, would be just compensation, reparation. Moreover, then, depending on the human population, it would take a long time for the first ""cancer healthy"" to occur instead of a cancer sufferer. To reverse the equation.The famous HeLa cells provide a foretaste of this. Not only have they enabled thousands of medical patents, but they have also already become immortal. For several decades. As well as this ability, other adaptations and mutations of cancer, as well as dreaded viruses, can be used for research and healing.Also, if it one day succeeds to brew the elixir of immortality out of the mechanisms of these hostages of humanity, billions of people will not have died in vain until then. With their dying, they made it possible to go the way to find the philosopher's stone.By then, one in four will fall ill in the course of her or his life.Es scheint, als wären ein paar der Schlüsselfaktoren ausgespart worden.Die Erklärungsansätze für Krebs waren seit Anbeginn der Geschichtsschreibung vielfältig. Sie ähnelten häufig den Ideen aus Religionen und Zeremonien und waren somit, höflich ausgedrückt, egozentrisch bis esoterisch. Was auffällt ist, dass die Krankheit im Gegensatz zu anderen Plagen oder normalen Infektionskrankheiten schon immer eine Sonderstellung einnahm. Sei es aufgrund der häufig damit einhergehenden Entstellung, dem extrem langen Leidensweg oder der Implikationen, warum man so eine Krankheit bekam. Die Menschen interpretierten sehr viel in die Krankheit hinein und verbanden sie mit ihren anderen Glaubenskonstrukten. Wie so häufig wurde sie auch mit Schuld und einer Gottesstrafe assoziiert. Somit hatte der Leidtragende nicht nur mit einer lebensbedrohlichen Erkrankung zu kämpfen. Sondern auch mit der Stigmatisierung und sozialen Isolation. Es ist seltsam, dass Krankheiten bei normalen, lebenden Personen immer als ein Zeichen von Strafe für eine Sünde im aktuellen oder vorherigen Leben ausgelegt werden. Heilige und Märtyrer der Religionen hingegen leiden edel und würdig und tragen Krankheit und Schmerz als ein Zeichen von Auserwähltheit.Mukherjee beschreibt die Entstehung verschiedener Krebsarten und die Prozesse, die zur Ausbreitung im Körper verwendet werden. Er gibt der Krankheit ein Gesicht, indem er die Schicksale von Patienten schildert. Das ist aber teilweise mit zu wenig Distanz zu den Erkrankten und zu viel emotionalen Ballast angereichert, der teilweise die Grenze zur Effekthascherei überschreitet. Mehr wissenschaftliche Distanz und Seriosität hätten dem entgegen gewirkt. Die Behandlungsarten von Schamanen, Aderlass, schlichter Chirurgie über Strahlentherapie, Chemotherapie bis zu den immer indiviualisierteren Behandlungsansätzen der nahen Zukunft werden erklärt.Ein guter Garant für einen früheren Tod ist Rauchen. Es war ein Geniestreich des Marketing, Rauchen früher als elitäres Zeichen zu definieren. Wer nicht rauchte, war arm und somit war Rauchen ein Statussymbol. Ähnlich wie die Korpulenz vor Jahrtausenden ein Zeichen von Wohlstand und somit attraktiv war. Als Kriegsgewinnler ließ es sich die Tabakindustrie nicht nehmen, den Soldaten ihr tägliches Zigarettenpäckchen zu spendieren. Wenn schon nicht der Feind, so tötete sie zumindest das. Die sonst früher übliche, großzügig bemessene Ration Rum war ja leider in Verruf geraten. Also war das ein guter Ersatz. Und betrunkene Soldaten waren vielleicht für Gruppenmoral gut, aber nicht für die Tötungseffizienz. Da waren andere Drogen schon eher geeignet und wurden auch eingesetzt. Da es heute für die Tabakkonzerne in den Industriestaaten immer ungemütlicher wird, suchen sie ihren zukünftigen Umsatz in den Entwicklungs- und Schwellenländern. Die dortigen Regierungen lassen sich noch leichter und billiger schmieren als in Europa und Nordamerika. Dank dessen steigt die Zahl der Raucher, etwa in Mexiko oder Usbekistan, stark an. Die Karzinogentität von Alkoholkonsum ist zwar ebenso ins Gedächtnis der Menschen gelangt, jedoch nicht so stark wie beim Rauchen. Vor allem, weil das gesellschaftliche Stigma fehlt. Dem Trinken haftet nichts asoziales in Form der Schädigung Unbeteiligter an. Es gibt kein Passivtrinken.Wie sich die Epidemie der Fettleibigkeit samt Ernährung mit minderwertiger, süchtig machender Industrienahrung auswirken wird, lässt sich schwer klassfizieren. Die Grundkonstellation ist fatal. Fast keine Bewegung, sehr schwer durchzuführende Vorsorgeuntersuchungen und die Unmengen an Chemikalien, künstlich hergestellten Nahrungszusätzen und gentechnisch veränderten Organismen. Die Wechselwirkungen dieser Tausenden Komponenten in den Körpern der Menschen sind kaum erforscht. Es gibt entweder keine Studien, es wäre zu aufwendig oder schlichtweg nicht seriös durchführbar. Weil man bei so komplexen Erkrankungen schwer einen Faktor eruieren kann. Und man nimmt Mäuse als Testobjekt. Nicht einmal Schweine oder zumindest Affen. Wäre beides zu teuer.Und die Nahrungsmittelindustrie bevorzugt es natürlich, Bewegungsmangel und Übergewicht als Ursachen ins Feld zu führen. Klingt besser als die Schuld auf Lebensmittelchemie zu schieben. Und praktischerweise macht man damit die Opfer zu Schuldigen, die sich einfach nicht beherrschen können und die keine Willensstärke hätten. Nicht das Produkt wäre schädlich, sondern die gewählte Form des unmündigen Konsums. Wie bei Schnapsflaschen, die zu einem verantwortungsvollen Umgang auffordern. Und diejenigen, die damit ihr Leben zerstören, sind die Willensschwachen. Nicht die Hersteller der Drogen und deren Dealer. Man könnte Parallelen zu anderen Geschäftsmodellen, in denen mit Sucht und Elend der Menschen Profit gemacht wird, ziehen. Etwa der organisierten Kriminalität.Die Politik rief lieber einen ""Krieg gegen den Krebs"" aus, anstatt die Ursachen zu eruieren. Big Lobby is watching them. Im Prinzip das gleiche Konzept, wie die Schuld den Menschen zuzuschieben. So macht man halt die Krankheit zum Übeltäter, ohne den Weg bis dahin näher ins Auge zu fassen. Es ist dieselbe Logik, immer das Endresultat unabhängig von den verursachenden Faktoren zu betrachten. Oder absichtlich verwirrende Elemente zu nennen und falsche Spuren zu legen , um die echten Ursachen zu verschleiern.Schade, dass diesen Faktoren und den komplexen Zusammenhängen so wenig Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt wurde. Es hätte der Vielfältigkeit des Buches gut getan, ein paar der Leidensgeschichten von Patienten oder historische Exkurse zu kürzen und dafür diese akute Problematik auszuleuchten. Wobei so komplexe Zusammenhänge natürlich nicht ins Metier des Autors fallen. Warum er sie aber fast gänzlich ausgespart hat, bleibt ein Rätsel. Auch viele gute, alternative Heilungsansätze, die funktionierten und seit teils Jahrzehnten bekannt sind, werden nicht erwähnt. Primär werden die konventionellen Therapieformen heran gezogen, jedoch fast nie die Alternativen besprochen. Dabei stechen besonders die schonendereren, billigereren und erfolgreicheren Alternativen zur Chemotherapie hervor. In nicht so schweren Fällen, in denen diese Holzhammermethode nicht notwendig wäre, sind Patienten teils durch die Therapie bedrohter als durch die Krankheit. Leider ist es unmöglich, die seriösen von den unseriösen Alternativen zu trennen. Mit der Verzweiflung und Todesangst der Menschen wird viel Schindluder getrieben. Der Autor würde wahrscheinlich überproportional auf diesen Umstand hinweisen, um seine Scheuklappen auf die Schulmedizin zu rechtfertigen. Nur die Betrügereien mancher Wunderheilter rechtfertigen nicht, alle Alternativen als gegenstandslos und somit nicht erwähnenswert zu erachten.Die Erzählweise wird deswegen häufig nur auf die Krankheit und die Patienten reduziert. Die komplexen Zusammenhänge und Mechanismen darum fehlen. Genau wie die Auswirkungen von Umweltgiften sowie deren Akkumulation in Nahrungsmitteln und Menschen. Es fällt auf, das häufig gerade so einseitige Sachbücher von den Systemmedien stark gehypt, besprochen und überproportional häufig mit Preisen überhäuft werden.Das Bewusstsein der Menschen, dass ihr Lebensstil unmittelbar mit ihrem Krebsrisiko verbunden ist, scheint noch viel zu wenig ausgeprägt zu sein. Wie beim Autofahren. Man weiß um die Gefahr und wenn ein Unfall passiert oder ein Angehöriger verletzt wird, fährt man ein paar Tage lang vorsichtig. Bis die Erkenntnis wieder aus der Wahrnehmung sickert und man weiter genau so verantwortungslos wie zuvor mit der eigenen Gesundheit umgeht.Mit einem Blick ins Jahr 2050 werden die Potentiale progressiver Heilungsmethoden, noch zu erforschender medizinischer Verfahren und die verbesserte Nutzung von Technik veranschaulicht.In der gefürchteten Anpassungsfähigkeit, Reproduktionsfähigkeit, Widerstandsfähigkeit und Unsterblichkeit des Krebses liegt gleichzeitig einer der Schlüssel zur Unsterblichkeit. Ein zweiter ist in der Gentechnik versteckt.Es mutet wie grausame Ironie an, dass in einer der schlimmsten Geiseln gleichzeitig die Kur für den Tod liegen soll. Was aber nach unzähligen Toten nur ein gerechter Ausgleich, eine Wiedergutmachung wäre. Und dann würde es noch, abhängig von der menschlichen Population, lange dauern, bis ein erster Krebsgesunder die Gleichung umkehrt.Die berühmten HeLa Zellen liefern darauf einen Vorgeschmack. Sie haben nicht nur Tausende medizinische Patente ermöglicht, sondern sind bereits unsterblich. Seit einigen Jahrzehnten. So wie diese Fähigkeit können auch andere Adaptionen und Mutationen von Krebs, wie auch von gefürchteten Viren, für die Forschung und Heilung verwendet werden. Und wenn es eines Tages gelingt, aus den Mechanismen dieser Geiseln der Menschheit das Elixier der Unsterblichkeit zu brauen, sind Milliarden Menschen bis dahin nicht umsonst gestorben. Sie ermöglichten es mit ihrem Sterben, den Weg zum Finden des Steins der Weisen zu beschreiten.Bis dahin wird jeder Vierte im Laufe seines Lebens erkranken."
56,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4871190-sriram,5,"“This book is a history of cancer”. And so it begins! From this rather straight and simple introductory line, 'The Emperor of all Maladies - A Biography of Cancer' unravels the mysteries of the dreadful disease, tracing its path since around 4000 BC until today and the incessant war humanity has waged against it. A war in which for most time the enemy was barely understood; its shape, size, roots, cause, effect, likes and dislikes, lurking as mysteries for most people! As I do with any non-fiction work, I read this book tremendously slowly. Five pages in a sitting over a period of 3-4 months was my pace, with the fear of losing scientific detail if my aging brain were to go any faster or skim through the chapters. A medical book begets even more attention as it also details matters of true lives, deaths, slumps and survivals. As the chapters unfold, in hindsight, one may view Galen's search for the black bile or Bennet simplifying leukemia as a ""suppuration of blood"" a little humorous - no pun intended. But in the absence of a proper understanding of basic biology, diagnostic tools, surgical methods, antiseptic, anesthesia and a few other essentials in the artillery, it comes as no surprise that the ancient physicians were up against a monster so powerful, looming and unfathomable that Imhotep (around 2600 BC) had to summarize its therapy in just a few words: ""There is none!"" Mukherjee has begun the first part well with this historic extreme that may leave a reader surprised and troubled at once about how primordial medical therapy was then. In extrapolation and by induction, each era that followed might also justifiably be characterized by this note, as evidenced by the progresses made in cancer research, therapy, molecular biology and so on, each discovery annulling the prior or extending the prior and opening new doors. DNA was referred to as nothing more than a “stupid molecule” after its discovery and we know only too well now what an emperor of its own kind the DNA is!           Galen made a simplistic, debatable but profound statement around AD 160 that ""...it (cancer) is caused by bile – of blacke cholor and without boyling...!""  Mukherjee refers back to Galen a few many times in later chapters when he has to drive home the point that cancer has a deep and pervasive basis, so pertinent that a researcher of even recent times could be tempted to liken it to being ""humoral"" in a sense! Mukherjee elucidates the historical, scientific progress (or the lack of it!) of the fight against cancer with a child's enthusiasm to narrate a story that occurred at school. He knows it really well. He is a player in the field. He is involved. And he entwines it equally well with the endearing stories of several patients - many that remarkably survived and many that gave in. Lachrymal moments for the reader in both instances. Milestone after another achieved in terms of causal, diagnostic, clinical and political breakthroughs stand testimony to human resilience. And equally depressing are instances of human weaknesses listed with examples in this impatient war. Mukherjee has painted these pictures with great skill and knowledge. The eras spanning black bile, radical surgery, discovering cytotoxins, poison trials, Farber, Lasker & Jimmy movement, tobacco wars, mammograms, soot cleaners, Bezwoda enigma, X-rays and radiation therapy, scientific trials, genetic basis of cancer and the prognosis of the war are a true panoramic exposition of the emperor of all maladies! The protagonist of the book is the malady itself and not the innumerable heroes that challenged it. This is an amazing point and full credit to the writing that brought out this intrinsic ""feel"". To draw an analogy, if someone brings up 'Titanic', my mind would jump to remember DiCaprio or Winslet or the finale in the icy ocean. 'Titanic' the ship per se, comes to the foreground only next possibly! But here, in spite of a few central endearing characters, remarkable soldiers – including patients, scientists and doctors – one is inevitably left brooding about cancer as the dark hero pervading through the book as its indelible core! Ehrlich put it so succinctly and is quoted in the book, Life is... a chemical incident! As the cellular basis of cancer becomes better known, DNA-RNA-protein pathways better understood, agents and anti-agent chemicals synthesized, locks and keys invented, life sinking abysmally in the absence of a molecule and springing back to remission when a new molecule is injected, one is inevitably left with the thought how chemical we are and how whimsical it is to be on this side of the kingdom or the other: the healthy or the ill! Personally, I experienced about hundred ""goosebump occasions"" as I traversed through this book. A few here (warning - spoilers!): - Ehrlich ranting about the seminal concept of Chemotherapy for the first time in medical history to a dozing audience in a train! - If we didn't kill the tumor, we killed the patient! - A patient admitting her end and the doctors consoled by the ineffectuality of their discipline, hanging their heads in shame! - In God we trust, all others must have data! - Cancer therapy is like beating a dog with a stick to get rid of its fleas! - Cancer - biological mutability gone wild while AIDS - social mutability gone wild! - Our encounter with cancer... has rounded us off and polished us like river rocks! - Both abnormalities - proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors (""accelerators and brakes"") represent the core molecular defects in a cancer cell! - (On cancer therapy...) You change the shape of the key and test it... Does it fit? If not, you change it again! - (For a cancer patient) this is their new normal! - Cancer, as one scientist recently put, ""is really a pathway disease""! - Someday, if cancer succeeds, it will produce a far more perfect being than its host!!! - Medicine is fundamentally a technological art. At its core, it intervenes with life. Cancer medicine, at the extreme, intervenes with our genome itself... Perhaps cancer defines the inherent outer limit of our survival!! - And the last line... It was if she (a patient) has encapsulated the essence of a four thousand year war!! Hats off to Siddhartha Mukherjee for this splendid work! This one was a pleasure to read and had the Pulitzer written all over it!!- Sriram (Sep 4, 2011)"
57,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2499261-rachel,3,"In April 2017, I lost my former boss, mentor and friend to leukemia at age 55. I recall talking to him on the phone once, and somehow the conversation had rolled around to mortality. He told me that he felt a sense of comfort knowing what the cause of his death will be - ""when I die, it will be from this cancer. That I know already."" But he was given a prognosis of 15 years, and did not even make it halfway. I finally chose to read this book in December, after learning that a former office mate's best friend had died of metastatic breast cancer at 33. I had met her on a few occasions before the diagnosis and was charmed by her buoyant personality, a pretty girl who might know that she is beautiful but doesn't have a dash of superiority about it. This was the second young person I had known who died of cancer this year. Not that life is ever fair, but I wanted to know about the specific processes that caused the conditions that led to their deaths. And I wanted to know where we are now in terms of mitigating cancer. There are two things I really appreciate about The Emperor of All Maladies. First, I savored seeing the scientific method in action - especially towards the beginning of the book when scientists are just learning the makeup of cancerous tumor masses and starting to develop early chemical treatments. I was thrilled by the fact that chemotherapy for leukemia was born out of observing the way weaponized mustard gas killed the cells in bone marrow (which in cancers of the blood would of course include the cancerous cells). I liked reading about early clinical trials, where hypothesis was applied to human test subjects. I even enjoyed reading about the discovery of genetic material that led scientists to realize that endogenous cancer is mapped into our cells. The second thing I enjoyed about this book is the way it made me think of cancer differently. Dr. Mukherjee is an exhaustive biographer, and by thoroughly covering cancer from all angles - the various triggers (genetic code, viruses, carcinogens) for abnormal cell growth, the way cancer is not a homogeneous affliction, the many trials, errors and complications that arise from trying to treat each type of cancer - I no longer think in terms of a ""cure"" for ""cancer,"" generalized. I had no problem with the sweeping, majestic language Mukherjee sometimes uses to describe cancer; ""emperor of all maladies"" seems appropriate, given how often cancer impacts our lives, the broad scope of its attack, and the challenge in the fact that one cancer may not be able to be treated like another. However, as a self-described enthusiastic ""lab rat"" of a scientist, it did seem like it was hard for him to not mention every single scrap of research he did for this book. Some sections get bogged down in tedium at times, and others feel maddeningly repetitive. This may be a comprehensive biography of cancer, but I could have done with significant shortening of the sections about, say, political lobbying. It will be no shock to the reader when towards the end of the book, Mukherjee mentions that he cut the umbilical cord wearing surgeon's scrubs at the birth of his own daughter to mine it for blood to donate to leukemia and lymphoma patients. This is clearly his life's work. My lack of patience for all of the details is personal - I will never be an expert. But is a bright spot for the future that we have doctors with his curiosity working, researching, and teaching today."

This book was really, really well done. It truly was a ""biography"" of cancer. It went back to the roots of when we first discovered it, and tried to cure it. What happened back in the ancient times in Eqypt was intense. There were attempts to simply cut out breast cancer and it was usually a fatal attempt to save the patient. It was frustrating beyond belief to learn about how cancer was treated between the 1880's and 1960's. Children who succumb to luekemia were shoved into dark corners of the hospital, or even the basement wards under the logic that ""they can die in peace in a restful place with no doctors hounding them"". They were simply left to die. The doctors that pioneered chemotherapy were treated like monsters. Because the treatment was so toxic they were viewed as cruel and ruthless people who were torturing their patients to their deaths. The truth was the doctors truly knew that they were onto something in the beginning stages of chemotherapy. They were relentless in their pursuit of a cure, and one of the doctors who discovered the early prototype of chemotherapy for luekemia and lymphoma was fired by a board of doctors who deemed he was too extreme in his methods. Senior doctors wouldn't touch the research - so it was left up to newly graduated med students to continue on with the research amongts the jeers and distrust of their fellow doctors - all the while knowing they may be ending their careers and sacrificing all of their time in the quest to find the cure for cancer. The New York Times was asked to run a special on breast cancer, and their response was they could neither use the word breast, or CANCER in their articles because it was such a taboo subject. The survival rate before chemotherapy was less than 1%, and it was so feared by the general public that not even the news wanted to cover it. I just got so enraged reading about how people and doctors were treated in those times I put the book down several times. The author of the book is an oncologist, so not only do we get a story about how the ancients attempted to treat cancer, and how people were treated at the turn of the century, we also get a modern view of what it's like to be an oncologist, a speciality that takes an enormous amount of courage and heart to treat patients with such a grim outlook. This is a book I recommend to anyone who has known somone who's been diagnosed with cancer, or who has an interest in this topic. Hell, even if you don't I still think you should read this book because of the dense amount of information that's so important for people to understand. It's a story about how humanity has a drive to live, a drive to learn, and an innate need to help one another. The pioneers of chemotherapy were heros with undaunting courage to wade through the criticism and keep fighting knowing they were on the right track. Without them, this world may still have been suffering a 1% chance of survival without the miracles of chemotherapy, radiation and other methods of fighting the war on cancer. "
59,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9629595-david,5,"Written as a narrative, this book takes on two challenges: outlining the history of cancer as perceived and treated by humans; explaining the science and scientific method behind not only the disease, but also the various forms of therapy and industries that have affected oncology.Ambitious in scope, The Emperor of All Maladies not only effectively communicates the scientific and socio-economic events involving cancer - no small feat in themselves - it also employs a ""human"" component to the narrative.People involved in both the treatment and suffering of cancer are taken into account. They are not portrayed as mindless agents in science's steady march for enlightenment (like programmed cells with predictable behaviour), they are individuals with differing characters, emotions, and drives. One finds him/herself emoting with these individuals.The Emperor of All Maladies is a reminder that science is not a cold subject, especially when it comes to the medical sciences. It is as enlightening as it is emotional.That said, I have found it extremely distressing when I read about past scientists/doctors avoiding questions and putting their pride above the possibility of more effective treatment. The determination driving Halstedian mastectomies has been especially disturbing. If nothing else, however, reporting these disagreements may be the most accurate portrayal of scientific ""progress"" and might help the public understand how the world of science works.Dedicating a chapter to the relationship between cancer and smoking, Mukherjee takes us on an epistemological journey central to the history of cancer. How do we know what we know about cancer and smoking? What were the underlying politics that led us to where we are now? It did seem that there was an obvious metaphor that was missed (maybe purposefully omitted): after all the fighting against smoking, not only has smoking not disappeared from society, but it is also growing in popularity again; much like the sudden, explosive relapse of a particularly stubborn cancer."

If this hadn't been a friend's book club choice, I never would have picked it up - but I'm the richer for reading it. Mukherjee's writing is clear, often lyrical. Here's a piece describing leukemia cells: ""The cells look bloated and grotesque, with a dilated nucleus and a thin rim of cytoplasm, the sign of a cell whose very soul has been co-opted to divide and to keep dividing with pathological, monomaniacal purpose."" They grow with ""obscene fecundity."" It's so strange. There is a kind of horrific poetry in the disease - but all at the cellular level, because there is no beauty in what it does to the human body. The history of cancer research is full of men (and a few, oh so very few, women) who live their lives in labs, their eyes searching glass plates for the cure, experimenting on themselves, their wives, their patients. They are driven, weird, mean, egotistical, and brilliant. And sometimes lucky. Through their work, today's doctors know so much more about the way cancer operates. Through their work, we also know how much we don't know. Quite a bit of the book focuses on the particular therapies used for various cancer treatments, much of which seem almost medieval to me, like blood letting. Nearly killing the patient before recovery can begin. It's fucking depressing. Who doesn't know somebody afflicted or maimed by cancer? And yet. If I were young and science-minded, I'd be excited by this book. What's left to be discovered will be profound. The work that's been done is jaw-dropping in its complexity. And here I am......still in awe of simple mitosis. "
61,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6738834-fay-al,4,"Cancer's life is a recapitulation of the body's life, its existence a pathological mirror of our ownThe beginning of this book was with the author's intention to get to know more about cancer since he was majoring in oncology, he thought of it as cancer's own memoirs. But with time, as the small project got more elaborate and complex, he realized that he can turn this into a full blown book. And the result is, quite honestly, very interesting. Cancer, humanity's curse and one of the most ancient diseases we know of, is covered in all of its different aspects. The book starts with the historic aspect, when was cancer first discovered, what was the diagnosis and what were the different treatments we came up with. It then moves on to cover the activism that launched the War on Cancer and how carcinogens were being identified and legislation put in place to limit tobacco use and propagation. Finally it gives a comprehensive tour of the available treatments we have and use now: radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy.""Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little, to cure diseases of which the know less, in human beings of whom they know nothing."" — VoltaireMedicine, I said, begins with storytelling. Patients tell stories to describe illness; doctors tell stories to understand it. Science tells its own story to explain diseases.Overall, this book is a great resource to understand the disease and where we've gotten so far and what are the challenges we're facing to get a full cure for cancer. But the fact that the book was published in late 2010 leaves recent developments in cancer research left out so hopefully I'd find a more recent and equally well-written book on the topic.

It was the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-fiction in 2011 and has been named to a number of prestigious lists of influential books.Wikipedia reports that two of Mukherjee's influences for the book were Randy Shilts' And the Band Played On and Richard Rhodes' The Making of the Atomic Bomb, but the defining moment for him was ""when he conceived of his book as a biography"". I believe it.Emperor of All Maladies is an easy read. Mukherjee takes the reader from Imotep's discovery of cancer over 4000 years ago to present day efforts to find a cure. Although Mukherjee is an accomplished oncologist with hands on experience treating cancer patients, his book is impersonal. We do not read about him or his patients. Instead, we read about the human experience, medical and otherwise, with cancer down through history. This expansive approach is surprisingly engaging. And Mukherjee does a wonderful job de-mystifying the medical science involved in diagnosing, treating and attempting to cure cancer.Cancer is a frightening and unhappy subject, but this is not a frightening, unhappy book. It is optimistic and informative. I think almost anyone would enjoy reading this book. "
63,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,5,"Cancer -- probably the most dreaded word in the English language -- affects everyone. It has been afflicting humans ever since there have been humans. Yet most of us know little about it other than the fact that it causes cells to multiply rapidly without regard for the being in which they reside. Their unrestrained growth eventually kills their host, and themselves as a consequence.The Emperor of All Maladies won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction. I found it to be extremely readable, interesting, and educational as it told the history of cancer and cancer research up to the present time. Only a very few pages were too scientific or technical for me to completely understand. I really can't give this book enough praise. Throughout the time I was reading it I was completely amazed at how deftly the author explained complex ideas and scientific biological principles in ways that were so easily understandable. He also managed to beautifully put a human touch to the subject by describing personal experiences that had affected him during his practice and research as an oncologist. This will be a book I will never forget."

I have just a cursory understanding of the disease from friends and family who have experienced it personally, but this book really opened my eyes. The narrative is very readable, even for a layperson. It's long, but almost riveting in describing how the disease was first identified, treated and then how our perception of it has evolved. I often mention here how many odd coincidences I have in my reading selections. Another one of the book selections for our book club was Mauve: How One Man Invented a Color That Changed the World by Simon Garfield. That book highlighted the discovery of a chemical dye by William Perkin and we just read it this April. I was a bit surprised when he was also referenced in this book (p. 81). And then he mentioned Abraham Verghese (p. 308) - We read Cutting for Stone for our May 2013 selection. I was anticipating that he would mention The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot (we read that one for our September 2011 selection) and the widely studied HeLa cells, but alas, no. That book was published the same year as this one, so perhaps the origin of the cervical cancer cells wasn't as widely known to him as he wrote the book. Otherwise, I get the impression he would've mentioned it.I was also surprised by his mention of Primo Levi's experiences in a concentration camp. His parallel to cancer's annihilation of a person's future and their world outside of the world of a cancer patient is stark and appropriate, but somewhat unexpected. I read Mr. Levi's book, Survival in Auschwitz, this June and it is both a terrible reminder of the levels of degradation, humiliation, and cruelty to which humans can descend, but also to the survival instinct and way in which the human spirit can persevere.Another odd coincidence is the fact that in three books I've recently read (this one, Finding Your Element: How to Discover Your Talents and Passions and Transform Your Life, and You Wouldn't Want to Be Sick in the 16th Century!: Diseases You'd Rather Not Catch), there is mention of the four body fluids, or humors. ""The human body, Hippocrates proposed, was composed of four cardinal fluids called humors: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. Each of these fluids had a unique color (red, black, yellow, and white), viscosity, and essential character. In the normal body, these four fluids were held in perfect, if somewhat precarious, balance. In illness, this balance was upset by the excess of one fluid."" (p. 48) I thought it was odd that the humors came up so frequently in seemingly random reading choices, but then again, I'm usually surprised at the odd coincidences I come across.Overall, I read this book with a fervor that I don't dedicate to many books. Part of it was because I only gave myself a week to read it before the book club meeting and I wasn't sure that I'd finish in time (I did, but just barely.) But also, I think it was due to the nature of the narrative, the fascinating and detailed journal of how we got to present day with our knowledge and treatment of cancer. It is a compelling read, made all the more poignant by the people I know who are battling different cancers. I do know one thing. Should I or one of my family members get diagnosed with a cancer, I would want a doctor like Dr. Thomas Lynch (first mentioned on p. 307) to be there for us. interesting quotes:""The notion of cancer as an affliction that belongs paradigmatically to the twentieth century is reminiscent, as Susan Sontag argued so powerfully in her book Illness as Metaphor, of another disease once considered emblematic of another era: tuberculosis in the nineteenth century. Both diseases, as Sontag pointedly noted, were similarly 'obscene - in the original meaning of that word: ill-omened, abominable, repugnant to the senses.' Both drain vitality; both stretch out the encounter with death; in both cases, dying, even more than death, defines the illness."" (pp. 37-38)""If consumption once killed its victims by pathological evisceration (the tuberculosis bacillus gradually hollows out the lung), then cancer asphyxiates us by filling our bodies with too many cells; it is consumption in its alternate meaning - the pathology of excess."" (p. 38)""It was Atossa's tumor, then that quietly launched a thousand ships. Cancer, even as a clandestine illness, left its fingerprints on the ancient world."" (p. 42)""For cancer, Galen reserved the most malevolent and disquieting of the four humors: black bile. (Only one other disease, replete with metaphors, would be attributed to an excess of this oily, viscous, humor: depression. Indeed, melancholia, the medieval name for 'depression,' would draw its name from the Greek melas, 'black,' and khole, 'bile.' Depression and cancer, the psychic and physical diseases of black bile, were thus intrinsically intertwined.) Galen proposed that cancer was 'trapped' black bile - static bile unable to escape from a site and thus congealed into a matted mass."" (p. 48)""Vesalius had started his anatomical project to save Galen's theory, but, in the end, he quietly buried it."" (p. 53)""'Radicalism' became a psychological obsession, burrowing its way deeply into cancer surgery. Even the word radical was a seductive conceptual trap. Halsted had used it in the Latin sense of 'root' because his operation was meant to dig out the buried, subterranean roots of cancer. But radical also meant 'aggressive,' 'innovative,' and 'brazen,' and it was this meaning that left its mark on the imaginations of patients. What man or woman, confronting cancer, would willingly choose non-radical, or 'conservative,' surgery?"" (pp. 69-70)""Specificity refers to the ability of any medicine to discriminate between its intended target and its host. Killing a cancer cell in a test tube is not a particularly difficult task: the chemical world is packed with malevolent poisons that, even in infitesimal quantities, can dispatch a cancer cell within minutes. The trouble lies in finding a selective poison - a drug that will kill cancer without annihilating the patient. Systemic therapy without specificity is an indiscriminate bomb."" (p. 80)""But this rant in a train compartment was one of medicine's most important ideas in its distilled, primordial form. 'Chemotherapy,' the use of specific chemicals to heal the diseased body, was conceptually born in the middle of the night."" (p. 85)""Ehrlich's successes with Trypan Red and compound 606 (which he named Salvarsan, from the word salvation) proved that diseases were just pathological locks waiting to be picked by the right molecules. The line of potentially curable illnesses now stretched endlessly before him. Ehrlich called his drugs 'magic bullets' - bullets for their capacity to kill and magic for their specificity. It was a phrase with an ancient, alchemic ring that would sound insistently through the future of oncology."" (p. 86)""The wartime chemists went back to their labs to devise new chemicals for other battles, and the inheritors of Ehrlich's legacy went hunting elsewhere for his specific chemicals. They were looking for a magic bullet that would rid the body of caner, not a toxic gas that would leave its victims half-dead, blind, blistered, and permanently anemic. That their bullet would eventually appear out of that very chemical weapon seemed like a perversion of specific affinity, a ghoulish of Ehrlich's dream."" (p. 88)""Every drug, the sixteenth-century physician Paracelsus once opined, is a poison in disguise."" (p. 89)""For any illness to rise to political prominence, it needed to be marketed, just as a political campaign needed marketing. A disease needed to be transformed politically before it could be transformed scientifically."" (p. 99)""To design an ideal anticancer drug, one would need to identify a specific molecular target in a cancer cell and create a chemical to attack that target."" (p. 163)""Society, like the ultimate psychosomatic patient, matches its medical afflictions to its psychological crises; when a disease touches such a visceral chord, it is often because that chord is already resonating."" (p. 182)""If local surgery resulted in the same outcome as radical surgery, then the centrifugal theory had to be reconsidered. Keynes had slyly declared war on radical surgery, even if he had done do by pricking it with a pin-size lancet."" (p. 195)[Bernard Fisher] ""'The clinician, no matter how venerable, must accept the fact that experience, voluminous as it might be, cannot be employed as a sensitive indicator of scientific validity,' Fisher wrote in an article. He was willing to have faith in divine wisdom, but not in Halsted as divine wisdom. 'In God we trust,"" he brusquely told a journalist. 'All others [must] have data.'"" (p. 200)""Events outside the world of medicine also impinged on oncology, injecting new blood and verve into the institute. In the early 1970s, young doctors who opposed the Vietnam War flooded to the NCI. (Due to an obscure legal clause, enrollment in a federal research program, such as the NIH, exempted someone from the draft.) The undrafted soldiers of one battle were thus channeled into another."" (p. 207)""In America, the landscape of cancer medicine had become so deeply gashed by internal rifts that the most important NCI-sponsored trial of cytotoxic chemotherapy to be launched after the announcement of the War on Cancer had to be relocated to a foreign country."" (p. 220)""The allure of deploying a full armamentarium of cytotoxic drugs - of driving the body to the edge of death to rid it of its malignant innards - was still irresistible. So cancer medicine charged on, even if it meant relinquishing sanctity, sanity, or safety."" (p. 223)""She was devoted to her mother, with the reversed - and twice as fierce - maternal instinct that marks the poignant moment of midlife when the roles of mother and daughter begin to switch."" (p. 224)""Palliative care, the branch of medicine that focuses on symptom relief and comfort, had been perceived as the antimatter of cancer therapy, the negative to its positive, an admission of failure to its rhetoric of success. The word palliate comes from the Latin palliare, 'to cloak' - and providing pain relief was perceived as cloaking the essence of the illness, smothering symptoms rather than attacking disease."" (pp. 224-225)""In the history of medicine, no significant disease had ever been eradicated by a treatment-related program alone."" (pp. 228-229)""Old age inevitably drags cancer with it, like flotsam on a tide. A nation with a larger fraction of older citizens will seem more cancer-ridden than a nation with younger citizens, even if actual cancer mortality has not changed."" (p. 230)[John Bailar & Elaine Smith] ""There is 'no evidence,' Bailar and Smith wrote darkly, 'that some thirty-five years of intense and growing efforts to improve the treatment of cancer have had much overall effect on the most fundamental measure of clinical outcome - death.' They continued, 'We are losing the war against cancer notwithstanding progress against several uncommon forms of the disease [such as childhood leukemia and Hodgkin's disease], improvements in palliation and extension of productive years of life...Some thirty-five years of intense effort focused largely on improving treatment must be judged a qualified failure."" (p. 231)[Chicago Tribune, 1975] ""The idea of preventative medicine is faintly un-American. It means, first, recognizing that the enemy is us."" (p. 235)""'Syphilis,' as the saying ran, 'was one night with Venus, followed by a thousand nights with mercury."" (p. 238)""It remains an astonishing, disturbing fact that in America - a nation where nearly every new drug is subjected to rigorous scrutiny as a potential carcinogen, and even the bare hint of a substance's link to cancer ignite a firestorm of public hysteria and media anxiety - one of the most potent and common carcinogens known to humans can be freely bought and sold at every corner store for a few dollars."" (p. 275)""By sampling asymptomatic women, Papanicolaou speculated that his test, albeit imperfect, might capture the disease at its first stages. He would, in essence, push the diagnostic clock backward - from incurable, invasive cancers to curable, preinvasive malignancies."" (p. 289) [nice pun...speculated]""But powerful as the camera might be, cancer confounds this simple rule. Since metastasis is what kills patients with breast cancer, it is, of course, generally true that the ability to detect and remove premetastatic tumors saves women's lives. But it is also true that just because a tumor is small does not mean that it is premetastatic. Even relatively small tumors barely detectable by mammography can carry genetic programs that make them vastly more likely to metastasize early. Conversely, large tumors may inherently be genetically benign - unlikely to invade and metastasize. Size matters, in other words - but only to a point. The difference in the behavior of tumors is not just a consequence of quantitative growth, but of qualitative growth."" (p. 302-303)""By the mid-1940s, three decades after biologists had coined the word, the molecular nature of the gene had come into focus. Functionally, a gene was a unit of inheritance that carried a biological trait from one cell to another or from one generation to the next. Physically, genes were carried within the cell in the form of chromosomes. Chemically, genes were composed of DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid."" (p. 345)""In genetic terms, our cells were not sitting on the edge of the abyss of cancer. They were dragged toward that abyss in graded, discrete steps."" (p. 386)""Cancer's life is a recapitulation of the body's life, its existence a pathological mirror of our own. Susan Sontag warned against overburdening an illness with metaphors. But this is not a metaphor. Down to their innate molecular core, cancer cells are hyperactive, survival-endowed, scrappy, fecund, inventive copies of ourselves."" (p. 388)""The Italian memoirist Primo Levi, who survived a concentration camp and then navigated his way through a blasted Germany to his native Turin, often remarked that among the most fatal qualities of the camp was its ability to erase the idea of a life outside and beyond itself. A person's past and his present were annihilated as a matter of course - to be in the camps was to abnegate history, identity, and personality - but it was the erasure of the future that was the most chilling. With that annihilation, Levi wrote, came a moral and spiritual death that perpetuated the status quo of imprisonment. If no life existed beyond the camp, then the distorted logic by which the camp operated became life as usual."" (p. 397)""It is an old complaint about the practice of medicine that it inures you to the idea of death. But when medicine inures you to the idea of life, to survival, then it has failed utterly. The novelist Thomas Wolfe, recalling a lifelong struggle with illness, wrote in his last letter, 'I've made a long voyage and been to a strange country, and I've seen the dark man very close.' I had not made the journey myself, and I had only seen the darkness reflected in the eyes of others. But surely, it was the most sublime moment of my clinical life to have watched that voyage in reverse, to encounter men and women returning from the strange country - to see them so very close, clambering back."" (p. 400)""Bannister's [sub-four-minute] mile remains a touchstone in the history of athletics not because Bannister set an unbreachable record - currently, the fastest mile is a good fifteen seconds under Bannister's. For generations, four minutes was thought to represent an intrinsic physiological limit, as if muscles could inherently not be made to move any faster or lungs breathe any deeper. What Bannister proved was that such notions about intrinsic boundaries are mythical. What he broke permanently was not a limit, but the idea of limits."" (p. 439)""'Cancer at the fin de siècle,' as the oncologist Harold Burstein described it, 'resides at the interface between society and science.' It poses not one but two challenges. The first, the 'biological challenge' of cancer, involves 'harnessing the fantastic rise in scientific knowledge...to conquer this ancient and terrible illness.' But the second, the 'social challenge,' is just as acute: it involves forcing ourselves to confront our customs, rituals, and behaviors. These, unfortunately, are not customs or behaviors that lie at the peripheries of our society or selves, but ones that lie at their definitional cores: what we eat and drink, what we produce and exude into our environments, when we choose to reproduce, and how we age."" (p. 447)""Cancer is a flaw in our growth, but this flaw is deeply entrenched in ourselves. We can rid ourselves of cancer, then, only as much as we can rid ourselves of the process in our physiology that depend on growth - aging, regeneration, healing, reproduction.""

Goes into technical details deep enough, and still keeps it all interesting by linking to stories.Most of the stuff ""about"" cancer was pretty much known beforehand. The unique part was details on all the persons involved in arduously trying to find a cure. The economic and political agenda. Stories of despair and hope (mostly!)My takeaway was Cancer is not a single disease. Under the same umbrella, its a variety of diseases having different causes and many more varieties of proposed treatments.Is a cure around the corner?This book throws light on how humanity finds hope for a cure with modern technological and medical advancements... and still Cancer keeps evading humanity from a cure! Right from surgical assault, to radical masectomy, to introduction of chemicals (derived from cloth dying agents), to combination of poisons used to target specific traits of cancer..... The latest being looking deep into genetics to find the unsolved answers.The cure seems to be around the next corner, since eternity!""If our understanding and treatment of cancer keep morphing so radically in time, then how can cancer's past be used to predict its future?""Some more quotes I liked from this book:""History repeats but science reverberates.""""Cancer therapy is like beating the dog with a stick to get rid of his fleas.""""Medicine is fundamentally a technological art; at its core lies a desire to improve human lives by intervening on life itself.""Very much recommended."
66,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9369133-happy,5,"This is a fantastic read! The author traces man-kinds history with the dreaded Big C from the earliest references, in Egyptian hieroglyphics to the most modern medical treatments and understanding of its causes. Dr. Mukherjee is a practicing Oncologist and as he tells the history of cancer, he interweaves that story with the stories of some of his patients. As the author tells the story, he enlightens the reader with just how happenstance some of the advances in cancer treatment were. One example he cites is in the development of one of first effective drugs in the treatment of Leukemia. (view spoiler)[During World War II the Allies had moved almost 70 tons of mustard gas to the Italian port of Bari. While the ships were in port, but not unloaded, the Germans bombed the port, sinking some of the ships containing the mustard gas. Before the ships sank much of the gas was vented to the atmosphere killing many of the residents. While preforming autopsies on the victims, it was noticed that their white blood cell counts was extremely low. Apparently the killing of white blood cells is one side effect of mustard gas poisoning. After the war, cancer researches came across this data and a bright light came on and they isolated the parts of mustard gas that killed white blood cells, coming up with one of the first effective chemotherapy drugs for Leukemia. (hide spoiler)] This story is repeated again and again in the search for chemotherapy drugs. It seems that the researchers throw anything they can dream up against the wall to see what sticks.Another interesting theme in the book is the infighting between the different disciplines of medicine. The first effective treatments of cancer were surgical, but when drugs started to become available, the surgeons, for the most part, wanted nothing to do with them, in some cases actively working against chemotherapy. The same thing happened with radiation, but in this case both the surgeons and the pharmacologists teamed up against the radiologists. The author cites time after time when some researcher could not get anyone from a different discipline to cooperate in a study. Often the researchers had to go out of the country to find someone who would participate in their study.Another aspect of the story of cancer that is well told is how the medicine came to the understanding of the causes of cancer – from a single cause ala diphtheria or typhus to the recognition that there are many sources – environmental, viral, genetic, ect. In telling this story, the good Doctor looks at Richard Nixon’s War on Cancer and the high hopes that cancer, much like polio, could be “conquered” before the end of Nixon’s term in office, if enough money was thrown at it. Again as with the advancements in treatment, the internecine battles between the various cancer camps is explored with the initial - if it doesn’t agree with me it can’t have any value to the current understanding of interdisciplinary treatment is traced and explored.All in all this is wonderful look at not just cancer the disease, but the attempts by the medical world to both understand what it is and is not and to find a “cure” for what no patient ever wants to hear from his or her doctor. This is a must read and a well deserving of the Pulitzer Prize Dr. Mukherjee was awarded – 5 stars"

I was in college at the time. Having spent almost my entire childhood under cancer's shadow--she was first diagnosed when I was two, though was ""cured"" for roughly fifteen years--I finally feel enough distance to approach the topic of cancer from a more removed vantage-point.I try not to give out 5 star reviews very often. Usually I save 5-star reviews, not just for excellent books, but for books that reverberated with me somehow on a personal level. For obvious reasons this one did that, but not in the way I expected. Cancer is not a happy topic, and there are tragic episodes that triggered a deja vu feeling in me--usually when the author-oncologist finds himself empathizing with the suffering of his patients. He seems a sensitive doctor, and his patients are lucky to have him. But the book also details a fascinating history of our understanding & battles with this ""most human"" of all diseases. There's the changing history of public policy. In the early 20th century the words ""cancer"" and ""breast"" couldn't even be printed in the newspaper (I think we've come a long way). There's also bio-chemistry! Well...perhaps more bio-chemistry than my math-challenged brain could comprehend, but it was lay-friendly enough that I could understand it. Most importantly, there's an underlying sense of hope that cancer cures, thanks to very recent technological developments such as gene sequencing, are at our finger tips. If you only read one book on cancer, read this one."
68,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,5,"62nd book for 2018.Mukherjee is not only a gifted writer, but (as far as it is possible to ascertain from his writing) a compassion doctor, one who I would be delighted to have treating me. This history is remarkable in not only laying out the details of medical arrogance in the face of cancer (the 10000s of woman who were needless maimed by radical mastectomies is particularly difficult to read), but also it's successes (there were a number of times in the book when I was cheering as some group of patients or another survived was would have been a death sentence). Each survival Mukherjee makes clear is worth celebrating. Published in 2010, the book already getting a bit dated, as advances in genetics revolutionize our understanding of the disease and offer increasingly promising avenues for healing. And Mukherjee is definitely a doctor by training, seeing cancer as a disease to be cured, so although there is a very interesting discussion of tobacco and cancer, disappointingly there is little else by way of discussing preventative measures (diet is certainly not discussed in more than a sentence), which is strange as Mukherjee himself points out that at this point in our understanding of the disease preventative measures would have a disproportionately positive effect on the numbers of people suffering from this dreadful disease.However, with these caveats aside, this book is a must read for anyone who wants to better understand cancer: its history, its etiology, and our attempts to eradicate it.5-stars."

Mukherjee delves into the history of the one disease that has occupied our imagination in recent times, cancer, and traces humanity's understanding of it over the year - traversing the vast epochal shifts since its identification as an illness with no cure by the Egyptians to the modern Cancer Genome Atlas project. The way he weaves in this history with his personal experience as an oncologist, and the portraits he paints of this battle with innumerable key figures is truly remarkable. The book moves at a great pace for a topic this vast, and the narratives he uses capture the spirit and ethos of the 'battle' quite well. The books is also packed with literary references - with allusions to Susan Sontag, Alexander Solzhenitskyn, Lewis Caroll, Italo Calvino to name a few - that help and elucidate this remarkable journey, and also how it can be understood better as the 'new normal' for the millions it affects. Indeed, the language and the tone make this as much as a work of literary excellence as one of scientific expertise."

74,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6871223-aaron-million,4,"Interested in learning more about cancer? Where it comes from, how it starts and then spreads throughout the body, the different types of it, the treatments for it and how they have changed over time, including successful and unsuccessful trials and drugs? Then this is the book for you. Dr. Mukherjee titles this as a biography of cancer, and it definitely is that, and one extremely well-written. It is also mainly a history of many forms of cancer, a history of the advancement in treatment, a sprinkling of politics, mini-biographies of some important people as it concerns cancer throughout history, and topped off with occasional vignettes showcasing personal cases that the Dr. has treated in his young career. The result is a highly informative and, generally, not overly scientific book. Mukherjee begins centuries ago, trying to locate the first known mention of cancer, or something that seemed to be what we would now call cancer but did not yet have a name way back then. He slowly moves forward in time, chronicling how cancer was thought of and treated (or not) all the way up to the first decade of this century. As one quickly learns, during almost all of this time, treatment for any kind of cancer, successful or not, was usually barbaric and sometimes almost as harmful as the tumor itself. Reading about early surgical techniques made me cringe multiple times. It made me wonder how many people just chose to quietly and painfully die from the cancer rather than go through the torture of having a surgeon literally hack into their bodies, with no guarantee of anything except more pain. Not all cancers are covered here - the book would probably never end if that were the case. Mukherjee does focus on several different ones though, with breast cancer and leukemia probably being the two that gets the most pages devoted to them. He writes about Sidney Farber creating an institute just for the study of cancer in the late 1940s, and the creation of the Jimmy Fund in an effort to raise funds to fight childhood leukemia. The advocacy of Farber, and equally of Mary Lasker, to bring attention and then just as importantly, money, to the cause was crucial in research development efforts. Mukherjee takes pains to show the obstacles that they and many others were up against - it was difficult to convince politicians, and sometimes other medical professionals, to expend time and money on a disease that most people sort of assumed there was no cure for. The section of the book that I found most interesting was the part concerning lung cancer, and smoking. Mukherjee examines the difficulties early on of just trying to prove to the general public that smoking causes lung cancer. This was because many people who smoked heavily for decades, died of something else, not lung cancer; and because other people who were non-smokers sometimes got lung cancer. Secondhand smoke was not thought of or understood until the later parts of the 20th century. The cigarette companies and tobacco lobbyists fought furiously to block any attempt to link their products with a deadly disease. Unfortunately, because money talks, this industry had the ear of many politicians in Washington, thus health advocates were thwarted for decades from being able to fully advertise the risks of smoking. You would not think that Mukherjee's primary occupation is that of an oncologist, given how well he writes. He keeps the narrative engaging, occasionally bringing it back to a patient he has recently treated (not all end well, unfortunately). This was probably a little less than 10% of the book, although I would have liked to have seen a lot more of these personal interest stories. As for the scientific terms and procedures, he tries to keep it as basic as possible. Although I will admit that he lost me later in the book as lab results and procedures became more complex and technical. I do not fault him here, but rather my own inability to completely follow all of it. For the most part, it is written for a layperson's understanding. And I recognize that there are some things that one can only dumb down so much without completely losing the meaning of discussing it to begin with. This was published a decade ago, so it would be interesting to see how much has changed in the intervening years, and it would be even more interesting to check back in a few more decades and see how out of date some of today's procedures might be by then.Grade: A- "
75,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84193733-porter-broyles,3,"This book starts and ends very strong, but suffers from two failings:1. The middle third of the book became somewhat repetitive. Scientist were trying to cure a variant of cancer by some combination of surgery, radiation, and poison (hard to call it medicine when it's possible first.)2. The book is about medical science and it's understanding. There is nothing about alternative treatment or intangibles or diet. While clinically these may not be viable treatments, I found it is that they weren't even mentioned. Especially the intangibles---whether you call it faith or stubbornism, surviving cancer is often dependent upon the person infected. Can I prove it? No, but it stands to reason that intangibles do have an affect on surving.That being said, the book was fascinating in what it covered. Starting with childhood lukemia, the author captures the reader with journey pulling for the kids. The haphazard approach used to test cancer combined with early strokes of genius kept the readers attention.The end if the book, about the time AIDS is introduced, the book becomes fascinating again. Here science is really starting to understand cancer and how to treat/handle it.Overall, I'm definitely glad I read this book... Strong 3.5 starts."

Its the small town lawyer who decides to fight against the medical insurance behemoths because they didn't cover his sister's breast cancer treatment, its a pair of driven scientists who spent months walking the corridors of a giant Pharmaceutical company to convince them to mass produce a cancer medicine even though it was for a small variant of cancer and might not earn the company a lot of money, its the clinical researchers who stood their ground against the tobacco companies to push awareness about lung cancer and finally its the countless surgeons, hematologists and geneticists who spent their literal lifetime against a formidable foe and by solving a small piece of the puzzle saved thousands of lives.""The Emperor of All Maladies"" by Siddhartha Mukherjee is a brilliant masterpiece. It is superbly written and extraordinarily insightful. The research that must have gone behind writing this book is astounding - almost every page of this roughly 600 pages book has at least two references. It covers the history of Cancer starting from its first recorded occurrence in the Egyptian texts some 2500 years ago all the way to today's Cancer Genome Atlas. It has riveting accounts of numerous wins and losses by researchers against Cancer and how our collective understanding of this disease has progressed. The book mostly talks about the data from the US and western European countries and the writer, Siddhartha Mukherjee, openly admits to that. But that being said, this book will leave you speechless. IMO, everyone should read this, period."

Generalised anxiety disorder and three grandparents dead of cancer will do that, I guess. Luckily, I’ve turned a corner and reading this just fascinated me — my only regret being that it isn’t quite up to date on the latest in cancer treatments, stuff which I know about from my medical transcription work that isn’t always even past the phase II trial stage yet. The way the doctors I transcribe talk about that… well, I’d love to know more.Still, there’s a lot here: a history of what we’ve known about cancer from ancient history to the time of publication, with meticulous footnotes. It’s illustrated with some case studies, patients of Mukherjee’s, which help to contextualise the treatments mentioned or the cancers being studied. His fascination with the disease is clear, but also his compassion for his patients, though I never found it sentimentalised.It’s a little dense and probably slow going if you’re not used to reading non-fiction, or if the subject matter is unfamiliar. I was delighted that I could follow pretty much all of it, even when he discussed statistics (the bane of my biology degree); I found it pretty impossible to put down, because I had to keep finding out more. As the best non-fiction always does with me, I ended the book by wanting Mukherjee’s job.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."

It was a very dry read, and I was grateful to have an audio version from the library to help me get through it. This is not recommended reading for the average reader. I would think only those with an extreme interest in cancer or a devotee of medical literature would be interested in this book. However, it was very thorough and, as a cancer patient, I found it fascinating. The first half of the book was plodding; a travel back through cancer in history to its earliest mentions, and then traveling forward in time as medical science wrestled with overcoming the disease. It certainly makes one glad to be a cancer patient in this period of time, and I was surprised to realize how very recent most scientific and medical advances in cancer have been. Chemotherapy really only came about in the 60s and 70s, and most progress in treating cancer happened after the 1980s. The latter half of the book brings us into modern times from the 1960s and beyond, through the development of adjuvant treatments of chemo and radiation and on through the discoveries of the Human Genome Project and the development of the Cancer Genome Atlas to the development of targeted cancer therapies - those designed to target specific cancer cells, rather than the more generic chemotherapy, which targets all rapidly dividing cells, both cancerous and healthy normal cells. This part of the book was very interesting and explained the behavior of cancer at the genetic level, down to proteins and cellular pathways. It was the first cancer book that I have read that truly explained what happens inside a cell that causes it to turn cancerous. Most cancer books only mention that cancer cells divide uncontrollably. This book explains how that process starts and covers the 2 ways that it can happen on the cellular level - either by accelerated and uncontrolled growth (akin to a stuck gas pedal on a car) or the absence of the cellular equivalent to a brake pedal to suppress cell growth. I must say, it was an eye-opener about how cancer really works, but I was left with the feeling that cancer is and will continue to be a formidable foe to mankind. I'm not sure that science and medicine will really ever be able to cure cancer - maybe just be able to keep it at bay. I was left with the feeling that cancer is almost a natural bodily function to carry out the process of aging and death."
79,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962663-karen,5,"This book won the Pulitzer for best nonfiction in 2010, and I can see why. Mukherjee shadows researchers in their Ahab-like quest to find the origins and the cure for cancer. We learn about the early developments for the cancer treatments of surgery, radiology and chemotherapy and the subsequent refinements for each. Mukherjee does an excellent job portraying the character of several cancer researchers, showing how science is dynamic, interested and perspectival. Much of the book traces the history and development of cancer research; however, the author at times switches gears from describing a complex puzzle to highlighting the impact cancer has on the people struggling to combat this unrelenting disease. He also balances the scientific detail with epigraphs from literature and history and with references to works such as Susan Sontag's Illness as Metaphor. What I found interesting is how cancer research over the centuries reflects humankind's worldview. During the centuries where Galen's theories of the four humors prevailed, people thought cancer was an excess of bile and rejected surgery because they thought the bile would spread. Then during the early 20th Century, people used war metaphors to describe cancer treatment. Now the focus is on the cellular level, using genetics as the most influential discipline. Although Mukherjee doesn't state this overtly, I see today's genetic-based research and treatment as using analogies from computer programming. As a society, we have to discover the specific way cancer is encoded so we can learn how to reprogram cancer in order to save the patient. The book can be demanding because of its length and its technical detail, so if you only have time and the constitution to read two passages, read these: On p. 391, the author has a 6 point description of cancer's characteristics, which focuses on cellular processes of growth gone wild. His more succinct commentary is contained in a single sentence from p. 388: ""Down to their innate molecular core, cancer cells are hyperactive, survival-endowed, scrappy, fecund, inventive copies of ourselves."" "
80,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge,4,"Book on CD read by Stephen HoyeThe subtitle really says it all: A Biography of Cancer. Mukherjee has extensively researched the disease, going back to recorded cases in ancient Egypt and carefully documented efforts to treat, eradicate, or “cure.” He recounts stories of the many scientists who meticulously searched for and sometimes stumbled up new treatments, showing a passion and dedication to the science and to the human beings whose lives they tried to save. Some of these stories are horrifying: the treatments with dung or bleedings, the determination to cut more and more tissue in a radical mastectomy. Some are uplifting: the tireless efforts of philanthropists and scientists in the “war against cancer,” the grace and dignity of patients with little hope of a cure who nevertheless soldiered on, the “miraculous” survival of Little Jimmy and others. There is considerable medical and scientific jargon. This did not bother me much (I used to do medical transcription, and still read quite a few operative notes weekly), and I think Mukherjee is pretty good at explaining terminology that might not be familiar to a lay person. His use of some patient histories also helps to break up the litany of scientific breakthroughs, and makes the book much more human and relatable. Stephen Hoye does a fine job of narrating the audio version. His voice can be a little droning, however, and given the heavy scientific / medical jargon that is required in sections there were times when I really just wanted to stop listening to him. I think this would be better appreciated if read in a text version rather than listened to in audio format. "
81,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147619-michael,5,"I was a little nervous about a 470 page book about a disease, but it ended up being a page-turner. The narration is very scientific while also being humane and approachable. The book starts with the first mentions of cancer nearly 4000 years ago (we were doing mastectomies 2000 years ago) and moves up through present day, mostly covering the past 150 years as humanity has made progress in fits and starts in understanding and potentially curing the seemingly-endless forms of cancer. (it really is about a million different diseases.) Advances have mostly come from isolated individuals (and their patients) willing to test-- often with horrific results when their hypothesis are wrong-- ideas and cures in the face of known science. Everything and everyone who has moved us forward in medicine (and science in general) were originally rejected by the status quo and were often risking lives and their careers in the hope of progress. They were also often up against billion dollar industries and advertisements like the Marlboro Man. The good news: Everything is moving so fast. The ability to share research and clinical trial data has exploded with the internet. Diagnosis that were a death sentence 10 years ago are now treated as chronic diseases. The book came out in 2010 and already the ending feels a little dated because of advancements. The bad news: We're not there yet. And if you like mice, this book isn't for you. Millions upon millions of them have given up their lives in the hunt for a cure. :)"

Only that everything you have read or heard about this book is correct. Only it is better. I've never encountered a book on a scientific topic that is neither over the heads of lay persons or too simple for experts in the field. This book does the best a book can do: it makes you think and speculate.This is the only book I would recommend wholeheartedly to anyone. If you have been touched by cancer and want to know more about the history, definitions, and prognosis for cancer research and treatment, you can do no better than to start here. If you've worked in the cancer community, this book will connect the dots of things you were sure you understood previously. Or at least what you know will be stated more clearly. If you enjoy good writing and don't necessarily think you have an interest in cancer, you will revel in the Mukherjee's prose. Good oncologists are a dime a dozen, so to speak, but few if any have yet been able to clearly communicate such a misunderstood topic as the author does here.This book won't help to find a cure for cancer, but it helps explain why that is the wrong way to look at it. It is about cancers (plural) and each case is unique. And cautious, realistic optimism is justified in many cases. "

Though the first part of the book, dealt with a subject I am intensely interested in, leukemia, it began as a 3 star book. The history of the disease was interesting. As the author began to talk about the tactics used by the American Cancer Society and the like, I became more interested. But what made this book a 5 star book was the discussion about the war between big tobacco and science. That section alone made the book worth the read. In fact, I would like to have read an entire book about how science and big tobacco fought it out over the years. First rate history!The biochemistry of cancer covered in this book was a great read also. If you have any familiarity with the genetic pathways in oncogenes (RAS- RAF) or enjoy learning about mutations, this book will be a satisfying read. The section on biochem is short but excellent. "

But little was said about why things didn't work, what went wrong in their far-fetched battles!Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee brought us the biography of the monster itself. The monster is like a thousand-faced Chimera with its one after one unique avatars. This book provided a 360* view of the macabre ranging from the mutant slips of the normal cells into malignancy, the dynamic battle between relapses & remissions, the tragedy of not surviving through radical treatments and cytotoxic cures of the disease rather than the disease itself, the hype, uncertainty, desperation, and helplessness among the patients to doctors.It was indeed a long long read. First few days I was paralysed with the tremors of this ghostly beast. I prayed to God not to roll dice of chance mutations of this lurking malignant beast for my near and dear ones. This book provided a full circle of cancer treatments, cures, preventions, the hypes and single-mindedness among doctors, political leaders, cancer lobbyists, and patients about the efficacy of particular treatments and causal theory of cancers that had stalled necessary investigations in the right directions for long. However, the detoured journey got back to its track to reveal the dark-pitted mystery of the malignant cells. Maybe in near future we will have better understanding of our malignant pathological versions.Dr. Mukherjee has turned into one of my favourite writers since last few months. I wish there were more books written by him. I would really miss his writings. But I am glad that I eventually read his beautiful writings. While browsing through his twitter account, found his recently published work in Nature this month on human cancers. May he come up with more essential works!"

92,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212447-sharon-barrow-wilfong,4,"Mukherjee is a cancer physician and interlaces his own experiences with patients with the history of cancer. He does a thorough job tracing back its earliest diagnosis and follows doctors through the ages as they learn to identify and name this Emperor of All Maladies. His descriptions of the different cases and attempts at doctors to save people from cancer read like a suspense novel.One becomes drawn into the lives that these doctors try to save. Some interesting facts emerge: at first physicians did not understand that there could be environmental reasons for cancer and that cancers come from the development of lesions in the body. Doctors started to understand this in the 19th century when young boys hired as chimney sweeps in England began developing lesions on their bodies, particularly their scrotal sacks after they hit puberty. The parts of the body infected were the parts that developed sores from the constant rubbing from traveling up and down chimneys and then became infected with soot.It took a particularly long time for people to connect smoking with lung cancer. This seems common sense to us today, but back then they hardly knew what cancer was and practically everyone smoked, but not everyone developed cancer, so the cause and effect was not immediately obvious.Mukherjee devotes a large portion of his book giving us the history of the battle between tobacco companies and victims of lung cancer. It seems the big bad company against the little person is a safe target to vilify. Too bad he wasn't as forthright about the connection between Sexually Transmitted Diseases and cervical cancer or that HPV is closely associated with anal cancer. He gives those facts barely a nod while not even including the growing evidence suggesting that abortion increases risk of breast cancer. I guess we need to make sure we only attack the people it's fashionable to attack rather than informing the populace about unpopular preventative health measures. He is, after all, trying to sell a book.What was most informative was how cancer develops in the body. The body is amazingly resilient to foreign bodies and even has a back up system when a lesion develops. He gives an example of someone who inhaled asbestos in their youth. This would cause a lesion in the lung, but not cancer because the immune system with its back up would only lose one ""fighter""against the lesion. (there's a medical term but I'll say fighter for convenience) But say the person also smoked for many years. This would produce another lesion and attack the back up defense. Now the body is out of fighters, hence the development of rapidly growing radicals because there is now nothing to stop it.Mukherjee takes us along with the doctors who, through hit and miss, and countless trials finally came up with the idea of chemical warfare against free radicals as well as radiation. He describes how these various procedures work. This is a huge improvement from the radical surgery that doctors employed at the turn of the last century. Surgeons would cut away almost half a person's body in order to eradicate the cancer.What they found out was that surgery actually caused the cancer to spread by creating more lesions.The entire book, while being non fiction, is written in a highly engaging style and is a fascinating look at a malady that has surely affected every one of us at one time or another."

94,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350233-casey,5,"I never understood why intelligent, well-rounded people would want to become oncologists. On television, such doctors were the James Wilson type: damaged, overly empathetic, the kind of person who gets off on guilt. I was never particularly interested in medicine, but I always thought it would be more fun to be an obstetrician or plastic surgeon, helping perfectly healthy people fulfill their dreams of having cute babies or big boobs, and never really dealing with issues as macabre as telling someone they only had a few months live.Everyone has a personal story about the impact of cancer on their own lives, and I am no exception: when I was in college, my mother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. The prognosis wasn't good, although I didn't know how bad it was at the time: my mom asked her oncologist not to reveal her staging. We were lucky, for a number of reasons. My mom had fantastic health insurance through the school where she taught, and she received treatment at a highly-ranked research hospital that just happened to be located close to my nowheresville hometown. The cancer was driven by a particular gene that had recently been discovered, and that was receiving an intense amount of research interest. If the cancer had developed a few years earlier, things might not have gone quite so well.Things really did go well, though: my mom is now in remission, although she still sees her oncologist for regular check-ups. One thing that surprised me was the deep relationship she developed with the oncologist who oversaw her treatment. He was focused on research, but not to such a myopic extent that he failed to support his patients. He was optimistic, but honest. My mom told me that he claimed to have stopped trying to estimate who would live and who would die, because his estimates failed to take into account the ephemeral human factors that cannot be measured. Although I never met this doctor, he didn't sound like the stereotype of an oncologist I had pictured. Instead, he was a well-adjusted doctor who cared about his patients and was passionate about his job.This is all a long windup to the simple fact that I totally get it now: I understand why people would devote their life to oncology. As Mukherjee writes, the root of the word oncology can be translated as ""burden,"" and it would be disingenuous to say that doctors treating cancer patients do not feel this burden on their shoulders. However, cancer is also fascinating. Before reading this book, I had no idea how cancer manipulated genes, setting off cascades that ultimately lead to uninhibited growth of tissue. Cancers are wily and manipulative, taking advantage of the human body in order to proliferate. The group of diseases we call cancer are darkly human in their intelligence and sheer desire to multiply."

It’s not just for those who are struggling with cancer personally, or have loved ones who do, or those who work on the treatment/care for cancer. We have read the statistics about the toll that caner is taking on human life, but I doubt people fully realize what the nature and scope of cancer are. Cancer is death, but it’s also life and growth and reproduction. Cancer is us – literally us. I thought I know this, but I really didn’t until I read this book. The book is mean to be a “biography” of cancer. It starts off with the history of the disease in the ancient times. Not much to say there. Then it moves into the 19th, and then 20th century where it spends most of its time – not just on science and medicine, but also politics and activism of the “War on Cancer.” If you have too much faith in the medical sciences, this book will cure you of it. You see how for decades and decades doctors and scientists didn’t really have any clue about what they were doing and what cancer really is. They moved from treatment to treatment. They caused cancer thinking they were curing it. They hacked and disfigured their patients who would die of cancer later anyway – if they survived the surgery. They poisoned their patients to the brink of death hoping to kill the cancer cells. Decades passed, and once they compiled the statistics, they realized that no real progress had been made. Things are only slightly better now. Unlocking the mysteries of cancer is unlocking the mysteries of life itself. Knowing what an intrinsic part of our biology it is can only give us despair in our fight against it. Only recently scientists have been able to understand some inner aspects of cancer and offer nontoxic medication for a few specific types of cancer. Cancer treatment, by and large, still is: take this poison (chemotherapy), chop off a part of your body, get fried by radiation – and good luck. A biography is supposed to end with the death of its subject, but not this one. We may have to accept that our war on cancer will not end in a victory. Our best chance may be a ceasefire on good terms – controlling it until we live close to what is considered a normal human life span. Mukherjee is a knowledgeable scientist, a great writer, and a compassionate doctor. This book is very well-written and well-researched. It reads like a gripping detective novel. It gets a bit difficult and scientific at times, but there’s no avoiding it. Know thy enemy – which is the same as know-thyself in this case. This book both breaks your heart and gives a glimmer of hope at the same time. In the end, we have to accept that we’re mortals. Consider it an irony that the caner that brings us death rises from the same forces that gave us life. "

It describes what has been learnt about cancer and how it was learned it through the years. It is a veritable who’s who in the world of oncology. He explores the origins of cancer, how it develops and how it behaves. He talks about the milestones in the “War against cancer” but unfortunately the success in battling cancer has not paralleled the tremendous increase in our knowledge of it in the past century.He spins an intriguing story, starting from ancient history, all the way to modern times, but this not just scientific history. There is a fair bit of sociopolitical history, reflections of human behaviour, even literary references at different points in the book. Closely intertwined with the story of cancer is how scientific research has also evolved. Only at the end, does he indulge in a philosophical discussion about the nature of cancer or rather about cancer in nature.The writing is well balanced between subjective and objective, between sentimentality and science. He seems to have done quite extensive research into the topic. It is not purely hard facts as his thoughts and feelings do permeate through the narratives. You can sense his excitement at some of the remarkable breakthroughs in the knowledge and treatment of cancer. You can also sense his disappointment at some of the obstacles and setbacks. But most of the story is technical and some of it gets a bit esoteric. He tells just enough of it to illustrate his point and makes the effort to explain it in lay terms. He does include some anecdotes about his own patients and their experiences, a mixture of triumphs and failures. Perhaps the only thing which he does not share is his own personal experiences with cancer, if any. There were shocking revelations including about medical research fraud and about the tobacco industry. It is ironic that while we are so obsessed with carcinogens, the most well known carcinogen of all is still so readily available and accessible. The push for cancer treatment is also not so straightforward and it is fraught with ethical dilemmas. In short, if you want a good overview of cancer, this book is it."

It points to the fact that as we grow and learn about this disease, the more it seems to learn about us. In this battle we have waged against this illness, we oftentimes have stumbled and lost, but the battles continue as scientists map, understand, and wage war against this enemy in the human body.Dr Mukherjee has written an informative book about cancer from it's first known appearance to the present where many steps forward have made certainly cancers somewhat curable while others still seem to evade any type of therapies and drugs. Fascinating and poignant, this author has made cancer an understandable disease to the reader. Intense and frightening, he has presented the faces of some of his patients thereby humanizing the disease and not just making this book a clinical study of a dreaded illness.We can only hope that the dedication and zeal of reseachers, doctor, and yes, even drug companies will carry on their tireless efforts to bring some sort of understanding and closure to this most insidious of enemies within the human body. One can't help but feel that this is the ""perfect"" disease, one that changes roles and tactics as if knowing in the end it will be always come away winning the battle raging within its host body. It is the disease we all fear, the disease that we think carries a death sentence. Yet, Dr. Mukherjee shows us how far we have come and how far we need to travel in order to have this disaese controlled. It was a wonderfully informative book written in a way in which a lay person could fully understand. One can only hope that the future will hold the cure and that the men and women who so diligently work across the planet in the hopes of defeating this ""emperor"" will eventually see their work and efforts bearing the fruit of human survival.

Add to this the daunting nature of the subject and it makes Mr. Mukherjee's achievement all the more remarkable. With the deftness of a fiction writer, this book grips all but the most moribund of minds in its beautiful, often poignant, never dull descriptions of mankind's enduring struggle with the fearsome illnesses we collectively call cancer. Frequently dealing with scientific concepts and the seemingly convoluted logic involved in the pursuit of therapies, preventions, and palliatives, Mukherjee remains Sherpa-like in his steady, guiding narrative and enables us to scale the subject with ease and fascination.Although dealing with a largely clinical subject, Mukherjee's treatment is far from clinical. He brings the personalities to life whether they be the researchers, clinicians, politicians, industrialists or patients. Each is delivered to us as a real persona whose strengths and flaws bring him or her into vivid focus. I was moved, sometimes to tears. In drawing me to contemplate my own future and whether cancer might figure in it, the book gave me both hope and fear.Mukherjee even pays attention to the cadence of the prose so that reading it feels as if the words carry their own lubricant. He is a rare blend of scientist and storyteller who has mastered the art of distilling without losing important details for a highly technical subject.Awesome!"

It’s not “entertaining” but you won’t be able to put it down. It’s full of surprises, though not the kind that make you gasp.Did you know that “Jimmy” of the Jimmy Fund was a Scandinavian boy who lived to old age in northern New England? That the origin of chemo-therapy was a Boston doctor injecting various caustic chemicals into patients who were in the last stages of leukemia? That cancer research was set back decades by the Cancer Society, which wanted lots of money thrown at the disease but didn’t fund the kind of research that has eventually explained how cancer develops on a cellular level?There are many things that make this book so engrossing. One is the personality of the author, which comes through his writing – despite his trying to step back from his subject. Another is the fascination most of us have with cancer. So few of us are untouched by the disease, with public figures, friends, or family members being diagnosed with one of the many kinds of carcinoma.The story of trends in cancer treatment leads to the innovative and often successful treatments of today. It’s a book filled with hope.2011 No 90 Coming soon: Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Portrait in Letters of an American Visionary"

Few of us living in C21 have not brushed up against cancer in some form or other. Whether witnessing its devastation first hand or through the testimony of others few can face the challenge of a cancer diagnosis with equanimity. This book pulls no punches and Mukherjee writes with a deep passion for his subject revealing his fascination with the enemy he has dedicated his life to fighting, but for us laity understanding an enemy can reduce the fear of cancer in its myriad forms and a reduction of fear can sometimes lead to an unexpected and unhoped for victory or reprieve. This book is first and foremost a first class history of the fight against cancer. Although the book is aimed at the layman at times the science can be complex to understand even for a lifelong science buff like myself. There is hope here certainly extra-ordinary triumphs and break throughs as many people alive today can testify to, but cancer turns out to be far more complex and confusing a disease than even the most experienced researchers of C20 could have imagined. Thanks to the extra-ordinary dedication, determination and occasional wild guesses of a handful of brilliant researchers and the patient legwork of thousands more some battles have been won. Many more are daily lost but the war goes on. "

Primary care doctors spend a mere 13 minutes per patient in an office visit, according to a new analysis. The history of the patient used to be seen as essential in sorting out what's wrong. Instead it's a pill for every ill and insurance companies rewarding procedures over consults. Shotgun blast medicine that's the most expensive in the world.=========================I am surprised that the author left out this later phase of the anti-smoking campaign https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retri...Section IV on smoking and the extensive machinations of the Big Tobacco disinformation campaign is worth the price of the book alone. It's become a kind of playbook for other entities. I see some evidence of that in the gun lobby in the U.S. These entities have a lot of money that they put to use in influencing the people they want to.A note on style: This is not a dry textbook. The style is very fluid. Though rich in information, the narrative moves right along. Even the accounts of research read like engrossing detective stories.================"

I have lost 3 friends to cancer in the past year, and others are still fighting, so I needed this book to help process the historical & clinical aspects of this disease.I felt lost a lot of the time & my mind frequently wandered during playback; normally I would rewind to see what I missed but in this case I did not. I am no scientist, so a lot of the technical & scientific concepts were lost on me. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the historical aspect & personal stories. The best part of all was how the author wrapped up the history in the end, placing an early character into the various historical contexts up through present day. The book increased my understanding of the various types of cancer & how they differ (as well as the types within types,) the complexities of trials & FDA approvals, the magnitude of costs & why big pharma might not be keen on pursuing them regardless of the number of lives that could be saved or extended. I also found it fascinating that a number of significant changes have occurred in my lifetime, of which I was only vaguely familiar, and the great lengths we as a population are willing to go to extend life a few months; and for the very fortunate, a few years. I hope we find several cures for the sequel..."

In the midst of scientific abstraction, it is sometimes possible to forget this one basic factWhat a fantastic storytelling! There are non-fiction books that are readable yet dumbed down - while this book lifts you up to a new level. It is essentially the story of the disease whose understanding has changed over centuries and evolved through multiple paths. The author tells the story almost with reverence to the human spirit and the malady. The human side of the disease, the resilience of a species at war and sobering defeats and disappointments, lucky breaks form hallmarks of a medical story. I found the research thorough and presentation brilliant. The biggest challenge would be to handle the parallel developments - and so he handles them in multiple threads. The defeats are heart breaking. It also critiqued the science vs care priorities. By introducing his patients and their very personal battles, he touches a chord. I don't think this story could have been told any better. Ends on the note of hope which is the only way I would want any book to end.Started as a buddy read among 4-5 books. Ended up dropping every other book I was reading to finish this. That tells the power of the book.Highly recommended!"
105,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5955141-madeline,1,"Ugh. It took me a good solid month to get through this one, and boy was it painful.Normally I'm a big fan of well-written pieces of non-fiction, but this was thick, boring, poorly constructed and utterly overrated. Additionally, the quality of the writing was sub-par at best. If I see somebody use the word ""macabre"" one more time in a novel, I'm going to freak out. Overall what I found the most frustrating was the organization of the book. The chapters were oddly strung together, key people to the ""cancer story"" were introduced abruptly (and to add insult to injury, each time a new person was introduced, they got three descriptive words about themselves which ended up being repetitive and formulaic with each chapter), discussed quickly, and then exited quickly before another stupid chapter started and the whole process started again.I shouldn't be as bitter about this one, but mostly it's because only 10% of the time did I feel the book was decently written/kept my interest. The rest of the time I felt like I was slogging through mud. Here is the perfect example of headscratcher to me - why people and critics are calling this a masterpiece is beyond me. "
106,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2670408-ambyr,4,"Thorough and engrossing. I appreciate Mukherjee's mixture of science, politics, and social history, which clearly situates research and treatment methods within their cultural context. The jumping back and forth in time was deftly handled, though I still found myself wishing for a consolidated timeline at the end. (If the print edition had one, I withdraw this objection.) Some of the genetics toward the end went over my head, and I think I'd have to reread, possibly in print, to truly appreciate what he's saying about the make-up of cancer and its curative agents. But it's complicated stuff, and I think he did the best he could to break it down for a lay audience.Probably my biggest take-away here is how little practical effect our progress has made; we've advanced leaps and bounds in our understanding, and yet in many cases that means survival extended by months or not at all. That researchers continue nonetheless speaks to the triumph of human optimism, I guess.Minor personal rant: dear authors, please stop using enormity as a synonym for immensity. It throws me every time."
107,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,5,"A complete look at Cancer. Mukherjee manages to make the concept, workings and progression of Cancer understandable. He manages to show the incredible progress being made in the understanding of the disease, in all its variations, and the possibility of it coming under the control of medical management. The history of Cancer is fascinating and Mukherjee manages to make it readable and meaningful. The science of Cancer is made understandable and each discovery is defined in terms that non-medical folks can grasp. This book does is interesting throughout, from first page to last, and really puts Cancer into perspective, it goes beyond the hype of the media. Also, we meet some incredible and courageous patients throughout. It brings all the current Cancer patients to mind: how they are fighting with dignity and courage and hope. A high five to Siddartha Mukherjee for bringing the humanity of the disease and the struggle to us, while explaining the intricacies of the disease in the easy going way that he did. "

This biography traces cancer, from its appearance more than four thousand years ago and the attempts to understand it, control it, prevent it and cure it that continue into this Century. While it is clearly written with compassion, the author doesn't pull any punches with details on the ravages wrought by the vicious disease and some of the drastic attempts at putting a stop to the aggressive invasion of these mutant cells in the human body.It's fascinating, horrifying, saddening and yet hopeful. It gave me a better understanding of the disease in all its forms, and more importantly, I'm comforted that there are organizations and individuals still determined to find better treatments leading to perhaps a cure in the near future."

I think the decision to write a comprehensive history of cancer was 'courageous' in the 'Yes, Minister' sense. There is a lot of fascinating detail, but it's all presented in such a dense whirl I wouldn't bet the house on my having retained much of it in a week or so. We jump about a lot through the years, a chapter can start in 1981 and end in 1976, taking in 1991 along the way. At times I had the feeling that there was an attempt going on to try and impose order on the chaos through these deft time jumps... but I was at times left a bit confused as to how different elements of research built on each other. That said, there is an absolute wealth of information here, and an almost exhaustive index (nearly a hundred pages!) that will make this a superb resource... but a timeline and a cast of characters would have really helped to keep track of what was going on and more rigorous breakdown into themes would have made this a more satisfying cover-to-cover read.

110,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3238010-julie,4,"I found this to be a very interesting and educational book about the history of cancer: the history of our understanding of the disease, treatment approaches, and the disconnect between the two. I occasionally thought the book went into more detail about the politics of the War on Cancer than I wanted, and some of the explanations about genes and cancer were a little confusing so that knocked my rating down from 5 stars to 4. Overall, the book was very well done though, and I learned a lot. Some things were nicely summarized in the last chapter and in the photo section too. I knew chemo is no fun of course…feeling weak and sick, losing hair….but I had no idea that the history of cancer treatment included some of the brutal treatments that it does. Having recently gotten my first mammogram and having them find something “suspicious”, I found the parts about early detection and mammograms for different age groups and over- and under-diagnosis to be especially interesting.

He starts every short chapter with several quotes from tobacco executives to Lewis Carroll to Italo Calvino. He goes into some depth on the science, but I would not think it was an inaccessible book for those who might want to skim through some of the details.Just remembered one of quotes from Woody Allen about not wanting to achieve immortality through his work, but just by not dying;-)"

As a researcher and physician, he is more competent than Thorwald (who was a journalist), but is equal to him in style and writing skills. Similarly to Thorwald, you'll find here history of medicine interconnected with personal stories, short characteristics of patiens and doctors, and some dramatization of events.
