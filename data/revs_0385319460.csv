1,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,4,"This book is a very brief history of a significant part of the mathematics that is presented in the perspective of one of the most difficult mathematical problems - Fermat's Last Theorem. It has been formulated by Pierre de Fermat and challenged many mathematicians for centuries, until it was quite recently solved by Andrew Wiles. Fermat's Last Theorem states that no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than 2. As one can imagine, the arrival to the solution was hard and with numerous byways. The search for the solution of the problem prompted the development of some other important number theories. That is presented by the author in a quite clear way and is a good read for everybody with interest in math. I know mathematicians have issues with some of the thesis in this book, but as an overall history of the famous problem it is a valid and interesting text."

First talked about in around 1637 (Fermat hinted at his solution in the margins of a text book by ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus), its roots go back even farther, yet the equation wasn't solved until 1994. There's a section that deals with the intrigue of mathematical proprietorship which feels odd in the context of the rest of the book, but the explanations of mathematical theories & their histories is made almost understandable üòâ"

4,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2134559-erin,4,"Aczel does a thorough job of describing the problems behind Fermat's Last Theorem including the history of mathematical discoveries that lead to the final solution of the proof in 1993. His history is entertaining and completely readable to the layperson, often including simple examples to illustrate principles and the details hardly ever border on tedious. I also enjoyed Aczel's use of brief anecdotes to add depth to the characters featured in what would otherwise be a mathematical name parade. That said, the final proof of Fermat's Last Theorem involves many different branches of mathematics and some very clever applications of mathematical results spanning the whole history of math, from the ancient Greek Diophantus to the work of Taniyama and Ribet in the 21st century. Grasping even the broad overview of what was accomplished is quite a headful of names and theories. Aczel handles the task quite efficiently, wrapping up the many details into a neat little package of less than 140 pages. Overall, a great quick read offering a brief and entertaining mathematical history leading up to one of the most dramatic and heart-wrenching stories in mathematics to date."
5,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354072-ahmed,5,"Simple, elegant, and utterly impossible to prove I think that Fermat's last theorem is one of the most interesting theorems ever created. Amir D. Aczel made this great book to show us how such a simple theorem A^n+B^n=C^n if n is greater than 2.I strongly believe that everyone should read this complex and fascinating book. The author has made the theorm so simple and so hard to solve at the same time. I rate this book a 5/5 stars. "

8,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30102760-momshad-alvee,5,First book I ever read out of interest at 7th grade. This probably changed my life...maybe
9,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,3,"This book is much too short to accomplish it's goal--which is to explain Andrew Wiles proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and to ground that explanation in the history of mathematics. Simon Singh's Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem does a much better job but even that falls short. In contrast to Singh's explications that really try to explain the concepts, Amir Aczel presents more of a capsule series of biographies of the many mathematicians over the last several centuries whose work converged in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. He tries to explain some concepts with words and figures but the explanations themselves are too elliptical. The individual pieces of the book are interesting and often entertaining enough. And the argument that you need to understand all of mathematics to understand the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is also driven home with overwhelming force. But I was hoping for something more."
10,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2322674-christopher-chambers,2,"An easy read - perhaps too easy.The author takes a classic chronological approach and covers 'all the usual suspects' in the evolution of FLT and its eventual solution. He gives proper emphasis to the crossovers of mathematical areas that informed Wiles's insights. The best parts are perhaps the discussions of the academic spats and the niceties of naming. Aczel is clear in the association of Goro Shimura's name with the (then) conjecture, possibly more of a concern when he was writing in 1996 (this edition 1997 for UK unchanged from earlier US).There are typos and mis-statements as other reviewers have pointed out. They are annoying but I've sympathy for anyone trying to write lay explanations of science and especially maths. However this book does eventually dissolve - as many popular science tracts do - into a novel-like state where the characters are unknowable constructs rather than fictions: 'Modular forms' appears and the expression gains familiarity but at the end can the reader write down an example?"
11,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8425689-synthetic-vox,4,"I really enjoyed this book. Short and very accessible given that it covers basically the history of number theory from the Babylonian times to the solving of FLT. It uses the people connected to their key mathematical ideas as the thread, which I really appreciated. I knew almost nothing about mathematics or mathematicians and so very much appreciated learning about Gauss‚Äô genius and life, for example. As the blurb says, ‚ÄúAn excellent short history of mathematics, viewed through the lens of one of its great problems‚Äîand achievements.‚Äù I dropped a star because it didn‚Äôt use chapter formats, which I found that a little tedious, and because toward the end the author stopped explaining what certain terms meant.If you enjoyed this, I would highly recommend reading The Housekeeper and the Professor."
12,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7586247-heather,4,"This book came to me from my son who has a far deeper understanding of mathematics than I do. Truly I‚Äôd give it 4.5 stars because although a bit of the narrative of people through mathematical history became cumbersome, this book has given me a much wider perspective of math that I‚Äôve never considered before. If my sixth graders had an approach similar to the thinkers of this book it would take them much further than our sorry common core math curriculum could. I loved the deep dedication of the mathematicians throughout history. And although, I‚Äôve never identified myself as a ‚Äúmath‚Äù person, I‚Äôm lead to the conclusion that the world of math is much, much bigger and I am familiar with very very little of it. My respect for mathematics has grown significantly after this read. ‚ÄúMathematics is the language in which God has written the universe‚Äù Galileo"
13,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575578-linda,3,"Well I did read some of it, seriously when the math gets heavy I exit.One of Fermat's most stunning achievements was to develop the main ideas of calculus, thirteen years before Sir Isaac Newton. Fermat translated many Greek works into Latin among which was a book called Arithmetica written by the Greek mathematician Diophantus. Next to a problem on breaking down a squared nuber into two squares he wroteOn the other hand, it is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a biquadrate into two biquadrates, or generally any power except a square into two powers with the same exponent. i have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which, however, the margin is not large enough to contain.This simple sentence would keep mathematicians busy for centuries! Fun read."
14,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,3,"A good summary of the work which went into the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for non-mathematicians. Marred by clear signs of a hurry to get the book out - proof reading errors and small gaffes (there's one place for instance where two adjacent sentences appear to contradict each other which is due to a missing qualification in the second sentence, which only holds for some numbers not globally). Concentrates more on personalities than the mathematics, which makes it less useful for a reader actually trying to get more than a vague understanding of the incredibly difficult ideas which made Wiles' proof possible. But highly readable!"
15,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2500454-gabe,3,"This is a fun little book on the history of Fermat's Last Theorem. Aczel does a good job of telling the story. The mathematics is kept at the level of techno-babble, that is, random sounding jargon that you're not expected to understand. The story is mostly about the strange people who made various mathematical contributions, starting with ancient thinkers and working all the way up to the 1990s when the theorem was proven. There are plenty of stories of mathematicians leading troubled lives and being jerks to each other. It makes me glad not to be a mathematician!"
16,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81424728-qingyang,3,"I thought it was going to be more mathematical, but turned out to be more of a historical account, which is not really my thing. Proved to be nonetheless interesting. The author presents the beautiful mathematical world through which Fermat, Euler, Guass, Shimura, Weil, Wiles and others explored. There are interesting connections between seemingly unrelated fields of mathematics which ultimately lead to proving Fermat's last theorem. It made me realise the power of versatility in maths, the power of seeing connections and the power of collaboration"
17,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120774829-joe-sadler,3,Engaging history of a pretty technical topic. Tells a history of math problems and solutions over 200 years in the context of trying to solve one famous problem. Reads easy but you've got to find the topic interesting already. For my level of math sophistication (hardly any) the issues could have been explained a bit more clearly or else shortened up - towards the end I was basically just scanning the technical explanations because I knew they would be over my head.

25,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1024257-robert,2,"A typical general reader math book on the low math content side. Admittedly this particular topic (a proof that runs about 200 pages of terse writing and mathematical symbols) is hard to describe briefly, and this is a very brief book, or with much detail accessible to people who have not acquired the equivalent of a decent graduate level understanding of mathematics. About half of the book is a light survey of very familiar (to the point in some cases of being boiler plate for books likes this) biography of famous mathematicians whose work touched on areas related to Fermat's Last theorem (Fermat (obviously), Euler, Gauss, Poincare, Fibonacci, Archimedes, Galois, Pythagoras, Diophantus, Fourier, Cantor vs Kronecker, Bolyai and Lobachevsky and some probably less well known to the general public, Kummer, Dirichet, Monge, Dedekind). The rest concerns more recent mathematicians and their work (especially the hardy post WWII Japanese mathematicians who achieved important results under unusually trying circumstances) that contributed directly to Andrew Wiles ultimate proof of the theorem. It tells a good story of the secrecy and paranoia behind the scenes, driven by the twin concerns of being subjected to premature and distracting attention, not to mention derision and ultimately humiliation if unsuccessful, once word gets out that one has the nerve to work seriously one of the most famous unsolved problems of all time, and the real risk that someone will get there first and, worse, publish first after getting some hint of the way to go from the primary researcher. (Tom Lehrer's famous song ""Lobachevsky"" tells the story of appropriated results quite well even if it's namesake was only chosen for lyrical convenience not historical accuracy.) The story was actually quite dramatic since a flaw was found shortly after Wiles' boldly theatrical and unrefereed presentation at Cambridge. There is a happy ending when Wiles finds the way out with the additional satisfaction of finding it in the research he had originally expected to be the source of the proof but had given up a few years earlier.One point that is well made is that this proof required new discoveries and the complex assembly of two centuries of discoveries that uncovered many deep and complex connections between what had been regarded as utterly separate branches of mathematics that have moved number theory forward since the times of Euler and Gauss. We will never know if Fermat had a proof that just wouldn't fit in the margin of his book. It is my opinion that if so many gifted mathematicians in the century or two after Fermat could not find a proof, the great Gauss took a good look at it and pronounced the grapes to be sour and the huge array of distinct recent developments made by so many mathematicians that had to be proved or combined by Wiles to get the present proof, there is no way that Fermat had a full proof of the theorem, but rather he had probably proven a few of the cases by the customary techniques of the day and assumed that the rest could be accomplished by more of the same and moved on. Mathematics was much less rigorous in those days evidenced by another Fermat ""result"" concerning prime numbers that was eventually disproved by Euler. At least the ""Last"" theorem turns out to be true which is what I think most mathematicians expected. (Wiles also created a glaring anachronism in one episode of Star Trek TNG in which Picard, in the 24th century, mentions Fermat's Last Theorem as one of those mysteries that have never been solved.) Wiles' result leaves the Goldbach conjecture (every even number is the sum of two prime numbers) as the last great well known and easily understood unsolved problem. Thanks to recent books and movies about John Forbes Nash, the general public is now more aware the other most famous unsolved problem, the Riemann Hypothesis, the problem that supposedly drove the 30-ish Nash over the edge in his unsuccessful pursuit of a Field medal. (And few general reading books about the Riemann Hypothesis itself have just come out as well.) But ""all the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part 1/2"" just does not have the simple appeal of the Goldbach problem since only math students are likely to know what the zeta function is or why anyone ever discovered it or cares about it.If you can find it I recommend the Nova program about the proof as it includes an explanation of the key recent developments that is as good as that in this book (minus the long historical build up and famiilar anecdotes) and live interview footage of Wiles himself."
26,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15613653-kweetat-chew,5,"This book is a good introduction to how the ""world's greatest math problem"" was solved. The reader is introduced to the mathematical exploits of Pierre de Fermat ‚Äî a leading 17th century French mathematician ‚Äî in particular, to one famous conjecture, the so-called Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem.In 1637, Fermat scribbled at the tiny margins of an Ancient Greek text, the Diophantus‚Äô Arithmetica, that he‚Äôd found the proof that there was no integer solution to the Diophantine equation (a polynomial equation with integers as solutions): x^n+y^n=z^n, for any integer of n >2. Unfortunately, he could not provide the proof, ostensibly due to a lack of space in the book!For more than 350 years, mathematicians chipped away at the problem, each moving nearer and nearer to the Holy Grail, but never quite successful, until 1993, when Andrew Wiles, a distinguished Oxford don, who had worked doggedly for six years in secrecy, presented his ‚Äúproof‚Äù in Cambridge, only to be set back by a fatal flaw. Not to be outdone, he renewed his attack on the problem, and in 1994, came up with a brilliant idea, and together with his former student Richard Taylor, solved and completed the proof. Andrew Wiles stood on the shoulders of giants, whose work and theories were necessary, but still insufficient to get to the proof. Only with Wiles‚Äô genius and perseverance, the obstinate knots were finally unraveled and released. The reader gets to glimpse the work of giants of mathematics such as Pythagoras, Euclid, Archimedes, Fibonacci, Descartes, Pascal, Euler, Galois, Abel, Riemann, Hilbert, Poincare, Taniyama, Shimura, Weil, Lang, Frey, Ribet, Mazur, Taylor, and many more! The book cuts through a vast swath of their work, such as number theory, group theory, Galois theory; Gauss‚Äô integration of complex numbers into number theory; algebraic number theory, complex variables, prime number theorem, non-Euclidean geometry, elliptic functions, idea of countable infinities, Poincar√©‚Äôs contribution to elliptic curves, abelian groups, Mordell‚Äôs conjecture and Faltings‚Äô belated proof of that conjecture, Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, connecting modular forms with elliptic curves, and so on. There is also a ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù story, a rather pejorative tale of guile, and betrayal by Andr√© Weil, as regards the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture.The eventual solution rested with tackling the problem via Frey‚Äôs unusual imaginary curve, that if proven to be not modular, then there existed two possible conclusions, and the latter one was how Andrew Wiles completed the proof:1) If Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem is false, then the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture is also false2) If the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture is true, then so is Fermat's last theorem"
27,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,3,"Originally published on my blog here in August 1998.This book is a popular history of Fermat's Last Theorem, from its original conjecture by Fermat to its solution by Andrew Wiles. As a history, it works quite well, with occasional infelicities (mainly to do with forced, false sounding connections between unrelated parts of the narrative, such as linking mathematicians because they were both interested in some fairly large division of mathematics). From a mathematical point of view, I felt it was perhaps a little less successful. It managed to be over-simplified for the mathematically trained and at the same time potentially confusing for the non-mathematician. I suppose you can assume a minimal level of interest in mathematics to be held by anyone wishing to read a book on this subject, but I'm not sure the book always reached that level. The order used to detail the contributions - and contributors to the theories involved include just about every single really famous mathematician - is neither strictly chronological nor really by mathematical subject; the book could have done with perhaps some appendices to help orient the reader who wanted to use it as a reference.These criticisms apart - and they are fairly severe - I enjoyed the book; I wanted to go on and read more on the subject."
28,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5602731-keelan,3,"This book provides an broad overview of the mathematical advances in the past ca. 2500 years that influenced Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Due to its breadth and the fact that the book is quite short, the author devotes only a few short pages to each mathematician in the survey. While this approach is useful for providing the reader with a general overview of the history of mathematics and some interesting trivia, it does not help the reader understand much in the way of the mathematics underlying the proof. In particular, I found the discussion of the 20th century developments, such as the Shimura-Taniyama Conjecture, way too superficial to help me understand the concepts. Finally, the author's writing style was often overly sensational and dramatic, such as the following passage: ""On Monday morning, September 19, 1994, Wiles was sitting at his desk at Princeton University...He decided he would take one last look at his proof before chucking it all and abandoning all hope to prove Fermat's Last Theorem."" Several other passages like this seemed to contain similar exaggerations that were intended to make the book more interesting to a general audience."
29,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35668827-simon-eastman,4,"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. If you have curiosity about mathematics and a fond memory of high school geometry this book willt ake you through the history of a fascinating mathematical conumdrum and introduce you to the Alice in Wonderland World of higher mathematics without knotting you up in formulas. Fermat's question, what happens if you put a cube on the hypothenuse - doesit equal the sum of the cube of the other two sides (Okay I paraphrase her don't lynch me - and the what happens if its a four< five or twenty three dimensional shape) can exercise the minds of even non-mathermaticians. The fact that it took over 300 years for the world's smartest mathemtical minds to prove and that the proof is incomprehensible to all but about 7 people on the planet makes the story no less fascinating. Aczel manages to convey the excitement of the intellectual challenge whilst dropping in the occasional morsel of higher mathematics. Whilst this is a book that can leave us all feeling a little smarter its real epigraph comes from Newton √è have been a child playing on the seashoe while the whole ocean of truth lay undiscovered before me"
30,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/742074-megan,3,"This book tried really, really hard to make something long and drawn out and fairly boring seem like the most exciting thing of all time. It is pretty exciting that someone finally solved Fermat's enigma. What isn't that exciting is the way in which it happened. Developing this proof took months of work on the part of the person credited, on top of the years of research and work of numerous people before that. The math in this book is very difficult, and not explained in any great detail, because the book focuses more on dramatizing the course of events leading to the proof. I'm not exactly sure who the audience for this was meant to be - maybe topologists who don't mind reading something lacking in rigour because they long for more excitement in their field. It wasn't a total waste of time to read, and sometimes it was amusing because the author is trying so hard, but I wouldn't recommend this book to... well I can't think of anyone I *would* recommend it to, actually."
31,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6967393-nicholas,2," It's not essential to have an in depth knowledge of mathmatics to enjoy this, but to give it a five star rating it's pretty much essential.However,the book is mercifully short enough and contains enough potted biographies and related history to remain readble by normal people,as well as those who understand why the omission of the Euler System (without which there is no Class Number Formula) inhibits the Galois representations of elliptic curves against the modular forms thus not establishing the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture,which is needed to confirm the theorem in question.To be honest though the going only gets into deep water around page 100 and the author doesn't try to get clever and hinge too much on you mathmatical expertise.And if you have the ability to relinqish your self-remonstrations for incomplete understanding and just accept some of these theories in name only then the book should be a satisfactory experience."

It wasn't until 1995 that an American mathematician, with the help of some incredibly advanced number theory worked out by others, managed to find a solution.Aczel's book is sort of interesting, telling the story of the search for a solution to Fermat's Theorem. But it contains just enough in-depth mathematical details to allow the reader to get slightly lost along the way.

He does a better-than-average job of making the narrative thread interesting (a better job than Prime Obsession did with the Riemann Hypothesis, for instance) but in 136 pages one shouldn't expect to come away from a book with a greater mathematical understanding of the solution to Fermat's Last Theorem.I didn't even know it was solved!

I have a decent math background, but I found myself getting lost in places, and the intrigue simply didn't grab me like it did in Singh's book. If you're in a hurry and just want a bare bones account of the history behind Fermat's Last Theorem, this will do, but if you want the whole story, go straight to Simon Singh."

It starts from Bronze age in the fertile crescent, moves on to Diophantus, Phytagoreans, Gauss, Galois, Fermat, and all the way to Andrew Wiles, with so many in between who contributed in one way or another to the representation and proof of Fermat's last theorem.You don't need to be fluent in mathematics to enjoy this book. But, you must have a basic understanding of algebra and, more importantly, you must have an unending love of mathematics and its history. If you do, go read this one."
40,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999771-michaela,5,"Wonderful! Made me see math in a whole new light- now I appreciate the history behind math, this theorem, and all the mathematicians- both named and unnamed that have changed this world. Math seems so complex, and this book really highlighted it, yet at the same time makes even a hater of math see how beautiful it can be. Covering history from Babylonians, the wedge-shaped writing called cuneiform, as well Greeks, Pythagoras, secret societies, Archimedes, as well as theorems, diagrams, postulates, numbers, Fibonacci, and the Golden Ratio and MUCH MORE!"
41,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10181507-muhammad,4,"I needed to read a book for school that wasn't on a list and I remember seeing this on a table at the library. It wasn't checked out and nobody was around so I picked it up. When I got to reading it, it was well put together. Since I wasn't looking for a proof for Fermat's Theorem, I was just interested in reading. Aczel's narration is easy to follow. I like his style of writing. The only time I wouldn't recommend this book is when you're looking for straight proof book and not a story like narration of things revolving around this ancient mathematical problem."
42,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/150648-tiffany,4,"Math geekiness -- yum! This was a nice history of what's been dubbed ""Fermat's Last Theorem"" (that x^n + y^n = z^n ONLY works for squares) and the 1996 proof of it, as well as some history of math and different branches of math studies.A really nice history, and a quick read, too. Some of the math went over my head, but it was explained in such a way that I was at least able to understand the gist of the math, and why it was important to the proving of the Theorem."
43,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3668862-cahlen-humphreys,5,"Outstanding read. Not only do you get the history of Fermat and virtually every mathematician/theorem/conjecture that was used in the general proof, but a pretty long history of the Pythagoreanism. Which in itself is just as, if not more so, interesting than Fermat's Last Theorem. Small in size, huge in content. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone with even a general interest in mathematics."
44,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23219786-rakesh-dimri,4,Nice read. It is story about how mathematicians took ~300 years to solve Fermat's last theorem.Its easy to understand. Author has done beautiful work of making it a story rather then just being the chronological list of mathematician and their work. I feel the book is little bit low in mathematical content. More of maths would have made it interesting for readers with a decent mathematics background.
45,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6158064-joseph-wetterling,3,"While the pace of the story was odd -- both Fermat and Wiles get less of the book than you might expect -- the tale of the solution is enjoyable. There is a lesson for non-mathematicians here in not underestimating your contributions. The solution was the work of many hands, most of which were never even directly working on it.The math is occasionally described by analogy or diagram, but too often a non-mathematician will simply have to nod and smile and take the author's word for it."
46,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45343506-graham,4,"A fantastic little pop-mathematics book that takes a tour through the history of maths along the thread of this intriguing little problem that looks so simple but turns out to require several centuries, many discoveries and a stroke of genius to solve. Very entertaining, and only slightly too technical to follow as it gets towards the end, but not enough to make you feel stupid. A great read, and a great reminder that even problems that look simple can in fact be unimaginably hard to fix."
47,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/486071-wayne-g,3,"This was given to me by a retired IBM executive who served on the budget committee in Wappingers, which I considered a great compliment because he presented it saying he thought I was one of the few public school educators who might find the book entertaining... He was partially right... I found it marginally engrossing and somewhat dense... "
48,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074456-ac,3,A great exposition on the history of Fermat and the mathematics of his time. This is the first Aczel book I ever read and (along with Pendulum) is one of my favorites in his collection. It is a rich combination of Fermat's biography and the state of mathematics leading up to Fermat's last theorem and the struggles to prove/disprove it that lasted for over 3 centuries.
49,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3641156-rohit,4,"Page turner, almost a thriller. Fascinating introduction to the field of mathematics and how genuises spend their lives proving theorems. I read it in two sittings. Inspiring though the mathematics is sometimes too vague and confusing. But the author presents the main ideas well and I now know at least what Fermat's last theorem was all about!"
50,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2640281-rory,3,"More like a brief history of mathematics that at times reads kind of like a hastily-written high schooler's paper pieced together from encyclopedia entries, e.g. the number of times it is said that some historical figure ""went on to do other great mathematics."" Still, interesting and readable enough that I wish books like it had been assigned in my math classes to put everything into context."
51,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294130-manderson,3,"Interesting read. I'm not mathematically inclined, but enjoyed gaining a bird's eye view of abstract mathematical ideas and a tiny slice of its history. I think Aczel does a fairly good job of treading the boundary between articulating theory just enough to convey its premise, while maintaining the layperson's interest by keeping it general."
52,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14495244-sudha-bellamkonda,5,"I got a little lost when it got into the modular forms on 3-d planes and the donut model. It took a little perseverance. Thoroughly enjoyed it otherwise and the early historical stories of Pythagoras and Gauss were particularly interesting. And I need to absolutely find some literature on ""Monsieur LeBlanc""!"
53,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13287708-ben,2,"I was expecting a book about such a domain specific topic to be written for mathematicians. This book was not. If you want a very brief overview of the mathematics leading up to Wiles proof and slightly incorrect phrasings of mathematical ideas do not enrage your inner pedant, this book might interest you. Overall, meh."
54,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1511796-cameron,4,"I really enjoyed this book, yet I think my ""nerd"" phase of reading has come an end for this year. I think I enjoyed the history of all the steps it took to solve the theorem more then when they actually proved it. amazing that it took so long, about 300 years, and that who proved it discovered it when he was a child and it was his dream to solve it. lucky he was born when he was."
55,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/397645-will-sin,4,"Most of the technical details of the Mathematics have been rephrased in a more layman style with a good story telling ability performed by the writer, the history behind the Fermat's last theorem is fascinating."
56,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1162544-jacob,2,"I didn't finish this one. It had lots of interesting history of mathematics and all of the pieces needed to solve Fermat's theorem, but once it got into the really obscure, theoretical math I lost my focus. What's the square root of negative one? Madness."
57,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654489-seth-kenlon,5,"A fantastic book that delves into the math behind Fermat's Last Theorem, and why its ""solution"" is, more or less, really a solution. Not overly mathematic, actually; it's very narrative and understandable to non-math types."
58,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2827252-lou,4,"Very interesting story told from a non-Western perspective. There are parts when it is obvious that English is not the authors primary language, but it's still a very good read if you're a bit of math geek."
59,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5240284-dave-lyons,4,"Could you love a book about the search for a mathematical proof? I wouldn't have thought so, but I did. Engaging and often funny journey through the last few centuries of mathematics and the antics, politics and characters involved."
60,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108010-tina,4,"This book is about math. And I absolutely loved it! It's a story, though, and has very few equations, so don't worry if, like me, you suck at math. You'll still get it. "
61,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1646404-lori,4,If you enjoy math and a good story this book is for you.
62,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5263667-beth,5,The first book I ever read about math that I read for the fun of it! This is an awesome book and I highly recommend it to any person interested in mathematics and number theory. 
63,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17172115-dana-phillips,5,"Science, history, biography, mystery . . . Aczel always weaves science knowledge into a wonderful human story. (Check the Mystery of Aleph for a story that takes over the science - in a good way)"
64,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9641743-dawn,3,The history was great and the writing was clear. I liked the learning of the uncredited mathematicians. Not too much high level math.
65,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257262-mark,4,Honestly followed about 80% of the explanations here. Very good cantor through historic mathematics to show how the final solution was found and clear writing.

69,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1553366-amy,5,That was a deeply satisfying read-the author travels from Babylon to early 1990s Cambridge following Fermat's conjecture. I haven't enjoyed a book so much in ages.
70,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/663928-leah,2,read for a book challenge with my work buddies!
71,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300459-sambasivan,4,Mathematical history at its best. A little bit technical but I think it was unavoidable. Andrew Wiles' achievement is monumental. Worth a read for any math aficianado!
72,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31451721-robert-heckner,5,"Amazing and amazingly well written. Thorough, insightful, and totally engrossing. "

74,0385319460,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84443363-rachel-felker,5,"A fascinating merge of historical and modern mathematical thought. I really enjoy Aczel‚Äôs writing style, as it is attainable enough for a non-mathematician. I‚Äôve had a life long fascination with things pertaining to the Fibonacci sequence and golden ratio, because nature becomes even more beautiful and captivating when you see the mathematics of it- and this book manages to gather all those concepts and so many other threads of history in a compelling way that wove and whittled thousands of years down to the feat of proving Fermant‚Äôs theorem, without feeling scattered or losing momentum. I will read this one again! "
