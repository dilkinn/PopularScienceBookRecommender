1,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"I know that it´s totally wrong to be amused or even laugh while reading books with such topics, but the author does such a great, entertaining, science-education job by combining the worst nightmares of plague history with wit and satire that it´s difficult to stay serious.The key element here is Big History and that makes it an eyeopener because the medical books are just talking about the strange cures, the history books about the consequences on politics and warfare, the biology books about how the critters scuttle from victim to victim, but nobody puzzled the elements together until know.It was a combination of ignorance, stupidity, prudery, faith,... that made the illnesses even worse, because by combining stupid or no healing options with ostracizing, stigmatizing and persecuting the suffering humans, it got spread wider than necessary. The narrative arc of each described illness shows all of those aspects, the ideologies that fostered the wrong ideas and the brave doctors and scientists who tried to find real cures instead while facing scorn and occupational problems.One thing must be said about the inventors of freaking crazy theories about how and why who suffers from what, they were pretty creative. Just as right out of a maniac group brainstorming session, those academic trained, teaching, elite professors saw the damage they caused as science and cure and although some of them might certainly have been frauds, many might have believed that they are doing something Hippocratic instead of sadistic and worsening everything.Pandemics and infectious diseases had a huge impact on human history, art, and probably even genetic development, because eliminating large parts of the gene pool and just leaving the fittest or luckiest with random mutations or even build-in resistance survive, changes the composition of a population forever. If the black death hadn´t wiped out large parts of Europe's population, we might still live in a theocracy; if the peoples of the Americas would have been immune to smallpox and other European diseases, colonialization would have been impossible and there would be no US today. Instead, the tribes could have built huge ships to sail to Europe to bring us their plagues on purpose or accidentally and helped our ancestors to find the path close to extinction and we would live in reservations now.There are plenty of possible uchronia settings.The worst case of mismanagement in the 20th century was the reaction to the coming AIDS epidemic that could have been prevented, but instead, Reagan and, in general, many conservative politicians did everything to make it worse and let it escalate. If it would have been a rich, straight, white man´s disease, it would have been cured.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesti...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesti...He was such a loveable person.The only difference to today may be that it were just restricted minds and sheer stupidity and not financial interests (or disinterests in finding cures for diseases nobody in the industrialized, rich countries gets or new antibiotics or cheap generics or...) that torpedoed and deferred progress in medical research. And doctors and scientists don´t get witch-hunted and burned any more if they have the nasty habit of getting pesky and just have to fear the loss of funding, license, job, reputation, and respect.It´s a coincidence that I am writing this review at a moment when the 2020 Coronavirus outbreak https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2...is omnipresent.(and after the 2019 Ebola crisis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kivu_Eb...)It´s just a question of the competence of government and international institutions (sadly no joke); the severity of the new mutation of the virus; herd immunity and vaccination rates and how quickly new vaccines can be developed, mass-produced, and distributed; if it may become a too close, not just platonic friend of the yearly flu epidemic and similar, seasonal epidemics or multidrug-resistant germs or biological warfare agents someone let lying around anywhere (looking at you, certain country with terrible military security measures), or...; how quickly it´s discovered and how far it has already spread, if it´s a zoonosis, where it breaks out, how contagious and deadly it is,... and sheer luck or bad luck how bad that future, coming pandemics will get.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieva...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemichttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemichttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectionhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_h...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_His..."
2,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,5,"With the coronavirus and all the anxiety, this book got pushed up in my reading queue. I am very glad it was because this is terrific. Each chapter is devoted to a different pandemic and the selfless, smart people who saved us. It starts with a plague that I had never heard of that helped bring down the Roman empire, the Antonine plague. Rational and savvy, Marcus Aurelius did all he could to deal headlong with this scourge until he succumbed too. The author, Jennifer Wright is funny and down to earth and clear in her beliefs as she continues through history and describes how each society dealt brilliantly with their catastrophic disease or not so brilliantly. She believes that there is hope for us all as long as we are kind and smart and brave about these things. She bemoans the indifference of some doctors who treat their patients unkindly, saying, ""It's perfectly possible to be smarter than everyone else and still be polite and even deferential--women have been doing it for centuries."" We need kindness and compassion when we are sick more than ever.She also talks about the importance of a strong government response to the known facts of an epidemic and getting that information to the public. And if the government is lying to the people than we must have brave journalists that get the information out there so we can better defeat the monster, because disease knows no boundaries and doesn't discriminate."
3,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,4,"Reading a book on plagues may not be everyone's idea of a pleasurable way to spend their reading time, but that is exactly what I did. While I can't say it was pleasurable, it was certainly intriguing and informative. Plagues, many times changed the course of history, were used in our nursery rhymes , illnesses, like tuberculosis and EL were prevalent in art and literature. Many artists painted pictures of women dying from consumption, painting them as ethereal and haunting, thought beautiful at the time. Dying of consumption as it was known then was anything but beautiful. The book provides the paths of the diseases, how they were handled at the time, those who fought them, finding cures if possible and what was going on in the world at the time and how circumstances were affected. Loved the set up of this book, each chapter its own illness. She saves the mishandling of the AIDS epidemic for the epilogue, how this was mishandled by the Reagan administration and how so many turned their backs on those dying of this disease.The author attempts to lighten up the gruesome subject matter by inserting pithy comments and commentary. Sometimes these worked for me and I found them mildly humorous, at other times I felt they could have been left out. Actually think the book would have been improved if there would have been less of these. So I am rating this four stars for the well researched information contained within, but making this 3.5 for my persona rating. Definitely worth reading though, I think it is hubris on our part to think that because we have better medicines now, that a plague or epidemic will not strike. Especially since we are being warned about bacteria resistant antibiotics. I was also very surprised to find out that Zimbabwe and fourteen other nations have better inoculation rates against measles, now that many parents are refusing to immunize their children. So scary.ARC from publisher and librarything."
4,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40898015-jamie,3,"While entertaining at times, I was wanting more medical science, more about plagues and diseases- rather than commentary on pop culture references. There is a whole host of references in the back and it seems she had done her research-I had just wished she would have included more of it throughout rather than trying to be funny the whole time. I also didn't like the shaming of people in this book who didn't live up to her opinion (yes she even did this after shaming someone to drive it home a second time).This is a very accessible read-and would be great for people who just want an intro or overview of a few plagues/diseases."
5,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"There are few plague and pandemic books I can rank up there as my absolute favorites, but this one comes awfully close.Honestly, her clever and quippy and generally knowledgeable demeanor only enhanced the core facts of these ""great"" diseases that caused so much damage throughout history and closer to home.And there are lots of heroes:People who start using logic and common sense when so little of it is going around. (Cleanliness) People who have more decency in them than practically everyone else. (Kindness)People who buck convention to DO THE RIGHT THING. (Courage)Let's not forget intelligence. But often there is a lot of that going around without the other three and without the other three, YOU'RE STILL DEAD. Or much, much worse off.I totally recommend this book for anyone who's interested in plagues and pandemics. For we who are currently IN ONE, I can't recommend it enough. It's not fearmongering. It's history. The good stuff and the bad.I recommend the chapter on the Spanish Flu in particular. While many of the symptoms and the range are not all that similar to the Coronavirus, people's reactions to it during 1918 IS. Misinformation abounded everywhere. And while today's world isn't quite saddled with 20 years in prison for yelling ""Fire"" in a crowded theater, and journalists aren't locked up for saying a single thing that criticizes the government, we are still dealing with a ton of idiots.Putting your head in the sand and quoting economic reasons to go into work while everyone ought to be in lockdown is not helping anyone. If everyone stayed put there would be no new vectors. But as it is now, a ton of people ARE staying put while another whole segment of society is freaking out about their jobs, passing the coronavirus along AGAIN and spreading out the length of the danger even longer for those who are already in self-quarantine. Can you see a psychology problem here? It's not YOUR job at risk. It's EVERYONE'S LIVES at risk. Ignore the death rate for a moment. Focus on who is most at risk. Children, old people, and anyone with compromised immune systems. If you keep rolling the dice for yourself, you are not the only one you're hurting.The total ignorance of the Spanish Flu, the over-insistence that EVERYTHING IS ALL FINE made it spread like crazy. WWI killed roughly 20 million people. In 1918 the Spanish Flu killed roughly 20 million people.We really need to stop being stupid."
6,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,4,"Yes, I am currently reading 4 books because I have no chill and my anxiety is making it difficult to concentrate on one thing at a time. So obviously I want to read about disease.Facinating and insightful non fiction, this manages to present the terrifying reality of plagues and disease in an accessible way with witty comments and playful pictures scattered throughout. It's engaging and quick to read while remaining entertaining and informative - which can often be a difficult line to tread in nonfiction. It also covers a lot of ground for a short book, taking the reader from smallpox, cholera and the bubonic plague to the currently relevant Spanish flu and beyond. Granted, some chapters were more interesting and well researched than others (I loved the chapters on EL but I work in Neuro so I'm biased, and less so the chapter on lebotomies) but overall I found this broad enough to cover the epic scale of disease and its social repercussions without feeling overwhelming. It piques enough of an interest that if I wanted to I could look up more information on the topics I find most appealing.Not for everyone in the current world climate, but if you're interested in epidemics through the ages this is a good starting point."
7,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19511519-jennyb,1,"I love a good disease book. Unfortunately, this isn't one. Want to know why? Written in short, declarative sentences, with ample! misplaced exclamations!, too many self-referential ""I"" sentences, dated pop culture references and sophomoric efforts at humor, it reads like... Well, a sophomore's effort at a book report. Which is to say: it is actually not readable at all. Too bad, especially given that it's clear Wright did a ton of research on these topics. If only the maturity of the research effort was matched by maturity in the writing."
8,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time,5," I loved Get Well Soon: History's Worst Plagues and the Heroes Who Fought Them so, so much. In fact, I think it's in my top three non-fiction audiobooks ever.I'm an unabashed science geek, so it's really no surprise that I was drawn to this one. I'm a devotee of authors like Mary Roach, so humor mixed with science-y non-fiction is sort of my weakness. However, even I was pretty amazed at how much I adored this story, even more so because I tend to shy away from anything sad or depressing. Jennifer Wright did an absolutely perfect job of blending facts with witticisms. Some might find her cheeky commentary to be a bit much, but I found her pithy remarks to be smart and on the nose. I loved the way the story was composed, and I loved Jennifer Wright's strong, opinionated take on those on the wrong side of history. I think this book should be required reading for anyone who finds themselves intrigued by the anti-vax ""point of view."" I'm extremely pro-vaccine and pro-science, and this book is a perfect example of why. We are not past deadly diseases, and our next plaque could be right around the corner. Willful ignorance and anti-science views can be deadly, and this book tells readers exactly why that is. I loved the final chapter on the AIDS crisis, one that my family was personally affected by, and it really resonated with me that the most recent plaque wasn't very long ago. Scary. An excellent audiobook and a perfect narration by Gabra Zackman, who struck just the right tone between didactic and your best friend. Loved this one, and it easily makes my favorites list for this year. goodreads|instagram|twitter|blog"
9,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21987508-a-reader-obsessed,5,"5 StarsNo one is more shocked than I for thoroughly enjoying this because I don’t even come close to being a history buff nor even the occasional dabbler in various such things.To put it succinctly, the real terror is the devastation disease can wreak on the human population, and this highlights some really truly scary awful times and what went oh so wrong but also thankfully, what went right. To say the least, this was highly entertaining in all its gory horror. It was delivered with smarts, humor, and wit, throwing in pop culture references and apt comments, never making this a tedious lesson to be learned but one that was fascinating in all its revelations. Wholeheartedly recommended, this was a rare gem indeed!"
10,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,4,"Get Well Soon by Jennifer Wright is certainly an apposite book for the times. The subtitle is History’s Worst Plagues and Heroes Who Fought Them, I would like to add “and anti-heroes”.Wright’s style is easy to read and very conversational, she also editorialises a bit which is okay by me, nothing like an opinion in my view. Even though she doesn’t appear to come from a medical background, she has referenced countless sources. The list of references starts at the 70% mark on my Kindle. There’s lots of them, so it seems her opinions don’t come from thin-air.This book covers a dozen or so instances in history, of which many are pandemics. Each story contains messages and much food for thought relating to today’s issues we are all facing and wrestling with. The chapters I found the most interesting related to (I’ll only pick 3 – promise!):The Antonine Plague One of my favourite Emperors - Marcus Aurelius – was presented with this massive challenge. The impact on the economy was significant, less workers, less soldiers to fight the Germanic tribes up North, less farm produce and less tax. The plague damaged the Roman national psyche and caused major economic disruption. Some say, this was the start of the decline of the Empire – however, Aurelius’ nasty and hopeless son Commodus, may have had something to do with that, in my opinion. The author delivers the first lesson of this book saying If a plague is not quickly defeated by medicine, any significant outbreak sends horrible ripples through every aspect of society. A very sobering message indeed. This plague killed more than 100 million people.The Spanish FluI paid particular attention to this chapter, for obvious reasons - even though COVID-19 is ‘no-flu’. This disease actually originated in Kansas in March 1918, it was unusual in that it killed many, many people in the prime of their life. This flu ”Put people into bed as if hit by a two-by-four, turned into pneumonia, turned people blue and black and killed them"". The overwhelming immune response and consequent fluid build-up in the lungs actually kills them. Very similar to comments I heard from a desperate Italian Intensivist on CNN news the other day. The BIG message in this chapter was the importance of providing good information to the public, to distort nothing, to not paint a false-positive picture, to manipulate no one – leadership must make whatever horror exists concrete. Up to 100 million people died.LeprosyThis was really, really sad. These poor people were treated terribly, ostracised, left to die. We think perhaps that modern society isn’t capable of this – but cast our minds back to not so long ago to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the attitude towards the gay community back then. But the one massive take away I learned in this chapter was regarding the truly amazing efforts of one Father Damien. This man was made a saint (not something I am usually impressed by, being an atheist), I couldn’t think of a more worthy Saint than this incredible man. I’ll leave you to do your own research on this incredible individual.So, whether it be TB, Polio, Smallpox or many other diseases – there is so much to learn and reflect on here, not so much about the disease itself but the way our leaders, the population and society itself behaves, and the collateral damage these diseases cause. So many lessons.In summary, you won’t learn a great deal about medicine or science in this book. Sure, it touches on these things, but it’s more than that. It is a very easy to read, laypersons, account of some of the most significant plagues of humankind. I found this to be a very interesting and worthwhile read, it also gave me a few chuckles. 4 Stars"
11,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28482493-angus-mckeogh,5,"Great book to start the year on. 5 stars. Should be required reading for every vaccine denier, religious zealot, general hater of anyone with a different lifestyle, or any combination thereof. Wright pulls no punches and has great hopes for mankind. Look at history people. We can’t really afford to repeat it."

""The purpose of this book is not to scare you. Instead, like all good books, it is intended to distract you from the screaming baby one aisle over from the airplane where you are currently trapped for the next five hours.""
This book was a blast. The history is fun and engaging and crazy. (Did you know that the crazy anti-plague beak doctor costumes kind of worked? I didn't.) And the author's commentary is brash and opinionated and purely entertaining. The Antonine plague: apparently Galen was a pretentious coward, and despite his tendency to throw Christians to the lions, Marc Antony was a terrific organiser who at least temporarily saved his empire. The bubonic plague: well apart from the beak doctor costumes, which are awesome, there's this quote:
""Shakespeare's brothers and sisters and his son died of the bubonic plague. Theaters were closed due to the plague during his lifetime. Hans Holbein and Titian painted great works before their deaths from the plague. Would they have preferred to live in a time without the Black Death? Yes. (This is not speculative. I called them all and asked.) But life went on in the face of death. Even the Roman Empire was able to endure for a few hundred years after the Antonine plague. Commodus was able to dither around killing ostriches.""
 The Dancing plague: a mysterious illness intriguing with any narration and spiced up by the side commentary on Paracelsus's impressive level of sexism. Smallpox: snarky commentary about how it was feared by men for its mortality and by women for its detriment to appearance, a diatribe about anti-vaxxers, and a ""Guns, Germs, and Steel""-type portrayal of the destruction of the Aztecs and Incans. 
""The devastation of smallpox in the Americas was not due to a vengeful God or a mysterious man bearing an evil box, but rather to the fact that the Amerindians did not spend as much quality time with their domesticated llamas as Europeans did with their cows.Now maybe you are reading these tales of destruction and thinking, Oh, God, I myself do not have a cattle farm, or I am a proud llama farmer (there's got to be one somewhere), and are therefore convinced that you would die if you contracted smallpox because of your sad immune system--and what if terrorists purposefully incubate smallpox and come in a suicidal pact and spread it to us, and we all die and our civilization perishes and everything is very bad? I am with you, citizen! [...] Fortunately...""
 Syphilis: the amazing lengths to which biographers will go to avoid admitting their subject had the disease, plus the ""No-Nose Club."" TB: a tirade against the romanticism of the disease. Cholera: a character assassination of John Snow (personally, I think he sounds a bit spectrum and I'd like to have a conversation with him, if only to know how he came up with the idea of veganism about a century before it was a fad). Points gained for never using the phrase, ""You know nothing, John Snow"" when describing the cholera detective. Leprosy: the truly lovely story of Father Damien, the Leper Priest of Molokai. Typhoid: the rather insane story of Typhoid Mary, the government's attempt to lock her up, and her determination to make ice cream despite it all.The Spanish Flu: apparently it wasn't actually Spanish in origin, but:
""An all-American plague hailing from Haskell, Kansas. There is still research that attempts to pin the biggest plague in the twentieth century on anyplace else (guesses range from China to Great Britain), probably because ""America's bread-basket"" is a much nicer way to refer to the Midwest than ""the planet's flu-bin.""
 The most amazing aspect of this particular plague is the incredible lengths the US and UK went to to pretend it wasn't happening, including threatening journalists with jail and/or death.Encephalitis Lethargica: scary scary scary, with the interesting collateral that it may be the disease responsible for a lot of our endless-sleep fairy tales.Lobotomies: not actually a plague, unless you'd consider ""hysteria"" in women to be a plague, but I think Wright just really wanted to talk about Walter Jackson Freeman II and his penis ring (seriously) and the time he put two ice picks in both eye sockets and hammered them in simultaneously... actually probably the most horrifying chapter. 
""Feel free to start using Walter Jackson Freeman II as an insult directed towards people you hate. Almost no one will get the reference, but if I am in the room we'll high-five and it will be awesome.""
Polio: coming after the lobotomy chapter, a rather heartwarming and life-affirming take on FDR, March of Dimes, Jonas Salk's polio vaccine, and the biggest human trial in history.HIV/AIDS: the really depressing state of this current epidemic, our return to demonising the victims and treating the disease as a ""judgement"" and a consequence of ""bad behaviour,"" as with syphilis. My problem with this chapter is that it really talks only about the disease in the US. In the Congo, it affects a truly horrific percentage of the population, and conspiracies that western governments actually created and spread the disease do nothing to help mitigate it.Even though the book is crazy and funny and lighthearted with in-your-face opinions and irreverent commentary and pop-culture references, I never felt that Wright dehumanized her subjects. Even as she found the crazy comedy in it all, I never felt that she was disrespectful towards the victims or made light of their suffering. Maybe it is because my sense of humour tends towards the morbid, but I don't think comedy is not antithetical to tragedy. Seeing people as rounded and multifaceted and, yes, wacky, enhances their humanity rather than lessening it. I got to the end of the book and was sad that there was no more. I would have thoroughly enjoyed a chapter on yellow fever or measles or mumps or rubella (the namesakes of the now unfairly-infamous MMR vaccine), or meningitis, one of the more frightening diseases of my childhood, or tetanus, aka lockjaw. I suspect Wright would have enjoyed describing tetanic convulsions. My only major complaint against the book is its extreme Western focus. Where was the Plague of Justinian? The Ebola outbreaks in Africa? Malaria in Spain and Africa? What about dengue fever, particularly in the eighteenth century? ""History"" doesn't mean ""Western history,"" and I really wish more historians would remember it. But other than my greedy desire for more--or perhaps a sequel--I got a huge kick out of the book. If those quotes sound intriguing and you like the conversational style and snark, grab a copy. It's a wild ride. And now I'm off to go request Wright's other book, It Ended Badly, from the library..."
13,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"So, those of you who know me are probably not at all surprised that I read or loved this book. I love some interesting sciencey nonfiction, whether it's where we come from, how we live and think and behave, things that kill us (this is one of those!) or what happens to us after we're dead, I likes them. And I love audio for these kinds of books. It's the best of both worlds - I get to learn about something new, and at the same time not get bogged down in footnotes or graphs or what-have-you. Not that this book would have been that type, and for the most part I have been incredibly lucky that MOST of the non-fiction I've selected have been more interesting and fun than dry and boring (ahem... The History of the Ancient World: From the Earliest Accounts to the Fall of Rome... Lookin' at you. Informative but not very exciting! Zzzzzz...). This book absolutely falls into the first category. It was delightful. Yes, delightful. A book about illness and death in massive, decimating quantities. A book that describes the ingesting of... excretions, both unintentionally and on purpose, to either unknowingly acquire or seek to prevent said illness and death. Pardon my french here, but, that shit is fucking gross. And yet, still... I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Disgusting descriptions of nastiness aside, this book was about as relatable and personable as I think it's possible to be. I felt like the author was telling me the story of each of these maladies while hanging out with me while I did laundry and cleaned my office. Possibly this had to do with the reader, who I liked, but I think it was that the author's personality and sense of humor and, on occasion, righteous outrage at the shittitude of humanity just came shining through the text and passed through the reader and into my heart via my earholes. I think that Jennifer Wright and I would be friends if we knew each other, though in a way, I kinda do feel like I know her a bit... so maybe we're ALREADY friends! I liked her perspective and her observations of the ways that history shines when dealing with terrible situations, and the ways that it completely and cruelly fucks up. I liked that she called these monsters out as monsters. I like that she views history through the lens of modernity, while still conveying the living reality that these people dealt with, and giving their untimely and often gruesome deaths meaning and historical relevance and context. I liked that she gave credit where it was due, and hailed those who even TRIED to help as heroes, despite human folly and shortsightedness going against their common sense. I liked that this book about plagues and death was so full of life and a good dollop of ""let's learn from these stories and do better next time"" hope and intelligence. I liked that she did all of this with a wonderful sense of humor, a lot.In short, I really loved this book, and I hope she writes many more just like it. Delightful."
14,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"This is by far the BEST book on diseases imaginable! It's also one of if not THE best non-fiction book I've ever read.Throughout history, humans have encountered all kinds of diseases. Naturally, we didn't always have the medical tools available to us now. This book details the emergence of a number of well-known plagues as well as how they spread, how bad it got, the steps taken by those trying to find a cure and where we stand now.We thus learn of the antonine plague, bubonic plague, dancing plague (mass hysteria), syphilis, leprosy, typhoid fever, influenza and some others. The author introduces us to charlatans as well as serious doctors from a time when their work was more investigative than anything else due to a lack of knowledge. We therefore get to know a host of „cures“ that range from astonishingly close to what we have now to hilariously moronic (even for their day and age).We also meet despicable human beings like Typhoid Mary as well as true heroes like Father Damien (Saint Damien of Molokai).
""Greater love hath no man than this that he should lay down his life for his friends.
All of the stories are told in a no-nonsense manner that is accentuated with a quirky sense of humour. The author also throws in a number of cultural references to music, plays, books, movies, TV shows etc., showcasing what an all-round knowledgeable person she is. This made reading all the historical data even more delightful. I therefore now know that ice cream sprinkles weren't invented before the 1930 (if you wonder what that has to do with anything, read the book ;P).What I mean by that can be seen from a number of the many quotes I've highlighted.Yes, I'm one of those people who don't faint or get grossed out. For me, there are also no taboos. I'd like to be present during an autopsy - simply because I'm curious and books can only teach you so much (and if I was offered a chance to do some of the work myself, I'd totally do it). I believe that knowledge is one of the best weapons. Hard to read were some of the present-day details. All the diseases that could be eradicated for good by now - and in an affordable way - but aren't, for example. Some of the social commentary was hilarious, too. Like comparing Marcus Aurelius to today's leaders across the globe. Considering what is happening the world over right now thanks to another virus/plague, many of her descriptions of past reactions by people in afflicted zones (and elsewhere) sound as if she was reporting live about today's crisis. So much for humans learning and preparing, I guess.Overall, a fun read, as weird as that may sound considering the subject matter, that is nevertheless full of accurate information delivered in a very down-to-earth and accessible way. I loved this so much that I bought the hardcover right away and I shall thrust this at anyone asking me for a recommendation (and everyone else, too) because I might have a new favourite book!"

She danced herself to her death six days later, and soon thirty-four more villagers joined her. Then more. In a month more than 400 people had died from the mysterious dancing plague. In late-nineteenth-century England an eccentric gentleman founded the No Nose Club in his gracious townhome—a social club for those who had lost their noses, and other body parts, to the plague of syphilis for which there was then no cure. And in turn-of-the-century New York, an Irish cook caused two lethal outbreaks of typhoid fever, a case that transformed her into the notorious Typhoid Mary and led to historic medical breakthroughs.Throughout time, humans have been terrified and fascinated by the plagues they've suffered from.

I must be dying...Hypochondriacs will just LOVE this dark, fascinating, terrifying and often hilarious read. You feel like shit for thinking it's hilarious but gallows humor serves a certain purpose. Also, it was meticulously researched out the wazoo: the book ends at 75% and the rest is footnotes and annotations. (Yay, footnotes and annotations!)I felt personal connections to a lot of the chapters. My great-grandparents were separated a little while. They decided to reconcile but then my great-grandfather was diagnosed with syphilis. His mother-in-law made my great-grandmother divorce him. He died alone and deranged.My maternal grandmother contracted TB right after the birth of my aunt. She went away to the ""san"" for over six months. My mother was four. She couldn't visit because TB is so contagious. She had to stand on the sidewalk outside the building and my grandmother would go out on this little side porch to wave at her.I had relatives living in Philadelphia when the Spanish flu hit the city in 1918. What the hell was that like?Makes you grateful to be living in the age of vaccines, antibiotics and the Center for Disease Control.(Touches forehead) Am I hot? Am I running a fever? "
19,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8051792-lisa,5,"Who knew that a book on diseases could be so entertaining? Get Well Soon is a compassionate, witty and scary history of plagues. Wright's commentary manages to be scathing and funny without being flippant. She is passionate about the devastation of disease as well as the heroes and villains who have helped or hindered mankind. This is an amazing book - thought-provoking and unputdownable!"
20,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10973677-madalyn-novel-ink,5,"this is some of the best nonfiction I’ve read in a long while. seriously, what a gem. I loved this."
21,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,5,"I have for a long time been interested in plagues both their causes and results. For instance the Black Death was largely spread by the fleas from the ubiquitous rats in the cities. Just one odd fact I came across (before I read this book) was that since cats were regarded as evil the people in London and other European cities ran around killing cats...thus helping the spread of rats.Here Ms Wright does her best to tell the story of several plagues down through history. While she never belittles the horror here or makes light of the death she does try to keep a certain lightness in the telling itself. I mean like firemen, ENTs, police and combat troops the only way deal with this kind of horror is often with a kind of dark humor.Looking at most plagues since the Black Death and up to (but not covering) the Aids epidemic (she does comment on Aids but doesn't go on to try and detail it) we get some interesting insights. We also meet some interesting people, courageous doctors, quack doctors and plague carries (like ""Typhoid Mary"" as an example).The book also invites us to consider how long it's been since we've had global population decimating plague...we're over due.Recommended."
22,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"Initially I was skeptical about this one due to the author's ill-supported claims that the Antonine Plague caused the Roman Empire to fall (“was a very significant contributor to the decline” would have made me less uncomfortable), but, as it turned out, that first chapter was the only one where her “history” struck me as noticeably iffy.* Telling the stories of various plagues throughout history, Wright explores each plague (she includes fourteen of them) from the level of bacteria to that of governmental response. She tells of individual sufferers, heroic (and not-so-heroic) doctors, politicians, and public health officials, describing how each plague destroyed lives, and how the responses of physicians and bureaucrats helped or hindered the treatment of the disease. She reminds readers frequently of the importance of compassion in dealing with victims of plagues, occasionally to the point of excessive preachiness, but mostly, given the history of human responses to contagious diseases, very reasonably. As she notes repeatedly, blaming the victims is never an effective response to illness. Even in the case of a Typhoid Mary, who, she agrees, showed monstrous irresponsibility in her disregard for disease control, public health officials would have behaved far more usefully if they had provided her with training for a new career rather than simply releasing her back on an unsuspecting public with nothing but her cooking skills with which to support herself.Wright certainly doesn't gloss over the horrors of the plagues she chronicles, but where there are heroes – Father Damiens and Jonas Salks – she dwells on them. Among the most horrific chapters were those on lobotomies (the only “non-disease” plague she includes) and AIDS, where the extent of the suffering was, to an inexcusable extent, caused by the heartlessness of people who truly should have known better, and, conversely, the most inspiring was that on polio, where human intelligence, decency, and public spiritedness combined to defeat a devastating disease. Wright finishes on a note of optimism, convinced that the better angels of our nature will generally triumph over fear and narrow-mindedness. While her efforts at humor occasionally fall flat and I could have done with fewer pop culture references, this was mostly enjoyable and surprisingly uplifting.*ETA: Updating because clearly I've fallen behind in my reading of popular histories of Rome -- just today I've read two articles about how plague IS now considered plausible as an important factor in the ""fall"" of Rome. (here's a link to an article from the LA Timeshttp://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/... , and Kyle Harper's new book, The Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire, looks very interesting)."
23,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6595648-bam-the-bibliomaniac,4,"AUDIO READ #6Absolutely fascinating! Everything is covered from leprosy to lobotomy. Not only are the causes discussed, but also we hear about the conquerors of the horrid diseases that, believe it or not, do not all exist solely in the past. I recommend the audio book; the narrator is excellent.P. S. The epilogue that discusses AIDS is absolutely heartbreaking"
24,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22409011-brendan-monroe,4,"There’s nothing I find scarier, or more fascinating, than a viral epidemic. Growing up, I read books like The Hot Zone: The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus and I’m still convinced, deep down, that half of humanity will one day be wiped out by an incurable contagion like Ebola. When Ebola itself made a comeback in 2014, I watched with horrified fascination as the disease spread to countries where it had never appeared before, like the United States. Remember Kaci Hickox, the modern-day Typhoid Mary who publicly ranted and raved after being forced into quarantine because she'd come into contact with Ebola patients in West Africa? Hickox jumped on a plane to the U.S., risking possibly infecting those on board, then, forced into quarantine on arrival, became a media fixation. Needless to say, I had no sympathy whatsoever for her. The point where I advocate suspending personal freedoms is when said person is known to have come into contact with carriers of a highly contagious disease with a remarkable kill rate and decides immediately afterward to board a commercial aircraft. Umm, sorry Ebola Kaci, but you just sit your ass in quarantine for a while so we can see if you’ve got the disease, you selfish cad! (Spoiler: she didn't have Ebola, but hey - better safe than sorry.)All of which is to say that I live in terrified awe of diseases. My absolute dream job would have been to work at The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Even though I hate Atlanta, I would have put up with it just to work there. With a job like that, I’m not sure I'd have ever been able to sleep again, but still.So I was instantly drawn to “Get Well Soon: History's Worst Plagues and the Heroes Who Fought Them”. Who doesn’t like hearing about the famous killers of the past? Take Encephalitis lethargica, for example. No cure was ever found for this “sleeping sickness” which resulted in those infected falling asleep suddenly while doing common, everyday activities like chewing. Fascinating.Similarly, Spanish Influenza. Like Encephalitis lethargica, no one knew how to cure this highly contagious disease that infected 500 million people worldwide (back in 1918-1920, when the disease ran its course, that number accounted for a whopping third of the planet’s population). But Spanish Influenza wasn’t your run-of-the-mill flu. Unlike the standard flu, which is generally only fatal in the older, sicker population, Spanish Influenza attacked the young and healthy, generally those between the ages of 20-35. Estimates had it responsible for the deaths of as many as 70 million people or 5 percent of the global population. Holy mackerel!What made Spanish Influenza even more destructive were the efforts the U.S. Government went to in order to cover it up. Even the name “Spanish Influenza” is a part of this cover-up. One would think that such a flu must have come from Spain, right? Wrong! In reality it looks to have come from the United States. Desperate to keep American troops flowing to the European front at the end of World War One, the U.S. Government covered up the fact that vast numbers of young men were contracting the flu onboard American ships crossing the Atlantic. Then, once in Europe, U.S. soldiers infected the rest of the continent. The disease is only known as the Spanish Influenza because Spain didn’t take part in the first World War and, as a result, had a truly free press that reported on the outbreak once it hit Spain.So yes, I am clearly this book’s intended audience. What keeps me from giving this book a higher rating is that the author, Jennifer Wright, loves her pop culture references a little too much. Early on, she mentions the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius who, she says, was a great problem solver, just like Matt Damon in “The Martian”. Matt Damon? What?That’s just one reference among many. I don’t even remember half of them now because they were stupid and didn’t add anything to the book. Rather than make this feel like a well-researched look into the history of some of the world’s worst plagues, which it largely is, these dated references (less than 3 years on, who really remembers “The Martian”?) make it feel like an old copy of US Weekly. I imagine that Miss Wright is looking to add some comic relief to what is pretty dark material, but rather than adding anything, references like these just take away from what is an otherwise very enjoyable read.Miss Wright ends by talking about the most recent mass epidemic, HIV AIDS, and she's not afraid to get political and point fingers at the Reagan Administration's startling lack of compassion for those afflicted with it.This is a great overview for anyone looking to learn more about ""history's worst plagues""."
25,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,5,"If a book on plagues, polio, leprosy, and other horrific diseases of (mostly) times past doesn't sound like your idea of an enjoyable read, it's probably because you haven't read Jennifer Wright's extremely engaging and very enjoyable book ""Get Well Soon"". This book is full of fascinating (and yes, at times gruesome!) details about some of history's worst diseases. Whilst this would normally make for a rather depressing (though still interesting) read, Ms. Wright writes in such a witty manner that I found myself laughing out loud quite often. Now, this did lead to some feelings of discomfort, I will admit, feelings of guilt that I was finding entertainment in a book containing information of much death and suffering. However, that is not Ms. Wright's purpose as she comes across as a person of great compassion and she never once makes fun or light of people's suffering. Rather, I think her purpose is to enlighten in a way that will captivate readers, to make us aware of just how important it is to take diseases, viruses, and bacteria seriously. Her use of dark humor serves to draw us in, keep our interest, ensure we learn. Disease and suffering are and have been horrific realities of life that we sometimes turn a blind eye to in our sterilized world of antibiotics and vaccines, forgetting that there are still millions suffering with horrible diseases. We must remain dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and science and seek to find cures and vaccines.Fans of Mary Roach will love this book, as I find Jennifer Wright's style to be quite similar."
26,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1778320-jennifer,2,"I thought the premise for this book sounded really interesting. However, I got about 150 pages into it, and found that it just was not holding my interest. While the author's commentary was humorous at times, for the most part I didn't care for it. Also, I realize that this was an Advance Reading Copy, but truly, it was the worst-edited ARC I've ever read - and I've read more than 100. It was so poorly edited that it was distracting - sentences didn't make sense, words were missing. Maybe that had something to do with my disinclination to continue reading. Bottom line: I have too many books on my TBR list to continue reading one that doesn't hold my interest."
27,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84193733-porter-broyles,3,"This is a fun short book. It tells the stories of pandemics with a touch of humor. The author often breaks the ""fourth wall"" and talks directly to the reader. She will pontificate upon various things that are dumb or unexplainable. If you are interested in doing a stand up routine on pandemics, this might bea good source for jokes."
28,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,0,"It is not OK for authors to give themselves 5* reviews. It can dramatically skew the ratings for new books and defeats the purpose of Goodreads.Update July 2018: I apologize for upsetting some Goodreads friends with this review. Please see comment stream below for an interesting discussion. I am clearing the 1* rating now, because I appreciate the argument from friends that this undermines my other reviews more than it has any chance of changing behavior/policy on Goodreads. The issue I was bringing up is not insignificant. Amazon, the parent company of Goodreads, used to have the policy of not allowing sellers-- or even their families--to write customer reviews of their own products. The following article describes the opposition of authors to the policy because of the difficulty of enforcement without creepy spying to determine who is family, etc.: https://gizmodo.com/amazons-review-po....

30,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820549-jackballoon,5,Learned so much from this book. the audible edition was excellent. 
31,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,5,"Jennifer Wright writes with a delightful combination of snark and compassion. I thoroughly enjoyed this romp through many of history’s worst plagues. The heroes of which she speaks are not always doctors and scientists, but everyday compassionate people who care about their fellow man. There is also a villain or two. The book also comes with a bit of preaching, which I didn’t mind. There are two major lessons I think she wants us to walk away with.1) Stigmatizing and ostracizing victims of disease is not only mean and wrong, but it hinders our ability to fight the disease. This is because ashamed people hide their condition, leading to increased spreading of the disease, and decreased data for research.2) Vaccinate your kids, for crying out loud!A few quotes for your reading pleasure.“Feel free to start using Walter Jackson Freeman II as an insult directed toward people you hate. Almost no one will get the reference, but if I am in the room we’ll high-five and it will be awesome.” “Although Galen was a great physician, he was not a terribly courageous man. Galen was a self-promotor above anything else. According to McLynn, he consistently claimed to be a self-made man, casually downplaying the fact that he can from an extremely wealthy family and had inherited numerous estates as well as a stellar list of contacts. He employed underhanded tactics to win debates, and he constantly aggrandized his own achievements. Personality-wise, you could think of him as the Donald Trump of Ancient Rome.” “Full disclosure: I would have patented that vaccine and not felt guilty about it for a second. I suspect I would have used the money to do dumb stuff I thought was awesome, like start an F. Scott Fitzgerald theme park. I assume everyone else would also do that. Why doesn’t a theme park devoted to books exist? It would be so much fun.”"
32,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45392105-aleta,5,"Jennifer Wright did an incredible job with this book. Maybe I have a Macabre side to me reading this during our current Pandemic, but it's amazing how we we've repeated mistakes from the past. It was reassuring to be reminded of all the diseases we have eradicated over the Centuries and the people who came together to wage war on sickness."
33,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I picked this book up on a whim as I’m interested in the subject matter and I’m so glad I did! This was such a fantastic book and one of my favourites on the discussion of plagues to date (I’ve actually read a fair few ..)I love the references to popular culture and current and recent films which brings historical plagues into a 21st century relatability whilst also holding onto the historical nature and telling of the plagues being described. I absolutely adore her writing style in this, it’s down to earth, personable with her funny witty personality that seems to lace her words. It doesn’t detract away from the informative nature or content which is written both scientifically and in such an engaging way it’s a delight to read. It’s also written in a way that’s delicate but also to the point and doesn’t beat around the bush. I loved it! I really recommend a read if this aligns with your interests !"
34,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7812107-natalie,5,"People who don't find Jennifer Wright hilarious are people I don't want to be friends with. There. That is the most important thing you need to know regarding my opinion of this book.MY OTHER OPINIONS1. This was incredibly interesting. I learned more reading this than I did in four years of high school. I was telling all my friends and co-workers about it. 2. This took me forever to read because I didn't want it to end. I would pick it up only as a special treat to myself - like chocolates or a massage. 3. Walter Jackson Freeman II was a total POS. That's not really an opinion. That's a fact. Unless you believe otherwise. In that case, you are also a POS. I want to read a million books by this author. Unfortunately, her supply does not meet my demand currently, so I'll just need to savor what I do have. 5 Stars"
35,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"I'm not sure whether it's something to be proud of or not, but I've always been fascinated by disease and plagues. So when I came across this book, I knew I had to read it. It did not disappoint.I could see how some people would find Wright's casual and almost flippant tone at times to be a little off-putting, but for me, I felt as if we were two women discussing these horrific plagues and diseases over a cup of coffee. And there's just enough lightness to keep the book from being completely and utterly depressing, even if we still have no idea where the Spanish flu came from, and no way to combat it if it ever decided to come out of hibernation. My only consolation is I'm perhaps a bit too old at 38 to be at the greatest risk of dying from the Spanish flu. (Also can we please quit calling stomach bugs the ""flu""? It is not the flu. Influenza, even the non-Spanish version, will knock you on your back for a couple of weeks. If you are up and about the next day or the day after, you do not have the flu. /end rant)This book will also annoy anti-vaxxers to no end, as Wright goes on quite the rant regarding the need for and the safety of vaccines at the end of the chapter on smallpox. I do believe that we're so far removed from these terrible diseases that it's lulled people into a false sense of security, that the diseases every child experienced in the pre-vaccination age weren't really that bad. But when you realize that milkmaids were very proud of the fact that they'd never ""lose their beauty"" (ie, become horribly disfigured) thanks to smallpox, having had cowpox already, you start think, ""Hmm, perhaps smallpox *was* pretty damn bad."" And without vaccines, children would still be paralyzed every summer thanks to contracting polio. That's not exactly a world I'd like to return to.I especially liked that Wright stepped outside the box a bit, and told us about some lesser-known plagues, like the dancing plague and encephalitis lethargica. But the scariest bits were how quickly we forget the terror of losing so many thanks to an extremely contagious disease. I can't even imagine watching bodies pile up in the streets, as they did in Philadelphia just a hundred years ago during the Spanish flu. Yet we need to remember, and begin to plan for an epidemic like this to happen again. It seems as if we're just about due for another outbreak.I highly recommend this book, especially since Wright keeps the terrifying photos to a section at the end of the book that one doesn't have to look at. It's so informative, yet accessible thanks to her chatty prose. I can't wait to read her previous book, It Ended Badly: Thirteen of the Worst Breakups in History. I have a feeling I'll love it just as much, and I truly hope Wright continues to write these fascinating books."
36,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19228026-phyllis,4,"I planned on a four star rating but the more I read, the more I liked it. So I gave it 4.5. I've read several books about epidemics, plagues and am always fascinated by how diseases and their victims are treated. The author has done a tremendous amount of research and also has a sense of humor, just enough to get you through some of the horrible aspects of these epidemics. A quote from the leprosy chapter about Father Damien, the priest who went to live and care for the lepers on the island of Molokai, ""Damien is a reminder that you don't have to be a genius or a brilliant scientist or a doctor to help in this war against disease: you just have to be someone who gives a damn about your fellow man"".  In the chapter on the Spanish Influenza she talks about the president who controlled the press and wouldn't allow anything about this massive, deadly epidemic to appear in any newspaper. We should never allow presidents to control the press. Another excellent book on the Spanish Influenza The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History"
37,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"I finished this one a few days ago and while I found it interesting, the social commentary from the author was a little hit and miss. Jennifer Wright gives us a great overview of some of the worst of the worst plagues and misses the AIDS plague which I was hoping would've provided us some insight. The book is a 3.5 and I liked it enough to keep reading. Some of the humour didn't fit and I'm a huge fan of pop culture but I was a little baffled here. Wright should of left some of the commentary to the later part of the chapters, giving us a brief overview of the cleverness she clearly has. If you don't know too much about plagues like myself and you hear anyone running around with crazy ideas on plagues, shove this book in their hands. It gives you a large amount of information but I just think it didn't flow like it should've. Others clearly think better of it and have pegged this at 5, I just wanted a lot more input from the author. The book needed to be longer but maybe she will deliver a follow-up which will blow our minds. "
38,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen,4,"Wright is a bit of a Mary Roach—funny and voice-y and opinionated, while simultaneously unloading lots of learning about the history of disease. She is firmly on the side of sufferers and the people who’ve tried to help them, and just as firmly condemns anyone who has judged, abandoned, or exploited the sick. From the dancing plague of the sixteenth century to typhoid, cholera, and polio—by way of lobotomies and a brief mention of AIDS—she covers the pestilential waterfront. Taught me stuff and made me smile on my commute. "
39,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Most of the information included in this book was not new, and I can’t even say it was put together in a new way that helped me see the subject matter through a new lens. Despite that, I will probably read any book Jennifer wright authors because I simply love her writing style. Her humor, wit, and strong opinions set a tone early in the book that made old and recycled information feel refreshing."
40,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5096743-suzanne,4,"This was fascinating, and the author kept it interesting throughout."
41,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36933045-rosemary-standeven,5,"This is a surprisingly readable, informative and amusing book – given its subject – and ideally suited to the current worldwide crisis. Some of the plagues I already knew a lot about (Syphilis and Tuberculosis), having written assignments on them for my Herbal Medicine degree (and NO, herbal medicine will NOT cure either of them, I just found the diseases interesting). Others I knew a bit about, but learned so much more. For instance – the so-called Spanish Flu originated in Kansas, USA, but due to WWI media restrictions no-one in USA, Britain etc was allowed to report on it. Spain was neutral, reported the deaths, and so got the blame. The dancing plague in Strasbourg was entirely new to me.There is a lot to be learned from the genesis, spread and treatment of old plagues that can be applied to the current COVID19, and the author does not shy away from scathing comments on doctors and politicians who were more interested in their own affairs than helping the public. There is also repeated (and wholly deserved) condemnation of Anti-vaxxers and people who will not listen to the genuine experts, and believe that they know best, despite overwhelming scientific proof of the idiocy and public danger of their claims. (“Ask the Aztecs and Incas whether or not they would have liked to have vaccines available to them. Oh, wait, you can’t, they’re dead.” One thing that stands out above all others, is the need for courageous, empathetic, intelligent and decisive leadership in the face of plagues – something that is in short supply just now (except in NZ and maybe Germany).Amongst all the death and suffering, there are some heart-warming stories, some real heroes, and some serendipitous good fortune. The book is ultimately about the resilience of the human spirit, and about how we can get through plagues, bad medicine and the current crisis, if we would just learn from past errors.Some quotes I liked:Dancing plague: “is lovely to see that all the edicts related to helping the suffering people. The community did not want their fellow neighbors to die and were experimenting on many fronts to help the afflicted. Today we still have outbreaks where we become so fearful for ourselves that we forget all about our neighbors. The people of Strasbourg were ahead of their time in their regard for one another. … there is never a situation where care and attentiveness by the community is a bad thing.”Cholera:  “He became such a firm convert to Snow’s theory that until his death Whitehead kept over his desk a portrait of Snow, which, he noted, “ever serves to remind me that in any profession the highest order of work is achieved not by fussy demand for ‘something to be done,’ but by patient study of the eternal laws.””“The best-case scenario when it comes to the outbreak of a disease is that the community will rally around the afflicted. It will tend to them gently; it will raise funds; it will do whatever is necessary to allow the people stricken with the disease to live with dignity while science searches for a cure.” Spanish ‘flu’:  “In spite of our First World desire to believe that diseases are fundamentally exotic imports, the first case of the Spanish flu epidemic was reported to the weekly journal Public Health Reports by Dr. Loring Miner of Haskell, Kansas, in March 1918.” “This might be a good time to mention that if you learn about an airborne virus that seems to be killing otherwise healthy young people in your area from a reputable medical journal, you are reading very bad news. Go to the grocery store and start stocking up on supplies immediately. If you have someplace relatively isolated to live, go there. Doing so might feel a bit silly or paranoid, but, honestly, neither of those responses would be overreactions.”“We are fortunate today to have organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization that track how diseases are progressing and report these findings. In the event of an outbreak similar to the Spanish flu, they will be wonderful resources.” – WHICH NEED FUNDING NOT CUTS!!!Lobotomies: “Part of the blame lies with a midcentury zeal for conformity. People were willing to sacrifice whole personalities to make those who seemed different and unusual more like everyone else. Some who turned to lobotomies desperately yearned for a cure for their ailments; others were suffering from nothing more than human frailty.”Polio: “Our main problem now,” said Thomas Rivers, a leader in viral research who oversaw the clinical trials of Salk’s vaccine in 1956, “is not that anything is wrong with the Salk vaccine, but that something is wrong with the people who won’t take it.”"
42,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2323418-abbey,4,"4.5 stars - it is so weird to say a book about diseases was a fun read. Wright uses such great humor through devastating parts of history in a way that’s respectful of the trauma. I’d heard of most of these plagues, but I knew zero details. This was fascinating and an easy way to get that information. It reminds me in some ways of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks in that it reminds us the importance of science while keeping the humanity in mind.Also, PLEASE VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN"
43,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23727760-daniel-kibblesmith,5,"Another funny, insightful history book from Jennifer Wright.As in her previous, ""It Ended Badly: 13 Of The Worst Break-Ups In History,"" Wright's blend of thorough research and humorous modern voice makes history instantly accessible and relatable — devoting each roughly commute-length chapter into a different vignette about a world-changing plague.Who knew that Father Damien was basically the greatest human being who ever lived, and Woodrow Wilson was the worst? Or that people ""cured"" the bubonic plague with exploding frogs? Also, one word: Lobotomobile.Stories you might have some familiarity with come to life in a deeper way with modern hindsight and funny (or frightening) modern relevance.

I still learned a fair amount though, and for all her jokes, it's clear that the book is very well researched and that she is passionate about her subject, which I really appreciated. However, if you're looking for a serious academic treatise on diseases, this isn't it.The only chapter I felt was out of place was the one on lobotomies. Yes, they are awful and terrifying, but not a disease."

There is still no cure for EL, and its rise and subsequent disappearance is still regarded as something of a mystery.
I have heard of this before but only in the obscure and morbidly fascinating sense, think more horror movie than documentary. The unknown-ness of this one draws me and repels me away. Reading about how it affected people's personalities, bodily functions, and sent them into comas is frightening. 
If you are interested in following a line of thought on interrelated diseases, though, some scientists today think that EL is related to streptococcal bacteria, so that’s a fun thing to consider when you get strep throat.
I have never heard and this and can I just say WHAT?!? Reading about how adult's showed after effects of Postencephalitic Parkinson’s disease which led them to L-dopa as a cure and how it initially worked, the woman waking up from a coma years later and thinking it was early 1940s when it was late 1960s, was wild. I think this ""plague"" was added to just scare the crap out of everyone as there is still no known cure but I guess it hasn't made any more appearances? This is one I'm going to have to investigate further because how freaking wild that it seems to suddenly appear in 1916 and disappear in 1920s. I guess I'd put my bet on Aliens.Lobotomies
Somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of lobotomies were performed on women, despite a greater percentage of men being institutionalized.
This probably shouldn't have been included in a plague book but it is important to discuss, so I'll allow it. I'm against lobotomies, so I had no problem how the author discussed Freeman, the physician behind the start, procedure, and craze of them. The accounts of how he went about them, snipping here and there, until he got the desired amount of not quite comatose in patients, is horrifying and rage inducing. 
A charismatic demagogue was elevated and trusted because he was captivating and because researching facts, as well as listening to dull doctors who have done their homework, is hard and time-consuming.
This quote, I can't tell you how much I feel this quote down into my soul right now. Reading about how women who were listed as menopausal or hysterical, by doctors that didn't even converse with them but rather their husbands and given over to Freeman for lobotomies had me fighting tears. This chapter was all about making sure there are committees, watchdogs, or the like in place to stop charismatic, mad medical field individuals from dazzling people with their ""science"".Polio 
Well, herd immunity works for most diseases only if about 80 to 90 percent of the population is vaccinated. With some diseases, like measles, a 95 percent vaccination rate is necessary.
Again, vaccinate your kids. I have to say, I'm not sure I knew Polio came from contaminated water or food, kind of like typhoid. That is how well we eradicated it, I didn't even know what caused it! The author talked about live virus and killer virus vaccines and the rivalry between Salk and Sabin to get there. I've heard of Salk before because of how he used unwittingly mental health patients for clinical trials, which the author mentioned but after saying he should be considered close to a saint. I'm not quite there on him but I'm a grey shades person and as long as you mention the shitty aspects I don't have a problem stating all the good he also did. Seems wild in today's atmosphere of people dying because the price of their insulin is too much money that he didn't patent his vaccine but I'd like to read more on the legalities of if and how he could have. My favorite part of this section was the focus on how representation matters and how FDR gave hope and pride to fellow Polio survivors. 
Those who had AIDS survived because they, like Mr. Crumpton’s No Nose’d Club for syphilitics, founded groups like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP to fight for their right to live. They supported one another. They protested. They yelled. They made people extremely uncomfortable.
I'm not a scientist or in the medical field, so there was definitely new information for me to gain from reading this. I went in thinking this was going to be a drier, informative read but realized very early on that my expectations needed to be changed. This is more of a coffee table book where casual readers can just pick it up and learn some interesting facts that will either make them popular on trivia night or send them down a drier text reading rabbit hole. The author has a sarcastic, pop culture heavy tone that could turn some people off as we discussing real horrible deaths but I'm a bit of a gallows humor gal myself, so except for a couple times, I wasn't put off or offended. I do think the pop culture references are going to date this and age it out of future circulation. All in all, I learned some facts, was intrigued to research some, and enjoyed this more surface look into diseases. This book is not for experts in the field but the average person could definitely get something out of it. However, if you're an anti-vaxxer, you'd probably get huffy over the author's constant reminder that you should probably reevaluate your thinking (I completely agree with her)."
48,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"Putting a hilarious spin on history in all the right places, Jennifer Wright will crack you up while telling you all about some of the worst plagues that have been documented. If you’re someone who hears about diseases or ailments and immediately think that you have them, this book might not be for you. However, if you’re someone who likes to read about history and are interested in learning about some of the most notable disease outbreaks, this is the book for you.When I picked up this book, I was not expecting to laugh as much as I did. Don’t get me wrong; the subject matter is serious, but Jennifer has a sense of humor that translates well even in nonfiction. Every time she inserts a photo, the caption has me rolling. At one point, there’s an illustration showing two people being treated for the Bubonic Plague. Her caption reads:“These guys were lucky—they had pillows and an in-home wizard.”There was never a funny moment that was horribly misplaced. There are chapters where the author is not funny because there just isn’t a time for it. However, other chapters let her personality shine through in sections and I was cracking up. It’s not a book that has a monotone voice like some nonfiction novels have.I learned a lot throughout the chapters. I had heard of majority of the diseases and had some knowledge about them, but the only one I really knew a lot about was the travesty that was lobotomies. This is the one chapter that’s not an actual disease but rather a horrific catch-all treatment that did a lot of harm to the people who were operated on. There’s a lot of interesting information throughout the chapters including some interesting cases and notable names, treatment attempts, and cases.This is an excellent book that’s perfect for anyone’s collection in addition to making a great gift for those interested in historical overviews."
49,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,5,Informative and fun in equal measure.
50,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6367659-poligirlreads,5,"Given that I can develop a disease based on the power of suggestion alone (""Doc, I've been watching the news on prostate cancer, and now I think think there's something wrong with my prostate."" ""You're a chick. You don't have a prostate."" ""That's precisely what makes this situation all the more dire.""), I probably should've taken a hard pass on this book. But given my love of Wright's previous book, It Ended Badly, I knew I needed to read this one. As a result, I now want to hunker down in basement and wear a gas mask 24/7 to ward off any potential plagues, but despite that, this is a most excellent read.You know how people talk about how in order to understand the present, you have to look toward the past? Boy is this the perfect book within the context of the anti-vaxxers. History is always trying out ""natural"" cures like rubbing the body down in onions and whatnot, and amazingly, it's only actual science that seems to provide the actual solutions. It's a weird and strange transition from seeing people line up for polio vaccines in the '50s to abject suspicion in the 21st century to such dangerous quackery like, you know, measles vaccinations. Wright details how these phenomenons occur: once something is eradicated, we no longer see their horrifying effects, and once a disease is eradicated, we promptly forget about it, and the lessons we learned from it. That is both troubling and decidedly human.Also human? The tales she tells of the heroes: Aurelius, Father Damien, Salk. People who get their business together, and go about trying to save lives and give people comfort. Heck, it gave me comfort just knowing that these people existed.Wright has a delightful writing style, both parts humorous and informative. She managed to make me laugh while I cringed at humanity's general responses to plagues. I get her reasoning for not devoting a full chapter to AIDS, but I still think it should've been done. Tracing what happened once folks realized that the ""gay disease"" was actually a people disease, would have been interesting. And I also would've liked to see some love for SARS. It had all of the hallmarks that Wright would've loved: the public's response, the race-baiting (""blame the Asians!""), the effects of globalization on its spread, the political response...sigh. Oh well. The good thing about plagues (I never thought I'd write that line) is that there's always more to come. Here's looking forward to Get Well Soon, Vol. 2.And to Wright? Thank you, THANK YOU for keeping the horrific pictures of diseased folks in the back of the book. Had they been included throughout, I probably would've been so traumatized that I would've developed the Dancing Plague."
51,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16214729-margaret,2,"The author of this book desperately wanted to make this subject ""cool"" without taking into account the fact that people who pick up a book about plagues are probably going to be annoyed by that. The author inserts a lot of herself into the telling about these plagues, using a lot of ""I"" sentences (as another reviewer noted). I know this isn't fiction, but she also CONSTANTLY breaks the ""fourth wall"" by addressing her readers directly, e.g. ""If you managed to get through the Spanish Flu chapter and were only modestly terrified, well you're a strange human being, but settle in and prepare to have your socks scared off."" BARF. The writing is quite juvenile. Why was it necessary to mention Goodreads while discussing bad reviews given to a medical paper? Why did she need to mention Kim Kardashian in a discussion about the media coverage of the Spanish Flu during WWI? The style is just grating. I felt very patronized, as if the author feels like her readers are too vapid to be interested in medical nonfiction without adding in bits of pop culture that will make this book age VERY badly. I think the last straw for me on that point was when she threw in a reference to 50 Shades of Grey. NO. JUST NO. I gave it 2 stars overall because in between the ""look how cool I'm making this subject!"" fluff, she actually presents interesting and accurate information about each plague - I've read many of the books and authors she references (John Kelly and John Barry)."
52,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith,3,"Audiobook. Although not quite as entertaining as Charles Panati’s book “Extraordinary Endings of Everything and Everybody” (as I recall its title), this is an informative book on the history of several infectious diseases, like plague, leprosy, typhoid, cholera, Spanish flu, etc. There is also a chapter on lobotomy, not a disease, but included to fit the author’s main theme, which is that society is full of monsters. There’s a lot of monstrosity in this book. The sick have always been treated with revulsion and righteousness, which is not laudable but is understandable when you realize that for most of human existence, life was a pretty hard struggle and we are hard-wired to fear disease and to protect the healthy by leaving the weak behind - which often means dehumanizing them. The author makes the valid point that our modern, enlightened society should move beyond these attitudes, although they do still often crop up, even among those who should be aware of the errors of the past and setting an example of more compassionate thought today.It’s definitely a history book. You won’t come away from it with any deep understandings of the mechanism or treatment of infection, but it does provide some interesting facts about how the various epidemics arose and the societal atmosphere surrounding them. It makes the point that advances such as improved sanitation, antiseptics, antibiotics and immunization should also include basic human compassion for the afflicted."
53,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39353094-diabolica,5,"I have never enjoyed reading the intro and epilogue of a book more. Straight up, this is possibly the only book that has managed to rein me in, in what is generally the most boring and (what I think) the most frivolous section of the novel. I loved the writing style, both informative and hilarious. Any secondary sources she used were weaved inside her novel, so that they flowed with the text. And the annotations weren't just there for the sake of being there. Despite reading this over the span of a month, I never once lost interest. The subject, as dry as it might have been through other media, was the most griping thing I read that month. (It also didn't hurt that I didn't read much else during January). Best of all, I actually remember what I read. Most attempts leave me bored within the first thirty pages (maybe that's a sign that I shouldn't read nonfiction(?)), but this book both reeled me in, and had my attention captured. So much so that I could recount what I read. Hats off to Wright. Definitely recommend this to really anyone whose interested, even slightly, in this sort of field/topic. "
54,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"Wright is even more witty and current than my other go-to NF writer, Roach, of Stiff and Spook fame. I was interested in learning more about the past plagues and what we need to learn from them. It's so hard to wrap your mind around that many people dying -significant percentages of the population... gone. How did people deal with loss of family friends, neighbors and the accompanying grief. In those days, they had so little idea of what they were dealing with, but as Wright reminds us , it's likely only a matter of time with increased resistance to antibiotics.. Not that this is a totally gloomy read, Wright applauds the heroes, traces the medical learning curve and applies a liberal dose of gallow's humor, that I really appreciated 4 and a half fevered stars."
55,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17887800-kelley-dykes,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. How she managed to make me laugh hysterically while teaching me important facts about plagues and showing respect for their gruesome history at the same time, I’ll never know. I love books on virology and this one did not disappoint. I have read a lot on the subject and was still surprised by a lot of the little known stories and heroes in the war on plagues throughout the ages. Seriously worth a read. If you can manage to make learning about horrific things fun for an average stay at home mom, you’ve won the game."

I was doing good and handling all this scary info well until I got to the Spanish flu chapter. ok, a little scared now. then the chapter on lobotomies. I could have cried and cried. after hearing about all these terrible diseases then to hear about the horrors a man inflicted on others and not always willing people, was so heart breaking. and don't think this book is going to end on a happy note. Lastly, she discusses the AIDS outbreak of the 80's. The things some of our elected officials said and they way they joked about it was truly awful. too bad they didn't have this book back then. Maybe they could have took some inspiration from (now) Saint Damien. "

We ended up listening to it together. We would stop after each chapter and discuss. It was fun. I knew nothing about the Antonine Plague of Rome. I found how widespread syphilis was to be fascinating. The monk that worked on the leper colony, Father Damien, should be a saint. The man who promoted lobotomies, Walter Jackson Freeman II, was a devil and I want to believe that he is paying for it in death. People should vaccinate their children. And seriously bursting frogs to cure the black death. Ugh! There is a lot of humor in this book which I didn’t always love but it wasn’t done disrespectfully.

And if you need a primer on pandemics, this is a nice one - BUT it isn't really anything more, just a primer. I expected something more - something more focused on specific illnesses as such; and although Wright references many books on pandemics, much of the pieces of information relayed can be found, in a not very different shape, on wikipedia.

61,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,5,"Jennifer Wright writes with a delightful combination of snark and compassion. I thoroughly enjoyed this romp through many of history’s worst plagues. The heroes of which she speaks are not always doctors and scientists, but everyday compassionate people who care about their fellow man. There is also a villain or two. The book also comes with a bit of preaching, which I didn’t mind. There are two major lessons I think she wants us to walk away with.1) Stigmatizing and ostracizing victims of disease is not only mean and wrong, but it hinders our ability to fight the disease. This is because ashamed people hide their condition, leading to increased spreading of the disease, and decreased data for research.2) Vaccinate your kids, for crying out loud!A few quotes for your reading pleasure.“Feel free to start using Walter Jackson Freeman II as an insult directed toward people you hate. Almost no one will get the reference, but if I am in the room we’ll high-five and it will be awesome.” “Although Galen was a great physician, he was not a terribly courageous man. Galen was a self-promotor above anything else. According to McLynn, he consistently claimed to be a self-made man, casually downplaying the fact that he can from an extremely wealthy family and had inherited numerous estates as well as a stellar list of contacts. He employed underhanded tactics to win debates, and he constantly aggrandized his own achievements. Personality-wise, you could think of him as the Donald Trump of Ancient Rome.” “Full disclosure: I would have patented that vaccine and not felt guilty about it for a second. I suspect I would have used the money to do dumb stuff I thought was awesome, like start an F. Scott Fitzgerald theme park. I assume everyone else would also do that. Why doesn’t a theme park devoted to books exist? It would be so much fun.”"
62,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45392105-aleta,5,"Jennifer Wright did an incredible job with this book. Maybe I have a Macabre side to me reading this during our current Pandemic, but it's amazing how we we've repeated mistakes from the past. It was reassuring to be reminded of all the diseases we have eradicated over the Centuries and the people who came together to wage war on sickness."
63,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I picked this book up on a whim as I’m interested in the subject matter and I’m so glad I did! This was such a fantastic book and one of my favourites on the discussion of plagues to date (I’ve actually read a fair few ..)I love the references to popular culture and current and recent films which brings historical plagues into a 21st century relatability whilst also holding onto the historical nature and telling of the plagues being described. I absolutely adore her writing style in this, it’s down to earth, personable with her funny witty personality that seems to lace her words. It doesn’t detract away from the informative nature or content which is written both scientifically and in such an engaging way it’s a delight to read. It’s also written in a way that’s delicate but also to the point and doesn’t beat around the bush. I loved it! I really recommend a read if this aligns with your interests !"
64,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7812107-natalie,5,"People who don't find Jennifer Wright hilarious are people I don't want to be friends with. There. That is the most important thing you need to know regarding my opinion of this book.MY OTHER OPINIONS1. This was incredibly interesting. I learned more reading this than I did in four years of high school. I was telling all my friends and co-workers about it. 2. This took me forever to read because I didn't want it to end. I would pick it up only as a special treat to myself - like chocolates or a massage. 3. Walter Jackson Freeman II was a total POS. That's not really an opinion. That's a fact. Unless you believe otherwise. In that case, you are also a POS. I want to read a million books by this author. Unfortunately, her supply does not meet my demand currently, so I'll just need to savor what I do have. 5 Stars"
65,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"I'm not sure whether it's something to be proud of or not, but I've always been fascinated by disease and plagues. So when I came across this book, I knew I had to read it. It did not disappoint.I could see how some people would find Wright's casual and almost flippant tone at times to be a little off-putting, but for me, I felt as if we were two women discussing these horrific plagues and diseases over a cup of coffee. And there's just enough lightness to keep the book from being completely and utterly depressing, even if we still have no idea where the Spanish flu came from, and no way to combat it if it ever decided to come out of hibernation. My only consolation is I'm perhaps a bit too old at 38 to be at the greatest risk of dying from the Spanish flu. (Also can we please quit calling stomach bugs the ""flu""? It is not the flu. Influenza, even the non-Spanish version, will knock you on your back for a couple of weeks. If you are up and about the next day or the day after, you do not have the flu. /end rant)This book will also annoy anti-vaxxers to no end, as Wright goes on quite the rant regarding the need for and the safety of vaccines at the end of the chapter on smallpox. I do believe that we're so far removed from these terrible diseases that it's lulled people into a false sense of security, that the diseases every child experienced in the pre-vaccination age weren't really that bad. But when you realize that milkmaids were very proud of the fact that they'd never ""lose their beauty"" (ie, become horribly disfigured) thanks to smallpox, having had cowpox already, you start think, ""Hmm, perhaps smallpox *was* pretty damn bad."" And without vaccines, children would still be paralyzed every summer thanks to contracting polio. That's not exactly a world I'd like to return to.I especially liked that Wright stepped outside the box a bit, and told us about some lesser-known plagues, like the dancing plague and encephalitis lethargica. But the scariest bits were how quickly we forget the terror of losing so many thanks to an extremely contagious disease. I can't even imagine watching bodies pile up in the streets, as they did in Philadelphia just a hundred years ago during the Spanish flu. Yet we need to remember, and begin to plan for an epidemic like this to happen again. It seems as if we're just about due for another outbreak.I highly recommend this book, especially since Wright keeps the terrifying photos to a section at the end of the book that one doesn't have to look at. It's so informative, yet accessible thanks to her chatty prose. I can't wait to read her previous book, It Ended Badly: Thirteen of the Worst Breakups in History. I have a feeling I'll love it just as much, and I truly hope Wright continues to write these fascinating books."
66,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19228026-phyllis,4,"I planned on a four star rating but the more I read, the more I liked it. So I gave it 4.5. I've read several books about epidemics, plagues and am always fascinated by how diseases and their victims are treated. The author has done a tremendous amount of research and also has a sense of humor, just enough to get you through some of the horrible aspects of these epidemics. A quote from the leprosy chapter about Father Damien, the priest who went to live and care for the lepers on the island of Molokai, ""Damien is a reminder that you don't have to be a genius or a brilliant scientist or a doctor to help in this war against disease: you just have to be someone who gives a damn about your fellow man"".  In the chapter on the Spanish Influenza she talks about the president who controlled the press and wouldn't allow anything about this massive, deadly epidemic to appear in any newspaper. We should never allow presidents to control the press. Another excellent book on the Spanish Influenza The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History"
67,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"I finished this one a few days ago and while I found it interesting, the social commentary from the author was a little hit and miss. Jennifer Wright gives us a great overview of some of the worst of the worst plagues and misses the AIDS plague which I was hoping would've provided us some insight. The book is a 3.5 and I liked it enough to keep reading. Some of the humour didn't fit and I'm a huge fan of pop culture but I was a little baffled here. Wright should of left some of the commentary to the later part of the chapters, giving us a brief overview of the cleverness she clearly has. If you don't know too much about plagues like myself and you hear anyone running around with crazy ideas on plagues, shove this book in their hands. It gives you a large amount of information but I just think it didn't flow like it should've. Others clearly think better of it and have pegged this at 5, I just wanted a lot more input from the author. The book needed to be longer but maybe she will deliver a follow-up which will blow our minds. "
68,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen,4,"Wright is a bit of a Mary Roach—funny and voice-y and opinionated, while simultaneously unloading lots of learning about the history of disease. She is firmly on the side of sufferers and the people who’ve tried to help them, and just as firmly condemns anyone who has judged, abandoned, or exploited the sick. From the dancing plague of the sixteenth century to typhoid, cholera, and polio—by way of lobotomies and a brief mention of AIDS—she covers the pestilential waterfront. Taught me stuff and made me smile on my commute. "

71,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36933045-rosemary-standeven,5,"This is a surprisingly readable, informative and amusing book – given its subject – and ideally suited to the current worldwide crisis. Some of the plagues I already knew a lot about (Syphilis and Tuberculosis), having written assignments on them for my Herbal Medicine degree (and NO, herbal medicine will NOT cure either of them, I just found the diseases interesting). Others I knew a bit about, but learned so much more. For instance – the so-called Spanish Flu originated in Kansas, USA, but due to WWI media restrictions no-one in USA, Britain etc was allowed to report on it. Spain was neutral, reported the deaths, and so got the blame. The dancing plague in Strasbourg was entirely new to me.There is a lot to be learned from the genesis, spread and treatment of old plagues that can be applied to the current COVID19, and the author does not shy away from scathing comments on doctors and politicians who were more interested in their own affairs than helping the public. There is also repeated (and wholly deserved) condemnation of Anti-vaxxers and people who will not listen to the genuine experts, and believe that they know best, despite overwhelming scientific proof of the idiocy and public danger of their claims. (“Ask the Aztecs and Incas whether or not they would have liked to have vaccines available to them. Oh, wait, you can’t, they’re dead.” One thing that stands out above all others, is the need for courageous, empathetic, intelligent and decisive leadership in the face of plagues – something that is in short supply just now (except in NZ and maybe Germany).Amongst all the death and suffering, there are some heart-warming stories, some real heroes, and some serendipitous good fortune. The book is ultimately about the resilience of the human spirit, and about how we can get through plagues, bad medicine and the current crisis, if we would just learn from past errors.Some quotes I liked:Dancing plague: “is lovely to see that all the edicts related to helping the suffering people. The community did not want their fellow neighbors to die and were experimenting on many fronts to help the afflicted. Today we still have outbreaks where we become so fearful for ourselves that we forget all about our neighbors. The people of Strasbourg were ahead of their time in their regard for one another. … there is never a situation where care and attentiveness by the community is a bad thing.”Cholera:  “He became such a firm convert to Snow’s theory that until his death Whitehead kept over his desk a portrait of Snow, which, he noted, “ever serves to remind me that in any profession the highest order of work is achieved not by fussy demand for ‘something to be done,’ but by patient study of the eternal laws.””“The best-case scenario when it comes to the outbreak of a disease is that the community will rally around the afflicted. It will tend to them gently; it will raise funds; it will do whatever is necessary to allow the people stricken with the disease to live with dignity while science searches for a cure.” Spanish ‘flu’:  “In spite of our First World desire to believe that diseases are fundamentally exotic imports, the first case of the Spanish flu epidemic was reported to the weekly journal Public Health Reports by Dr. Loring Miner of Haskell, Kansas, in March 1918.” “This might be a good time to mention that if you learn about an airborne virus that seems to be killing otherwise healthy young people in your area from a reputable medical journal, you are reading very bad news. Go to the grocery store and start stocking up on supplies immediately. If you have someplace relatively isolated to live, go there. Doing so might feel a bit silly or paranoid, but, honestly, neither of those responses would be overreactions.”“We are fortunate today to have organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization that track how diseases are progressing and report these findings. In the event of an outbreak similar to the Spanish flu, they will be wonderful resources.” – WHICH NEED FUNDING NOT CUTS!!!Lobotomies: “Part of the blame lies with a midcentury zeal for conformity. People were willing to sacrifice whole personalities to make those who seemed different and unusual more like everyone else. Some who turned to lobotomies desperately yearned for a cure for their ailments; others were suffering from nothing more than human frailty.”Polio: “Our main problem now,” said Thomas Rivers, a leader in viral research who oversaw the clinical trials of Salk’s vaccine in 1956, “is not that anything is wrong with the Salk vaccine, but that something is wrong with the people who won’t take it.”"

Wright uses such great humor through devastating parts of history in a way that’s respectful of the trauma. I’d heard of most of these plagues, but I knew zero details. This was fascinating and an easy way to get that information. It reminds me in some ways of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks in that it reminds us the importance of science while keeping the humanity in mind.Also, PLEASE VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN"
73,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23727760-daniel-kibblesmith,5,"Another funny, insightful history book from Jennifer Wright.As in her previous, ""It Ended Badly: 13 Of The Worst Break-Ups In History,"" Wright's blend of thorough research and humorous modern voice makes history instantly accessible and relatable — devoting each roughly commute-length chapter into a different vignette about a world-changing plague.Who knew that Father Damien was basically the greatest human being who ever lived, and Woodrow Wilson was the worst? Or that people ""cured"" the bubonic plague with exploding frogs? Also, one word: Lobotomobile.Stories you might have some familiarity with come to life in a deeper way with modern hindsight and funny (or frightening) modern relevance. Perfect for history buffs, people looking for some historical perspective after the election, and the hypochondriac in all of us."
74,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14174872-lea,4,"A fun and easy-to-read book on some particularly nasty diseases, the people who suffered them and the people who helped cure/treat them.I was familiar with most of the history in the book, but had fun with the author's casual writing style. I still learned a fair amount though, and for all her jokes, it's clear that the book is very well researched and that she is passionate about her subject, which I really appreciated. However, if you're looking for a serious academic treatise on diseases, this isn't it.The only chapter I felt was out of place was the one on lobotomies. Yes, they are awful and terrifying, but not a disease."

77,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2763722-whiskeyinthejar,3,"I read this for the Doomsday square for Halloween Bingo.Previous Updates:Antonine PlagueBubonic PlagueDancing PlagueSmall PoxSyphilis, Tuberculosis, and CholeraLeprosy, Typhoid, and Spanish FluEncephalitis Lethargica
There is still no cure for EL, and its rise and subsequent disappearance is still regarded as something of a mystery.
I have heard of this before but only in the obscure and morbidly fascinating sense, think more horror movie than documentary. The unknown-ness of this one draws me and repels me away. Reading about how it affected people's personalities, bodily functions, and sent them into comas is frightening. 
If you are interested in following a line of thought on interrelated diseases, though, some scientists today think that EL is related to streptococcal bacteria, so that’s a fun thing to consider when you get strep throat.
I have never heard and this and can I just say WHAT?!? Reading about how adult's showed after effects of Postencephalitic Parkinson’s disease which led them to L-dopa as a cure and how it initially worked, the woman waking up from a coma years later and thinking it was early 1940s when it was late 1960s, was wild. I think this ""plague"" was added to just scare the crap out of everyone as there is still no known cure but I guess it hasn't made any more appearances? This is one I'm going to have to investigate further because how freaking wild that it seems to suddenly appear in 1916 and disappear in 1920s. I guess I'd put my bet on Aliens.Lobotomies
Somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of lobotomies were performed on women, despite a greater percentage of men being institutionalized.
This probably shouldn't have been included in a plague book but it is important to discuss, so I'll allow it. I'm against lobotomies, so I had no problem how the author discussed Freeman, the physician behind the start, procedure, and craze of them. The accounts of how he went about them, snipping here and there, until he got the desired amount of not quite comatose in patients, is horrifying and rage inducing. 
A charismatic demagogue was elevated and trusted because he was captivating and because researching facts, as well as listening to dull doctors who have done their homework, is hard and time-consuming.
This quote, I can't tell you how much I feel this quote down into my soul right now. Reading about how women who were listed as menopausal or hysterical, by doctors that didn't even converse with them but rather their husbands and given over to Freeman for lobotomies had me fighting tears. This chapter was all about making sure there are committees, watchdogs, or the like in place to stop charismatic, mad medical field individuals from dazzling people with their ""science"".Polio 
Well, herd immunity works for most diseases only if about 80 to 90 percent of the population is vaccinated. With some diseases, like measles, a 95 percent vaccination rate is necessary.
Again, vaccinate your kids. I have to say, I'm not sure I knew Polio came from contaminated water or food, kind of like typhoid. That is how well we eradicated it, I didn't even know what caused it! The author talked about live virus and killer virus vaccines and the rivalry between Salk and Sabin to get there. I've heard of Salk before because of how he used unwittingly mental health patients for clinical trials, which the author mentioned but after saying he should be considered close to a saint. I'm not quite there on him but I'm a grey shades person and as long as you mention the shitty aspects I don't have a problem stating all the good he also did. Seems wild in today's atmosphere of people dying because the price of their insulin is too much money that he didn't patent his vaccine but I'd like to read more on the legalities of if and how he could have. My favorite part of this section was the focus on how representation matters and how FDR gave hope and pride to fellow Polio survivors. 
Those who had AIDS survived because they, like Mr. Crumpton’s No Nose’d Club for syphilitics, founded groups like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP to fight for their right to live. They supported one another. They protested. They yelled. They made people extremely uncomfortable.
I'm not a scientist or in the medical field, so there was definitely new information for me to gain from reading this. I went in thinking this was going to be a drier, informative read but realized very early on that my expectations needed to be changed. This is more of a coffee table book where casual readers can just pick it up and learn some interesting facts that will either make them popular on trivia night or send them down a drier text reading rabbit hole. The author has a sarcastic, pop culture heavy tone that could turn some people off as we discussing real horrible deaths but I'm a bit of a gallows humor gal myself, so except for a couple times, I wasn't put off or offended. I do think the pop culture references are going to date this and age it out of future circulation. All in all, I learned some facts, was intrigued to research some, and enjoyed this more surface look into diseases. This book is not for experts in the field but the average person could definitely get something out of it. However, if you're an anti-vaxxer, you'd probably get huffy over the author's constant reminder that you should probably reevaluate your thinking (I completely agree with her)."
78,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"Putting a hilarious spin on history in all the right places, Jennifer Wright will crack you up while telling you all about some of the worst plagues that have been documented. If you’re someone who hears about diseases or ailments and immediately think that you have them, this book might not be for you. However, if you’re someone who likes to read about history and are interested in learning about some of the most notable disease outbreaks, this is the book for you.When I picked up this book, I was not expecting to laugh as much as I did. Don’t get me wrong; the subject matter is serious, but Jennifer has a sense of humor that translates well even in nonfiction. Every time she inserts a photo, the caption has me rolling. At one point, there’s an illustration showing two people being treated for the Bubonic Plague. Her caption reads:“These guys were lucky—they had pillows and an in-home wizard.”There was never a funny moment that was horribly misplaced. There are chapters where the author is not funny because there just isn’t a time for it. However, other chapters let her personality shine through in sections and I was cracking up. It’s not a book that has a monotone voice like some nonfiction novels have.I learned a lot throughout the chapters. I had heard of majority of the diseases and had some knowledge about them, but the only one I really knew a lot about was the travesty that was lobotomies. This is the one chapter that’s not an actual disease but rather a horrific catch-all treatment that did a lot of harm to the people who were operated on. There’s a lot of interesting information throughout the chapters including some interesting cases and notable names, treatment attempts, and cases.This is an excellent book that’s perfect for anyone’s collection in addition to making a great gift for those interested in historical overviews."
79,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,5,Informative and fun in equal measure.
80,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6367659-poligirlreads,5,"Given that I can develop a disease based on the power of suggestion alone (""Doc, I've been watching the news on prostate cancer, and now I think think there's something wrong with my prostate."" ""You're a chick. You don't have a prostate."" ""That's precisely what makes this situation all the more dire.""), I probably should've taken a hard pass on this book. But given my love of Wright's previous book, It Ended Badly, I knew I needed to read this one. As a result, I now want to hunker down in basement and wear a gas mask 24/7 to ward off any potential plagues, but despite that, this is a most excellent read.You know how people talk about how in order to understand the present, you have to look toward the past? Boy is this the perfect book within the context of the anti-vaxxers. History is always trying out ""natural"" cures like rubbing the body down in onions and whatnot, and amazingly, it's only actual science that seems to provide the actual solutions. It's a weird and strange transition from seeing people line up for polio vaccines in the '50s to abject suspicion in the 21st century to such dangerous quackery like, you know, measles vaccinations. Wright details how these phenomenons occur: once something is eradicated, we no longer see their horrifying effects, and once a disease is eradicated, we promptly forget about it, and the lessons we learned from it. That is both troubling and decidedly human.Also human? The tales she tells of the heroes: Aurelius, Father Damien, Salk. People who get their business together, and go about trying to save lives and give people comfort. Heck, it gave me comfort just knowing that these people existed.Wright has a delightful writing style, both parts humorous and informative. She managed to make me laugh while I cringed at humanity's general responses to plagues. I get her reasoning for not devoting a full chapter to AIDS, but I still think it should've been done. Tracing what happened once folks realized that the ""gay disease"" was actually a people disease, would have been interesting. And I also would've liked to see some love for SARS. It had all of the hallmarks that Wright would've loved: the public's response, the race-baiting (""blame the Asians!""), the effects of globalization on its spread, the political response...sigh. Oh well. The good thing about plagues (I never thought I'd write that line) is that there's always more to come. Here's looking forward to Get Well Soon, Vol. 2.And to Wright? Thank you, THANK YOU for keeping the horrific pictures of diseased folks in the back of the book. Had they been included throughout, I probably would've been so traumatized that I would've developed the Dancing Plague."
81,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16214729-margaret,2,"The author of this book desperately wanted to make this subject ""cool"" without taking into account the fact that people who pick up a book about plagues are probably going to be annoyed by that. The author inserts a lot of herself into the telling about these plagues, using a lot of ""I"" sentences (as another reviewer noted). I know this isn't fiction, but she also CONSTANTLY breaks the ""fourth wall"" by addressing her readers directly, e.g. ""If you managed to get through the Spanish Flu chapter and were only modestly terrified, well you're a strange human being, but settle in and prepare to have your socks scared off."" BARF. The writing is quite juvenile. Why was it necessary to mention Goodreads while discussing bad reviews given to a medical paper? Why did she need to mention Kim Kardashian in a discussion about the media coverage of the Spanish Flu during WWI? The style is just grating. I felt very patronized, as if the author feels like her readers are too vapid to be interested in medical nonfiction without adding in bits of pop culture that will make this book age VERY badly. I think the last straw for me on that point was when she threw in a reference to 50 Shades of Grey. NO. JUST NO. I gave it 2 stars overall because in between the ""look how cool I'm making this subject!"" fluff, she actually presents interesting and accurate information about each plague - I've read many of the books and authors she references (John Kelly and John Barry)."
82,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith,3,"Audiobook. Although not quite as entertaining as Charles Panati’s book “Extraordinary Endings of Everything and Everybody” (as I recall its title), this is an informative book on the history of several infectious diseases, like plague, leprosy, typhoid, cholera, Spanish flu, etc. There is also a chapter on lobotomy, not a disease, but included to fit the author’s main theme, which is that society is full of monsters. There’s a lot of monstrosity in this book. The sick have always been treated with revulsion and righteousness, which is not laudable but is understandable when you realize that for most of human existence, life was a pretty hard struggle and we are hard-wired to fear disease and to protect the healthy by leaving the weak behind - which often means dehumanizing them. The author makes the valid point that our modern, enlightened society should move beyond these attitudes, although they do still often crop up, even among those who should be aware of the errors of the past and setting an example of more compassionate thought today.It’s definitely a history book. You won’t come away from it with any deep understandings of the mechanism or treatment of infection, but it does provide some interesting facts about how the various epidemics arose and the societal atmosphere surrounding them. It makes the point that advances such as improved sanitation, antiseptics, antibiotics and immunization should also include basic human compassion for the afflicted."
83,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39353094-diabolica,5,"I have never enjoyed reading the intro and epilogue of a book more. Straight up, this is possibly the only book that has managed to rein me in, in what is generally the most boring and (what I think) the most frivolous section of the novel. I loved the writing style, both informative and hilarious. Any secondary sources she used were weaved inside her novel, so that they flowed with the text. And the annotations weren't just there for the sake of being there. Despite reading this over the span of a month, I never once lost interest. The subject, as dry as it might have been through other media, was the most griping thing I read that month. (It also didn't hurt that I didn't read much else during January). Best of all, I actually remember what I read. Most attempts leave me bored within the first thirty pages (maybe that's a sign that I shouldn't read nonfiction(?)), but this book both reeled me in, and had my attention captured. So much so that I could recount what I read. Hats off to Wright. Definitely recommend this to really anyone whose interested, even slightly, in this sort of field/topic. "
84,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"Wright is even more witty and current than my other go-to NF writer, Roach, of Stiff and Spook fame. I was interested in learning more about the past plagues and what we need to learn from them. It's so hard to wrap your mind around that many people dying -significant percentages of the population... gone. How did people deal with loss of family friends, neighbors and the accompanying grief. In those days, they had so little idea of what they were dealing with, but as Wright reminds us , it's likely only a matter of time with increased resistance to antibiotics.. Not that this is a totally gloomy read, Wright applauds the heroes, traces the medical learning curve and applies a liberal dose of gallow's humor, that I really appreciated 4 and a half fevered stars."

How she managed to make me laugh hysterically while teaching me important facts about plagues and showing respect for their gruesome history at the same time, I’ll never know. I love books on virology and this one did not disappoint. I have read a lot on the subject and was still surprised by a lot of the little known stories and heroes in the war on plagues throughout the ages. Seriously worth a read.

I was doing good and handling all this scary info well until I got to the Spanish flu chapter. ok, a little scared now. then the chapter on lobotomies. I could have cried and cried. after hearing about all these terrible diseases then to hear about the horrors a man inflicted on others and not always willing people, was so heart breaking. and don't think this book is going to end on a happy note. Lastly, she discusses the AIDS outbreak of the 80's. The things some of our elected officials said and they way they joked about it was truly awful. too bad they didn't have this book back then. Maybe they could have took some inspiration from (now) Saint Damien. "

We ended up listening to it together. We would stop after each chapter and discuss. It was fun. I knew nothing about the Antonine Plague of Rome. I found how widespread syphilis was to be fascinating. The monk that worked on the leper colony, Father Damien, should be a saint. The man who promoted lobotomies, Walter Jackson Freeman II, was a devil and I want to believe that he is paying for it in death. People should vaccinate their children. And seriously bursting frogs to cure the black death. Ugh! There is a lot of humor in this book which I didn’t always love but it wasn’t done disrespectfully.

I thoroughly enjoyed this romp through many of history’s worst plagues. The heroes of which she speaks are not always doctors and scientists, but everyday compassionate people who care about their fellow man. There is also a villain or two. The book also comes with a bit of preaching, which I didn’t mind. There are two major lessons I think she wants us to walk away with.1) Stigmatizing and ostracizing victims of disease is not only mean and wrong, but it hinders our ability to fight the disease. This is because ashamed people hide their condition, leading to increased spreading of the disease, and decreased data for research.2) Vaccinate your kids, for crying out loud!A few quotes for your reading pleasure.“Feel free to start using Walter Jackson Freeman II as an insult directed toward people you hate. Almost no one will get the reference, but if I am in the room we’ll high-five and it will be awesome.” “Although Galen was a great physician, he was not a terribly courageous man. Galen was a self-promotor above anything else. According to McLynn, he consistently claimed to be a self-made man, casually downplaying the fact that he can from an extremely wealthy family and had inherited numerous estates as well as a stellar list of contacts. He employed underhanded tactics to win debates, and he constantly aggrandized his own achievements. Personality-wise, you could think of him as the Donald Trump of Ancient Rome.” “Full disclosure: I would have patented that vaccine and not felt guilty about it for a second. I suspect I would have used the money to do dumb stuff I thought was awesome, like start an F. Scott Fitzgerald theme park. I assume everyone else would also do that. Why doesn’t a theme park devoted to books exist? It would be so much fun.”"
92,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45392105-aleta,5,"Jennifer Wright did an incredible job with this book. Maybe I have a Macabre side to me reading this during our current Pandemic, but it's amazing how we we've repeated mistakes from the past. It was reassuring to be reminded of all the diseases we have eradicated over the Centuries and the people who came together to wage war on sickness."

This was such a fantastic book and one of my favourites on the discussion of plagues to date (I’ve actually read a fair few ..)I love the references to popular culture and current and recent films which brings historical plagues into a 21st century relatability whilst also holding onto the historical nature and telling of the plagues being described. I absolutely adore her writing style in this, it’s down to earth, personable with her funny witty personality that seems to lace her words. It doesn’t detract away from the informative nature or content which is written both scientifically and in such an engaging way it’s a delight to read. It’s also written in a way that’s delicate but also to the point and doesn’t beat around the bush. I loved it! I really recommend a read if this aligns with your interests !"

That is the most important thing you need to know regarding my opinion of this book.MY OTHER OPINIONS1. This was incredibly interesting. I learned more reading this than I did in four years of high school. I was telling all my friends and co-workers about it. 2. This took me forever to read because I didn't want it to end. I would pick it up only as a special treat to myself - like chocolates or a massage. 3. Walter Jackson Freeman II was a total POS. That's not really an opinion. That's a fact. Unless you believe otherwise. In that case, you are also a POS. I want to read a million books by this author. Unfortunately, her supply does not meet my demand currently, so I'll just need to savor what I do have. 5 Stars"
95,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"I'm not sure whether it's something to be proud of or not, but I've always been fascinated by disease and plagues. So when I came across this book, I knew I had to read it. It did not disappoint.I could see how some people would find Wright's casual and almost flippant tone at times to be a little off-putting, but for me, I felt as if we were two women discussing these horrific plagues and diseases over a cup of coffee. And there's just enough lightness to keep the book from being completely and utterly depressing, even if we still have no idea where the Spanish flu came from, and no way to combat it if it ever decided to come out of hibernation. My only consolation is I'm perhaps a bit too old at 38 to be at the greatest risk of dying from the Spanish flu. (Also can we please quit calling stomach bugs the ""flu""? It is not the flu. Influenza, even the non-Spanish version, will knock you on your back for a couple of weeks. If you are up and about the next day or the day after, you do not have the flu. /end rant)This book will also annoy anti-vaxxers to no end, as Wright goes on quite the rant regarding the need for and the safety of vaccines at the end of the chapter on smallpox. I do believe that we're so far removed from these terrible diseases that it's lulled people into a false sense of security, that the diseases every child experienced in the pre-vaccination age weren't really that bad. But when you realize that milkmaids were very proud of the fact that they'd never ""lose their beauty"" (ie, become horribly disfigured) thanks to smallpox, having had cowpox already, you start think, ""Hmm, perhaps smallpox *was* pretty damn bad."" And without vaccines, children would still be paralyzed every summer thanks to contracting polio. That's not exactly a world I'd like to return to.I especially liked that Wright stepped outside the box a bit, and told us about some lesser-known plagues, like the dancing plague and encephalitis lethargica. But the scariest bits were how quickly we forget the terror of losing so many thanks to an extremely contagious disease. I can't even imagine watching bodies pile up in the streets, as they did in Philadelphia just a hundred years ago during the Spanish flu. Yet we need to remember, and begin to plan for an epidemic like this to happen again. It seems as if we're just about due for another outbreak.I highly recommend this book, especially since Wright keeps the terrifying photos to a section at the end of the book that one doesn't have to look at. It's so informative, yet accessible thanks to her chatty prose. I can't wait to read her previous book, It Ended Badly: Thirteen of the Worst Breakups in History. I have a feeling I'll love it just as much, and I truly hope Wright continues to write these fascinating books."
96,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19228026-phyllis,4,"I planned on a four star rating but the more I read, the more I liked it. So I gave it 4.5. I've read several books about epidemics, plagues and am always fascinated by how diseases and their victims are treated. The author has done a tremendous amount of research and also has a sense of humor, just enough to get you through some of the horrible aspects of these epidemics. A quote from the leprosy chapter about Father Damien, the priest who went to live and care for the lepers on the island of Molokai, ""Damien is a reminder that you don't have to be a genius or a brilliant scientist or a doctor to help in this war against disease: you just have to be someone who gives a damn about your fellow man"".  In the chapter on the Spanish Influenza she talks about the president who controlled the press and wouldn't allow anything about this massive, deadly epidemic to appear in any newspaper. We should never allow presidents to control the press. Another excellent book on the Spanish Influenza The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History"
97,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"I finished this one a few days ago and while I found it interesting, the social commentary from the author was a little hit and miss. Jennifer Wright gives us a great overview of some of the worst of the worst plagues and misses the AIDS plague which I was hoping would've provided us some insight. The book is a 3.5 and I liked it enough to keep reading. Some of the humour didn't fit and I'm a huge fan of pop culture but I was a little baffled here. Wright should of left some of the commentary to the later part of the chapters, giving us a brief overview of the cleverness she clearly has. If you don't know too much about plagues like myself and you hear anyone running around with crazy ideas on plagues, shove this book in their hands. It gives you a large amount of information but I just think it didn't flow like it should've. Others clearly think better of it and have pegged this at 5, I just wanted a lot more input from the author. The book needed to be longer but maybe she will deliver a follow-up which will blow our minds. "
98,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen,4,"Wright is a bit of a Mary Roach—funny and voice-y and opinionated, while simultaneously unloading lots of learning about the history of disease. She is firmly on the side of sufferers and the people who’ve tried to help them, and just as firmly condemns anyone who has judged, abandoned, or exploited the sick. From the dancing plague of the sixteenth century to typhoid, cholera, and polio—by way of lobotomies and a brief mention of AIDS—she covers the pestilential waterfront. Taught me stuff and made me smile on my commute. "
99,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Most of the information included in this book was not new, and I can’t even say it was put together in a new way that helped me see the subject matter through a new lens. Despite that, I will probably read any book Jennifer wright authors because I simply love her writing style. Her humor, wit, and strong opinions set a tone early in the book that made old and recycled information feel refreshing."

101,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36933045-rosemary-standeven,5,"This is a surprisingly readable, informative and amusing book – given its subject – and ideally suited to the current worldwide crisis. Some of the plagues I already knew a lot about (Syphilis and Tuberculosis), having written assignments on them for my Herbal Medicine degree (and NO, herbal medicine will NOT cure either of them, I just found the diseases interesting). Others I knew a bit about, but learned so much more. For instance – the so-called Spanish Flu originated in Kansas, USA, but due to WWI media restrictions no-one in USA, Britain etc was allowed to report on it. Spain was neutral, reported the deaths, and so got the blame. The dancing plague in Strasbourg was entirely new to me.There is a lot to be learned from the genesis, spread and treatment of old plagues that can be applied to the current COVID19, and the author does not shy away from scathing comments on doctors and politicians who were more interested in their own affairs than helping the public. There is also repeated (and wholly deserved) condemnation of Anti-vaxxers and people who will not listen to the genuine experts, and believe that they know best, despite overwhelming scientific proof of the idiocy and public danger of their claims. (“Ask the Aztecs and Incas whether or not they would have liked to have vaccines available to them. Oh, wait, you can’t, they’re dead.” One thing that stands out above all others, is the need for courageous, empathetic, intelligent and decisive leadership in the face of plagues – something that is in short supply just now (except in NZ and maybe Germany).Amongst all the death and suffering, there are some heart-warming stories, some real heroes, and some serendipitous good fortune. The book is ultimately about the resilience of the human spirit, and about how we can get through plagues, bad medicine and the current crisis, if we would just learn from past errors.Some quotes I liked:Dancing plague: “is lovely to see that all the edicts related to helping the suffering people. The community did not want their fellow neighbors to die and were experimenting on many fronts to help the afflicted. Today we still have outbreaks where we become so fearful for ourselves that we forget all about our neighbors. The people of Strasbourg were ahead of their time in their regard for one another. … there is never a situation where care and attentiveness by the community is a bad thing.”Cholera:  “He became such a firm convert to Snow’s theory that until his death Whitehead kept over his desk a portrait of Snow, which, he noted, “ever serves to remind me that in any profession the highest order of work is achieved not by fussy demand for ‘something to be done,’ but by patient study of the eternal laws.””“The best-case scenario when it comes to the outbreak of a disease is that the community will rally around the afflicted. It will tend to them gently; it will raise funds; it will do whatever is necessary to allow the people stricken with the disease to live with dignity while science searches for a cure.” Spanish ‘flu’:  “In spite of our First World desire to believe that diseases are fundamentally exotic imports, the first case of the Spanish flu epidemic was reported to the weekly journal Public Health Reports by Dr. Loring Miner of Haskell, Kansas, in March 1918.” “This might be a good time to mention that if you learn about an airborne virus that seems to be killing otherwise healthy young people in your area from a reputable medical journal, you are reading very bad news. Go to the grocery store and start stocking up on supplies immediately. If you have someplace relatively isolated to live, go there. Doing so might feel a bit silly or paranoid, but, honestly, neither of those responses would be overreactions.”“We are fortunate today to have organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization that track how diseases are progressing and report these findings. In the event of an outbreak similar to the Spanish flu, they will be wonderful resources.” – WHICH NEED FUNDING NOT CUTS!!!Lobotomies: “Part of the blame lies with a midcentury zeal for conformity. People were willing to sacrifice whole personalities to make those who seemed different and unusual more like everyone else. Some who turned to lobotomies desperately yearned for a cure for their ailments; others were suffering from nothing more than human frailty.”Polio: “Our main problem now,” said Thomas Rivers, a leader in viral research who oversaw the clinical trials of Salk’s vaccine in 1956, “is not that anything is wrong with the Salk vaccine, but that something is wrong with the people who won’t take it.”"
102,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2323418-abbey,4,"4.5 stars - it is so weird to say a book about diseases was a fun read. Wright uses such great humor through devastating parts of history in a way that’s respectful of the trauma. I’d heard of most of these plagues, but I knew zero details. This was fascinating and an easy way to get that information. It reminds me in some ways of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks in that it reminds us the importance of science while keeping the humanity in mind.Also, PLEASE VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN"
103,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23727760-daniel-kibblesmith,5,"Another funny, insightful history book from Jennifer Wright.As in her previous, ""It Ended Badly: 13 Of The Worst Break-Ups In History,"" Wright's blend of thorough research and humorous modern voice makes history instantly accessible and relatable — devoting each roughly commute-length chapter into a different vignette about a world-changing plague.Who knew that Father Damien was basically the greatest human being who ever lived, and Woodrow Wilson was the worst? Or that people ""cured"" the bubonic plague with exploding frogs? Also, one word: Lobotomobile.Stories you might have some familiarity with come to life in a deeper way with modern hindsight and funny (or frightening) modern relevance. Perfect for history buffs, people looking for some historical perspective after the election, and the hypochondriac in all of us."
104,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14174872-lea,4,"A fun and easy-to-read book on some particularly nasty diseases, the people who suffered them and the people who helped cure/treat them.I was familiar with most of the history in the book, but had fun with the author's casual writing style. I still learned a fair amount though, and for all her jokes, it's clear that the book is very well researched and that she is passionate about her subject, which I really appreciated. However, if you're looking for a serious academic treatise on diseases, this isn't it.The only chapter I felt was out of place was the one on lobotomies. Yes, they are awful and terrifying, but not a disease."

107,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2763722-whiskeyinthejar,3,"I read this for the Doomsday square for Halloween Bingo.Previous Updates:Antonine PlagueBubonic PlagueDancing PlagueSmall PoxSyphilis, Tuberculosis, and CholeraLeprosy, Typhoid, and Spanish FluEncephalitis Lethargica
There is still no cure for EL, and its rise and subsequent disappearance is still regarded as something of a mystery.
I have heard of this before but only in the obscure and morbidly fascinating sense, think more horror movie than documentary. The unknown-ness of this one draws me and repels me away. Reading about how it affected people's personalities, bodily functions, and sent them into comas is frightening. 
If you are interested in following a line of thought on interrelated diseases, though, some scientists today think that EL is related to streptococcal bacteria, so that’s a fun thing to consider when you get strep throat.
I have never heard and this and can I just say WHAT?!? Reading about how adult's showed after effects of Postencephalitic Parkinson’s disease which led them to L-dopa as a cure and how it initially worked, the woman waking up from a coma years later and thinking it was early 1940s when it was late 1960s, was wild. I think this ""plague"" was added to just scare the crap out of everyone as there is still no known cure but I guess it hasn't made any more appearances? This is one I'm going to have to investigate further because how freaking wild that it seems to suddenly appear in 1916 and disappear in 1920s. I guess I'd put my bet on Aliens.Lobotomies
Somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of lobotomies were performed on women, despite a greater percentage of men being institutionalized.
This probably shouldn't have been included in a plague book but it is important to discuss, so I'll allow it. I'm against lobotomies, so I had no problem how the author discussed Freeman, the physician behind the start, procedure, and craze of them. The accounts of how he went about them, snipping here and there, until he got the desired amount of not quite comatose in patients, is horrifying and rage inducing. 
A charismatic demagogue was elevated and trusted because he was captivating and because researching facts, as well as listening to dull doctors who have done their homework, is hard and time-consuming.
This quote, I can't tell you how much I feel this quote down into my soul right now. Reading about how women who were listed as menopausal or hysterical, by doctors that didn't even converse with them but rather their husbands and given over to Freeman for lobotomies had me fighting tears. This chapter was all about making sure there are committees, watchdogs, or the like in place to stop charismatic, mad medical field individuals from dazzling people with their ""science"".Polio 
Well, herd immunity works for most diseases only if about 80 to 90 percent of the population is vaccinated. With some diseases, like measles, a 95 percent vaccination rate is necessary.
Again, vaccinate your kids. I have to say, I'm not sure I knew Polio came from contaminated water or food, kind of like typhoid. That is how well we eradicated it, I didn't even know what caused it! The author talked about live virus and killer virus vaccines and the rivalry between Salk and Sabin to get there. I've heard of Salk before because of how he used unwittingly mental health patients for clinical trials, which the author mentioned but after saying he should be considered close to a saint. I'm not quite there on him but I'm a grey shades person and as long as you mention the shitty aspects I don't have a problem stating all the good he also did. Seems wild in today's atmosphere of people dying because the price of their insulin is too much money that he didn't patent his vaccine but I'd like to read more on the legalities of if and how he could have. My favorite part of this section was the focus on how representation matters and how FDR gave hope and pride to fellow Polio survivors. 
Those who had AIDS survived because they, like Mr. Crumpton’s No Nose’d Club for syphilitics, founded groups like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP to fight for their right to live. They supported one another. They protested. They yelled. They made people extremely uncomfortable.
I'm not a scientist or in the medical field, so there was definitely new information for me to gain from reading this. I went in thinking this was going to be a drier, informative read but realized very early on that my expectations needed to be changed. This is more of a coffee table book where casual readers can just pick it up and learn some interesting facts that will either make them popular on trivia night or send them down a drier text reading rabbit hole. The author has a sarcastic, pop culture heavy tone that could turn some people off as we discussing real horrible deaths but I'm a bit of a gallows humor gal myself, so except for a couple times, I wasn't put off or offended. I do think the pop culture references are going to date this and age it out of future circulation. All in all, I learned some facts, was intrigued to research some, and enjoyed this more surface look into diseases. This book is not for experts in the field but the average person could definitely get something out of it. However, if you're an anti-vaxxer, you'd probably get huffy over the author's constant reminder that you should probably reevaluate your thinking (I completely agree with her)."
108,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"Putting a hilarious spin on history in all the right places, Jennifer Wright will crack you up while telling you all about some of the worst plagues that have been documented. If you’re someone who hears about diseases or ailments and immediately think that you have them, this book might not be for you. However, if you’re someone who likes to read about history and are interested in learning about some of the most notable disease outbreaks, this is the book for you.When I picked up this book, I was not expecting to laugh as much as I did. Don’t get me wrong; the subject matter is serious, but Jennifer has a sense of humor that translates well even in nonfiction. Every time she inserts a photo, the caption has me rolling. At one point, there’s an illustration showing two people being treated for the Bubonic Plague. Her caption reads:“These guys were lucky—they had pillows and an in-home wizard.”There was never a funny moment that was horribly misplaced. There are chapters where the author is not funny because there just isn’t a time for it. However, other chapters let her personality shine through in sections and I was cracking up. It’s not a book that has a monotone voice like some nonfiction novels have.I learned a lot throughout the chapters. I had heard of majority of the diseases and had some knowledge about them, but the only one I really knew a lot about was the travesty that was lobotomies. This is the one chapter that’s not an actual disease but rather a horrific catch-all treatment that did a lot of harm to the people who were operated on. There’s a lot of interesting information throughout the chapters including some interesting cases and notable names, treatment attempts, and cases.This is an excellent book that’s perfect for anyone’s collection in addition to making a great gift for those interested in historical overviews."
109,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,5,Informative and fun in equal measure.
110,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6367659-poligirlreads,5,"Given that I can develop a disease based on the power of suggestion alone (""Doc, I've been watching the news on prostate cancer, and now I think think there's something wrong with my prostate."" ""You're a chick. You don't have a prostate."" ""That's precisely what makes this situation all the more dire.""), I probably should've taken a hard pass on this book. But given my love of Wright's previous book, It Ended Badly, I knew I needed to read this one. As a result, I now want to hunker down in basement and wear a gas mask 24/7 to ward off any potential plagues, but despite that, this is a most excellent read.You know how people talk about how in order to understand the present, you have to look toward the past? Boy is this the perfect book within the context of the anti-vaxxers. History is always trying out ""natural"" cures like rubbing the body down in onions and whatnot, and amazingly, it's only actual science that seems to provide the actual solutions. It's a weird and strange transition from seeing people line up for polio vaccines in the '50s to abject suspicion in the 21st century to such dangerous quackery like, you know, measles vaccinations. Wright details how these phenomenons occur: once something is eradicated, we no longer see their horrifying effects, and once a disease is eradicated, we promptly forget about it, and the lessons we learned from it. That is both troubling and decidedly human.Also human? The tales she tells of the heroes: Aurelius, Father Damien, Salk. People who get their business together, and go about trying to save lives and give people comfort. Heck, it gave me comfort just knowing that these people existed.Wright has a delightful writing style, both parts humorous and informative. She managed to make me laugh while I cringed at humanity's general responses to plagues. I get her reasoning for not devoting a full chapter to AIDS, but I still think it should've been done. Tracing what happened once folks realized that the ""gay disease"" was actually a people disease, would have been interesting. And I also would've liked to see some love for SARS. It had all of the hallmarks that Wright would've loved: the public's response, the race-baiting (""blame the Asians!""), the effects of globalization on its spread, the political response...sigh. Oh well. The good thing about plagues (I never thought I'd write that line) is that there's always more to come. Here's looking forward to Get Well Soon, Vol. 2.And to Wright? Thank you, THANK YOU for keeping the horrific pictures of diseased folks in the back of the book. Had they been included throughout, I probably would've been so traumatized that I would've developed the Dancing Plague."
111,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16214729-margaret,2,"The author of this book desperately wanted to make this subject ""cool"" without taking into account the fact that people who pick up a book about plagues are probably going to be annoyed by that. The author inserts a lot of herself into the telling about these plagues, using a lot of ""I"" sentences (as another reviewer noted). I know this isn't fiction, but she also CONSTANTLY breaks the ""fourth wall"" by addressing her readers directly, e.g. ""If you managed to get through the Spanish Flu chapter and were only modestly terrified, well you're a strange human being, but settle in and prepare to have your socks scared off."" BARF. The writing is quite juvenile. Why was it necessary to mention Goodreads while discussing bad reviews given to a medical paper? Why did she need to mention Kim Kardashian in a discussion about the media coverage of the Spanish Flu during WWI? The style is just grating. I felt very patronized, as if the author feels like her readers are too vapid to be interested in medical nonfiction without adding in bits of pop culture that will make this book age VERY badly. I think the last straw for me on that point was when she threw in a reference to 50 Shades of Grey. NO. JUST NO. I gave it 2 stars overall because in between the ""look how cool I'm making this subject!"" fluff, she actually presents interesting and accurate information about each plague - I've read many of the books and authors she references (John Kelly and John Barry)."
112,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith,3,"Audiobook. Although not quite as entertaining as Charles Panati’s book “Extraordinary Endings of Everything and Everybody” (as I recall its title), this is an informative book on the history of several infectious diseases, like plague, leprosy, typhoid, cholera, Spanish flu, etc. There is also a chapter on lobotomy, not a disease, but included to fit the author’s main theme, which is that society is full of monsters. There’s a lot of monstrosity in this book. The sick have always been treated with revulsion and righteousness, which is not laudable but is understandable when you realize that for most of human existence, life was a pretty hard struggle and we are hard-wired to fear disease and to protect the healthy by leaving the weak behind - which often means dehumanizing them. The author makes the valid point that our modern, enlightened society should move beyond these attitudes, although they do still often crop up, even among those who should be aware of the errors of the past and setting an example of more compassionate thought today.It’s definitely a history book. You won’t come away from it with any deep understandings of the mechanism or treatment of infection, but it does provide some interesting facts about how the various epidemics arose and the societal atmosphere surrounding them. It makes the point that advances such as improved sanitation, antiseptics, antibiotics and immunization should also include basic human compassion for the afflicted."
113,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39353094-diabolica,5,"I have never enjoyed reading the intro and epilogue of a book more. Straight up, this is possibly the only book that has managed to rein me in, in what is generally the most boring and (what I think) the most frivolous section of the novel. I loved the writing style, both informative and hilarious. Any secondary sources she used were weaved inside her novel, so that they flowed with the text. And the annotations weren't just there for the sake of being there. Despite reading this over the span of a month, I never once lost interest. The subject, as dry as it might have been through other media, was the most griping thing I read that month. (It also didn't hurt that I didn't read much else during January). Best of all, I actually remember what I read. Most attempts leave me bored within the first thirty pages (maybe that's a sign that I shouldn't read nonfiction(?)), but this book both reeled me in, and had my attention captured. So much so that I could recount what I read. Hats off to Wright. Definitely recommend this to really anyone whose interested, even slightly, in this sort of field/topic. "
114,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"Wright is even more witty and current than my other go-to NF writer, Roach, of Stiff and Spook fame. I was interested in learning more about the past plagues and what we need to learn from them. It's so hard to wrap your mind around that many people dying -significant percentages of the population... gone. How did people deal with loss of family friends, neighbors and the accompanying grief. In those days, they had so little idea of what they were dealing with, but as Wright reminds us , it's likely only a matter of time with increased resistance to antibiotics.. Not that this is a totally gloomy read, Wright applauds the heroes, traces the medical learning curve and applies a liberal dose of gallow's humor, that I really appreciated 4 and a half fevered stars."

How she managed to make me laugh hysterically while teaching me important facts about plagues and showing respect for their gruesome history at the same time, I’ll never know. I love books on virology and this one did not disappoint. I have read a lot on the subject and was still surprised by a lot of the little known stories and heroes in the war on plagues throughout the ages. Seriously worth a read.

I was doing good and handling all this scary info well until I got to the Spanish flu chapter. ok, a little scared now. then the chapter on lobotomies. I could have cried and cried. after hearing about all these terrible diseases then to hear about the horrors a man inflicted on others and not always willing people, was so heart breaking. and don't think this book is going to end on a happy note. Lastly, she discusses the AIDS outbreak of the 80's. The things some of our elected officials said and they way they joked about it was truly awful. too bad they didn't have this book back then. Maybe they could have took some inspiration from (now) Saint Damien. "

We ended up listening to it together. We would stop after each chapter and discuss. It was fun. I knew nothing about the Antonine Plague of Rome. I found how widespread syphilis was to be fascinating. The monk that worked on the leper colony, Father Damien, should be a saint. The man who promoted lobotomies, Walter Jackson Freeman II, was a devil and I want to believe that he is paying for it in death. People should vaccinate their children.

I thoroughly enjoyed this romp through many of history’s worst plagues. The heroes of which she speaks are not always doctors and scientists, but everyday compassionate people who care about their fellow man. There is also a villain or two. The book also comes with a bit of preaching, which I didn’t mind. There are two major lessons I think she wants us to walk away with.1) Stigmatizing and ostracizing victims of disease is not only mean and wrong, but it hinders our ability to fight the disease. This is because ashamed people hide their condition, leading to increased spreading of the disease, and decreased data for research.2) Vaccinate your kids, for crying out loud!A few quotes for your reading pleasure.“Feel free to start using Walter Jackson Freeman II as an insult directed toward people you hate. Almost no one will get the reference, but if I am in the room we’ll high-five and it will be awesome.” “Although Galen was a great physician, he was not a terribly courageous man. Galen was a self-promotor above anything else. According to McLynn, he consistently claimed to be a self-made man, casually downplaying the fact that he can from an extremely wealthy family and had inherited numerous estates as well as a stellar list of contacts. He employed underhanded tactics to win debates, and he constantly aggrandized his own achievements. Personality-wise, you could think of him as the Donald Trump of Ancient Rome.” “Full disclosure: I would have patented that vaccine and not felt guilty about it for a second. I suspect I would have used the money to do dumb stuff I thought was awesome, like start an F. Scott Fitzgerald theme park. I assume everyone else would also do that. Why doesn’t a theme park devoted to books exist? It would be so much fun.”"
122,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45392105-aleta,5,"Jennifer Wright did an incredible job with this book. Maybe I have a Macabre side to me reading this during our current Pandemic, but it's amazing how we we've repeated mistakes from the past.

This was such a fantastic book and one of my favourites on the discussion of plagues to date (I’ve actually read a fair few ..)I love the references to popular culture and current and recent films which brings historical plagues into a 21st century relatability whilst also holding onto the historical nature and telling of the plagues being described. I absolutely adore her writing style in this, it’s down to earth, personable with her funny witty personality that seems to lace her words. It doesn’t detract away from the informative nature or content which is written both scientifically and in such an engaging way it’s a delight to read. It’s also written in a way that’s delicate but also to the point and doesn’t beat around the bush. I loved it! I really recommend a read if this aligns with your interests !"

I learned more reading this than I did in four years of high school. I was telling all my friends and co-workers about it. 2. This took me forever to read because I didn't want it to end. I would pick it up only as a special treat to myself - like chocolates or a massage. 3. Walter Jackson Freeman II was a total POS. That's not really an opinion. That's a fact. Unless you believe otherwise. In that case, you are also a POS. I want to read a million books by this author. Unfortunately, her supply does not meet my demand currently, so I'll just need to savor what I do have. 5 Stars"
125,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"I'm not sure whether it's something to be proud of or not, but I've always been fascinated by disease and plagues. So when I came across this book, I knew I had to read it. It did not disappoint.I could see how some people would find Wright's casual and almost flippant tone at times to be a little off-putting, but for me, I felt as if we were two women discussing these horrific plagues and diseases over a cup of coffee. And there's just enough lightness to keep the book from being completely and utterly depressing, even if we still have no idea where the Spanish flu came from, and no way to combat it if it ever decided to come out of hibernation. My only consolation is I'm perhaps a bit too old at 38 to be at the greatest risk of dying from the Spanish flu. (Also can we please quit calling stomach bugs the ""flu""? It is not the flu. Influenza, even the non-Spanish version, will knock you on your back for a couple of weeks. If you are up and about the next day or the day after, you do not have the flu. /end rant)This book will also annoy anti-vaxxers to no end, as Wright goes on quite the rant regarding the need for and the safety of vaccines at the end of the chapter on smallpox. I do believe that we're so far removed from these terrible diseases that it's lulled people into a false sense of security, that the diseases every child experienced in the pre-vaccination age weren't really that bad. But when you realize that milkmaids were very proud of the fact that they'd never ""lose their beauty"" (ie, become horribly disfigured) thanks to smallpox, having had cowpox already, you start think, ""Hmm, perhaps smallpox *was* pretty damn bad."" And without vaccines, children would still be paralyzed every summer thanks to contracting polio. That's not exactly a world I'd like to return to.I especially liked that Wright stepped outside the box a bit, and told us about some lesser-known plagues, like the dancing plague and encephalitis lethargica. But the scariest bits were how quickly we forget the terror of losing so many thanks to an extremely contagious disease. I can't even imagine watching bodies pile up in the streets, as they did in Philadelphia just a hundred years ago during the Spanish flu. Yet we need to remember, and begin to plan for an epidemic like this to happen again. It seems as if we're just about due for another outbreak.I highly recommend this book, especially since Wright keeps the terrifying photos to a section at the end of the book that one doesn't have to look at. It's so informative, yet accessible thanks to her chatty prose. I can't wait to read her previous book, It Ended Badly: Thirteen of the Worst Breakups in History. I have a feeling I'll love it just as much, and I truly hope Wright continues to write these fascinating books."
126,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19228026-phyllis,4,"I planned on a four star rating but the more I read, the more I liked it. So I gave it 4.5. I've read several books about epidemics, plagues and am always fascinated by how diseases and their victims are treated. The author has done a tremendous amount of research and also has a sense of humor, just enough to get you through some of the horrible aspects of these epidemics. A quote from the leprosy chapter about Father Damien, the priest who went to live and care for the lepers on the island of Molokai, ""Damien is a reminder that you don't have to be a genius or a brilliant scientist or a doctor to help in this war against disease: you just have to be someone who gives a damn about your fellow man"".  In the chapter on the Spanish Influenza she talks about the president who controlled the press and wouldn't allow anything about this massive, deadly epidemic to appear in any newspaper. We should never allow presidents to control the press. Another excellent book on the Spanish Influenza The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History"
127,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"I finished this one a few days ago and while I found it interesting, the social commentary from the author was a little hit and miss. Jennifer Wright gives us a great overview of some of the worst of the worst plagues and misses the AIDS plague which I was hoping would've provided us some insight. The book is a 3.5 and I liked it enough to keep reading. Some of the humour didn't fit and I'm a huge fan of pop culture but I was a little baffled here. Wright should of left some of the commentary to the later part of the chapters, giving us a brief overview of the cleverness she clearly has. If you don't know too much about plagues like myself and you hear anyone running around with crazy ideas on plagues, shove this book in their hands. It gives you a large amount of information but I just think it didn't flow like it should've. Others clearly think better of it and have pegged this at 5, I just wanted a lot more input from the author. The book needed to be longer but maybe she will deliver a follow-up which will blow our minds. "
128,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen,4,"Wright is a bit of a Mary Roach—funny and voice-y and opinionated, while simultaneously unloading lots of learning about the history of disease. She is firmly on the side of sufferers and the people who’ve tried to help them, and just as firmly condemns anyone who has judged, abandoned, or exploited the sick. From the dancing plague of the sixteenth century to typhoid, cholera, and polio—by way of lobotomies and a brief mention of AIDS—she covers the pestilential waterfront. Taught me stuff and made me smile on my commute. "
129,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Most of the information included in this book was not new, and I can’t even say it was put together in a new way that helped me see the subject matter through a new lens. Despite that, I will probably read any book Jennifer wright authors because I simply love her writing style. Her humor, wit, and strong opinions set a tone early in the book that made old and recycled information feel refreshing."

131,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36933045-rosemary-standeven,5,"This is a surprisingly readable, informative and amusing book – given its subject – and ideally suited to the current worldwide crisis. Some of the plagues I already knew a lot about (Syphilis and Tuberculosis), having written assignments on them for my Herbal Medicine degree (and NO, herbal medicine will NOT cure either of them, I just found the diseases interesting). Others I knew a bit about, but learned so much more. For instance – the so-called Spanish Flu originated in Kansas, USA, but due to WWI media restrictions no-one in USA, Britain etc was allowed to report on it. Spain was neutral, reported the deaths, and so got the blame. The dancing plague in Strasbourg was entirely new to me.There is a lot to be learned from the genesis, spread and treatment of old plagues that can be applied to the current COVID19, and the author does not shy away from scathing comments on doctors and politicians who were more interested in their own affairs than helping the public. There is also repeated (and wholly deserved) condemnation of Anti-vaxxers and people who will not listen to the genuine experts, and believe that they know best, despite overwhelming scientific proof of the idiocy and public danger of their claims. (“Ask the Aztecs and Incas whether or not they would have liked to have vaccines available to them. Oh, wait, you can’t, they’re dead.” One thing that stands out above all others, is the need for courageous, empathetic, intelligent and decisive leadership in the face of plagues – something that is in short supply just now (except in NZ and maybe Germany).Amongst all the death and suffering, there are some heart-warming stories, some real heroes, and some serendipitous good fortune. The book is ultimately about the resilience of the human spirit, and about how we can get through plagues, bad medicine and the current crisis, if we would just learn from past errors.Some quotes I liked:Dancing plague: “is lovely to see that all the edicts related to helping the suffering people. The community did not want their fellow neighbors to die and were experimenting on many fronts to help the afflicted. Today we still have outbreaks where we become so fearful for ourselves that we forget all about our neighbors. The people of Strasbourg were ahead of their time in their regard for one another. … there is never a situation where care and attentiveness by the community is a bad thing.”Cholera:  “He became such a firm convert to Snow’s theory that until his death Whitehead kept over his desk a portrait of Snow, which, he noted, “ever serves to remind me that in any profession the highest order of work is achieved not by fussy demand for ‘something to be done,’ but by patient study of the eternal laws.””“The best-case scenario when it comes to the outbreak of a disease is that the community will rally around the afflicted. It will tend to them gently; it will raise funds; it will do whatever is necessary to allow the people stricken with the disease to live with dignity while science searches for a cure.” Spanish ‘flu’:  “In spite of our First World desire to believe that diseases are fundamentally exotic imports, the first case of the Spanish flu epidemic was reported to the weekly journal Public Health Reports by Dr. Loring Miner of Haskell, Kansas, in March 1918.” “This might be a good time to mention that if you learn about an airborne virus that seems to be killing otherwise healthy young people in your area from a reputable medical journal, you are reading very bad news. Go to the grocery store and start stocking up on supplies immediately. If you have someplace relatively isolated to live, go there. Doing so might feel a bit silly or paranoid, but, honestly, neither of those responses would be overreactions.”“We are fortunate today to have organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization that track how diseases are progressing and report these findings. In the event of an outbreak similar to the Spanish flu, they will be wonderful resources.” – WHICH NEED FUNDING NOT CUTS!!!Lobotomies: “Part of the blame lies with a midcentury zeal for conformity. People were willing to sacrifice whole personalities to make those who seemed different and unusual more like everyone else. Some who turned to lobotomies desperately yearned for a cure for their ailments; others were suffering from nothing more than human frailty.”Polio: “Our main problem now,” said Thomas Rivers, a leader in viral research who oversaw the clinical trials of Salk’s vaccine in 1956, “is not that anything is wrong with the Salk vaccine, but that something is wrong with the people who won’t take it.”"
132,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2323418-abbey,4,"4.5 stars - it is so weird to say a book about diseases was a fun read. Wright uses such great humor through devastating parts of history in a way that’s respectful of the trauma. I’d heard of most of these plagues, but I knew zero details. This was fascinating and an easy way to get that information. It reminds me in some ways of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks in that it reminds us the importance of science while keeping the humanity in mind.Also, PLEASE VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN"
133,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23727760-daniel-kibblesmith,5,"Another funny, insightful history book from Jennifer Wright.As in her previous, ""It Ended Badly: 13 Of The Worst Break-Ups In History,"" Wright's blend of thorough research and humorous modern voice makes history instantly accessible and relatable — devoting each roughly commute-length chapter into a different vignette about a world-changing plague.Who knew that Father Damien was basically the greatest human being who ever lived, and Woodrow Wilson was the worst? Or that people ""cured"" the bubonic plague with exploding frogs? Also, one word: Lobotomobile.Stories you might have some familiarity with come to life in a deeper way with modern hindsight and funny (or frightening) modern relevance. Perfect for history buffs, people looking for some historical perspective after the election, and the hypochondriac in all of us."
134,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14174872-lea,4,"A fun and easy-to-read book on some particularly nasty diseases, the people who suffered them and the people who helped cure/treat them.I was familiar with most of the history in the book, but had fun with the author's casual writing style. I still learned a fair amount though, and for all her jokes, it's clear that the book is very well researched and that she is passionate about her subject, which I really appreciated. However, if you're looking for a serious academic treatise on diseases, this isn't it.The only chapter I felt was out of place was the one on lobotomies. Yes, they are awful and terrifying, but not a disease."

137,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2763722-whiskeyinthejar,3,"I read this for the Doomsday square for Halloween Bingo.Previous Updates:Antonine PlagueBubonic PlagueDancing PlagueSmall PoxSyphilis, Tuberculosis, and CholeraLeprosy, Typhoid, and Spanish FluEncephalitis Lethargica
There is still no cure for EL, and its rise and subsequent disappearance is still regarded as something of a mystery.
I have heard of this before but only in the obscure and morbidly fascinating sense, think more horror movie than documentary. The unknown-ness of this one draws me and repels me away. Reading about how it affected people's personalities, bodily functions, and sent them into comas is frightening. 
If you are interested in following a line of thought on interrelated diseases, though, some scientists today think that EL is related to streptococcal bacteria, so that’s a fun thing to consider when you get strep throat.
I have never heard and this and can I just say WHAT?!? Reading about how adult's showed after effects of Postencephalitic Parkinson’s disease which led them to L-dopa as a cure and how it initially worked, the woman waking up from a coma years later and thinking it was early 1940s when it was late 1960s, was wild. I think this ""plague"" was added to just scare the crap out of everyone as there is still no known cure but I guess it hasn't made any more appearances? This is one I'm going to have to investigate further because how freaking wild that it seems to suddenly appear in 1916 and disappear in 1920s. I guess I'd put my bet on Aliens.Lobotomies
Somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of lobotomies were performed on women, despite a greater percentage of men being institutionalized.
This probably shouldn't have been included in a plague book but it is important to discuss, so I'll allow it. I'm against lobotomies, so I had no problem how the author discussed Freeman, the physician behind the start, procedure, and craze of them. The accounts of how he went about them, snipping here and there, until he got the desired amount of not quite comatose in patients, is horrifying and rage inducing. 
A charismatic demagogue was elevated and trusted because he was captivating and because researching facts, as well as listening to dull doctors who have done their homework, is hard and time-consuming.
This quote, I can't tell you how much I feel this quote down into my soul right now. Reading about how women who were listed as menopausal or hysterical, by doctors that didn't even converse with them but rather their husbands and given over to Freeman for lobotomies had me fighting tears. This chapter was all about making sure there are committees, watchdogs, or the like in place to stop charismatic, mad medical field individuals from dazzling people with their ""science"".Polio 
Well, herd immunity works for most diseases only if about 80 to 90 percent of the population is vaccinated. With some diseases, like measles, a 95 percent vaccination rate is necessary.
Again, vaccinate your kids. I have to say, I'm not sure I knew Polio came from contaminated water or food, kind of like typhoid. That is how well we eradicated it, I didn't even know what caused it! The author talked about live virus and killer virus vaccines and the rivalry between Salk and Sabin to get there. I've heard of Salk before because of how he used unwittingly mental health patients for clinical trials, which the author mentioned but after saying he should be considered close to a saint. I'm not quite there on him but I'm a grey shades person and as long as you mention the shitty aspects I don't have a problem stating all the good he also did. Seems wild in today's atmosphere of people dying because the price of their insulin is too much money that he didn't patent his vaccine but I'd like to read more on the legalities of if and how he could have. My favorite part of this section was the focus on how representation matters and how FDR gave hope and pride to fellow Polio survivors. 
Those who had AIDS survived because they, like Mr. Crumpton’s No Nose’d Club for syphilitics, founded groups like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP to fight for their right to live. They supported one another. They protested. They yelled. They made people extremely uncomfortable.
I'm not a scientist or in the medical field, so there was definitely new information for me to gain from reading this. I went in thinking this was going to be a drier, informative read but realized very early on that my expectations needed to be changed. This is more of a coffee table book where casual readers can just pick it up and learn some interesting facts that will either make them popular on trivia night or send them down a drier text reading rabbit hole. The author has a sarcastic, pop culture heavy tone that could turn some people off as we discussing real horrible deaths but I'm a bit of a gallows humor gal myself, so except for a couple times, I wasn't put off or offended. I do think the pop culture references are going to date this and age it out of future circulation. All in all, I learned some facts, was intrigued to research some, and enjoyed this more surface look into diseases. This book is not for experts in the field but the average person could definitely get something out of it. However, if you're an anti-vaxxer, you'd probably get huffy over the author's constant reminder that you should probably reevaluate your thinking (I completely agree with her)."
138,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"Putting a hilarious spin on history in all the right places, Jennifer Wright will crack you up while telling you all about some of the worst plagues that have been documented. If you’re someone who hears about diseases or ailments and immediately think that you have them, this book might not be for you. However, if you’re someone who likes to read about history and are interested in learning about some of the most notable disease outbreaks, this is the book for you.When I picked up this book, I was not expecting to laugh as much as I did. Don’t get me wrong; the subject matter is serious, but Jennifer has a sense of humor that translates well even in nonfiction. Every time she inserts a photo, the caption has me rolling. At one point, there’s an illustration showing two people being treated for the Bubonic Plague. Her caption reads:“These guys were lucky—they had pillows and an in-home wizard.”There was never a funny moment that was horribly misplaced. There are chapters where the author is not funny because there just isn’t a time for it. However, other chapters let her personality shine through in sections and I was cracking up. It’s not a book that has a monotone voice like some nonfiction novels have.I learned a lot throughout the chapters. I had heard of majority of the diseases and had some knowledge about them, but the only one I really knew a lot about was the travesty that was lobotomies. This is the one chapter that’s not an actual disease but rather a horrific catch-all treatment that did a lot of harm to the people who were operated on. There’s a lot of interesting information throughout the chapters including some interesting cases and notable names, treatment attempts, and cases.This is an excellent book that’s perfect for anyone’s collection in addition to making a great gift for those interested in historical overviews."
139,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,5,Informative and fun in equal measure.
140,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6367659-poligirlreads,5,"Given that I can develop a disease based on the power of suggestion alone (""Doc, I've been watching the news on prostate cancer, and now I think think there's something wrong with my prostate."" ""You're a chick. You don't have a prostate."" ""That's precisely what makes this situation all the more dire.""), I probably should've taken a hard pass on this book. But given my love of Wright's previous book, It Ended Badly, I knew I needed to read this one. As a result, I now want to hunker down in basement and wear a gas mask 24/7 to ward off any potential plagues, but despite that, this is a most excellent read.You know how people talk about how in order to understand the present, you have to look toward the past? Boy is this the perfect book within the context of the anti-vaxxers. History is always trying out ""natural"" cures like rubbing the body down in onions and whatnot, and amazingly, it's only actual science that seems to provide the actual solutions. It's a weird and strange transition from seeing people line up for polio vaccines in the '50s to abject suspicion in the 21st century to such dangerous quackery like, you know, measles vaccinations. Wright details how these phenomenons occur: once something is eradicated, we no longer see their horrifying effects, and once a disease is eradicated, we promptly forget about it, and the lessons we learned from it. That is both troubling and decidedly human.Also human? The tales she tells of the heroes: Aurelius, Father Damien, Salk. People who get their business together, and go about trying to save lives and give people comfort. Heck, it gave me comfort just knowing that these people existed.Wright has a delightful writing style, both parts humorous and informative. She managed to make me laugh while I cringed at humanity's general responses to plagues. I get her reasoning for not devoting a full chapter to AIDS, but I still think it should've been done. Tracing what happened once folks realized that the ""gay disease"" was actually a people disease, would have been interesting. And I also would've liked to see some love for SARS. It had all of the hallmarks that Wright would've loved: the public's response, the race-baiting (""blame the Asians!""), the effects of globalization on its spread, the political response...sigh. Oh well. The good thing about plagues (I never thought I'd write that line) is that there's always more to come. Here's looking forward to Get Well Soon, Vol. 2.And to Wright? Thank you, THANK YOU for keeping the horrific pictures of diseased folks in the back of the book. Had they been included throughout, I probably would've been so traumatized that I would've developed the Dancing Plague."
141,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16214729-margaret,2,"The author of this book desperately wanted to make this subject ""cool"" without taking into account the fact that people who pick up a book about plagues are probably going to be annoyed by that. The author inserts a lot of herself into the telling about these plagues, using a lot of ""I"" sentences (as another reviewer noted). I know this isn't fiction, but she also CONSTANTLY breaks the ""fourth wall"" by addressing her readers directly, e.g. ""If you managed to get through the Spanish Flu chapter and were only modestly terrified, well you're a strange human being, but settle in and prepare to have your socks scared off."" BARF. The writing is quite juvenile. Why was it necessary to mention Goodreads while discussing bad reviews given to a medical paper? Why did she need to mention Kim Kardashian in a discussion about the media coverage of the Spanish Flu during WWI? The style is just grating. I felt very patronized, as if the author feels like her readers are too vapid to be interested in medical nonfiction without adding in bits of pop culture that will make this book age VERY badly. I think the last straw for me on that point was when she threw in a reference to 50 Shades of Grey. NO. JUST NO. I gave it 2 stars overall because in between the ""look how cool I'm making this subject!"" fluff, she actually presents interesting and accurate information about each plague - I've read many of the books and authors she references (John Kelly and John Barry)."
142,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith,3,"Audiobook. Although not quite as entertaining as Charles Panati’s book “Extraordinary Endings of Everything and Everybody” (as I recall its title), this is an informative book on the history of several infectious diseases, like plague, leprosy, typhoid, cholera, Spanish flu, etc. There is also a chapter on lobotomy, not a disease, but included to fit the author’s main theme, which is that society is full of monsters. There’s a lot of monstrosity in this book. The sick have always been treated with revulsion and righteousness, which is not laudable but is understandable when you realize that for most of human existence, life was a pretty hard struggle and we are hard-wired to fear disease and to protect the healthy by leaving the weak behind - which often means dehumanizing them. The author makes the valid point that our modern, enlightened society should move beyond these attitudes, although they do still often crop up, even among those who should be aware of the errors of the past and setting an example of more compassionate thought today.It’s definitely a history book. You won’t come away from it with any deep understandings of the mechanism or treatment of infection, but it does provide some interesting facts about how the various epidemics arose and the societal atmosphere surrounding them. It makes the point that advances such as improved sanitation, antiseptics, antibiotics and immunization should also include basic human compassion for the afflicted."
143,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39353094-diabolica,5,"I have never enjoyed reading the intro and epilogue of a book more. Straight up, this is possibly the only book that has managed to rein me in, in what is generally the most boring and (what I think) the most frivolous section of the novel. I loved the writing style, both informative and hilarious. Any secondary sources she used were weaved inside her novel, so that they flowed with the text. And the annotations weren't just there for the sake of being there. Despite reading this over the span of a month, I never once lost interest. The subject, as dry as it might have been through other media, was the most griping thing I read that month. (It also didn't hurt that I didn't read much else during January). Best of all, I actually remember what I read. Most attempts leave me bored within the first thirty pages (maybe that's a sign that I shouldn't read nonfiction(?)), but this book both reeled me in, and had my attention captured. So much so that I could recount what I read. Hats off to Wright. Definitely recommend this to really anyone whose interested, even slightly, in this sort of field/topic. "
144,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"Wright is even more witty and current than my other go-to NF writer, Roach, of Stiff and Spook fame. I was interested in learning more about the past plagues and what we need to learn from them. It's so hard to wrap your mind around that many people dying -significant percentages of the population... gone. How did people deal with loss of family friends, neighbors and the accompanying grief. In those days, they had so little idea of what they were dealing with, but as Wright reminds us , it's likely only a matter of time with increased resistance to antibiotics.. Not that this is a totally gloomy read, Wright applauds the heroes, traces the medical learning curve and applies a liberal dose of gallow's humor, that I really appreciated 4 and a half fevered stars."

How she managed to make me laugh hysterically while teaching me important facts about plagues and showing respect for their gruesome history at the same time, I’ll never know. I love books on virology and this one did not disappoint. I have read a lot on the subject and was still surprised by a lot of the little known stories and heroes in the war on plagues throughout the ages. Seriously worth a read.

I was doing good and handling all this scary info well until I got to the Spanish flu chapter. ok, a little scared now. then the chapter on lobotomies. I could have cried and cried. after hearing about all these terrible diseases then to hear about the horrors a man inflicted on others and not always willing people, was so heart breaking. and don't think this book is going to end on a happy note. Lastly, she discusses the AIDS outbreak of the 80's. The things some of our elected officials said and they way they joked about it was truly awful. too bad they didn't have this book back then.

The man who promoted lobotomies, Walter Jackson Freeman II, was a devil and I want to believe that he is paying for it in death. People should vaccinate their children.

The book also comes with a bit of preaching, which I didn’t mind. There are two major lessons I think she wants us to walk away with.1) Stigmatizing and ostracizing victims of disease is not only mean and wrong, but it hinders our ability to fight the disease. This is because ashamed people hide their condition, leading to increased spreading of the disease, and decreased data for research.2) Vaccinate your kids, for crying out loud!A few quotes for your reading pleasure.“Feel free to start using Walter Jackson Freeman II as an insult directed toward people you hate. Almost no one will get the reference, but if I am in the room we’ll high-five and it will be awesome.” “Although Galen was a great physician, he was not a terribly courageous man. Galen was a self-promotor above anything else. According to McLynn, he consistently claimed to be a self-made man, casually downplaying the fact that he can from an extremely wealthy family and had inherited numerous estates as well as a stellar list of contacts. He employed underhanded tactics to win debates, and he constantly aggrandized his own achievements. Personality-wise, you could think of him as the Donald Trump of Ancient Rome.” “Full disclosure: I would have patented that vaccine and not felt guilty about it for a second. I suspect I would have used the money to do dumb stuff I thought was awesome, like start an F. Scott Fitzgerald theme park. I assume everyone else would also do that. Why doesn’t a theme park devoted to books exist? It would be so much fun.”"

Maybe I have a Macabre side to me reading this during our current Pandemic, but it's amazing how we we've repeated mistakes from the past. It was reassuring to be reminded of all the diseases we have eradicated over the Centuries and the people who came together to wage war on sickness."
153,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I picked this book up on a whim as I’m interested in the subject matter and I’m so glad I did! This was such a fantastic book and one of my favourites on the discussion of plagues to date (I’ve actually read a fair few ..)I love the references to popular culture and current and recent films which brings historical plagues into a 21st century relatability whilst also holding onto the historical nature and telling of the plagues being described. I absolutely adore her writing style in this, it’s down to earth, personable with her funny witty personality that seems to lace her words. It doesn’t detract away from the informative nature or content which is written both scientifically and in such an engaging way it’s a delight to read. It’s also written in a way that’s delicate but also to the point and doesn’t beat around the bush. I loved it! I really recommend a read if this aligns with your interests !"
154,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7812107-natalie,5,"People who don't find Jennifer Wright hilarious are people I don't want to be friends with. There. That is the most important thing you need to know regarding my opinion of this book.MY OTHER OPINIONS1. This was incredibly interesting. I learned more reading this than I did in four years of high school. I was telling all my friends and co-workers about it. 2. This took me forever to read because I didn't want it to end. I would pick it up only as a special treat to myself - like chocolates or a massage. 3. Walter Jackson Freeman II was a total POS. That's not really an opinion. That's a fact. Unless you believe otherwise. In that case, you are also a POS. I want to read a million books by this author. Unfortunately, her supply does not meet my demand currently, so I'll just need to savor what I do have. 5 Stars"
155,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"I'm not sure whether it's something to be proud of or not, but I've always been fascinated by disease and plagues. So when I came across this book, I knew I had to read it. It did not disappoint.I could see how some people would find Wright's casual and almost flippant tone at times to be a little off-putting, but for me, I felt as if we were two women discussing these horrific plagues and diseases over a cup of coffee. And there's just enough lightness to keep the book from being completely and utterly depressing, even if we still have no idea where the Spanish flu came from, and no way to combat it if it ever decided to come out of hibernation. My only consolation is I'm perhaps a bit too old at 38 to be at the greatest risk of dying from the Spanish flu. (Also can we please quit calling stomach bugs the ""flu""? It is not the flu. Influenza, even the non-Spanish version, will knock you on your back for a couple of weeks. If you are up and about the next day or the day after, you do not have the flu. /end rant)This book will also annoy anti-vaxxers to no end, as Wright goes on quite the rant regarding the need for and the safety of vaccines at the end of the chapter on smallpox. I do believe that we're so far removed from these terrible diseases that it's lulled people into a false sense of security, that the diseases every child experienced in the pre-vaccination age weren't really that bad. But when you realize that milkmaids were very proud of the fact that they'd never ""lose their beauty"" (ie, become horribly disfigured) thanks to smallpox, having had cowpox already, you start think, ""Hmm, perhaps smallpox *was* pretty damn bad."" And without vaccines, children would still be paralyzed every summer thanks to contracting polio. That's not exactly a world I'd like to return to.I especially liked that Wright stepped outside the box a bit, and told us about some lesser-known plagues, like the dancing plague and encephalitis lethargica. But the scariest bits were how quickly we forget the terror of losing so many thanks to an extremely contagious disease. I can't even imagine watching bodies pile up in the streets, as they did in Philadelphia just a hundred years ago during the Spanish flu. Yet we need to remember, and begin to plan for an epidemic like this to happen again. It seems as if we're just about due for another outbreak.I highly recommend this book, especially since Wright keeps the terrifying photos to a section at the end of the book that one doesn't have to look at. It's so informative, yet accessible thanks to her chatty prose. I can't wait to read her previous book, It Ended Badly: Thirteen of the Worst Breakups in History. I have a feeling I'll love it just as much, and I truly hope Wright continues to write these fascinating books."
156,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19228026-phyllis,4,"I planned on a four star rating but the more I read, the more I liked it. So I gave it 4.5. I've read several books about epidemics, plagues and am always fascinated by how diseases and their victims are treated. The author has done a tremendous amount of research and also has a sense of humor, just enough to get you through some of the horrible aspects of these epidemics. A quote from the leprosy chapter about Father Damien, the priest who went to live and care for the lepers on the island of Molokai, ""Damien is a reminder that you don't have to be a genius or a brilliant scientist or a doctor to help in this war against disease: you just have to be someone who gives a damn about your fellow man"".  In the chapter on the Spanish Influenza she talks about the president who controlled the press and wouldn't allow anything about this massive, deadly epidemic to appear in any newspaper. We should never allow presidents to control the press. Another excellent book on the Spanish Influenza The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History"
157,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"I finished this one a few days ago and while I found it interesting, the social commentary from the author was a little hit and miss. Jennifer Wright gives us a great overview of some of the worst of the worst plagues and misses the AIDS plague which I was hoping would've provided us some insight. The book is a 3.5 and I liked it enough to keep reading. Some of the humour didn't fit and I'm a huge fan of pop culture but I was a little baffled here. Wright should of left some of the commentary to the later part of the chapters, giving us a brief overview of the cleverness she clearly has. If you don't know too much about plagues like myself and you hear anyone running around with crazy ideas on plagues, shove this book in their hands. It gives you a large amount of information but I just think it didn't flow like it should've. Others clearly think better of it and have pegged this at 5, I just wanted a lot more input from the author. The book needed to be longer but maybe she will deliver a follow-up which will blow our minds. "
158,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen,4,"Wright is a bit of a Mary Roach—funny and voice-y and opinionated, while simultaneously unloading lots of learning about the history of disease. She is firmly on the side of sufferers and the people who’ve tried to help them, and just as firmly condemns anyone who has judged, abandoned, or exploited the sick. From the dancing plague of the sixteenth century to typhoid, cholera, and polio—by way of lobotomies and a brief mention of AIDS—she covers the pestilential waterfront. Taught me stuff and made me smile on my commute. "
159,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Most of the information included in this book was not new, and I can’t even say it was put together in a new way that helped me see the subject matter through a new lens. Despite that, I will probably read any book Jennifer wright authors because I simply love her writing style. Her humor, wit, and strong opinions set a tone early in the book that made old and recycled information feel refreshing."
160,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5096743-suzanne,4,"This was fascinating, and the author kept it interesting throughout."
161,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36933045-rosemary-standeven,5,"This is a surprisingly readable, informative and amusing book – given its subject – and ideally suited to the current worldwide crisis. Some of the plagues I already knew a lot about (Syphilis and Tuberculosis), having written assignments on them for my Herbal Medicine degree (and NO, herbal medicine will NOT cure either of them, I just found the diseases interesting). Others I knew a bit about, but learned so much more. For instance – the so-called Spanish Flu originated in Kansas, USA, but due to WWI media restrictions no-one in USA, Britain etc was allowed to report on it. Spain was neutral, reported the deaths, and so got the blame. The dancing plague in Strasbourg was entirely new to me.There is a lot to be learned from the genesis, spread and treatment of old plagues that can be applied to the current COVID19, and the author does not shy away from scathing comments on doctors and politicians who were more interested in their own affairs than helping the public. There is also repeated (and wholly deserved) condemnation of Anti-vaxxers and people who will not listen to the genuine experts, and believe that they know best, despite overwhelming scientific proof of the idiocy and public danger of their claims. (“Ask the Aztecs and Incas whether or not they would have liked to have vaccines available to them. Oh, wait, you can’t, they’re dead.” One thing that stands out above all others, is the need for courageous, empathetic, intelligent and decisive leadership in the face of plagues – something that is in short supply just now (except in NZ and maybe Germany).Amongst all the death and suffering, there are some heart-warming stories, some real heroes, and some serendipitous good fortune. The book is ultimately about the resilience of the human spirit, and about how we can get through plagues, bad medicine and the current crisis, if we would just learn from past errors.Some quotes I liked:Dancing plague: “is lovely to see that all the edicts related to helping the suffering people. The community did not want their fellow neighbors to die and were experimenting on many fronts to help the afflicted. Today we still have outbreaks where we become so fearful for ourselves that we forget all about our neighbors. The people of Strasbourg were ahead of their time in their regard for one another. … there is never a situation where care and attentiveness by the community is a bad thing.”Cholera:  “He became such a firm convert to Snow’s theory that until his death Whitehead kept over his desk a portrait of Snow, which, he noted, “ever serves to remind me that in any profession the highest order of work is achieved not by fussy demand for ‘something to be done,’ but by patient study of the eternal laws.””“The best-case scenario when it comes to the outbreak of a disease is that the community will rally around the afflicted. It will tend to them gently; it will raise funds; it will do whatever is necessary to allow the people stricken with the disease to live with dignity while science searches for a cure.” Spanish ‘flu’:  “In spite of our First World desire to believe that diseases are fundamentally exotic imports, the first case of the Spanish flu epidemic was reported to the weekly journal Public Health Reports by Dr. Loring Miner of Haskell, Kansas, in March 1918.” “This might be a good time to mention that if you learn about an airborne virus that seems to be killing otherwise healthy young people in your area from a reputable medical journal, you are reading very bad news. Go to the grocery store and start stocking up on supplies immediately. If you have someplace relatively isolated to live, go there. Doing so might feel a bit silly or paranoid, but, honestly, neither of those responses would be overreactions.”“We are fortunate today to have organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization that track how diseases are progressing and report these findings. In the event of an outbreak similar to the Spanish flu, they will be wonderful resources.” – WHICH NEED FUNDING NOT CUTS!!!Lobotomies: “Part of the blame lies with a midcentury zeal for conformity. People were willing to sacrifice whole personalities to make those who seemed different and unusual more like everyone else. Some who turned to lobotomies desperately yearned for a cure for their ailments; others were suffering from nothing more than human frailty.”Polio: “Our main problem now,” said Thomas Rivers, a leader in viral research who oversaw the clinical trials of Salk’s vaccine in 1956, “is not that anything is wrong with the Salk vaccine, but that something is wrong with the people who won’t take it.”"
162,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2323418-abbey,4,"4.5 stars - it is so weird to say a book about diseases was a fun read. Wright uses such great humor through devastating parts of history in a way that’s respectful of the trauma. I’d heard of most of these plagues, but I knew zero details. This was fascinating and an easy way to get that information. It reminds me in some ways of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks in that it reminds us the importance of science while keeping the humanity in mind.Also, PLEASE VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN"
163,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23727760-daniel-kibblesmith,5,"Another funny, insightful history book from Jennifer Wright.As in her previous, ""It Ended Badly: 13 Of The Worst Break-Ups In History,"" Wright's blend of thorough research and humorous modern voice makes history instantly accessible and relatable — devoting each roughly commute-length chapter into a different vignette about a world-changing plague.Who knew that Father Damien was basically the greatest human being who ever lived, and Woodrow Wilson was the worst? Or that people ""cured"" the bubonic plague with exploding frogs? Also, one word: Lobotomobile.Stories you might have some familiarity with come to life in a deeper way with modern hindsight and funny (or frightening) modern relevance. Perfect for history buffs, people looking for some historical perspective after the election, and the hypochondriac in all of us."
164,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14174872-lea,4,"A fun and easy-to-read book on some particularly nasty diseases, the people who suffered them and the people who helped cure/treat them.I was familiar with most of the history in the book, but had fun with the author's casual writing style. I still learned a fair amount though, and for all her jokes, it's clear that the book is very well researched and that she is passionate about her subject, which I really appreciated. However, if you're looking for a serious academic treatise on diseases, this isn't it.The only chapter I felt was out of place was the one on lobotomies. Yes, they are awful and terrifying, but not a disease."

There is still no cure for EL, and its rise and subsequent disappearance is still regarded as something of a mystery.
I have heard of this before but only in the obscure and morbidly fascinating sense, think more horror movie than documentary. The unknown-ness of this one draws me and repels me away. Reading about how it affected people's personalities, bodily functions, and sent them into comas is frightening. 
If you are interested in following a line of thought on interrelated diseases, though, some scientists today think that EL is related to streptococcal bacteria, so that’s a fun thing to consider when you get strep throat.
I have never heard and this and can I just say WHAT?!? Reading about how adult's showed after effects of Postencephalitic Parkinson’s disease which led them to L-dopa as a cure and how it initially worked, the woman waking up from a coma years later and thinking it was early 1940s when it was late 1960s, was wild. I think this ""plague"" was added to just scare the crap out of everyone as there is still no known cure but I guess it hasn't made any more appearances? This is one I'm going to have to investigate further because how freaking wild that it seems to suddenly appear in 1916 and disappear in 1920s. I guess I'd put my bet on Aliens.Lobotomies
Somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of lobotomies were performed on women, despite a greater percentage of men being institutionalized.
This probably shouldn't have been included in a plague book but it is important to discuss, so I'll allow it. I'm against lobotomies, so I had no problem how the author discussed Freeman, the physician behind the start, procedure, and craze of them. The accounts of how he went about them, snipping here and there, until he got the desired amount of not quite comatose in patients, is horrifying and rage inducing. 
A charismatic demagogue was elevated and trusted because he was captivating and because researching facts, as well as listening to dull doctors who have done their homework, is hard and time-consuming.
This quote, I can't tell you how much I feel this quote down into my soul right now. Reading about how women who were listed as menopausal or hysterical, by doctors that didn't even converse with them but rather their husbands and given over to Freeman for lobotomies had me fighting tears. This chapter was all about making sure there are committees, watchdogs, or the like in place to stop charismatic, mad medical field individuals from dazzling people with their ""science"".Polio 
Well, herd immunity works for most diseases only if about 80 to 90 percent of the population is vaccinated. With some diseases, like measles, a 95 percent vaccination rate is necessary.
Again, vaccinate your kids. I have to say, I'm not sure I knew Polio came from contaminated water or food, kind of like typhoid. That is how well we eradicated it, I didn't even know what caused it! The author talked about live virus and killer virus vaccines and the rivalry between Salk and Sabin to get there. I've heard of Salk before because of how he used unwittingly mental health patients for clinical trials, which the author mentioned but after saying he should be considered close to a saint. I'm not quite there on him but I'm a grey shades person and as long as you mention the shitty aspects I don't have a problem stating all the good he also did. Seems wild in today's atmosphere of people dying because the price of their insulin is too much money that he didn't patent his vaccine but I'd like to read more on the legalities of if and how he could have. My favorite part of this section was the focus on how representation matters and how FDR gave hope and pride to fellow Polio survivors. 
Those who had AIDS survived because they, like Mr. Crumpton’s No Nose’d Club for syphilitics, founded groups like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP to fight for their right to live. They supported one another. They protested. They yelled. They made people extremely uncomfortable.
I'm not a scientist or in the medical field, so there was definitely new information for me to gain from reading this. I went in thinking this was going to be a drier, informative read but realized very early on that my expectations needed to be changed. This is more of a coffee table book where casual readers can just pick it up and learn some interesting facts that will either make them popular on trivia night or send them down a drier text reading rabbit hole. The author has a sarcastic, pop culture heavy tone that could turn some people off as we discussing real horrible deaths but I'm a bit of a gallows humor gal myself, so except for a couple times, I wasn't put off or offended. I do think the pop culture references are going to date this and age it out of future circulation. All in all, I learned some facts, was intrigued to research some, and enjoyed this more surface look into diseases. This book is not for experts in the field but the average person could definitely get something out of it. However, if you're an anti-vaxxer, you'd probably get huffy over the author's constant reminder that you should probably reevaluate your thinking (I completely agree with her)."
168,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"Putting a hilarious spin on history in all the right places, Jennifer Wright will crack you up while telling you all about some of the worst plagues that have been documented. If you’re someone who hears about diseases or ailments and immediately think that you have them, this book might not be for you. However, if you’re someone who likes to read about history and are interested in learning about some of the most notable disease outbreaks, this is the book for you.When I picked up this book, I was not expecting to laugh as much as I did. Don’t get me wrong; the subject matter is serious, but Jennifer has a sense of humor that translates well even in nonfiction. Every time she inserts a photo, the caption has me rolling. At one point, there’s an illustration showing two people being treated for the Bubonic Plague. Her caption reads:“These guys were lucky—they had pillows and an in-home wizard.”There was never a funny moment that was horribly misplaced. There are chapters where the author is not funny because there just isn’t a time for it. However, other chapters let her personality shine through in sections and I was cracking up. It’s not a book that has a monotone voice like some nonfiction novels have.I learned a lot throughout the chapters. I had heard of majority of the diseases and had some knowledge about them, but the only one I really knew a lot about was the travesty that was lobotomies. This is the one chapter that’s not an actual disease but rather a horrific catch-all treatment that did a lot of harm to the people who were operated on. There’s a lot of interesting information throughout the chapters including some interesting cases and notable names, treatment attempts, and cases.This is an excellent book that’s perfect for anyone’s collection in addition to making a great gift for those interested in historical overviews."
169,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,5,Informative and fun in equal measure.
170,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6367659-poligirlreads,5,"Given that I can develop a disease based on the power of suggestion alone (""Doc, I've been watching the news on prostate cancer, and now I think think there's something wrong with my prostate."" ""You're a chick. You don't have a prostate."" ""That's precisely what makes this situation all the more dire.""), I probably should've taken a hard pass on this book. But given my love of Wright's previous book, It Ended Badly, I knew I needed to read this one. As a result, I now want to hunker down in basement and wear a gas mask 24/7 to ward off any potential plagues, but despite that, this is a most excellent read.You know how people talk about how in order to understand the present, you have to look toward the past? Boy is this the perfect book within the context of the anti-vaxxers. History is always trying out ""natural"" cures like rubbing the body down in onions and whatnot, and amazingly, it's only actual science that seems to provide the actual solutions. It's a weird and strange transition from seeing people line up for polio vaccines in the '50s to abject suspicion in the 21st century to such dangerous quackery like, you know, measles vaccinations. Wright details how these phenomenons occur: once something is eradicated, we no longer see their horrifying effects, and once a disease is eradicated, we promptly forget about it, and the lessons we learned from it. That is both troubling and decidedly human.Also human? The tales she tells of the heroes: Aurelius, Father Damien, Salk. People who get their business together, and go about trying to save lives and give people comfort. Heck, it gave me comfort just knowing that these people existed.Wright has a delightful writing style, both parts humorous and informative. She managed to make me laugh while I cringed at humanity's general responses to plagues. I get her reasoning for not devoting a full chapter to AIDS, but I still think it should've been done. Tracing what happened once folks realized that the ""gay disease"" was actually a people disease, would have been interesting. And I also would've liked to see some love for SARS. It had all of the hallmarks that Wright would've loved: the public's response, the race-baiting (""blame the Asians!""), the effects of globalization on its spread, the political response...sigh. Oh well. The good thing about plagues (I never thought I'd write that line) is that there's always more to come. Here's looking forward to Get Well Soon, Vol. 2.And to Wright? Thank you, THANK YOU for keeping the horrific pictures of diseased folks in the back of the book. Had they been included throughout, I probably would've been so traumatized that I would've developed the Dancing Plague."
171,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16214729-margaret,2,"The author of this book desperately wanted to make this subject ""cool"" without taking into account the fact that people who pick up a book about plagues are probably going to be annoyed by that. The author inserts a lot of herself into the telling about these plagues, using a lot of ""I"" sentences (as another reviewer noted). I know this isn't fiction, but she also CONSTANTLY breaks the ""fourth wall"" by addressing her readers directly, e.g. ""If you managed to get through the Spanish Flu chapter and were only modestly terrified, well you're a strange human being, but settle in and prepare to have your socks scared off."" BARF. The writing is quite juvenile. Why was it necessary to mention Goodreads while discussing bad reviews given to a medical paper? Why did she need to mention Kim Kardashian in a discussion about the media coverage of the Spanish Flu during WWI? The style is just grating. I felt very patronized, as if the author feels like her readers are too vapid to be interested in medical nonfiction without adding in bits of pop culture that will make this book age VERY badly. I think the last straw for me on that point was when she threw in a reference to 50 Shades of Grey. NO. JUST NO. I gave it 2 stars overall because in between the ""look how cool I'm making this subject!"" fluff, she actually presents interesting and accurate information about each plague - I've read many of the books and authors she references (John Kelly and John Barry)."
172,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith,3,"Audiobook. Although not quite as entertaining as Charles Panati’s book “Extraordinary Endings of Everything and Everybody” (as I recall its title), this is an informative book on the history of several infectious diseases, like plague, leprosy, typhoid, cholera, Spanish flu, etc. There is also a chapter on lobotomy, not a disease, but included to fit the author’s main theme, which is that society is full of monsters. There’s a lot of monstrosity in this book. The sick have always been treated with revulsion and righteousness, which is not laudable but is understandable when you realize that for most of human existence, life was a pretty hard struggle and we are hard-wired to fear disease and to protect the healthy by leaving the weak behind - which often means dehumanizing them. The author makes the valid point that our modern, enlightened society should move beyond these attitudes, although they do still often crop up, even among those who should be aware of the errors of the past and setting an example of more compassionate thought today.It’s definitely a history book. You won’t come away from it with any deep understandings of the mechanism or treatment of infection, but it does provide some interesting facts about how the various epidemics arose and the societal atmosphere surrounding them. It makes the point that advances such as improved sanitation, antiseptics, antibiotics and immunization should also include basic human compassion for the afflicted."
173,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39353094-diabolica,5,"I have never enjoyed reading the intro and epilogue of a book more. Straight up, this is possibly the only book that has managed to rein me in, in what is generally the most boring and (what I think) the most frivolous section of the novel. I loved the writing style, both informative and hilarious. Any secondary sources she used were weaved inside her novel, so that they flowed with the text. And the annotations weren't just there for the sake of being there. Despite reading this over the span of a month, I never once lost interest. The subject, as dry as it might have been through other media, was the most griping thing I read that month. (It also didn't hurt that I didn't read much else during January). Best of all, I actually remember what I read. Most attempts leave me bored within the first thirty pages (maybe that's a sign that I shouldn't read nonfiction(?)), but this book both reeled me in, and had my attention captured. So much so that I could recount what I read. Hats off to Wright. Definitely recommend this to really anyone whose interested, even slightly, in this sort of field/topic. "
174,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"Wright is even more witty and current than my other go-to NF writer, Roach, of Stiff and Spook fame. I was interested in learning more about the past plagues and what we need to learn from them. It's so hard to wrap your mind around that many people dying -significant percentages of the population... gone. How did people deal with loss of family friends, neighbors and the accompanying grief. In those days, they had so little idea of what they were dealing with, but as Wright reminds us , it's likely only a matter of time with increased resistance to antibiotics.. Not that this is a totally gloomy read, Wright applauds the heroes, traces the medical learning curve and applies a liberal dose of gallow's humor, that I really appreciated 4 and a half fevered stars."

How she managed to make me laugh hysterically while teaching me important facts about plagues and showing respect for their gruesome history at the same time, I’ll never know. I love books on virology and this one did not disappoint. I have read a lot on the subject and was still surprised by a lot of the little known stories and heroes in the war on plagues throughout the ages. Seriously worth a read. If you can manage to make learning about horrific things fun for an average stay at home mom, you’ve won the game."

177,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8253900-latasha,4,"this book was great and informative without being dry and hard to consume. Gabra Zackman did a great job narrating. I was doing good and handling all this scary info well until I got to the Spanish flu chapter. ok, a little scared now. then the chapter on lobotomies. I could have cried and cried. after hearing about all these terrible diseases then to hear about the horrors a man inflicted on others and not always willing people, was so heart breaking. and don't think this book is going to end on a happy note. Lastly, she discusses the AIDS outbreak of the 80's. The things some of our elected officials said and they way they joked about it was truly awful. too bad they didn't have this book back then. Maybe they could have took some inspiration from (now) Saint Damien. "
178,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54489623-the-captain,4,"Ahoy there mateys! This book is about plagues and is fascinating. The First Mate listened to this one and recommended it. We ended up listening to it together. We would stop after each chapter and discuss. It was fun. I knew nothing about the Antonine Plague of Rome. I found how widespread syphilis was to be fascinating. The monk that worked on the leper colony, Father Damien, should be a saint. The man who promoted lobotomies, Walter Jackson Freeman II, was a devil and I want to believe that he is paying for it in death. People should vaccinate their children. And seriously bursting frogs to cure the black death. Ugh! There is a lot of humor in this book which I didn’t always love but it wasn’t done disrespectfully. I wouldn’t mind reading more of this author’s works. Arrr!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp..."

And if you need a primer on pandemics, this is a nice one - BUT it isn't really anything more, just a primer. I expected something more - something more focused on specific illnesses as such; and although Wright references many books on pandemics, much of the pieces of information relayed can be found, in a not very different shape, on wikipedia. "
180,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820549-jackballoon,5,Learned so much from this book. the audible edition was excellent. 
181,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,5,"Jennifer Wright writes with a delightful combination of snark and compassion. I thoroughly enjoyed this romp through many of history’s worst plagues. The heroes of which she speaks are not always doctors and scientists, but everyday compassionate people who care about their fellow man. There is also a villain or two. The book also comes with a bit of preaching, which I didn’t mind. There are two major lessons I think she wants us to walk away with.1) Stigmatizing and ostracizing victims of disease is not only mean and wrong, but it hinders our ability to fight the disease. This is because ashamed people hide their condition, leading to increased spreading of the disease, and decreased data for research.2) Vaccinate your kids, for crying out loud!A few quotes for your reading pleasure.“Feel free to start using Walter Jackson Freeman II as an insult directed toward people you hate. Almost no one will get the reference, but if I am in the room we’ll high-five and it will be awesome.” “Although Galen was a great physician, he was not a terribly courageous man. Galen was a self-promotor above anything else. According to McLynn, he consistently claimed to be a self-made man, casually downplaying the fact that he can from an extremely wealthy family and had inherited numerous estates as well as a stellar list of contacts. He employed underhanded tactics to win debates, and he constantly aggrandized his own achievements. Personality-wise, you could think of him as the Donald Trump of Ancient Rome.” “Full disclosure: I would have patented that vaccine and not felt guilty about it for a second. I suspect I would have used the money to do dumb stuff I thought was awesome, like start an F. Scott Fitzgerald theme park. I assume everyone else would also do that. Why doesn’t a theme park devoted to books exist? It would be so much fun.”"
182,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45392105-aleta,5,"Jennifer Wright did an incredible job with this book. Maybe I have a Macabre side to me reading this during our current Pandemic, but it's amazing how we we've repeated mistakes from the past. It was reassuring to be reminded of all the diseases we have eradicated over the Centuries and the people who came together to wage war on sickness."
183,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I picked this book up on a whim as I’m interested in the subject matter and I’m so glad I did! This was such a fantastic book and one of my favourites on the discussion of plagues to date (I’ve actually read a fair few ..)I love the references to popular culture and current and recent films which brings historical plagues into a 21st century relatability whilst also holding onto the historical nature and telling of the plagues being described. I absolutely adore her writing style in this, it’s down to earth, personable with her funny witty personality that seems to lace her words. It doesn’t detract away from the informative nature or content which is written both scientifically and in such an engaging way it’s a delight to read. It’s also written in a way that’s delicate but also to the point and doesn’t beat around the bush. I loved it! I really recommend a read if this aligns with your interests !"
184,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7812107-natalie,5,"People who don't find Jennifer Wright hilarious are people I don't want to be friends with. There. That is the most important thing you need to know regarding my opinion of this book.MY OTHER OPINIONS1. This was incredibly interesting. I learned more reading this than I did in four years of high school. I was telling all my friends and co-workers about it. 2. This took me forever to read because I didn't want it to end. I would pick it up only as a special treat to myself - like chocolates or a massage. 3. Walter Jackson Freeman II was a total POS. That's not really an opinion. That's a fact. Unless you believe otherwise. In that case, you are also a POS. I want to read a million books by this author. Unfortunately, her supply does not meet my demand currently, so I'll just need to savor what I do have. 5 Stars"
185,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"I'm not sure whether it's something to be proud of or not, but I've always been fascinated by disease and plagues. So when I came across this book, I knew I had to read it. It did not disappoint.I could see how some people would find Wright's casual and almost flippant tone at times to be a little off-putting, but for me, I felt as if we were two women discussing these horrific plagues and diseases over a cup of coffee. And there's just enough lightness to keep the book from being completely and utterly depressing, even if we still have no idea where the Spanish flu came from, and no way to combat it if it ever decided to come out of hibernation. My only consolation is I'm perhaps a bit too old at 38 to be at the greatest risk of dying from the Spanish flu. (Also can we please quit calling stomach bugs the ""flu""? It is not the flu. Influenza, even the non-Spanish version, will knock you on your back for a couple of weeks. If you are up and about the next day or the day after, you do not have the flu. /end rant)This book will also annoy anti-vaxxers to no end, as Wright goes on quite the rant regarding the need for and the safety of vaccines at the end of the chapter on smallpox. I do believe that we're so far removed from these terrible diseases that it's lulled people into a false sense of security, that the diseases every child experienced in the pre-vaccination age weren't really that bad. But when you realize that milkmaids were very proud of the fact that they'd never ""lose their beauty"" (ie, become horribly disfigured) thanks to smallpox, having had cowpox already, you start think, ""Hmm, perhaps smallpox *was* pretty damn bad."" And without vaccines, children would still be paralyzed every summer thanks to contracting polio. That's not exactly a world I'd like to return to.I especially liked that Wright stepped outside the box a bit, and told us about some lesser-known plagues, like the dancing plague and encephalitis lethargica. But the scariest bits were how quickly we forget the terror of losing so many thanks to an extremely contagious disease. I can't even imagine watching bodies pile up in the streets, as they did in Philadelphia just a hundred years ago during the Spanish flu. Yet we need to remember, and begin to plan for an epidemic like this to happen again. It seems as if we're just about due for another outbreak.I highly recommend this book, especially since Wright keeps the terrifying photos to a section at the end of the book that one doesn't have to look at. It's so informative, yet accessible thanks to her chatty prose. I can't wait to read her previous book, It Ended Badly: Thirteen of the Worst Breakups in History. I have a feeling I'll love it just as much, and I truly hope Wright continues to write these fascinating books."
186,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19228026-phyllis,4,"I planned on a four star rating but the more I read, the more I liked it. So I gave it 4.5. I've read several books about epidemics, plagues and am always fascinated by how diseases and their victims are treated. The author has done a tremendous amount of research and also has a sense of humor, just enough to get you through some of the horrible aspects of these epidemics. A quote from the leprosy chapter about Father Damien, the priest who went to live and care for the lepers on the island of Molokai, ""Damien is a reminder that you don't have to be a genius or a brilliant scientist or a doctor to help in this war against disease: you just have to be someone who gives a damn about your fellow man"".  In the chapter on the Spanish Influenza she talks about the president who controlled the press and wouldn't allow anything about this massive, deadly epidemic to appear in any newspaper. We should never allow presidents to control the press. Another excellent book on the Spanish Influenza The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History"
187,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"I finished this one a few days ago and while I found it interesting, the social commentary from the author was a little hit and miss. Jennifer Wright gives us a great overview of some of the worst of the worst plagues and misses the AIDS plague which I was hoping would've provided us some insight. The book is a 3.5 and I liked it enough to keep reading. Some of the humour didn't fit and I'm a huge fan of pop culture but I was a little baffled here. Wright should of left some of the commentary to the later part of the chapters, giving us a brief overview of the cleverness she clearly has. If you don't know too much about plagues like myself and you hear anyone running around with crazy ideas on plagues, shove this book in their hands. It gives you a large amount of information but I just think it didn't flow like it should've. Others clearly think better of it and have pegged this at 5, I just wanted a lot more input from the author. The book needed to be longer but maybe she will deliver a follow-up which will blow our minds. "
188,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen,4,"Wright is a bit of a Mary Roach—funny and voice-y and opinionated, while simultaneously unloading lots of learning about the history of disease. She is firmly on the side of sufferers and the people who’ve tried to help them, and just as firmly condemns anyone who has judged, abandoned, or exploited the sick. From the dancing plague of the sixteenth century to typhoid, cholera, and polio—by way of lobotomies and a brief mention of AIDS—she covers the pestilential waterfront. Taught me stuff and made me smile on my commute. "
189,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Most of the information included in this book was not new, and I can’t even say it was put together in a new way that helped me see the subject matter through a new lens. Despite that, I will probably read any book Jennifer wright authors because I simply love her writing style. Her humor, wit, and strong opinions set a tone early in the book that made old and recycled information feel refreshing."
190,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5096743-suzanne,4,"This was fascinating, and the author kept it interesting throughout."
191,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36933045-rosemary-standeven,5,"This is a surprisingly readable, informative and amusing book – given its subject – and ideally suited to the current worldwide crisis. Some of the plagues I already knew a lot about (Syphilis and Tuberculosis), having written assignments on them for my Herbal Medicine degree (and NO, herbal medicine will NOT cure either of them, I just found the diseases interesting). Others I knew a bit about, but learned so much more. For instance – the so-called Spanish Flu originated in Kansas, USA, but due to WWI media restrictions no-one in USA, Britain etc was allowed to report on it. Spain was neutral, reported the deaths, and so got the blame. The dancing plague in Strasbourg was entirely new to me.There is a lot to be learned from the genesis, spread and treatment of old plagues that can be applied to the current COVID19, and the author does not shy away from scathing comments on doctors and politicians who were more interested in their own affairs than helping the public. There is also repeated (and wholly deserved) condemnation of Anti-vaxxers and people who will not listen to the genuine experts, and believe that they know best, despite overwhelming scientific proof of the idiocy and public danger of their claims. (“Ask the Aztecs and Incas whether or not they would have liked to have vaccines available to them. Oh, wait, you can’t, they’re dead.” One thing that stands out above all others, is the need for courageous, empathetic, intelligent and decisive leadership in the face of plagues – something that is in short supply just now (except in NZ and maybe Germany).Amongst all the death and suffering, there are some heart-warming stories, some real heroes, and some serendipitous good fortune. The book is ultimately about the resilience of the human spirit, and about how we can get through plagues, bad medicine and the current crisis, if we would just learn from past errors.Some quotes I liked:Dancing plague: “is lovely to see that all the edicts related to helping the suffering people. The community did not want their fellow neighbors to die and were experimenting on many fronts to help the afflicted. Today we still have outbreaks where we become so fearful for ourselves that we forget all about our neighbors. The people of Strasbourg were ahead of their time in their regard for one another. … there is never a situation where care and attentiveness by the community is a bad thing.”Cholera:  “He became such a firm convert to Snow’s theory that until his death Whitehead kept over his desk a portrait of Snow, which, he noted, “ever serves to remind me that in any profession the highest order of work is achieved not by fussy demand for ‘something to be done,’ but by patient study of the eternal laws.””“The best-case scenario when it comes to the outbreak of a disease is that the community will rally around the afflicted. It will tend to them gently; it will raise funds; it will do whatever is necessary to allow the people stricken with the disease to live with dignity while science searches for a cure.” Spanish ‘flu’:  “In spite of our First World desire to believe that diseases are fundamentally exotic imports, the first case of the Spanish flu epidemic was reported to the weekly journal Public Health Reports by Dr. Loring Miner of Haskell, Kansas, in March 1918.” “This might be a good time to mention that if you learn about an airborne virus that seems to be killing otherwise healthy young people in your area from a reputable medical journal, you are reading very bad news. Go to the grocery store and start stocking up on supplies immediately. If you have someplace relatively isolated to live, go there. Doing so might feel a bit silly or paranoid, but, honestly, neither of those responses would be overreactions.”“We are fortunate today to have organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization that track how diseases are progressing and report these findings. In the event of an outbreak similar to the Spanish flu, they will be wonderful resources.” – WHICH NEED FUNDING NOT CUTS!!!Lobotomies: “Part of the blame lies with a midcentury zeal for conformity. People were willing to sacrifice whole personalities to make those who seemed different and unusual more like everyone else. Some who turned to lobotomies desperately yearned for a cure for their ailments; others were suffering from nothing more than human frailty.”Polio: “Our main problem now,” said Thomas Rivers, a leader in viral research who oversaw the clinical trials of Salk’s vaccine in 1956, “is not that anything is wrong with the Salk vaccine, but that something is wrong with the people who won’t take it.”"
192,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2323418-abbey,4,"4.5 stars - it is so weird to say a book about diseases was a fun read. Wright uses such great humor through devastating parts of history in a way that’s respectful of the trauma. I’d heard of most of these plagues, but I knew zero details. This was fascinating and an easy way to get that information. It reminds me in some ways of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks in that it reminds us the importance of science while keeping the humanity in mind.Also, PLEASE VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN"
193,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23727760-daniel-kibblesmith,5,"Another funny, insightful history book from Jennifer Wright.As in her previous, ""It Ended Badly: 13 Of The Worst Break-Ups In History,"" Wright's blend of thorough research and humorous modern voice makes history instantly accessible and relatable — devoting each roughly commute-length chapter into a different vignette about a world-changing plague.Who knew that Father Damien was basically the greatest human being who ever lived, and Woodrow Wilson was the worst? Or that people ""cured"" the bubonic plague with exploding frogs? Also, one word: Lobotomobile.Stories you might have some familiarity with come to life in a deeper way with modern hindsight and funny (or frightening) modern relevance. Perfect for history buffs, people looking for some historical perspective after the election, and the hypochondriac in all of us."
194,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14174872-lea,4,"A fun and easy-to-read book on some particularly nasty diseases, the people who suffered them and the people who helped cure/treat them.I was familiar with most of the history in the book, but had fun with the author's casual writing style. I still learned a fair amount though, and for all her jokes, it's clear that the book is very well researched and that she is passionate about her subject, which I really appreciated. However, if you're looking for a serious academic treatise on diseases, this isn't it.The only chapter I felt was out of place was the one on lobotomies. Yes, they are awful and terrifying, but not a disease."

There is still no cure for EL, and its rise and subsequent disappearance is still regarded as something of a mystery.
I have heard of this before but only in the obscure and morbidly fascinating sense, think more horror movie than documentary. The unknown-ness of this one draws me and repels me away. Reading about how it affected people's personalities, bodily functions, and sent them into comas is frightening. 
If you are interested in following a line of thought on interrelated diseases, though, some scientists today think that EL is related to streptococcal bacteria, so that’s a fun thing to consider when you get strep throat.
I have never heard and this and can I just say WHAT?!? Reading about how adult's showed after effects of Postencephalitic Parkinson’s disease which led them to L-dopa as a cure and how it initially worked, the woman waking up from a coma years later and thinking it was early 1940s when it was late 1960s, was wild. I think this ""plague"" was added to just scare the crap out of everyone as there is still no known cure but I guess it hasn't made any more appearances? This is one I'm going to have to investigate further because how freaking wild that it seems to suddenly appear in 1916 and disappear in 1920s. I guess I'd put my bet on Aliens.Lobotomies
Somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of lobotomies were performed on women, despite a greater percentage of men being institutionalized.
This probably shouldn't have been included in a plague book but it is important to discuss, so I'll allow it. I'm against lobotomies, so I had no problem how the author discussed Freeman, the physician behind the start, procedure, and craze of them. The accounts of how he went about them, snipping here and there, until he got the desired amount of not quite comatose in patients, is horrifying and rage inducing. 
A charismatic demagogue was elevated and trusted because he was captivating and because researching facts, as well as listening to dull doctors who have done their homework, is hard and time-consuming.
This quote, I can't tell you how much I feel this quote down into my soul right now. Reading about how women who were listed as menopausal or hysterical, by doctors that didn't even converse with them but rather their husbands and given over to Freeman for lobotomies had me fighting tears. This chapter was all about making sure there are committees, watchdogs, or the like in place to stop charismatic, mad medical field individuals from dazzling people with their ""science"".Polio 
Well, herd immunity works for most diseases only if about 80 to 90 percent of the population is vaccinated. With some diseases, like measles, a 95 percent vaccination rate is necessary.
Again, vaccinate your kids. I have to say, I'm not sure I knew Polio came from contaminated water or food, kind of like typhoid. That is how well we eradicated it, I didn't even know what caused it! The author talked about live virus and killer virus vaccines and the rivalry between Salk and Sabin to get there. I've heard of Salk before because of how he used unwittingly mental health patients for clinical trials, which the author mentioned but after saying he should be considered close to a saint. I'm not quite there on him but I'm a grey shades person and as long as you mention the shitty aspects I don't have a problem stating all the good he also did. Seems wild in today's atmosphere of people dying because the price of their insulin is too much money that he didn't patent his vaccine but I'd like to read more on the legalities of if and how he could have. My favorite part of this section was the focus on how representation matters and how FDR gave hope and pride to fellow Polio survivors. 
Those who had AIDS survived because they, like Mr. Crumpton’s No Nose’d Club for syphilitics, founded groups like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP to fight for their right to live. They supported one another. They protested. They yelled. They made people extremely uncomfortable.
I'm not a scientist or in the medical field, so there was definitely new information for me to gain from reading this. I went in thinking this was going to be a drier, informative read but realized very early on that my expectations needed to be changed. This is more of a coffee table book where casual readers can just pick it up and learn some interesting facts that will either make them popular on trivia night or send them down a drier text reading rabbit hole. The author has a sarcastic, pop culture heavy tone that could turn some people off as we discussing real horrible deaths but I'm a bit of a gallows humor gal myself, so except for a couple times, I wasn't put off or offended. I do think the pop culture references are going to date this and age it out of future circulation. All in all, I learned some facts, was intrigued to research some, and enjoyed this more surface look into diseases. This book is not for experts in the field but the average person could definitely get something out of it. However, if you're an anti-vaxxer, you'd probably get huffy over the author's constant reminder that you should probably reevaluate your thinking (I completely agree with her)."
198,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"Putting a hilarious spin on history in all the right places, Jennifer Wright will crack you up while telling you all about some of the worst plagues that have been documented. If you’re someone who hears about diseases or ailments and immediately think that you have them, this book might not be for you. However, if you’re someone who likes to read about history and are interested in learning about some of the most notable disease outbreaks, this is the book for you.When I picked up this book, I was not expecting to laugh as much as I did. Don’t get me wrong; the subject matter is serious, but Jennifer has a sense of humor that translates well even in nonfiction. Every time she inserts a photo, the caption has me rolling. At one point, there’s an illustration showing two people being treated for the Bubonic Plague. Her caption reads:“These guys were lucky—they had pillows and an in-home wizard.”There was never a funny moment that was horribly misplaced. There are chapters where the author is not funny because there just isn’t a time for it. However, other chapters let her personality shine through in sections and I was cracking up. It’s not a book that has a monotone voice like some nonfiction novels have.I learned a lot throughout the chapters. I had heard of majority of the diseases and had some knowledge about them, but the only one I really knew a lot about was the travesty that was lobotomies. This is the one chapter that’s not an actual disease but rather a horrific catch-all treatment that did a lot of harm to the people who were operated on. There’s a lot of interesting information throughout the chapters including some interesting cases and notable names, treatment attempts, and cases.This is an excellent book that’s perfect for anyone’s collection in addition to making a great gift for those interested in historical overviews."
199,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,5,Informative and fun in equal measure.
200,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6367659-poligirlreads,5,"Given that I can develop a disease based on the power of suggestion alone (""Doc, I've been watching the news on prostate cancer, and now I think think there's something wrong with my prostate."" ""You're a chick. You don't have a prostate."" ""That's precisely what makes this situation all the more dire.""), I probably should've taken a hard pass on this book. But given my love of Wright's previous book, It Ended Badly, I knew I needed to read this one. As a result, I now want to hunker down in basement and wear a gas mask 24/7 to ward off any potential plagues, but despite that, this is a most excellent read.You know how people talk about how in order to understand the present, you have to look toward the past? Boy is this the perfect book within the context of the anti-vaxxers. History is always trying out ""natural"" cures like rubbing the body down in onions and whatnot, and amazingly, it's only actual science that seems to provide the actual solutions. It's a weird and strange transition from seeing people line up for polio vaccines in the '50s to abject suspicion in the 21st century to such dangerous quackery like, you know, measles vaccinations. Wright details how these phenomenons occur: once something is eradicated, we no longer see their horrifying effects, and once a disease is eradicated, we promptly forget about it, and the lessons we learned from it. That is both troubling and decidedly human.Also human? The tales she tells of the heroes: Aurelius, Father Damien, Salk. People who get their business together, and go about trying to save lives and give people comfort. Heck, it gave me comfort just knowing that these people existed.Wright has a delightful writing style, both parts humorous and informative. She managed to make me laugh while I cringed at humanity's general responses to plagues. I get her reasoning for not devoting a full chapter to AIDS, but I still think it should've been done. Tracing what happened once folks realized that the ""gay disease"" was actually a people disease, would have been interesting. And I also would've liked to see some love for SARS. It had all of the hallmarks that Wright would've loved: the public's response, the race-baiting (""blame the Asians!""), the effects of globalization on its spread, the political response...sigh. Oh well. The good thing about plagues (I never thought I'd write that line) is that there's always more to come. Here's looking forward to Get Well Soon, Vol. 2.And to Wright? Thank you, THANK YOU for keeping the horrific pictures of diseased folks in the back of the book. Had they been included throughout, I probably would've been so traumatized that I would've developed the Dancing Plague."
201,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16214729-margaret,2,"The author of this book desperately wanted to make this subject ""cool"" without taking into account the fact that people who pick up a book about plagues are probably going to be annoyed by that. The author inserts a lot of herself into the telling about these plagues, using a lot of ""I"" sentences (as another reviewer noted). I know this isn't fiction, but she also CONSTANTLY breaks the ""fourth wall"" by addressing her readers directly, e.g. ""If you managed to get through the Spanish Flu chapter and were only modestly terrified, well you're a strange human being, but settle in and prepare to have your socks scared off."" BARF. The writing is quite juvenile. Why was it necessary to mention Goodreads while discussing bad reviews given to a medical paper? Why did she need to mention Kim Kardashian in a discussion about the media coverage of the Spanish Flu during WWI? The style is just grating. I felt very patronized, as if the author feels like her readers are too vapid to be interested in medical nonfiction without adding in bits of pop culture that will make this book age VERY badly. I think the last straw for me on that point was when she threw in a reference to 50 Shades of Grey. NO. JUST NO. I gave it 2 stars overall because in between the ""look how cool I'm making this subject!"" fluff, she actually presents interesting and accurate information about each plague - I've read many of the books and authors she references (John Kelly and John Barry)."
202,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith,3,"Audiobook. Although not quite as entertaining as Charles Panati’s book “Extraordinary Endings of Everything and Everybody” (as I recall its title), this is an informative book on the history of several infectious diseases, like plague, leprosy, typhoid, cholera, Spanish flu, etc. There is also a chapter on lobotomy, not a disease, but included to fit the author’s main theme, which is that society is full of monsters. There’s a lot of monstrosity in this book. The sick have always been treated with revulsion and righteousness, which is not laudable but is understandable when you realize that for most of human existence, life was a pretty hard struggle and we are hard-wired to fear disease and to protect the healthy by leaving the weak behind - which often means dehumanizing them. The author makes the valid point that our modern, enlightened society should move beyond these attitudes, although they do still often crop up, even among those who should be aware of the errors of the past and setting an example of more compassionate thought today.It’s definitely a history book. You won’t come away from it with any deep understandings of the mechanism or treatment of infection, but it does provide some interesting facts about how the various epidemics arose and the societal atmosphere surrounding them. It makes the point that advances such as improved sanitation, antiseptics, antibiotics and immunization should also include basic human compassion for the afflicted."
203,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39353094-diabolica,5,"I have never enjoyed reading the intro and epilogue of a book more. Straight up, this is possibly the only book that has managed to rein me in, in what is generally the most boring and (what I think) the most frivolous section of the novel. I loved the writing style, both informative and hilarious. Any secondary sources she used were weaved inside her novel, so that they flowed with the text. And the annotations weren't just there for the sake of being there. Despite reading this over the span of a month, I never once lost interest. The subject, as dry as it might have been through other media, was the most griping thing I read that month. (It also didn't hurt that I didn't read much else during January). Best of all, I actually remember what I read. Most attempts leave me bored within the first thirty pages (maybe that's a sign that I shouldn't read nonfiction(?)), but this book both reeled me in, and had my attention captured. So much so that I could recount what I read. Hats off to Wright. Definitely recommend this to really anyone whose interested, even slightly, in this sort of field/topic. "
204,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"Wright is even more witty and current than my other go-to NF writer, Roach, of Stiff and Spook fame. I was interested in learning more about the past plagues and what we need to learn from them. It's so hard to wrap your mind around that many people dying -significant percentages of the population... gone. How did people deal with loss of family friends, neighbors and the accompanying grief. In those days, they had so little idea of what they were dealing with, but as Wright reminds us , it's likely only a matter of time with increased resistance to antibiotics.. Not that this is a totally gloomy read, Wright applauds the heroes, traces the medical learning curve and applies a liberal dose of gallow's humor, that I really appreciated 4 and a half fevered stars."
205,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17887800-kelley-dykes,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. How she managed to make me laugh hysterically while teaching me important facts about plagues and showing respect for their gruesome history at the same time, I’ll never know. I love books on virology and this one did not disappoint. I have read a lot on the subject and was still surprised by a lot of the little known stories and heroes in the war on plagues throughout the ages. Seriously worth a read. If you can manage to make learning about horrific things fun for an average stay at home mom, you’ve won the game."

207,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8253900-latasha,4,"this book was great and informative without being dry and hard to consume. Gabra Zackman did a great job narrating. I was doing good and handling all this scary info well until I got to the Spanish flu chapter. ok, a little scared now. then the chapter on lobotomies. I could have cried and cried. after hearing about all these terrible diseases then to hear about the horrors a man inflicted on others and not always willing people, was so heart breaking. and don't think this book is going to end on a happy note. Lastly, she discusses the AIDS outbreak of the 80's. The things some of our elected officials said and they way they joked about it was truly awful. too bad they didn't have this book back then. Maybe they could have took some inspiration from (now) Saint Damien. "
208,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54489623-the-captain,4,"Ahoy there mateys! This book is about plagues and is fascinating. The First Mate listened to this one and recommended it. We ended up listening to it together. We would stop after each chapter and discuss. It was fun. I knew nothing about the Antonine Plague of Rome. I found how widespread syphilis was to be fascinating. The monk that worked on the leper colony, Father Damien, should be a saint. The man who promoted lobotomies, Walter Jackson Freeman II, was a devil and I want to believe that he is paying for it in death. People should vaccinate their children. And seriously bursting frogs to cure the black death. Ugh! There is a lot of humor in this book which I didn’t always love but it wasn’t done disrespectfully. I wouldn’t mind reading more of this author’s works. Arrr!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp..."
209,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15965497-girl,2,"It's an extremely readable book - I swallowed it in a day. And if you need a primer on pandemics, this is a nice one - BUT it isn't really anything more, just a primer. I expected something more - something more focused on specific illnesses as such; and although Wright references many books on pandemics, much of the pieces of information relayed can be found, in a not very different shape, on wikipedia. "
210,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820549-jackballoon,5,Learned so much from this book. the audible edition was excellent. 
211,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,5,"Jennifer Wright writes with a delightful combination of snark and compassion. I thoroughly enjoyed this romp through many of history’s worst plagues. The heroes of which she speaks are not always doctors and scientists, but everyday compassionate people who care about their fellow man. There is also a villain or two. The book also comes with a bit of preaching, which I didn’t mind. There are two major lessons I think she wants us to walk away with.1) Stigmatizing and ostracizing victims of disease is not only mean and wrong, but it hinders our ability to fight the disease. This is because ashamed people hide their condition, leading to increased spreading of the disease, and decreased data for research.2) Vaccinate your kids, for crying out loud!A few quotes for your reading pleasure.“Feel free to start using Walter Jackson Freeman II as an insult directed toward people you hate. Almost no one will get the reference, but if I am in the room we’ll high-five and it will be awesome.” “Although Galen was a great physician, he was not a terribly courageous man. Galen was a self-promotor above anything else. According to McLynn, he consistently claimed to be a self-made man, casually downplaying the fact that he can from an extremely wealthy family and had inherited numerous estates as well as a stellar list of contacts. He employed underhanded tactics to win debates, and he constantly aggrandized his own achievements. Personality-wise, you could think of him as the Donald Trump of Ancient Rome.” “Full disclosure: I would have patented that vaccine and not felt guilty about it for a second. I suspect I would have used the money to do dumb stuff I thought was awesome, like start an F. Scott Fitzgerald theme park. I assume everyone else would also do that. Why doesn’t a theme park devoted to books exist? It would be so much fun.”"
212,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45392105-aleta,5,"Jennifer Wright did an incredible job with this book. Maybe I have a Macabre side to me reading this during our current Pandemic, but it's amazing how we we've repeated mistakes from the past. It was reassuring to be reminded of all the diseases we have eradicated over the Centuries and the people who came together to wage war on sickness."
213,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I picked this book up on a whim as I’m interested in the subject matter and I’m so glad I did! This was such a fantastic book and one of my favourites on the discussion of plagues to date (I’ve actually read a fair few ..)I love the references to popular culture and current and recent films which brings historical plagues into a 21st century relatability whilst also holding onto the historical nature and telling of the plagues being described. I absolutely adore her writing style in this, it’s down to earth, personable with her funny witty personality that seems to lace her words. It doesn’t detract away from the informative nature or content which is written both scientifically and in such an engaging way it’s a delight to read. It’s also written in a way that’s delicate but also to the point and doesn’t beat around the bush. I loved it! I really recommend a read if this aligns with your interests !"
214,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7812107-natalie,5,"People who don't find Jennifer Wright hilarious are people I don't want to be friends with. There. That is the most important thing you need to know regarding my opinion of this book.MY OTHER OPINIONS1. This was incredibly interesting. I learned more reading this than I did in four years of high school. I was telling all my friends and co-workers about it. 2. This took me forever to read because I didn't want it to end. I would pick it up only as a special treat to myself - like chocolates or a massage. 3. Walter Jackson Freeman II was a total POS. That's not really an opinion. That's a fact. Unless you believe otherwise. In that case, you are also a POS. I want to read a million books by this author. Unfortunately, her supply does not meet my demand currently, so I'll just need to savor what I do have. 5 Stars"
215,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"I'm not sure whether it's something to be proud of or not, but I've always been fascinated by disease and plagues. So when I came across this book, I knew I had to read it. It did not disappoint.I could see how some people would find Wright's casual and almost flippant tone at times to be a little off-putting, but for me, I felt as if we were two women discussing these horrific plagues and diseases over a cup of coffee. And there's just enough lightness to keep the book from being completely and utterly depressing, even if we still have no idea where the Spanish flu came from, and no way to combat it if it ever decided to come out of hibernation. My only consolation is I'm perhaps a bit too old at 38 to be at the greatest risk of dying from the Spanish flu. (Also can we please quit calling stomach bugs the ""flu""? It is not the flu. Influenza, even the non-Spanish version, will knock you on your back for a couple of weeks. If you are up and about the next day or the day after, you do not have the flu. /end rant)This book will also annoy anti-vaxxers to no end, as Wright goes on quite the rant regarding the need for and the safety of vaccines at the end of the chapter on smallpox. I do believe that we're so far removed from these terrible diseases that it's lulled people into a false sense of security, that the diseases every child experienced in the pre-vaccination age weren't really that bad. But when you realize that milkmaids were very proud of the fact that they'd never ""lose their beauty"" (ie, become horribly disfigured) thanks to smallpox, having had cowpox already, you start think, ""Hmm, perhaps smallpox *was* pretty damn bad."" And without vaccines, children would still be paralyzed every summer thanks to contracting polio. That's not exactly a world I'd like to return to.I especially liked that Wright stepped outside the box a bit, and told us about some lesser-known plagues, like the dancing plague and encephalitis lethargica. But the scariest bits were how quickly we forget the terror of losing so many thanks to an extremely contagious disease. I can't even imagine watching bodies pile up in the streets, as they did in Philadelphia just a hundred years ago during the Spanish flu. Yet we need to remember, and begin to plan for an epidemic like this to happen again. It seems as if we're just about due for another outbreak.I highly recommend this book, especially since Wright keeps the terrifying photos to a section at the end of the book that one doesn't have to look at. It's so informative, yet accessible thanks to her chatty prose. I can't wait to read her previous book, It Ended Badly: Thirteen of the Worst Breakups in History. I have a feeling I'll love it just as much, and I truly hope Wright continues to write these fascinating books."
216,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19228026-phyllis,4,"I planned on a four star rating but the more I read, the more I liked it. So I gave it 4.5. I've read several books about epidemics, plagues and am always fascinated by how diseases and their victims are treated. The author has done a tremendous amount of research and also has a sense of humor, just enough to get you through some of the horrible aspects of these epidemics. A quote from the leprosy chapter about Father Damien, the priest who went to live and care for the lepers on the island of Molokai, ""Damien is a reminder that you don't have to be a genius or a brilliant scientist or a doctor to help in this war against disease: you just have to be someone who gives a damn about your fellow man"".  In the chapter on the Spanish Influenza she talks about the president who controlled the press and wouldn't allow anything about this massive, deadly epidemic to appear in any newspaper. We should never allow presidents to control the press. Another excellent book on the Spanish Influenza The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History"
217,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"I finished this one a few days ago and while I found it interesting, the social commentary from the author was a little hit and miss. Jennifer Wright gives us a great overview of some of the worst of the worst plagues and misses the AIDS plague which I was hoping would've provided us some insight. The book is a 3.5 and I liked it enough to keep reading. Some of the humour didn't fit and I'm a huge fan of pop culture but I was a little baffled here. Wright should of left some of the commentary to the later part of the chapters, giving us a brief overview of the cleverness she clearly has. If you don't know too much about plagues like myself and you hear anyone running around with crazy ideas on plagues, shove this book in their hands. It gives you a large amount of information but I just think it didn't flow like it should've. Others clearly think better of it and have pegged this at 5, I just wanted a lot more input from the author. The book needed to be longer but maybe she will deliver a follow-up which will blow our minds. "
218,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen,4,"Wright is a bit of a Mary Roach—funny and voice-y and opinionated, while simultaneously unloading lots of learning about the history of disease. She is firmly on the side of sufferers and the people who’ve tried to help them, and just as firmly condemns anyone who has judged, abandoned, or exploited the sick. From the dancing plague of the sixteenth century to typhoid, cholera, and polio—by way of lobotomies and a brief mention of AIDS—she covers the pestilential waterfront. Taught me stuff and made me smile on my commute. "
219,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Most of the information included in this book was not new, and I can’t even say it was put together in a new way that helped me see the subject matter through a new lens. Despite that, I will probably read any book Jennifer wright authors because I simply love her writing style. Her humor, wit, and strong opinions set a tone early in the book that made old and recycled information feel refreshing."
220,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5096743-suzanne,4,"This was fascinating, and the author kept it interesting throughout."
221,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36933045-rosemary-standeven,5,"This is a surprisingly readable, informative and amusing book – given its subject – and ideally suited to the current worldwide crisis. Some of the plagues I already knew a lot about (Syphilis and Tuberculosis), having written assignments on them for my Herbal Medicine degree (and NO, herbal medicine will NOT cure either of them, I just found the diseases interesting). Others I knew a bit about, but learned so much more. For instance – the so-called Spanish Flu originated in Kansas, USA, but due to WWI media restrictions no-one in USA, Britain etc was allowed to report on it. Spain was neutral, reported the deaths, and so got the blame. The dancing plague in Strasbourg was entirely new to me.There is a lot to be learned from the genesis, spread and treatment of old plagues that can be applied to the current COVID19, and the author does not shy away from scathing comments on doctors and politicians who were more interested in their own affairs than helping the public. There is also repeated (and wholly deserved) condemnation of Anti-vaxxers and people who will not listen to the genuine experts, and believe that they know best, despite overwhelming scientific proof of the idiocy and public danger of their claims. (“Ask the Aztecs and Incas whether or not they would have liked to have vaccines available to them. Oh, wait, you can’t, they’re dead.” One thing that stands out above all others, is the need for courageous, empathetic, intelligent and decisive leadership in the face of plagues – something that is in short supply just now (except in NZ and maybe Germany).Amongst all the death and suffering, there are some heart-warming stories, some real heroes, and some serendipitous good fortune. The book is ultimately about the resilience of the human spirit, and about how we can get through plagues, bad medicine and the current crisis, if we would just learn from past errors.Some quotes I liked:Dancing plague: “is lovely to see that all the edicts related to helping the suffering people. The community did not want their fellow neighbors to die and were experimenting on many fronts to help the afflicted. Today we still have outbreaks where we become so fearful for ourselves that we forget all about our neighbors. The people of Strasbourg were ahead of their time in their regard for one another. … there is never a situation where care and attentiveness by the community is a bad thing.”Cholera:  “He became such a firm convert to Snow’s theory that until his death Whitehead kept over his desk a portrait of Snow, which, he noted, “ever serves to remind me that in any profession the highest order of work is achieved not by fussy demand for ‘something to be done,’ but by patient study of the eternal laws.””“The best-case scenario when it comes to the outbreak of a disease is that the community will rally around the afflicted. It will tend to them gently; it will raise funds; it will do whatever is necessary to allow the people stricken with the disease to live with dignity while science searches for a cure.” Spanish ‘flu’:  “In spite of our First World desire to believe that diseases are fundamentally exotic imports, the first case of the Spanish flu epidemic was reported to the weekly journal Public Health Reports by Dr. Loring Miner of Haskell, Kansas, in March 1918.” “This might be a good time to mention that if you learn about an airborne virus that seems to be killing otherwise healthy young people in your area from a reputable medical journal, you are reading very bad news. Go to the grocery store and start stocking up on supplies immediately. If you have someplace relatively isolated to live, go there. Doing so might feel a bit silly or paranoid, but, honestly, neither of those responses would be overreactions.”“We are fortunate today to have organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization that track how diseases are progressing and report these findings. In the event of an outbreak similar to the Spanish flu, they will be wonderful resources.” – WHICH NEED FUNDING NOT CUTS!!!Lobotomies: “Part of the blame lies with a midcentury zeal for conformity. People were willing to sacrifice whole personalities to make those who seemed different and unusual more like everyone else. Some who turned to lobotomies desperately yearned for a cure for their ailments; others were suffering from nothing more than human frailty.”Polio: “Our main problem now,” said Thomas Rivers, a leader in viral research who oversaw the clinical trials of Salk’s vaccine in 1956, “is not that anything is wrong with the Salk vaccine, but that something is wrong with the people who won’t take it.”"
222,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2323418-abbey,4,"4.5 stars - it is so weird to say a book about diseases was a fun read. Wright uses such great humor through devastating parts of history in a way that’s respectful of the trauma. I’d heard of most of these plagues, but I knew zero details. This was fascinating and an easy way to get that information. It reminds me in some ways of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks in that it reminds us the importance of science while keeping the humanity in mind.Also, PLEASE VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN"
223,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23727760-daniel-kibblesmith,5,"Another funny, insightful history book from Jennifer Wright.As in her previous, ""It Ended Badly: 13 Of The Worst Break-Ups In History,"" Wright's blend of thorough research and humorous modern voice makes history instantly accessible and relatable — devoting each roughly commute-length chapter into a different vignette about a world-changing plague.Who knew that Father Damien was basically the greatest human being who ever lived, and Woodrow Wilson was the worst? Or that people ""cured"" the bubonic plague with exploding frogs? Also, one word: Lobotomobile.Stories you might have some familiarity with come to life in a deeper way with modern hindsight and funny (or frightening) modern relevance. Perfect for history buffs, people looking for some historical perspective after the election, and the hypochondriac in all of us."
224,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14174872-lea,4,"A fun and easy-to-read book on some particularly nasty diseases, the people who suffered them and the people who helped cure/treat them.I was familiar with most of the history in the book, but had fun with the author's casual writing style. I still learned a fair amount though, and for all her jokes, it's clear that the book is very well researched and that she is passionate about her subject, which I really appreciated. However, if you're looking for a serious academic treatise on diseases, this isn't it.The only chapter I felt was out of place was the one on lobotomies. Yes, they are awful and terrifying, but not a disease."

There is still no cure for EL, and its rise and subsequent disappearance is still regarded as something of a mystery.
I have heard of this before but only in the obscure and morbidly fascinating sense, think more horror movie than documentary. The unknown-ness of this one draws me and repels me away. Reading about how it affected people's personalities, bodily functions, and sent them into comas is frightening. 
If you are interested in following a line of thought on interrelated diseases, though, some scientists today think that EL is related to streptococcal bacteria, so that’s a fun thing to consider when you get strep throat.
I have never heard and this and can I just say WHAT?!? Reading about how adult's showed after effects of Postencephalitic Parkinson’s disease which led them to L-dopa as a cure and how it initially worked, the woman waking up from a coma years later and thinking it was early 1940s when it was late 1960s, was wild. I think this ""plague"" was added to just scare the crap out of everyone as there is still no known cure but I guess it hasn't made any more appearances? This is one I'm going to have to investigate further because how freaking wild that it seems to suddenly appear in 1916 and disappear in 1920s. I guess I'd put my bet on Aliens.Lobotomies
Somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of lobotomies were performed on women, despite a greater percentage of men being institutionalized.
This probably shouldn't have been included in a plague book but it is important to discuss, so I'll allow it. I'm against lobotomies, so I had no problem how the author discussed Freeman, the physician behind the start, procedure, and craze of them. The accounts of how he went about them, snipping here and there, until he got the desired amount of not quite comatose in patients, is horrifying and rage inducing. 
A charismatic demagogue was elevated and trusted because he was captivating and because researching facts, as well as listening to dull doctors who have done their homework, is hard and time-consuming.
This quote, I can't tell you how much I feel this quote down into my soul right now. Reading about how women who were listed as menopausal or hysterical, by doctors that didn't even converse with them but rather their husbands and given over to Freeman for lobotomies had me fighting tears. This chapter was all about making sure there are committees, watchdogs, or the like in place to stop charismatic, mad medical field individuals from dazzling people with their ""science"".Polio 
Well, herd immunity works for most diseases only if about 80 to 90 percent of the population is vaccinated. With some diseases, like measles, a 95 percent vaccination rate is necessary.
Again, vaccinate your kids. I have to say, I'm not sure I knew Polio came from contaminated water or food, kind of like typhoid. That is how well we eradicated it, I didn't even know what caused it! The author talked about live virus and killer virus vaccines and the rivalry between Salk and Sabin to get there. I've heard of Salk before because of how he used unwittingly mental health patients for clinical trials, which the author mentioned but after saying he should be considered close to a saint. I'm not quite there on him but I'm a grey shades person and as long as you mention the shitty aspects I don't have a problem stating all the good he also did. Seems wild in today's atmosphere of people dying because the price of their insulin is too much money that he didn't patent his vaccine but I'd like to read more on the legalities of if and how he could have. My favorite part of this section was the focus on how representation matters and how FDR gave hope and pride to fellow Polio survivors. 
Those who had AIDS survived because they, like Mr. Crumpton’s No Nose’d Club for syphilitics, founded groups like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP to fight for their right to live. They supported one another. They protested. They yelled. They made people extremely uncomfortable.
I'm not a scientist or in the medical field, so there was definitely new information for me to gain from reading this. I went in thinking this was going to be a drier, informative read but realized very early on that my expectations needed to be changed. This is more of a coffee table book where casual readers can just pick it up and learn some interesting facts that will either make them popular on trivia night or send them down a drier text reading rabbit hole. The author has a sarcastic, pop culture heavy tone that could turn some people off as we discussing real horrible deaths but I'm a bit of a gallows humor gal myself, so except for a couple times, I wasn't put off or offended. I do think the pop culture references are going to date this and age it out of future circulation. All in all, I learned some facts, was intrigued to research some, and enjoyed this more surface look into diseases. This book is not for experts in the field but the average person could definitely get something out of it. However, if you're an anti-vaxxer, you'd probably get huffy over the author's constant reminder that you should probably reevaluate your thinking (I completely agree with her)."
228,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"Putting a hilarious spin on history in all the right places, Jennifer Wright will crack you up while telling you all about some of the worst plagues that have been documented. If you’re someone who hears about diseases or ailments and immediately think that you have them, this book might not be for you. However, if you’re someone who likes to read about history and are interested in learning about some of the most notable disease outbreaks, this is the book for you.When I picked up this book, I was not expecting to laugh as much as I did. Don’t get me wrong; the subject matter is serious, but Jennifer has a sense of humor that translates well even in nonfiction. Every time she inserts a photo, the caption has me rolling. At one point, there’s an illustration showing two people being treated for the Bubonic Plague. Her caption reads:“These guys were lucky—they had pillows and an in-home wizard.”There was never a funny moment that was horribly misplaced. There are chapters where the author is not funny because there just isn’t a time for it. However, other chapters let her personality shine through in sections and I was cracking up. It’s not a book that has a monotone voice like some nonfiction novels have.I learned a lot throughout the chapters. I had heard of majority of the diseases and had some knowledge about them, but the only one I really knew a lot about was the travesty that was lobotomies. This is the one chapter that’s not an actual disease but rather a horrific catch-all treatment that did a lot of harm to the people who were operated on. There’s a lot of interesting information throughout the chapters including some interesting cases and notable names, treatment attempts, and cases.This is an excellent book that’s perfect for anyone’s collection in addition to making a great gift for those interested in historical overviews."

230,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6367659-poligirlreads,5,"Given that I can develop a disease based on the power of suggestion alone (""Doc, I've been watching the news on prostate cancer, and now I think think there's something wrong with my prostate."" ""You're a chick. You don't have a prostate."" ""That's precisely what makes this situation all the more dire.""), I probably should've taken a hard pass on this book. But given my love of Wright's previous book, It Ended Badly, I knew I needed to read this one. As a result, I now want to hunker down in basement and wear a gas mask 24/7 to ward off any potential plagues, but despite that, this is a most excellent read.You know how people talk about how in order to understand the present, you have to look toward the past? Boy is this the perfect book within the context of the anti-vaxxers. History is always trying out ""natural"" cures like rubbing the body down in onions and whatnot, and amazingly, it's only actual science that seems to provide the actual solutions. It's a weird and strange transition from seeing people line up for polio vaccines in the '50s to abject suspicion in the 21st century to such dangerous quackery like, you know, measles vaccinations. Wright details how these phenomenons occur: once something is eradicated, we no longer see their horrifying effects, and once a disease is eradicated, we promptly forget about it, and the lessons we learned from it. That is both troubling and decidedly human.Also human? The tales she tells of the heroes: Aurelius, Father Damien, Salk. People who get their business together, and go about trying to save lives and give people comfort. Heck, it gave me comfort just knowing that these people existed.Wright has a delightful writing style, both parts humorous and informative. She managed to make me laugh while I cringed at humanity's general responses to plagues. I get her reasoning for not devoting a full chapter to AIDS, but I still think it should've been done. Tracing what happened once folks realized that the ""gay disease"" was actually a people disease, would have been interesting. And I also would've liked to see some love for SARS. It had all of the hallmarks that Wright would've loved: the public's response, the race-baiting (""blame the Asians!""), the effects of globalization on its spread, the political response...sigh. Oh well. The good thing about plagues (I never thought I'd write that line) is that there's always more to come. Here's looking forward to Get Well Soon, Vol. 2.And to Wright? Thank you, THANK YOU for keeping the horrific pictures of diseased folks in the back of the book. Had they been included throughout, I probably would've been so traumatized that I would've developed the Dancing Plague."
231,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16214729-margaret,2,"The author of this book desperately wanted to make this subject ""cool"" without taking into account the fact that people who pick up a book about plagues are probably going to be annoyed by that. The author inserts a lot of herself into the telling about these plagues, using a lot of ""I"" sentences (as another reviewer noted). I know this isn't fiction, but she also CONSTANTLY breaks the ""fourth wall"" by addressing her readers directly, e.g. ""If you managed to get through the Spanish Flu chapter and were only modestly terrified, well you're a strange human being, but settle in and prepare to have your socks scared off."" BARF. The writing is quite juvenile. Why was it necessary to mention Goodreads while discussing bad reviews given to a medical paper? Why did she need to mention Kim Kardashian in a discussion about the media coverage of the Spanish Flu during WWI? The style is just grating. I felt very patronized, as if the author feels like her readers are too vapid to be interested in medical nonfiction without adding in bits of pop culture that will make this book age VERY badly. I think the last straw for me on that point was when she threw in a reference to 50 Shades of Grey. NO. JUST NO. I gave it 2 stars overall because in between the ""look how cool I'm making this subject!"" fluff, she actually presents interesting and accurate information about each plague - I've read many of the books and authors she references (John Kelly and John Barry)."
232,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith,3,"Audiobook. Although not quite as entertaining as Charles Panati’s book “Extraordinary Endings of Everything and Everybody” (as I recall its title), this is an informative book on the history of several infectious diseases, like plague, leprosy, typhoid, cholera, Spanish flu, etc. There is also a chapter on lobotomy, not a disease, but included to fit the author’s main theme, which is that society is full of monsters. There’s a lot of monstrosity in this book. The sick have always been treated with revulsion and righteousness, which is not laudable but is understandable when you realize that for most of human existence, life was a pretty hard struggle and we are hard-wired to fear disease and to protect the healthy by leaving the weak behind - which often means dehumanizing them. The author makes the valid point that our modern, enlightened society should move beyond these attitudes, although they do still often crop up, even among those who should be aware of the errors of the past and setting an example of more compassionate thought today.It’s definitely a history book. You won’t come away from it with any deep understandings of the mechanism or treatment of infection, but it does provide some interesting facts about how the various epidemics arose and the societal atmosphere surrounding them. It makes the point that advances such as improved sanitation, antiseptics, antibiotics and immunization should also include basic human compassion for the afflicted."
233,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39353094-diabolica,5,"I have never enjoyed reading the intro and epilogue of a book more. Straight up, this is possibly the only book that has managed to rein me in, in what is generally the most boring and (what I think) the most frivolous section of the novel. I loved the writing style, both informative and hilarious. Any secondary sources she used were weaved inside her novel, so that they flowed with the text. And the annotations weren't just there for the sake of being there. Despite reading this over the span of a month, I never once lost interest. The subject, as dry as it might have been through other media, was the most griping thing I read that month. (It also didn't hurt that I didn't read much else during January). Best of all, I actually remember what I read. Most attempts leave me bored within the first thirty pages (maybe that's a sign that I shouldn't read nonfiction(?)), but this book both reeled me in, and had my attention captured. So much so that I could recount what I read. Hats off to Wright. Definitely recommend this to really anyone whose interested, even slightly, in this sort of field/topic. "
234,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"Wright is even more witty and current than my other go-to NF writer, Roach, of Stiff and Spook fame. I was interested in learning more about the past plagues and what we need to learn from them. It's so hard to wrap your mind around that many people dying -significant percentages of the population... gone. How did people deal with loss of family friends, neighbors and the accompanying grief. In those days, they had so little idea of what they were dealing with, but as Wright reminds us , it's likely only a matter of time with increased resistance to antibiotics.. Not that this is a totally gloomy read, Wright applauds the heroes, traces the medical learning curve and applies a liberal dose of gallow's humor, that I really appreciated 4 and a half fevered stars."
235,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17887800-kelley-dykes,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. How she managed to make me laugh hysterically while teaching me important facts about plagues and showing respect for their gruesome history at the same time, I’ll never know. I love books on virology and this one did not disappoint. I have read a lot on the subject and was still surprised by a lot of the little known stories and heroes in the war on plagues throughout the ages. Seriously worth a read. If you can manage to make learning about horrific things fun for an average stay at home mom, you’ve won the game."

237,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8253900-latasha,4,"this book was great and informative without being dry and hard to consume. Gabra Zackman did a great job narrating. I was doing good and handling all this scary info well until I got to the Spanish flu chapter. ok, a little scared now. then the chapter on lobotomies. I could have cried and cried. after hearing about all these terrible diseases then to hear about the horrors a man inflicted on others and not always willing people, was so heart breaking. and don't think this book is going to end on a happy note. Lastly, she discusses the AIDS outbreak of the 80's. The things some of our elected officials said and they way they joked about it was truly awful. too bad they didn't have this book back then. Maybe they could have took some inspiration from (now) Saint Damien. "
238,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54489623-the-captain,4,"Ahoy there mateys! This book is about plagues and is fascinating. The First Mate listened to this one and recommended it. We ended up listening to it together. We would stop after each chapter and discuss. It was fun. I knew nothing about the Antonine Plague of Rome. I found how widespread syphilis was to be fascinating. The monk that worked on the leper colony, Father Damien, should be a saint. The man who promoted lobotomies, Walter Jackson Freeman II, was a devil and I want to believe that he is paying for it in death. People should vaccinate their children. And seriously bursting frogs to cure the black death. Ugh! There is a lot of humor in this book which I didn’t always love but it wasn’t done disrespectfully. I wouldn’t mind reading more of this author’s works. Arrr!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp..."

And if you need a primer on pandemics, this is a nice one - BUT it isn't really anything more, just a primer. I expected something more - something more focused on specific illnesses as such; and although Wright references many books on pandemics, much of the pieces of information relayed can be found, in a not very different shape, on wikipedia. "
240,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820549-jackballoon,5,Learned so much from this book. the audible edition was excellent. 
241,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,5,"Jennifer Wright writes with a delightful combination of snark and compassion. I thoroughly enjoyed this romp through many of history’s worst plagues. The heroes of which she speaks are not always doctors and scientists, but everyday compassionate people who care about their fellow man. There is also a villain or two. The book also comes with a bit of preaching, which I didn’t mind. There are two major lessons I think she wants us to walk away with.1) Stigmatizing and ostracizing victims of disease is not only mean and wrong, but it hinders our ability to fight the disease. This is because ashamed people hide their condition, leading to increased spreading of the disease, and decreased data for research.2) Vaccinate your kids, for crying out loud!A few quotes for your reading pleasure.“Feel free to start using Walter Jackson Freeman II as an insult directed toward people you hate. Almost no one will get the reference, but if I am in the room we’ll high-five and it will be awesome.” “Although Galen was a great physician, he was not a terribly courageous man. Galen was a self-promotor above anything else. According to McLynn, he consistently claimed to be a self-made man, casually downplaying the fact that he can from an extremely wealthy family and had inherited numerous estates as well as a stellar list of contacts. He employed underhanded tactics to win debates, and he constantly aggrandized his own achievements. Personality-wise, you could think of him as the Donald Trump of Ancient Rome.” “Full disclosure: I would have patented that vaccine and not felt guilty about it for a second. I suspect I would have used the money to do dumb stuff I thought was awesome, like start an F. Scott Fitzgerald theme park. I assume everyone else would also do that. Why doesn’t a theme park devoted to books exist? It would be so much fun.”"
242,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45392105-aleta,5,"Jennifer Wright did an incredible job with this book. Maybe I have a Macabre side to me reading this during our current Pandemic, but it's amazing how we we've repeated mistakes from the past. It was reassuring to be reminded of all the diseases we have eradicated over the Centuries and the people who came together to wage war on sickness."
243,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I picked this book up on a whim as I’m interested in the subject matter and I’m so glad I did! This was such a fantastic book and one of my favourites on the discussion of plagues to date (I’ve actually read a fair few ..)I love the references to popular culture and current and recent films which brings historical plagues into a 21st century relatability whilst also holding onto the historical nature and telling of the plagues being described. I absolutely adore her writing style in this, it’s down to earth, personable with her funny witty personality that seems to lace her words. It doesn’t detract away from the informative nature or content which is written both scientifically and in such an engaging way it’s a delight to read. It’s also written in a way that’s delicate but also to the point and doesn’t beat around the bush. I loved it! I really recommend a read if this aligns with your interests !"
244,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7812107-natalie,5,"People who don't find Jennifer Wright hilarious are people I don't want to be friends with. There. That is the most important thing you need to know regarding my opinion of this book.MY OTHER OPINIONS1. This was incredibly interesting. I learned more reading this than I did in four years of high school. I was telling all my friends and co-workers about it. 2. This took me forever to read because I didn't want it to end. I would pick it up only as a special treat to myself - like chocolates or a massage. 3. Walter Jackson Freeman II was a total POS. That's not really an opinion. That's a fact. Unless you believe otherwise. In that case, you are also a POS. I want to read a million books by this author. Unfortunately, her supply does not meet my demand currently, so I'll just need to savor what I do have. 5 Stars"
245,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"I'm not sure whether it's something to be proud of or not, but I've always been fascinated by disease and plagues. So when I came across this book, I knew I had to read it. It did not disappoint.I could see how some people would find Wright's casual and almost flippant tone at times to be a little off-putting, but for me, I felt as if we were two women discussing these horrific plagues and diseases over a cup of coffee. And there's just enough lightness to keep the book from being completely and utterly depressing, even if we still have no idea where the Spanish flu came from, and no way to combat it if it ever decided to come out of hibernation. My only consolation is I'm perhaps a bit too old at 38 to be at the greatest risk of dying from the Spanish flu. (Also can we please quit calling stomach bugs the ""flu""? It is not the flu. Influenza, even the non-Spanish version, will knock you on your back for a couple of weeks. If you are up and about the next day or the day after, you do not have the flu. /end rant)This book will also annoy anti-vaxxers to no end, as Wright goes on quite the rant regarding the need for and the safety of vaccines at the end of the chapter on smallpox. I do believe that we're so far removed from these terrible diseases that it's lulled people into a false sense of security, that the diseases every child experienced in the pre-vaccination age weren't really that bad. But when you realize that milkmaids were very proud of the fact that they'd never ""lose their beauty"" (ie, become horribly disfigured) thanks to smallpox, having had cowpox already, you start think, ""Hmm, perhaps smallpox *was* pretty damn bad."" And without vaccines, children would still be paralyzed every summer thanks to contracting polio. That's not exactly a world I'd like to return to.I especially liked that Wright stepped outside the box a bit, and told us about some lesser-known plagues, like the dancing plague and encephalitis lethargica. But the scariest bits were how quickly we forget the terror of losing so many thanks to an extremely contagious disease. I can't even imagine watching bodies pile up in the streets, as they did in Philadelphia just a hundred years ago during the Spanish flu. Yet we need to remember, and begin to plan for an epidemic like this to happen again. It seems as if we're just about due for another outbreak.I highly recommend this book, especially since Wright keeps the terrifying photos to a section at the end of the book that one doesn't have to look at. It's so informative, yet accessible thanks to her chatty prose. I can't wait to read her previous book, It Ended Badly: Thirteen of the Worst Breakups in History. I have a feeling I'll love it just as much, and I truly hope Wright continues to write these fascinating books."
246,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19228026-phyllis,4,"I planned on a four star rating but the more I read, the more I liked it. So I gave it 4.5. I've read several books about epidemics, plagues and am always fascinated by how diseases and their victims are treated. The author has done a tremendous amount of research and also has a sense of humor, just enough to get you through some of the horrible aspects of these epidemics. A quote from the leprosy chapter about Father Damien, the priest who went to live and care for the lepers on the island of Molokai, ""Damien is a reminder that you don't have to be a genius or a brilliant scientist or a doctor to help in this war against disease: you just have to be someone who gives a damn about your fellow man"".  In the chapter on the Spanish Influenza she talks about the president who controlled the press and wouldn't allow anything about this massive, deadly epidemic to appear in any newspaper. We should never allow presidents to control the press. Another excellent book on the Spanish Influenza The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History"
247,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"I finished this one a few days ago and while I found it interesting, the social commentary from the author was a little hit and miss. Jennifer Wright gives us a great overview of some of the worst of the worst plagues and misses the AIDS plague which I was hoping would've provided us some insight. The book is a 3.5 and I liked it enough to keep reading. Some of the humour didn't fit and I'm a huge fan of pop culture but I was a little baffled here. Wright should of left some of the commentary to the later part of the chapters, giving us a brief overview of the cleverness she clearly has. If you don't know too much about plagues like myself and you hear anyone running around with crazy ideas on plagues, shove this book in their hands. It gives you a large amount of information but I just think it didn't flow like it should've. Others clearly think better of it and have pegged this at 5, I just wanted a lot more input from the author. The book needed to be longer but maybe she will deliver a follow-up which will blow our minds. "
248,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen,4,"Wright is a bit of a Mary Roach—funny and voice-y and opinionated, while simultaneously unloading lots of learning about the history of disease. She is firmly on the side of sufferers and the people who’ve tried to help them, and just as firmly condemns anyone who has judged, abandoned, or exploited the sick. From the dancing plague of the sixteenth century to typhoid, cholera, and polio—by way of lobotomies and a brief mention of AIDS—she covers the pestilential waterfront. Taught me stuff and made me smile on my commute. "
249,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Most of the information included in this book was not new, and I can’t even say it was put together in a new way that helped me see the subject matter through a new lens. Despite that, I will probably read any book Jennifer wright authors because I simply love her writing style. Her humor, wit, and strong opinions set a tone early in the book that made old and recycled information feel refreshing."
250,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5096743-suzanne,4,"This was fascinating, and the author kept it interesting throughout."
251,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36933045-rosemary-standeven,5,"This is a surprisingly readable, informative and amusing book – given its subject – and ideally suited to the current worldwide crisis. Some of the plagues I already knew a lot about (Syphilis and Tuberculosis), having written assignments on them for my Herbal Medicine degree (and NO, herbal medicine will NOT cure either of them, I just found the diseases interesting). Others I knew a bit about, but learned so much more. For instance – the so-called Spanish Flu originated in Kansas, USA, but due to WWI media restrictions no-one in USA, Britain etc was allowed to report on it. Spain was neutral, reported the deaths, and so got the blame. The dancing plague in Strasbourg was entirely new to me.There is a lot to be learned from the genesis, spread and treatment of old plagues that can be applied to the current COVID19, and the author does not shy away from scathing comments on doctors and politicians who were more interested in their own affairs than helping the public. There is also repeated (and wholly deserved) condemnation of Anti-vaxxers and people who will not listen to the genuine experts, and believe that they know best, despite overwhelming scientific proof of the idiocy and public danger of their claims. (“Ask the Aztecs and Incas whether or not they would have liked to have vaccines available to them. Oh, wait, you can’t, they’re dead.” One thing that stands out above all others, is the need for courageous, empathetic, intelligent and decisive leadership in the face of plagues – something that is in short supply just now (except in NZ and maybe Germany).Amongst all the death and suffering, there are some heart-warming stories, some real heroes, and some serendipitous good fortune. The book is ultimately about the resilience of the human spirit, and about how we can get through plagues, bad medicine and the current crisis, if we would just learn from past errors.Some quotes I liked:Dancing plague: “is lovely to see that all the edicts related to helping the suffering people. The community did not want their fellow neighbors to die and were experimenting on many fronts to help the afflicted. Today we still have outbreaks where we become so fearful for ourselves that we forget all about our neighbors. The people of Strasbourg were ahead of their time in their regard for one another. … there is never a situation where care and attentiveness by the community is a bad thing.”Cholera:  “He became such a firm convert to Snow’s theory that until his death Whitehead kept over his desk a portrait of Snow, which, he noted, “ever serves to remind me that in any profession the highest order of work is achieved not by fussy demand for ‘something to be done,’ but by patient study of the eternal laws.””“The best-case scenario when it comes to the outbreak of a disease is that the community will rally around the afflicted. It will tend to them gently; it will raise funds; it will do whatever is necessary to allow the people stricken with the disease to live with dignity while science searches for a cure.” Spanish ‘flu’:  “In spite of our First World desire to believe that diseases are fundamentally exotic imports, the first case of the Spanish flu epidemic was reported to the weekly journal Public Health Reports by Dr. Loring Miner of Haskell, Kansas, in March 1918.” “This might be a good time to mention that if you learn about an airborne virus that seems to be killing otherwise healthy young people in your area from a reputable medical journal, you are reading very bad news. Go to the grocery store and start stocking up on supplies immediately. If you have someplace relatively isolated to live, go there. Doing so might feel a bit silly or paranoid, but, honestly, neither of those responses would be overreactions.”“We are fortunate today to have organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization that track how diseases are progressing and report these findings. In the event of an outbreak similar to the Spanish flu, they will be wonderful resources.” – WHICH NEED FUNDING NOT CUTS!!!Lobotomies: “Part of the blame lies with a midcentury zeal for conformity. People were willing to sacrifice whole personalities to make those who seemed different and unusual more like everyone else. Some who turned to lobotomies desperately yearned for a cure for their ailments; others were suffering from nothing more than human frailty.”Polio: “Our main problem now,” said Thomas Rivers, a leader in viral research who oversaw the clinical trials of Salk’s vaccine in 1956, “is not that anything is wrong with the Salk vaccine, but that something is wrong with the people who won’t take it.”"
252,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2323418-abbey,4,"4.5 stars - it is so weird to say a book about diseases was a fun read. Wright uses such great humor through devastating parts of history in a way that’s respectful of the trauma. I’d heard of most of these plagues, but I knew zero details. This was fascinating and an easy way to get that information. It reminds me in some ways of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks in that it reminds us the importance of science while keeping the humanity in mind.Also, PLEASE VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN"
253,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23727760-daniel-kibblesmith,5,"Another funny, insightful history book from Jennifer Wright.As in her previous, ""It Ended Badly: 13 Of The Worst Break-Ups In History,"" Wright's blend of thorough research and humorous modern voice makes history instantly accessible and relatable — devoting each roughly commute-length chapter into a different vignette about a world-changing plague.Who knew that Father Damien was basically the greatest human being who ever lived, and Woodrow Wilson was the worst? Or that people ""cured"" the bubonic plague with exploding frogs? Also, one word: Lobotomobile.Stories you might have some familiarity with come to life in a deeper way with modern hindsight and funny (or frightening) modern relevance.

I still learned a fair amount though, and for all her jokes, it's clear that the book is very well researched and that she is passionate about her subject, which I really appreciated. However, if you're looking for a serious academic treatise on diseases, this isn't it.The only chapter I felt was out of place was the one on lobotomies. Yes, they are awful and terrifying, but not a disease."

There is still no cure for EL, and its rise and subsequent disappearance is still regarded as something of a mystery.
I have heard of this before but only in the obscure and morbidly fascinating sense, think more horror movie than documentary. The unknown-ness of this one draws me and repels me away. Reading about how it affected people's personalities, bodily functions, and sent them into comas is frightening. 
If you are interested in following a line of thought on interrelated diseases, though, some scientists today think that EL is related to streptococcal bacteria, so that’s a fun thing to consider when you get strep throat.
I have never heard and this and can I just say WHAT?!? Reading about how adult's showed after effects of Postencephalitic Parkinson’s disease which led them to L-dopa as a cure and how it initially worked, the woman waking up from a coma years later and thinking it was early 1940s when it was late 1960s, was wild. I think this ""plague"" was added to just scare the crap out of everyone as there is still no known cure but I guess it hasn't made any more appearances? This is one I'm going to have to investigate further because how freaking wild that it seems to suddenly appear in 1916 and disappear in 1920s. I guess I'd put my bet on Aliens.Lobotomies
Somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of lobotomies were performed on women, despite a greater percentage of men being institutionalized.
This probably shouldn't have been included in a plague book but it is important to discuss, so I'll allow it. I'm against lobotomies, so I had no problem how the author discussed Freeman, the physician behind the start, procedure, and craze of them. The accounts of how he went about them, snipping here and there, until he got the desired amount of not quite comatose in patients, is horrifying and rage inducing. 
A charismatic demagogue was elevated and trusted because he was captivating and because researching facts, as well as listening to dull doctors who have done their homework, is hard and time-consuming.
This quote, I can't tell you how much I feel this quote down into my soul right now. Reading about how women who were listed as menopausal or hysterical, by doctors that didn't even converse with them but rather their husbands and given over to Freeman for lobotomies had me fighting tears. This chapter was all about making sure there are committees, watchdogs, or the like in place to stop charismatic, mad medical field individuals from dazzling people with their ""science"".Polio 
Well, herd immunity works for most diseases only if about 80 to 90 percent of the population is vaccinated. With some diseases, like measles, a 95 percent vaccination rate is necessary.
Again, vaccinate your kids. I have to say, I'm not sure I knew Polio came from contaminated water or food, kind of like typhoid. That is how well we eradicated it, I didn't even know what caused it! The author talked about live virus and killer virus vaccines and the rivalry between Salk and Sabin to get there. I've heard of Salk before because of how he used unwittingly mental health patients for clinical trials, which the author mentioned but after saying he should be considered close to a saint. I'm not quite there on him but I'm a grey shades person and as long as you mention the shitty aspects I don't have a problem stating all the good he also did. Seems wild in today's atmosphere of people dying because the price of their insulin is too much money that he didn't patent his vaccine but I'd like to read more on the legalities of if and how he could have. My favorite part of this section was the focus on how representation matters and how FDR gave hope and pride to fellow Polio survivors. 
Those who had AIDS survived because they, like Mr. Crumpton’s No Nose’d Club for syphilitics, founded groups like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP to fight for their right to live. They supported one another. They protested. They yelled. They made people extremely uncomfortable.
I'm not a scientist or in the medical field, so there was definitely new information for me to gain from reading this. I went in thinking this was going to be a drier, informative read but realized very early on that my expectations needed to be changed. This is more of a coffee table book where casual readers can just pick it up and learn some interesting facts that will either make them popular on trivia night or send them down a drier text reading rabbit hole. The author has a sarcastic, pop culture heavy tone that could turn some people off as we discussing real horrible deaths but I'm a bit of a gallows humor gal myself, so except for a couple times, I wasn't put off or offended. I do think the pop culture references are going to date this and age it out of future circulation. All in all, I learned some facts, was intrigued to research some, and enjoyed this more surface look into diseases. This book is not for experts in the field but the average person could definitely get something out of it. However, if you're an anti-vaxxer, you'd probably get huffy over the author's constant reminder that you should probably reevaluate your thinking (I completely agree with her)."

If you’re someone who hears about diseases or ailments and immediately think that you have them, this book might not be for you. However, if you’re someone who likes to read about history and are interested in learning about some of the most notable disease outbreaks, this is the book for you.When I picked up this book, I was not expecting to laugh as much as I did. Don’t get me wrong; the subject matter is serious, but Jennifer has a sense of humor that translates well even in nonfiction. Every time she inserts a photo, the caption has me rolling. At one point, there’s an illustration showing two people being treated for the Bubonic Plague. Her caption reads:“These guys were lucky—they had pillows and an in-home wizard.”There was never a funny moment that was horribly misplaced. There are chapters where the author is not funny because there just isn’t a time for it. However, other chapters let her personality shine through in sections and I was cracking up. It’s not a book that has a monotone voice like some nonfiction novels have.I learned a lot throughout the chapters. I had heard of majority of the diseases and had some knowledge about them, but the only one I really knew a lot about was the travesty that was lobotomies. This is the one chapter that’s not an actual disease but rather a horrific catch-all treatment that did a lot of harm to the people who were operated on. There’s a lot of interesting information throughout the chapters including some interesting cases and notable names, treatment attempts, and cases.This is an excellent book that’s perfect for anyone’s collection in addition to making a great gift for those interested in historical overviews."
259,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,5,Informative and fun in equal measure.
260,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6367659-poligirlreads,5,"Given that I can develop a disease based on the power of suggestion alone (""Doc, I've been watching the news on prostate cancer, and now I think think there's something wrong with my prostate."" ""You're a chick. You don't have a prostate."" ""That's precisely what makes this situation all the more dire.""), I probably should've taken a hard pass on this book. But given my love of Wright's previous book, It Ended Badly, I knew I needed to read this one. As a result, I now want to hunker down in basement and wear a gas mask 24/7 to ward off any potential plagues, but despite that, this is a most excellent read.You know how people talk about how in order to understand the present, you have to look toward the past? Boy is this the perfect book within the context of the anti-vaxxers. History is always trying out ""natural"" cures like rubbing the body down in onions and whatnot, and amazingly, it's only actual science that seems to provide the actual solutions. It's a weird and strange transition from seeing people line up for polio vaccines in the '50s to abject suspicion in the 21st century to such dangerous quackery like, you know, measles vaccinations. Wright details how these phenomenons occur: once something is eradicated, we no longer see their horrifying effects, and once a disease is eradicated, we promptly forget about it, and the lessons we learned from it. That is both troubling and decidedly human.Also human? The tales she tells of the heroes: Aurelius, Father Damien, Salk. People who get their business together, and go about trying to save lives and give people comfort. Heck, it gave me comfort just knowing that these people existed.Wright has a delightful writing style, both parts humorous and informative. She managed to make me laugh while I cringed at humanity's general responses to plagues. I get her reasoning for not devoting a full chapter to AIDS, but I still think it should've been done. Tracing what happened once folks realized that the ""gay disease"" was actually a people disease, would have been interesting. And I also would've liked to see some love for SARS. It had all of the hallmarks that Wright would've loved: the public's response, the race-baiting (""blame the Asians!""), the effects of globalization on its spread, the political response...sigh. Oh well. The good thing about plagues (I never thought I'd write that line) is that there's always more to come. Here's looking forward to Get Well Soon, Vol. 2.And to Wright? Thank you, THANK YOU for keeping the horrific pictures of diseased folks in the back of the book. Had they been included throughout, I probably would've been so traumatized that I would've developed the Dancing Plague."
261,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16214729-margaret,2,"The author of this book desperately wanted to make this subject ""cool"" without taking into account the fact that people who pick up a book about plagues are probably going to be annoyed by that. The author inserts a lot of herself into the telling about these plagues, using a lot of ""I"" sentences (as another reviewer noted). I know this isn't fiction, but she also CONSTANTLY breaks the ""fourth wall"" by addressing her readers directly, e.g. ""If you managed to get through the Spanish Flu chapter and were only modestly terrified, well you're a strange human being, but settle in and prepare to have your socks scared off."" BARF. The writing is quite juvenile. Why was it necessary to mention Goodreads while discussing bad reviews given to a medical paper? Why did she need to mention Kim Kardashian in a discussion about the media coverage of the Spanish Flu during WWI? The style is just grating. I felt very patronized, as if the author feels like her readers are too vapid to be interested in medical nonfiction without adding in bits of pop culture that will make this book age VERY badly. I think the last straw for me on that point was when she threw in a reference to 50 Shades of Grey. NO. JUST NO. I gave it 2 stars overall because in between the ""look how cool I'm making this subject!"" fluff, she actually presents interesting and accurate information about each plague - I've read many of the books and authors she references (John Kelly and John Barry)."
262,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith,3,"Audiobook. Although not quite as entertaining as Charles Panati’s book “Extraordinary Endings of Everything and Everybody” (as I recall its title), this is an informative book on the history of several infectious diseases, like plague, leprosy, typhoid, cholera, Spanish flu, etc. There is also a chapter on lobotomy, not a disease, but included to fit the author’s main theme, which is that society is full of monsters. There’s a lot of monstrosity in this book. The sick have always been treated with revulsion and righteousness, which is not laudable but is understandable when you realize that for most of human existence, life was a pretty hard struggle and we are hard-wired to fear disease and to protect the healthy by leaving the weak behind - which often means dehumanizing them. The author makes the valid point that our modern, enlightened society should move beyond these attitudes, although they do still often crop up, even among those who should be aware of the errors of the past and setting an example of more compassionate thought today.It’s definitely a history book. You won’t come away from it with any deep understandings of the mechanism or treatment of infection, but it does provide some interesting facts about how the various epidemics arose and the societal atmosphere surrounding them. It makes the point that advances such as improved sanitation, antiseptics, antibiotics and immunization should also include basic human compassion for the afflicted."
263,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39353094-diabolica,5,"I have never enjoyed reading the intro and epilogue of a book more. Straight up, this is possibly the only book that has managed to rein me in, in what is generally the most boring and (what I think) the most frivolous section of the novel. I loved the writing style, both informative and hilarious. Any secondary sources she used were weaved inside her novel, so that they flowed with the text. And the annotations weren't just there for the sake of being there. Despite reading this over the span of a month, I never once lost interest. The subject, as dry as it might have been through other media, was the most griping thing I read that month. (It also didn't hurt that I didn't read much else during January). Best of all, I actually remember what I read. Most attempts leave me bored within the first thirty pages (maybe that's a sign that I shouldn't read nonfiction(?)), but this book both reeled me in, and had my attention captured. So much so that I could recount what I read. Hats off to Wright. Definitely recommend this to really anyone whose interested, even slightly, in this sort of field/topic. "
264,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"Wright is even more witty and current than my other go-to NF writer, Roach, of Stiff and Spook fame. I was interested in learning more about the past plagues and what we need to learn from them. It's so hard to wrap your mind around that many people dying -significant percentages of the population... gone. How did people deal with loss of family friends, neighbors and the accompanying grief. In those days, they had so little idea of what they were dealing with, but as Wright reminds us , it's likely only a matter of time with increased resistance to antibiotics.. Not that this is a totally gloomy read, Wright applauds the heroes, traces the medical learning curve and applies a liberal dose of gallow's humor, that I really appreciated 4 and a half fevered stars."
265,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17887800-kelley-dykes,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. How she managed to make me laugh hysterically while teaching me important facts about plagues and showing respect for their gruesome history at the same time, I’ll never know. I love books on virology and this one did not disappoint. I have read a lot on the subject and was still surprised by a lot of the little known stories and heroes in the war on plagues throughout the ages. Seriously worth a read. If you can manage to make learning about horrific things fun for an average stay at home mom, you’ve won the game."

267,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8253900-latasha,4,"this book was great and informative without being dry and hard to consume. Gabra Zackman did a great job narrating. I was doing good and handling all this scary info well until I got to the Spanish flu chapter. ok, a little scared now. then the chapter on lobotomies. I could have cried and cried. after hearing about all these terrible diseases then to hear about the horrors a man inflicted on others and not always willing people, was so heart breaking. and don't think this book is going to end on a happy note. Lastly, she discusses the AIDS outbreak of the 80's. The things some of our elected officials said and they way they joked about it was truly awful. too bad they didn't have this book back then. Maybe they could have took some inspiration from (now) Saint Damien. "
268,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54489623-the-captain,4,"Ahoy there mateys! This book is about plagues and is fascinating. The First Mate listened to this one and recommended it. We ended up listening to it together. We would stop after each chapter and discuss. It was fun. I knew nothing about the Antonine Plague of Rome. I found how widespread syphilis was to be fascinating. The monk that worked on the leper colony, Father Damien, should be a saint. The man who promoted lobotomies, Walter Jackson Freeman II, was a devil and I want to believe that he is paying for it in death. People should vaccinate their children. And seriously bursting frogs to cure the black death. Ugh! There is a lot of humor in this book which I didn’t always love but it wasn’t done disrespectfully.

And if you need a primer on pandemics, this is a nice one - BUT it isn't really anything more, just a primer. I expected something more - something more focused on specific illnesses as such; and although Wright references many books on pandemics, much of the pieces of information relayed can be found, in a not very different shape, on wikipedia.

271,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740304-linda,5,"Jennifer Wright writes with a delightful combination of snark and compassion. I thoroughly enjoyed this romp through many of history’s worst plagues. The heroes of which she speaks are not always doctors and scientists, but everyday compassionate people who care about their fellow man. There is also a villain or two. The book also comes with a bit of preaching, which I didn’t mind. There are two major lessons I think she wants us to walk away with.1) Stigmatizing and ostracizing victims of disease is not only mean and wrong, but it hinders our ability to fight the disease. This is because ashamed people hide their condition, leading to increased spreading of the disease, and decreased data for research.2) Vaccinate your kids, for crying out loud!A few quotes for your reading pleasure.“Feel free to start using Walter Jackson Freeman II as an insult directed toward people you hate. Almost no one will get the reference, but if I am in the room we’ll high-five and it will be awesome.” “Although Galen was a great physician, he was not a terribly courageous man. Galen was a self-promotor above anything else. According to McLynn, he consistently claimed to be a self-made man, casually downplaying the fact that he can from an extremely wealthy family and had inherited numerous estates as well as a stellar list of contacts. He employed underhanded tactics to win debates, and he constantly aggrandized his own achievements. Personality-wise, you could think of him as the Donald Trump of Ancient Rome.” “Full disclosure: I would have patented that vaccine and not felt guilty about it for a second. I suspect I would have used the money to do dumb stuff I thought was awesome, like start an F. Scott Fitzgerald theme park. I assume everyone else would also do that. Why doesn’t a theme park devoted to books exist? It would be so much fun.”"
272,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45392105-aleta,5,"Jennifer Wright did an incredible job with this book. Maybe I have a Macabre side to me reading this during our current Pandemic, but it's amazing how we we've repeated mistakes from the past. It was reassuring to be reminded of all the diseases we have eradicated over the Centuries and the people who came together to wage war on sickness."
273,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I picked this book up on a whim as I’m interested in the subject matter and I’m so glad I did! This was such a fantastic book and one of my favourites on the discussion of plagues to date (I’ve actually read a fair few ..)I love the references to popular culture and current and recent films which brings historical plagues into a 21st century relatability whilst also holding onto the historical nature and telling of the plagues being described. I absolutely adore her writing style in this, it’s down to earth, personable with her funny witty personality that seems to lace her words. It doesn’t detract away from the informative nature or content which is written both scientifically and in such an engaging way it’s a delight to read. It’s also written in a way that’s delicate but also to the point and doesn’t beat around the bush. I loved it! I really recommend a read if this aligns with your interests !"
274,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7812107-natalie,5,"People who don't find Jennifer Wright hilarious are people I don't want to be friends with. There. That is the most important thing you need to know regarding my opinion of this book.MY OTHER OPINIONS1. This was incredibly interesting. I learned more reading this than I did in four years of high school. I was telling all my friends and co-workers about it. 2. This took me forever to read because I didn't want it to end. I would pick it up only as a special treat to myself - like chocolates or a massage. 3. Walter Jackson Freeman II was a total POS. That's not really an opinion. That's a fact. Unless you believe otherwise. In that case, you are also a POS. I want to read a million books by this author. Unfortunately, her supply does not meet my demand currently, so I'll just need to savor what I do have. 5 Stars"
275,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl,5,"I'm not sure whether it's something to be proud of or not, but I've always been fascinated by disease and plagues. So when I came across this book, I knew I had to read it. It did not disappoint.I could see how some people would find Wright's casual and almost flippant tone at times to be a little off-putting, but for me, I felt as if we were two women discussing these horrific plagues and diseases over a cup of coffee. And there's just enough lightness to keep the book from being completely and utterly depressing, even if we still have no idea where the Spanish flu came from, and no way to combat it if it ever decided to come out of hibernation. My only consolation is I'm perhaps a bit too old at 38 to be at the greatest risk of dying from the Spanish flu. (Also can we please quit calling stomach bugs the ""flu""? It is not the flu. Influenza, even the non-Spanish version, will knock you on your back for a couple of weeks. If you are up and about the next day or the day after, you do not have the flu. /end rant)This book will also annoy anti-vaxxers to no end, as Wright goes on quite the rant regarding the need for and the safety of vaccines at the end of the chapter on smallpox. I do believe that we're so far removed from these terrible diseases that it's lulled people into a false sense of security, that the diseases every child experienced in the pre-vaccination age weren't really that bad. But when you realize that milkmaids were very proud of the fact that they'd never ""lose their beauty"" (ie, become horribly disfigured) thanks to smallpox, having had cowpox already, you start think, ""Hmm, perhaps smallpox *was* pretty damn bad."" And without vaccines, children would still be paralyzed every summer thanks to contracting polio. That's not exactly a world I'd like to return to.I especially liked that Wright stepped outside the box a bit, and told us about some lesser-known plagues, like the dancing plague and encephalitis lethargica. But the scariest bits were how quickly we forget the terror of losing so many thanks to an extremely contagious disease. I can't even imagine watching bodies pile up in the streets, as they did in Philadelphia just a hundred years ago during the Spanish flu. Yet we need to remember, and begin to plan for an epidemic like this to happen again. It seems as if we're just about due for another outbreak.I highly recommend this book, especially since Wright keeps the terrifying photos to a section at the end of the book that one doesn't have to look at. It's so informative, yet accessible thanks to her chatty prose. I can't wait to read her previous book, It Ended Badly: Thirteen of the Worst Breakups in History. I have a feeling I'll love it just as much, and I truly hope Wright continues to write these fascinating books."
276,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19228026-phyllis,4,"I planned on a four star rating but the more I read, the more I liked it. So I gave it 4.5. I've read several books about epidemics, plagues and am always fascinated by how diseases and their victims are treated. The author has done a tremendous amount of research and also has a sense of humor, just enough to get you through some of the horrible aspects of these epidemics. A quote from the leprosy chapter about Father Damien, the priest who went to live and care for the lepers on the island of Molokai, ""Damien is a reminder that you don't have to be a genius or a brilliant scientist or a doctor to help in this war against disease: you just have to be someone who gives a damn about your fellow man"".  In the chapter on the Spanish Influenza she talks about the president who controlled the press and wouldn't allow anything about this massive, deadly epidemic to appear in any newspaper. We should never allow presidents to control the press. Another excellent book on the Spanish Influenza The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History"
277,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,4,"I finished this one a few days ago and while I found it interesting, the social commentary from the author was a little hit and miss. Jennifer Wright gives us a great overview of some of the worst of the worst plagues and misses the AIDS plague which I was hoping would've provided us some insight. The book is a 3.5 and I liked it enough to keep reading. Some of the humour didn't fit and I'm a huge fan of pop culture but I was a little baffled here. Wright should of left some of the commentary to the later part of the chapters, giving us a brief overview of the cleverness she clearly has. If you don't know too much about plagues like myself and you hear anyone running around with crazy ideas on plagues, shove this book in their hands. It gives you a large amount of information but I just think it didn't flow like it should've. Others clearly think better of it and have pegged this at 5, I just wanted a lot more input from the author. The book needed to be longer but maybe she will deliver a follow-up which will blow our minds. "
278,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen,4,"Wright is a bit of a Mary Roach—funny and voice-y and opinionated, while simultaneously unloading lots of learning about the history of disease. She is firmly on the side of sufferers and the people who’ve tried to help them, and just as firmly condemns anyone who has judged, abandoned, or exploited the sick. From the dancing plague of the sixteenth century to typhoid, cholera, and polio—by way of lobotomies and a brief mention of AIDS—she covers the pestilential waterfront. Taught me stuff and made me smile on my commute. "

281,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36933045-rosemary-standeven,5,"This is a surprisingly readable, informative and amusing book – given its subject – and ideally suited to the current worldwide crisis. Some of the plagues I already knew a lot about (Syphilis and Tuberculosis), having written assignments on them for my Herbal Medicine degree (and NO, herbal medicine will NOT cure either of them, I just found the diseases interesting). Others I knew a bit about, but learned so much more. For instance – the so-called Spanish Flu originated in Kansas, USA, but due to WWI media restrictions no-one in USA, Britain etc was allowed to report on it. Spain was neutral, reported the deaths, and so got the blame. The dancing plague in Strasbourg was entirely new to me.There is a lot to be learned from the genesis, spread and treatment of old plagues that can be applied to the current COVID19, and the author does not shy away from scathing comments on doctors and politicians who were more interested in their own affairs than helping the public. There is also repeated (and wholly deserved) condemnation of Anti-vaxxers and people who will not listen to the genuine experts, and believe that they know best, despite overwhelming scientific proof of the idiocy and public danger of their claims. (“Ask the Aztecs and Incas whether or not they would have liked to have vaccines available to them. Oh, wait, you can’t, they’re dead.” One thing that stands out above all others, is the need for courageous, empathetic, intelligent and decisive leadership in the face of plagues – something that is in short supply just now (except in NZ and maybe Germany).Amongst all the death and suffering, there are some heart-warming stories, some real heroes, and some serendipitous good fortune. The book is ultimately about the resilience of the human spirit, and about how we can get through plagues, bad medicine and the current crisis, if we would just learn from past errors.Some quotes I liked:Dancing plague: “is lovely to see that all the edicts related to helping the suffering people. The community did not want their fellow neighbors to die and were experimenting on many fronts to help the afflicted. Today we still have outbreaks where we become so fearful for ourselves that we forget all about our neighbors. The people of Strasbourg were ahead of their time in their regard for one another. … there is never a situation where care and attentiveness by the community is a bad thing.”Cholera:  “He became such a firm convert to Snow’s theory that until his death Whitehead kept over his desk a portrait of Snow, which, he noted, “ever serves to remind me that in any profession the highest order of work is achieved not by fussy demand for ‘something to be done,’ but by patient study of the eternal laws.””“The best-case scenario when it comes to the outbreak of a disease is that the community will rally around the afflicted. It will tend to them gently; it will raise funds; it will do whatever is necessary to allow the people stricken with the disease to live with dignity while science searches for a cure.” Spanish ‘flu’:  “In spite of our First World desire to believe that diseases are fundamentally exotic imports, the first case of the Spanish flu epidemic was reported to the weekly journal Public Health Reports by Dr. Loring Miner of Haskell, Kansas, in March 1918.” “This might be a good time to mention that if you learn about an airborne virus that seems to be killing otherwise healthy young people in your area from a reputable medical journal, you are reading very bad news. Go to the grocery store and start stocking up on supplies immediately. If you have someplace relatively isolated to live, go there. Doing so might feel a bit silly or paranoid, but, honestly, neither of those responses would be overreactions.”“We are fortunate today to have organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization that track how diseases are progressing and report these findings. In the event of an outbreak similar to the Spanish flu, they will be wonderful resources.” – WHICH NEED FUNDING NOT CUTS!!!Lobotomies: “Part of the blame lies with a midcentury zeal for conformity. People were willing to sacrifice whole personalities to make those who seemed different and unusual more like everyone else. Some who turned to lobotomies desperately yearned for a cure for their ailments; others were suffering from nothing more than human frailty.”Polio: “Our main problem now,” said Thomas Rivers, a leader in viral research who oversaw the clinical trials of Salk’s vaccine in 1956, “is not that anything is wrong with the Salk vaccine, but that something is wrong with the people who won’t take it.”"
282,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2323418-abbey,4,"4.5 stars - it is so weird to say a book about diseases was a fun read. Wright uses such great humor through devastating parts of history in a way that’s respectful of the trauma. I’d heard of most of these plagues, but I knew zero details. This was fascinating and an easy way to get that information. It reminds me in some ways of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks in that it reminds us the importance of science while keeping the humanity in mind.Also, PLEASE VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN"

Or that people ""cured"" the bubonic plague with exploding frogs? Also, one word: Lobotomobile.Stories you might have some familiarity with come to life in a deeper way with modern hindsight and funny (or frightening) modern relevance. Perfect for history buffs, people looking for some historical perspective after the election, and the hypochondriac in all of us."

I still learned a fair amount though, and for all her jokes, it's clear that the book is very well researched and that she is passionate about her subject, which I really appreciated. However, if you're looking for a serious academic treatise on diseases, this isn't it.The only chapter I felt was out of place was the one on lobotomies. Yes, they are awful and terrifying, but not a disease."
285,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5837016-nadia,4,"After reading some of it, the tone is so intimate, so filled with well researched whimsy it brings you to truly discover why such strange things happened around the globe. She gets right into the dirt on all subjects with chronological chaos and effect. Sharply written, you won't be disappointed. "

There is still no cure for EL, and its rise and subsequent disappearance is still regarded as something of a mystery.
I have heard of this before but only in the obscure and morbidly fascinating sense, think more horror movie than documentary. The unknown-ness of this one draws me and repels me away. Reading about how it affected people's personalities, bodily functions, and sent them into comas is frightening. 
If you are interested in following a line of thought on interrelated diseases, though, some scientists today think that EL is related to streptococcal bacteria, so that’s a fun thing to consider when you get strep throat.
I have never heard and this and can I just say WHAT?!? Reading about how adult's showed after effects of Postencephalitic Parkinson’s disease which led them to L-dopa as a cure and how it initially worked, the woman waking up from a coma years later and thinking it was early 1940s when it was late 1960s, was wild. I think this ""plague"" was added to just scare the crap out of everyone as there is still no known cure but I guess it hasn't made any more appearances? This is one I'm going to have to investigate further because how freaking wild that it seems to suddenly appear in 1916 and disappear in 1920s. I guess I'd put my bet on Aliens.Lobotomies
Somewhere between 60 and 80 percent of lobotomies were performed on women, despite a greater percentage of men being institutionalized.
This probably shouldn't have been included in a plague book but it is important to discuss, so I'll allow it. I'm against lobotomies, so I had no problem how the author discussed Freeman, the physician behind the start, procedure, and craze of them. The accounts of how he went about them, snipping here and there, until he got the desired amount of not quite comatose in patients, is horrifying and rage inducing. 
A charismatic demagogue was elevated and trusted because he was captivating and because researching facts, as well as listening to dull doctors who have done their homework, is hard and time-consuming.
This quote, I can't tell you how much I feel this quote down into my soul right now. Reading about how women who were listed as menopausal or hysterical, by doctors that didn't even converse with them but rather their husbands and given over to Freeman for lobotomies had me fighting tears. This chapter was all about making sure there are committees, watchdogs, or the like in place to stop charismatic, mad medical field individuals from dazzling people with their ""science"".Polio 
Well, herd immunity works for most diseases only if about 80 to 90 percent of the population is vaccinated. With some diseases, like measles, a 95 percent vaccination rate is necessary.
Again, vaccinate your kids. I have to say, I'm not sure I knew Polio came from contaminated water or food, kind of like typhoid. That is how well we eradicated it, I didn't even know what caused it! The author talked about live virus and killer virus vaccines and the rivalry between Salk and Sabin to get there. I've heard of Salk before because of how he used unwittingly mental health patients for clinical trials, which the author mentioned but after saying he should be considered close to a saint. I'm not quite there on him but I'm a grey shades person and as long as you mention the shitty aspects I don't have a problem stating all the good he also did. Seems wild in today's atmosphere of people dying because the price of their insulin is too much money that he didn't patent his vaccine but I'd like to read more on the legalities of if and how he could have. My favorite part of this section was the focus on how representation matters and how FDR gave hope and pride to fellow Polio survivors. 
Those who had AIDS survived because they, like Mr. Crumpton’s No Nose’d Club for syphilitics, founded groups like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP to fight for their right to live. They supported one another. They protested. They yelled. They made people extremely uncomfortable.
I'm not a scientist or in the medical field, so there was definitely new information for me to gain from reading this. I went in thinking this was going to be a drier, informative read but realized very early on that my expectations needed to be changed. This is more of a coffee table book where casual readers can just pick it up and learn some interesting facts that will either make them popular on trivia night or send them down a drier text reading rabbit hole. The author has a sarcastic, pop culture heavy tone that could turn some people off as we discussing real horrible deaths but I'm a bit of a gallows humor gal myself, so except for a couple times, I wasn't put off or offended. I do think the pop culture references are going to date this and age it out of future circulation. All in all, I learned some facts, was intrigued to research some, and enjoyed this more surface look into diseases. This book is not for experts in the field but the average person could definitely get something out of it. However, if you're an anti-vaxxer, you'd probably get huffy over the author's constant reminder that you should probably reevaluate your thinking (I completely agree with her)."
288,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15983295-carmen,5,"Putting a hilarious spin on history in all the right places, Jennifer Wright will crack you up while telling you all about some of the worst plagues that have been documented. If you’re someone who hears about diseases or ailments and immediately think that you have them, this book might not be for you. However, if you’re someone who likes to read about history and are interested in learning about some of the most notable disease outbreaks, this is the book for you.When I picked up this book, I was not expecting to laugh as much as I did. Don’t get me wrong; the subject matter is serious, but Jennifer has a sense of humor that translates well even in nonfiction. Every time she inserts a photo, the caption has me rolling. At one point, there’s an illustration showing two people being treated for the Bubonic Plague. Her caption reads:“These guys were lucky—they had pillows and an in-home wizard.”There was never a funny moment that was horribly misplaced. There are chapters where the author is not funny because there just isn’t a time for it. However, other chapters let her personality shine through in sections and I was cracking up. It’s not a book that has a monotone voice like some nonfiction novels have.I learned a lot throughout the chapters. I had heard of majority of the diseases and had some knowledge about them, but the only one I really knew a lot about was the travesty that was lobotomies. This is the one chapter that’s not an actual disease but rather a horrific catch-all treatment that did a lot of harm to the people who were operated on. There’s a lot of interesting information throughout the chapters including some interesting cases and notable names, treatment attempts, and cases.This is an excellent book that’s perfect for anyone’s collection in addition to making a great gift for those interested in historical overviews."
289,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,5,Informative and fun in equal measure.
290,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6367659-poligirlreads,5,"Given that I can develop a disease based on the power of suggestion alone (""Doc, I've been watching the news on prostate cancer, and now I think think there's something wrong with my prostate."" ""You're a chick. You don't have a prostate."" ""That's precisely what makes this situation all the more dire.""), I probably should've taken a hard pass on this book. But given my love of Wright's previous book, It Ended Badly, I knew I needed to read this one. As a result, I now want to hunker down in basement and wear a gas mask 24/7 to ward off any potential plagues, but despite that, this is a most excellent read.You know how people talk about how in order to understand the present, you have to look toward the past? Boy is this the perfect book within the context of the anti-vaxxers. History is always trying out ""natural"" cures like rubbing the body down in onions and whatnot, and amazingly, it's only actual science that seems to provide the actual solutions. It's a weird and strange transition from seeing people line up for polio vaccines in the '50s to abject suspicion in the 21st century to such dangerous quackery like, you know, measles vaccinations. Wright details how these phenomenons occur: once something is eradicated, we no longer see their horrifying effects, and once a disease is eradicated, we promptly forget about it, and the lessons we learned from it. That is both troubling and decidedly human.Also human? The tales she tells of the heroes: Aurelius, Father Damien, Salk. People who get their business together, and go about trying to save lives and give people comfort. Heck, it gave me comfort just knowing that these people existed.Wright has a delightful writing style, both parts humorous and informative. She managed to make me laugh while I cringed at humanity's general responses to plagues. I get her reasoning for not devoting a full chapter to AIDS, but I still think it should've been done. Tracing what happened once folks realized that the ""gay disease"" was actually a people disease, would have been interesting. And I also would've liked to see some love for SARS. It had all of the hallmarks that Wright would've loved: the public's response, the race-baiting (""blame the Asians!""), the effects of globalization on its spread, the political response...sigh. Oh well. The good thing about plagues (I never thought I'd write that line) is that there's always more to come. Here's looking forward to Get Well Soon, Vol. 2.And to Wright? Thank you, THANK YOU for keeping the horrific pictures of diseased folks in the back of the book. Had they been included throughout, I probably would've been so traumatized that I would've developed the Dancing Plague."
291,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16214729-margaret,2,"The author of this book desperately wanted to make this subject ""cool"" without taking into account the fact that people who pick up a book about plagues are probably going to be annoyed by that. The author inserts a lot of herself into the telling about these plagues, using a lot of ""I"" sentences (as another reviewer noted). I know this isn't fiction, but she also CONSTANTLY breaks the ""fourth wall"" by addressing her readers directly, e.g. ""If you managed to get through the Spanish Flu chapter and were only modestly terrified, well you're a strange human being, but settle in and prepare to have your socks scared off."" BARF. The writing is quite juvenile. Why was it necessary to mention Goodreads while discussing bad reviews given to a medical paper? Why did she need to mention Kim Kardashian in a discussion about the media coverage of the Spanish Flu during WWI? The style is just grating. I felt very patronized, as if the author feels like her readers are too vapid to be interested in medical nonfiction without adding in bits of pop culture that will make this book age VERY badly. I think the last straw for me on that point was when she threw in a reference to 50 Shades of Grey. NO. JUST NO. I gave it 2 stars overall because in between the ""look how cool I'm making this subject!"" fluff, she actually presents interesting and accurate information about each plague - I've read many of the books and authors she references (John Kelly and John Barry)."
292,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith,3,"Audiobook. Although not quite as entertaining as Charles Panati’s book “Extraordinary Endings of Everything and Everybody” (as I recall its title), this is an informative book on the history of several infectious diseases, like plague, leprosy, typhoid, cholera, Spanish flu, etc. There is also a chapter on lobotomy, not a disease, but included to fit the author’s main theme, which is that society is full of monsters. There’s a lot of monstrosity in this book. The sick have always been treated with revulsion and righteousness, which is not laudable but is understandable when you realize that for most of human existence, life was a pretty hard struggle and we are hard-wired to fear disease and to protect the healthy by leaving the weak behind - which often means dehumanizing them. The author makes the valid point that our modern, enlightened society should move beyond these attitudes, although they do still often crop up, even among those who should be aware of the errors of the past and setting an example of more compassionate thought today.It’s definitely a history book. You won’t come away from it with any deep understandings of the mechanism or treatment of infection, but it does provide some interesting facts about how the various epidemics arose and the societal atmosphere surrounding them. It makes the point that advances such as improved sanitation, antiseptics, antibiotics and immunization should also include basic human compassion for the afflicted."
293,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39353094-diabolica,5,"I have never enjoyed reading the intro and epilogue of a book more. Straight up, this is possibly the only book that has managed to rein me in, in what is generally the most boring and (what I think) the most frivolous section of the novel. I loved the writing style, both informative and hilarious. Any secondary sources she used were weaved inside her novel, so that they flowed with the text. And the annotations weren't just there for the sake of being there. Despite reading this over the span of a month, I never once lost interest. The subject, as dry as it might have been through other media, was the most griping thing I read that month. (It also didn't hurt that I didn't read much else during January). Best of all, I actually remember what I read. Most attempts leave me bored within the first thirty pages (maybe that's a sign that I shouldn't read nonfiction(?)), but this book both reeled me in, and had my attention captured. So much so that I could recount what I read. Hats off to Wright. Definitely recommend this to really anyone whose interested, even slightly, in this sort of field/topic. "
294,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"Wright is even more witty and current than my other go-to NF writer, Roach, of Stiff and Spook fame. I was interested in learning more about the past plagues and what we need to learn from them. It's so hard to wrap your mind around that many people dying -significant percentages of the population... gone. How did people deal with loss of family friends, neighbors and the accompanying grief. In those days, they had so little idea of what they were dealing with, but as Wright reminds us , it's likely only a matter of time with increased resistance to antibiotics.. Not that this is a totally gloomy read, Wright applauds the heroes, traces the medical learning curve and applies a liberal dose of gallow's humor, that I really appreciated 4 and a half fevered stars."
295,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17887800-kelley-dykes,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. How she managed to make me laugh hysterically while teaching me important facts about plagues and showing respect for their gruesome history at the same time, I’ll never know. I love books on virology and this one did not disappoint. I have read a lot on the subject and was still surprised by a lot of the little known stories and heroes in the war on plagues throughout the ages. Seriously worth a read. If you can manage to make learning about horrific things fun for an average stay at home mom, you’ve won the game."

297,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8253900-latasha,4,"this book was great and informative without being dry and hard to consume. Gabra Zackman did a great job narrating. I was doing good and handling all this scary info well until I got to the Spanish flu chapter. ok, a little scared now. then the chapter on lobotomies. I could have cried and cried. after hearing about all these terrible diseases then to hear about the horrors a man inflicted on others and not always willing people, was so heart breaking. and don't think this book is going to end on a happy note. Lastly, she discusses the AIDS outbreak of the 80's. The things some of our elected officials said and they way they joked about it was truly awful. too bad they didn't have this book back then. Maybe they could have took some inspiration from (now) Saint Damien. "
298,1627797467,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54489623-the-captain,4,"Ahoy there mateys! This book is about plagues and is fascinating. The First Mate listened to this one and recommended it. We ended up listening to it together. We would stop after each chapter and discuss. It was fun. I knew nothing about the Antonine Plague of Rome. I found how widespread syphilis was to be fascinating. The monk that worked on the leper colony, Father Damien, should be a saint. The man who promoted lobotomies, Walter Jackson Freeman II, was a devil and I want to believe that he is paying for it in death. People should vaccinate their children. And seriously bursting frogs to cure the black death. Ugh! There is a lot of humor in this book which I didn’t always love but it wasn’t done disrespectfully. I wouldn’t mind reading more of this author’s works. Arrr!Check out me other reviews at https://thecaptainsquartersblog.wordp..."

And if you need a primer on pandemics, this is a nice one - BUT it isn't really anything more, just a primer. I expected something more - something more focused on specific illnesses as such; and although Wright references many books on pandemics, much of the pieces of information relayed can be found, in a not very different shape, on wikipedia.
