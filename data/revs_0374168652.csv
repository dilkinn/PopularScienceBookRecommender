Writing not only creates a record but a way in which to see, understand and reflect on all that we do. This includes the field of research and Sandeep Jauhar who has become quite a prominent voice in medicine regales us with “Heart: A History.” He weaves the tale expertly---as if he were creating a biography on this wonderful organ.   ""It looked like a reentrant spiral wave, the signature of the heart's death...my head was spinning.""  ---Sandeep Jauhar Jauhar is blatantly honest and he starts out with his own medical file and is transparent as glass. This book is personal and Sandeep connects with his audience---as only a specialist can. The journey starts off with a family member that was suffering from a heart condition and the description of the heart as an “untouchable” organ is truly poetic in this read. The geography of the heart is sublime. Highly placed and, in the center, giving us a clear visual of its glory. Heart disease---still remains the leading cause of death and it’s important that we care for this beating miracle. Over 100 years of heart history is discussed. His time with cardiology giants (eccentric ones) like Shapiro and his description is comical “he had a canine appearance” or “bearded art carnie.” Any physician should make a point of reading this book and it’s not necessarily geared for non-medical healthcare workers. Nice read and challenging. Cardiology is fast paced and different compared to the diagnosticians of neurology. The heart is the center and greatness emanates from here, starting with this small spark and traveling throughout to harmonize the senses. Heart health comes from the many social connections, lifestyle and the exchanges we have with others. Buy and breathe deeply."

I devoured this book, thoroughly enjoyed the anecdotes and learned so much. According to author Dr. Sandeep Jauhar, “This book is about what the heart is, how it has been handled by medicine, and how we can most wisely live with – as well as by – our hearts in the future.”Dr. Jauhar, a medical doctor, found himself out of breath, went to go get checked out and learned, along with other minor issues, his main artery feeding into his heart had a “30 to 50 percent obstruction near the opening and a 50 percent blockage in the mid portion.” His paternal grandfather died of a heart attack at 57 years old and his maternal grandfather at 83. His personal and familial experiences have guided his career and currently he is a cardiologist and the director of the Heart Failure Program at Long Island Jewish Medical Center. “Understanding how and why my grandfather had died, and what implications his premature death had for my father, my siblings, and me, was fundamentally intertwined with my decision to train in cardiology.”Filled with medical history and peppered with incredible stories of brave doctors who risked their own lives to study the heart, Heart: A History is incredibly informative and includes comprehensible descriptions of experiments and procedures that assisted in the understanding of how the heart works and how medicine has improved drastically so today we can fix certain problems.Since 1910, cardiovascular disease has been the number one killer, claiming 18 million lives a year. “The scale of heart disease in the 1950s was like that of AIDS in the 1980s: a disease that dominated American medicine both clinically and politically. More than 600,000 Americans were dying of heart disease every year. In 1945, the budget for medical research at the National Institutes of Health was $180,000. Five years later, it was $46 million. ” Based on research, heart health in this country is declining and we are challenged with finding new solutions. Heart transplants are successful but we will never have enough hearts available for those in need, so other solutions to heart disease must be pursued.Dr. Jauhar talks about how we associate the heart with our feelings and use the name of the organ to represent emotions, like wear your heart on your sleeve, your heart’s not in it, change of heart, bleeding heart. Even though these are just expressions, feelings and emotions often have a big effect on the heart and how it reacts to stresses and general overall function. “Over the years, I have learned that the proper care of my patients depends on trying to understand (or at least recognize) their emotional states, stresses, worries, and fears. There is no other way to practice heart medicine. For even if the heart is not the seat of the emotions, it is highly responsive to them. (The) “biological heart is extraordinarily sensitive to our emotional system—to the metaphorical heart”. “The autonomic nervous system has two divisions: the “sympathetic” system, which mediates the fight-or-flight reaction, using adrenaline to speed up the heart and increase blood pressure; and the “parasympathetic” system, which has the opposite effect, slowing respirations and heartbeat, lowering blood pressure, and promoting digestion. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves travel along blood vessels and terminate in nerve cells within the heart to help regulate the heart’s emotional reactions.”Procedures and practices have advanced greatly over the past 75 years. In the late 1940s chest compressions were discovered to help raise blood pressure and now are common practice in resuscitations. In 1954 advanced open heart surgery was extremely rare (being done by only one doctor) using cross circulation (another healthy person as a donor). In 1977 the first balloon coronary angioplasty was performed in Switzerland. The doctor came to the United States in 1980 to continue his research. This led to clot busting drugs (which although still experimental and not approved by the FDA at the time, saved my father’s life as he suffered a heart attacking in the late 1980s). The automatic defibrillator was approved by the FDA in 1985. Even though there has been a drop in cardiovascular mortality, we still must continue on the path of research and discovery.Heart: A History was easy to read, filled with great stories and research and provided an exciting overview of monumental strides made in twentieth century medicine. It also fed my curiosity and obsession with surgery that often gets fulfilled while watching medical shows on tv including Chicago Med, Untold Stories of the ER and the graphic Dr. Pimple Popper! I highly recommend this book to those who have a curiosity about science and the heart."
2,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,4,"This book is not for the faint of heart (har har) but was a great read for Science September from personal history with heart disease and training as a heart specialist to the history of how our understanding of the heart has developed, and with it treatments for various ailments. I was interested to read that meditation often does as much as medication, and emerging research on the connection between anxiety/stress and the heart. I recently had AED training when I was CPR certified but had no idea that technology was (relatively) so new, younger than me. On a level of greater detail, and don't read on if you're squeamish - Dr. Jauhar describes the first self-catheterization in agonizing detail and I threw the book down mid-sentence (and I'm the least squeamish person I know!) Experiments on animals that led to major heart discoveries are explained in great detail that might be difficult to read for a lot of animal lovers. And since the author was a doctor working in the makeshift morgues at ground zero for 9/11, you should be prepared for some pretty gruesome detail from that day, not heart related, or at least so it seems at first."
3,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"(3.5) There could hardly be an author better qualified to deliver this thorough history of the heart and the treatment of its problems. Sandeep Jauhar is the director of the Heart Failure Program at Long Island Medical Center. His family history – both grandfathers died of sudden cardiac events in India, one after being bitten by a snake – prompted an obsession with the heart, and he and his brother both became cardiologists. As the book opens, Jauhar was shocked to learn he had up to a 50% blockage of his own coronary vessels. Things had really gotten personal.Cardiovascular disease has been the #1 killer in the West since 1910 and, thanks to steady smoking rates and a continuing rise in obesity and sedentary lifestyles, will still affect 60% of Americans. However, the key is that fewer people will now die of heart disease thanks to the developments of the last six decades in particular. These include the heart–lung machine, cardiac catheterization, heart transplantation, and artificial hearts.Along the timeline, Jauhar peppers in bits of his own professional and academic experience, like experimenting on frogs during high school in California and meeting his first cadaver at medical school. My favorite chapter was the twelfth, “Vulnerable Heart,” which is about how trauma can cause heart arrhythmias; it opens with an account of the author’s days cataloguing body parts in a makeshift morgue as a 9/11 first responder. I also particularly liked his account of being called out of bed to perform an echocardiogram, which required catching a taxi at 3 a.m. and avoiding New York City’s rats.Maybe I’ve read too much surgical history this year (The Butchering Art by Lindsey Fitzharris and Face to Face by Jim McCaul), though, because I found myself growing fairly impatient with the medical details in the long Part II, which centers on the heart as a machine, and was drawn more to the autobiographical material in the first and final sections. Perhaps I would prefer Jauhar’s first book, Intern: A Doctor’s Initiation.In terms of readalikes, I’d mention Siddhartha Mukherjee’s The Gene, in which the personal story also takes something of a backseat to the science, and Gavin Francis’s Shapeshifters, which exhibits a similar interest in the metaphors applied to the body. While I didn’t enjoy this quite as much as two other heart-themed memoirs I’ve read, The Sanctuary of Illness by Thomas Larson and Echoes of Heartsounds by Martha Weinman Lear, I still think it’s a strong contender for next year’s Wellcome Book Prize (the judging panel is announced tomorrow!).Some favorite lines:“it is increasingly clear that the biological heart is extraordinarily sensitive to our emotional system—to the metaphorical heart, if you will.”“Who but the owner can say what lies inside a human heart?”“As a heart-failure specialist, I’d experienced enough death to fill up a lifetime. At one time, it was difficult to witness the grief of loved ones. But my heart had been hardened, and this was no longer that time.”Originally published on my blog, Bookish Beck."
4,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7765576-janet-newport,4,"As do many of us in later life, health challenges abound. Mine are cardiac in nature and I hoped for a better understanding of them through this book.I did get a much better understanding of my personal issues as well as a fairly complete history of the treatment of heart related issues. I appreciated Dr. Jauhar's telling of his own personal experiences of heart disease and family history. He was almost philosophical explaining the effects of emotions and exterior trauma on the heart. Overall an easy to read book, except for the truly technical stuff... As far as I'm concerned, there's a lot of ""magic"" in the world.... electricity and the internet for example."
5,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7265027-patricia,2,"This book had a lot of heart, but lacked purpose."
6,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15626106-helen,4,"I have worked my entire nursing career in a cardiac hospital so I was very interested in Sandeep Jahar’s book titled Heart: A History. Dr. Jahar is a cardiologist and a very good writer. The book gives an interesting history of how cardiac care has advanced throughout the years and it is written in layman’s terms so everyone can enjoy it. I especially liked his stories about his patients. I read his first book, Intern, many years ago so I was anxious to read his latest book and I was not disappointed. Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for the advanced reader’s copy. This is my unbiased review.  "
7,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63277467-hayley-stenger,3,"I read this book because it was the pick for the Now Read This, New York Times/PBS book club. It was more technical than was I hoping for. I learned a lot, but honestly could have used some more explanation than was offered and some more stories and detail. I appreciate the work doctors have done, I understand and could see how valuable their work was/is, but animal testing is difficult for me to read about."
8,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author, a cardiologist, explores the history of the heart, from its symbolism to the newest artificial hearts. He begins with his own story, chronicling an odd shortness of breath that results in a diagnosis of arterial blockage. He discusses some of his family history, from the probable heart attack that killed his paternal grandfather after being bitten by a cobra, to his mother's death of a heart attack in her sleep after a battle with Parkinson's. The heart, he concludes, is the life-bringer and the sudden death-dealer. In between, he relates several case studies and the stories of prescient pioneers in medical history, from Galen to the first balloon angioplasty to stents to Christiaan Barnard and the artificial heart. There are amazing facts throughout the book, such as how the heart begins beating in utero even before there is even any blood to flow, or how many miles of blood vessels there are in the human body, or how quickly one would die if the atrium of the heart is nicked. And it's also incredible to think that so many cardiac advances were made by mad geniuses who tested out their ideas on themselves, like Werner Forssmann, who pushed a wire through a vein in his arm until it touched his right atrium. But the core of this book, its heart if you will, is the underlying thesis that while we have made truly uncanny strides in medicine, from viewing the heart as literally untouchable to being able to sustain human life without a heart at all, the emotional heart and the physical organ are inextricably connected. While some of the book's subjects say that the heart is a pump and their work is ""just plumbing,"" Jauhar shows that to be dismissive and disingenuous. Studies have shown that all other factors being equal, a connected social life and a stress-free environment keep the heart going. For this dire warning alone, this fascinating history is well worth reading."
9,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/671457-carin,4,"It's odd that I am squeamish and yet like medical books. I nearly failed high school biology (and to be honest, I should have failed it. I only passed by cheating. Sorry, Mom.) and yet decades later, I wonder about those organs I tried not to look at too closely in my little frog.I read Dr. Jauhar's first medical memoir, Interned, years ago. (Unfortunately, I missed his second memoir. This is his third.) Like in Atul Gawande's Being Mortal, in this one, Dr. Jauhar is not just the medical expert, but he also becomes a patient in his own arena. He is a cardiologist, and he got his brother (also a cardiologist) to run some tests and found his cardiac arteries were mostly blocked, while he was still on the young side of middle age. His grandfather died of a sudden heart attack, and many members of his family have heart problems.But it is not just a memoir. It is about how the heart itself functions, including the ludicrous idea still circulating today that it's where ""love"" is (the first heart transplant patient's wife asked the doctors if he would still love her after the surgery.) It is about the history of the understand of the heart, and the history of cardiology. Even years after we were exploring the brain, the heart was still considered off limits to doctors. And as Dr. Jauhar remembers his training in cardiology and how he learned important facets of his field, he elucidates this vital organ in all its mystery and simplicity.If you have any interest in the medical field at all, even tangential like mine, this is an excellent book."
10,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13026905-ruthanne-johnston,5,"Five educated stars for this fascinating book. It’s educational, also a personal memoir of the life of a brilliantly-trained young cardiac surgeon, along with case studies of his most interesting patients and bits and pieces of his philosophy about such arguable subjects of”humans actually dying of grief and a broken heart.”As for the historical part, he goes back into 11th century medicine and explains how the body’s circulation was a much-errored mystery and how it was finally solved. All this was so fascinating to me because we had so much of the practical to learn in nursing school that there wasn’t time to study ancient medical history or Hippocrates or Galen. One caution if you listen to the audio version like I did, narrated by the author who speaks distinctly but quite slowly. You might want to turn your device speed up a bit."
11,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36362539-connie,3,"This is a beautifully written book that is a quick read and interesting. That being said, I felt like I was in a lecture hall in college."
12,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52593750-siltsu,5,"What a remarkable book! It’s the history of treating the heart and heart related issues, told through the stories of the trail blazing doctors, medical personnel and engineers who wanted to conquer the mysteries of the life giving organ, sometimes even using their own hearts and bodies as experiments. The book is so well written that even the most complicated issues are easy to understand and I feel that I now have a completely new perspective to heart health. I now intend to start taking a lot better care of my own heart than I have before. Other than great knowlege and storytelling, the book simply has a lot of heart (ha ha). Dr. Jauhar has experience as a cardiologist of course but he also has personal history with the heart. His grandfather and mother died of heartattacks and at the beginning of the book he himself finds out that he has some trouble with his coronary arteries. He also knows that the heart is not hurt by just physical changes but emotional ones, too. Did you know that when you have your metaphorical heart broken it actually effects the heart in your chest as well? Or that stress is detrimental to your heart health? Dr. Jauhar talks about these issues and of the reasons why the heart has a lot of symbolism attached to it. And how the symbolism has at times even been a hindrance to examining the heart. All in all a great and informative book I’d recommend to anyone interested in the history of science, though please note that some of the descriptions of different medical experiments were kind of gruesome."
13,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91696117-tullyn,3,"This was a surprisingly addictive read, with the author masterfully weaving the scientific with the anecdotal. "
14,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76472553-leah-porter,5,"A truly beautiful history of the complexities of the heart, both from a medical standpoint and from an emotional one. I loved every minute of this beautiful book!"
15,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1772612-wendy,5,"Exquisite exploration of the heart itself, the history of treatments developed to heal it, and anecdotes that add (not detract) from the narrative. I'm definitely not a doctor, but this book struck a perfect chord of science and story. "
16,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43944855-laura,3,"Heart, by cardiologist Sandeep Jauhar, has been longlisted for this year’s Wellcome Prize. It’s a stroll through the history of heart surgery interwoven with Jauhar’s own career as a surgeon and his own family’s experience of heart disease – a history that’s catching up with him, as he discovers plaques in his own coronary arteries during a CT scan. Jauhar writes better about cardiology than does Stephen Westaby in Fragile Lives, but his prose is still workmanlike rather than memorable; it never reaches the heights of Henry Marsh’s Do No Harm or Atul Gawande’s Being Mortal. The structure, at times, was a bit annoying, as Jauhar deliberately interweaves the story of a single real case between chunks of history and medical detail – I found that I kept skipping forward to find out what happened to the patient, as the intervening material was not directly relevant to my understanding of the case. I was also sorry that there was so little about heart transplants, purely because organ transplantation is a particular fascination of mine.Nevertheless, I enjoyed Heart more and more as it went on, and unlike Westaby, Jauhar himself comes across as likeable and modest – he manages to write about his own personal experiences without forcing himself to the forefront. I preferred the technical medical bits to the gallop through the history of cardiology, finding the chapters on ventricular fibrillation, stress and implantable defibrillators, which can link the two by causing panic attacks in patients who repeatedly receive unexpected shocks to kick their hearts back into rhythm, especially interesting. A worthwhile read, if not especially skilfully written. 3.5 stars."
17,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"If there is one thing that you need more than your brain, then it is your heart. Over the course of a normal life, the heart will beat around 115,00 times a day which equates to 42 million times a year. Over your lifetime it will pump a staggering 158 million litres of blood. For years was seen as the centre of our soul too, but that attitude changed with the rise of scientific understanding of the way it worked. But what goes around comes around and modern research has shown how the heart can react and change shape as it reacts to feeling and trauma. It is the organ that is the very centre and essence of us.Sandeep Jauhar has a close affinity with this organ, not only is he a practising cardiologist, but he only needs to go back to his grandparent's generation to find the roots of his own heart issues. That journey from them to him will take us to the pioneers and mavericks who have discovered so much about it. There is William Harvey who discovered that the blood flowed down the arteries and somehow passed through the flesh and was pumped back up the veins. Inge Edler who made the connection that ultrasound that was being used to find battleships could also be used on the heart to see it working and John Heysham Gibbon who spent thirty years of his life developing a heart and lung machine to oxygenate the blood, opening the doors to being able to perform surgery on the heart without the patient dying. This and many other innovations and groundbreaking advances have lead us to the point where we move ever closer to the artificial heart. This is a good overview with enough depth in it too for the casual reader of how we have got to where we are now with our understanding and treatment of the heart. There is also Jauhar's personal story of heart disease in his own family and how it impacts his health, but how these diseases have affected all sorts of people from all levels of society. "
18,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76455039-seth,4,"I was expecting this book to be dry, and too detailed about the anatomy and physiology of the heart, but I was pleasantly surprised! The author, who is a cardiologist, alternates between the history of the heart and stories about his patients. The history of the heart is filled with pretty interesting, and some just plain insane, stories. *Some* fascinating things I learned from this book: the purpose of the heart wasn't known until relatively recently, and the procedure that predated the heart-lung machine was absolutely insane, I would recommend this book to those who are interested in these kinds of books. [I got an ARC from Farrar, Straus, and Giroux via NetGalley; Thanks!]"
19,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5200977-melise,4,"This was a great read. The author, a cardiologist, alternates between stories from his own life revolving around him personally, and the history of different medical breakthroughs having to with treating the heart. He is an engaging writer and the book was a fascinating read. I highly recommend it. I read an advanced reading copy from Farrar, Straus and Giroux via NetGalley. Thanks. "
20,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217832-kristen,3,"I wish that I could rate this book a bit more highly - there is some interesting information here. However the book suffers from a lack of identity, part medical history, part case study, part autobiography. This, combined with jumps in topic and time, made it difficult to get invested."
21,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93822094-trevor-angst,4,"This book focuses on the human heart and the last ~120 years of technical achievements used to discover, understand and treat cardiovascular disease."
22,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10085593-sarakat,4,"If you've ever wanted to know more about the heart, how it goes wrong, and what is done to fix it-- this is your book. The author is a cardiologist and tells about how his family history of heart disease led him to his profession. The historical changes in medicine are book-ended with present-day accounts of his life in medical school and working as a doctor. I found the science well explained and the historical accounts were very interesting.I did have a hard time reading some of the accounts of the testing done throughout the years on animals. I know that it was necessary to find out a lot of things about the body, but that doesn't make it easy to read. I felt for the author as a kid, who found out that he wasn't cut out for certain experiments when he sobbed through the pithing of a frog for a school experiment. I still love his mother for letting the rest of the frogs go ( I think she did) and telling him to pick something else because he was too compassionate. Animal testing on frogs was described by Malpighi:...they allowed him to see structures that were not visible in larger animals. Nature is accustomed, he wrote, ""to undertake its great works only after a series of attempts at lower levels, and to outline in imperfect animals that plan of perfect animals."" He added, ""For the unloosing of their knots I have destroyed almost the whole race of frogs.""It was new to me about how much the emotional state of a person could affect the heart. The stories of people dying just because they think they are going to were crazy! I loved that in primitive societies the relationship between emotional and social needs and the heart was widely understood, but in our modern society, it isn't. We still focus on physical causes, but more and more evidence is found that connects emotional states and stress to heart disease. And the book does a great job of showing how science evolved over time. Harvey proved that experimentation could solve problems and reject hypotheses. It also showed that sometimes one branch of science couldn't move any further along until another branch caught up. Such as the function of red blood cells being a mystery until Oxygen was discovered. I liked hearing about the author's medical school days and his relationship with his cadaver in anatomy class. At twenty-seven years old, I had been introduced to a man with no name. I had handled his body, cut it apart, and put it back together again. From that point on, I thought, every careless mistake I might make in the hospital would be a slap in his face, every success a tribute to him, my first patient. He had given himself freely-wholeheartedly--and now I had to give him back and leave him to a restful peace.The problems with transplants led to a push to make technological fixes such as artificial hearts and implantable devices:Relying on transplants to cure heart failure is a bit like relying on the lottery to cure poverty.I had never heard of the horrifying side-effects of defibrillators before, but I guess if you wan to stay alive a little longer, you will put up with anything.... despite efforts to make them more user-friendly, defibrillators, like any medical technology, are always going to involve a compromise: What are you willing to give up to live a little longer?"
23,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72699984-muneeb-hameed,5,"A pivotal book for me. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Though many of the risk factors are largely predictable and preventable, I think it's a lack of understanding that makes it easy to ignore the ways we put ourselves at risk. Poor diet, lack of exercise, excessive stress, shallow social connections. We all know these things aren't good for us but until now, I never understood how it all ultimately leads to one thing - heart disease. A lifestyle with the aforementioned factors lead to atherosclerosis (hardening of heart's artery walls), then hypertension (high blood pressure), then eventually arterial thrombosis (clot in the artery), and depending on where the thrombosis is located- either a stroke or myocardial infarction (heart attack).Learning the details of how all the factors and processes work together has made it easier for me to make healthier lifestyle choices for which my future self will be grateful. I am now regularly tracking my heart rate, checking my blood pressure, and doing breathing exercise in addition to exercising regularly, and eating a more heart healthy diet (olive oil, fish, fruit, vegetables, nuts).The book has opened up a new world to me that I didn't anticipate being so fascinated by. And like many other science books I've read, I leave it with a new appreciation for how awesome life is."
24,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12893164-cheryl-turoczy-hart,5,"I wasn't sure about this book when I requested it from the library. It was the NPR Book Club selection for January but I didn't get it until February--an appropriate month to read a book about the heart.Part of my unsure and dubious thinking about reading the book was based on the fact that I had rheumatic fever at the age of 3 which resulted in an enlarged heart, among other things, so I have spent nearly my whole life knowing that my heart had been damaged because of that disease and that it likely would be something that I would need to attend to. Surprisingly, other than being unable to run long distances or exert myself at high altitudes, I have not ever had the difficulties that had been predicted for me at that early age. But, this year I was put on a mild dose of blood pressure medication--is this the beginning of that tunnel I expected to go down? So the book is interesting and very readable. It is, as it says, a history of advancements in medical treatments for heart disease, most of which have taken place during my lifetime. The ending is not especially optimistic but maybe that is just reality. "
25,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81642824-laura,5,"This is exactly the kind of book I love. Well-written elucidations of the evolution of scientific and medical ideas with entertaining details about the people involved: -On Mason Sones, who came up with coronary angiography, ""...Sones was a bit of a lunatic. Even in an era when doctors lived and breathed medicine, Sones topped the charts. He routinely worked until midnight, holding his cigarettes with sterile forceps while he smoked in the cath lab.""--On Charlie Dotter, who performed the first therapeutic procedure with a catheter: ""Dotter—“Crazy Charlie,” to some—was an odd bird: a mountain climber, ornithologist, and amphetamine addict.""Ends with the assertion that sheer science and engineering can't solve the problem of heart disease because managing stress and having strong interpersonal relationships are huge protective factors."

Do you want to live a long, healthy, and prosperous life? Don’t smoke. Exercise. Eat right. But also take good care of your interpersonal relationships and the way you deal with life’s inevitable upsets and traumas. Your mind-set, your coping strategies, how you navigate challenging circumstances, your capacity to transcend distress, your capacity to love – these things, I believe, are also a matter of life and death.
I loved reading about the history of cardiac surgery/medical practices, but it didn’t offer much that isn’t common knowledge for people familiar with medicine. And yet, it goes so into the technical detail of heart anatomy that even with Jauhar’s meticulous explanations I think someone that hasn’t taken anatomy/physiology (and a specific cardiac physiology class like I have) would struggle with some passages (or just get really bored). In general Jauhar doesn’t seem to have a clear audience in mind for his writing.Jauhar is a cardiologist and has a family history of heart disease, so I loved the personal narrative aspect of the book. Unfortunately, I don’t think it mixed well with the rest of the factual, historical content. A lot of the transitions felt forced, even though both the personal and historical narrative were interesting in their own right. As a result, the last call to action of next steps in heart disease prevention was rushed and fell flat, in my opinion. Edit: When I went back to read just the last section as itself, I really enjoyed it. I remember being jarred by the ending chapter the first time around because I felt like it came out of left field. I still marked a ton of passages, so it's definitely good stuff. I just wish it had been worked in from the beginning, and elaborated on in more than a brief final chapter."
27,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22725329-donna-capern,4,"I both enjoyed and learned from this history of heart science. Dr. Jauhar's explanations of heart physiology, conditions and treatment are clear and easy to understand, if read carefully, but heart medicine becomes real and personal with his anecdotes and patient stories. I certainly got the impression that early heart pioneers were a rebel lot, and that while care and repair of heart conditions have come a long way, our sedentary but stressed Western lifestyle and diet are still challenging this hardworking pump station. It was a well written wakeup call and a history of remarkable progress in the care of an organ that was once both mysterious and untouchable."
28,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185452-katrina-kennedy,5,I loved this book. It chronicles the history of cardiac treatment with compelling stories and thoughtful technical detail. I understand my own congenital heart defect more having read this. I also realize how lucky I was to be born just ten years after many breakthroughs in cardiac care that made my first surgery in 1971 possible. I’m in awe of the original doctors who tested procedures on themselves because so many societal and legal limitations made it impossible to test any other way. If you have a heart I’d recommend reading this for your health and for the mind boggling awe of how innovation and risk have changed medicine.
29,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3318166-bryn,2,"I really didn't like this book. The author had very little that was nice to say about his colleagues or many of the patient cameos that he used to introduce some chapters; there were also a number of times that he focused on his own discomfort, instead of the larger poignancy of the moment (when they were spreading his mother's ashes and he was feeling seasick, for example), so the overall authorial voice was almost grating to me. Furthermore, the book lacked any overall coherent organization that I found, and I haven't left the book with any better sense of heart disease than when I started--there were a number of basic heart terms that he never defined, and I found the explanations he did give confusing."
30,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27959427-katherine-lavelle,5,"This is the PBS News Hour Book Club pick for January, and I really enjoyed this book. I have three grandparents who all died of complications of congestive heart failure in their late 80s/early 90s, so it was interesting to read about the medical science as well as some philosophical and biographical discussion about these issues. This book is engaging and informative, and even someone who hasn't had a bio class since the 1990s could follow. "
31,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,4,"The author does a great job of weaving the history of medical heart developments with patient profiles and even some philosophical musings on the heart. He also inserts himself as a patient into the book (worried about his own heart disease) and I thought that was weirdly unsatisfying. But that is a minor portion of the book and the rest of it was very interesting and written in a simple, accessible way."
32,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1832655-shawnna,4,Deserving of its spot on the Wellcome short list. This book has an excellent balance of medical history (focused on the heart) and personal connections from the author (a cardiologist by profession with a family history of heart disease). Worth a read if you like medical history with a narrative structure.

It is written by a cardiologist and is part memoir part history of the advances and discoveries regarding the heart. He makes a great point that the biological heart is linked to the “metaphorical” heart meaning that we can’t extricate our emotions from the function of our literal heart."
40,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300459-sambasivan,4,Written in a slightly more detailed manner (in explaining the various medical innovations for treating the heart) this book has brought up to speed the knowledge level of lay persons like me.

So interesting!"
43,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855603-darrin,5,"I picked up this book from the library. I had seen it on the shelf in the new books area and passed it by originally but then it was featured as the first book of 2019 for the PBS Newshour/New York Times Book Review Now Read This book club and I decided to read it.I found similarities to the two books I have read by Dr. Siddharta Mukherjee, The Emperor of All Maladies and The Gene in that Dr. Jauhar writes not only about his experiences as a cardiologist but also his own personal struggle with a genetic predisposition to heart disease. I connected with Dr. Mukherjee's books because I had a stepfather who I watched struggle with and ultimately die from an aggressive cancer, the subject of Mukherjee’s first book, and I connected with The Gene because, like Dr. Mukherjee's sibling, my father was diagnosed with schizophrenia.I found myself knowing very little about the heart and this book was eye-opening and interesting. I am always surprised at what I don't know when I read books about medically related subjects. The history of how we have come to know what we know about the human body and many of the recent advancements in medicine come with a price. It is sometimes a bit excruciating to read about how the first efforts at doing surgical procedures on the heart came about and if it bothers you to hear about experiments on animals and specifically dogs, you might want to avoid this book. It would have been a lot less gruesome but there was no way to do computer modeling or use virtual reality 50 or more years ago.Overall, like all well-written popular science books I learned something new and I found this to be a quick, interesting read."
44,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56814338-virginia-l-withall,5,"A must read for anyone with a heart!First, I think Dr. Jauhar is a wonder author. He writes about the heart so that everyone can under stand it inter-workings without needing a medical background. I have a medical background and it was even more interesting to me. I appreciate snippets within the book about him personally and also about his family. The history of everything from heart catherizations to the event of heart transplants were extremely interesting. He did not mention the baboon heart transplant n So. Calif in the 1980's. I knew the surgeon who tried that with no success."
45,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47168381-marilyn-smith,4,The heart is revered for its mysteries of function and dysfunction throughout history.

I found myself relating interesting tidbits and reading passages aloud to my husband, which is always a good indication that a nonfiction book is catching my interest and getting my train of thought moving. It’s educational in a non-textbook way and, once again, a reminder to us all that we must do better to take care of ourselves emotionally to truly take better care of this organ that has yet to be replaced (though, as the book also talks about, teams have tried to craft and implant a mechanical heart, no one has lived very long using one).*I received an ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review.Read my full review, including a rating for content, at RatedReads.com: https://ratedreads.com/heart-history-..."
47,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4726093-joan,4,I was introduced to this book as the January 2019 selection of the PBS NewsHour/New York Times Now Read This Book Club. It was a fascinating and enlightening read for me since heart disease runs in my family. The author is a cardiologist and also a talented writer. He does an excellent job of explaining the history of advances in cardiac care in a way that makes it accessible and interesting to those without a medical background. He also discusses heart disease prevention and the link between mind and body. The facts and technical details are interspersed with anecdotes from the author’s personal and professional life.

I love how soulfully he ties biology to day-to-day life, including social, political and cultural dynamics. I'm not sure he was always super clear in the some of the gnitty gritty, hardcore biology facets of the book. I say this as someone with minimal knowledge of cardiology, but also as someone who teaches human anatomy and is a biologist with a Master's degree. I truly recommend it!

51,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8801579-cindy-leighton,5,"Throughout this history of the heart - how our knowledge about it evolved over time, the advances made in surgeries, in angioplasty, pacemakers, heart-lung machines, medications - Jauhar returns over and over again to the impact of the emotional heart on the physical heart. Many cultures have imagined the heart as the center of emotion, and although we know physiologically that is not true, Jauhar cites study after study after study revealing what an incredible impact our emotional life - our stress, fears, anxiety, happiness, and joy can have on our physical heart health. The book focuses on the advances in biomedicine, but concludes that we have much to learn from cultures that focus more on biopsychosocial models of health - that the heart is simply a machine, and then again not simply a machine. I found this fascinating.Jauhar (a cardiologist) does a beautiful job of weaving his personal life story - particularly his family history with heart failure and his subsequent fears for himself - with a well detailed and explained for laypersons history of biomedicine and the heart. I had no idea there had been operations where parents' bodies were basically used as heart-lung bypass machines while surgery was performed on their childrens' hearts. The stories of self-experimentation by physician researchers were fascinating. And the many failures that are inevitable on the road to success. The advances that have been made in the past 80 or so years are astounding for sure.But Jauhar is also quick to point out that biomedical advances sometimes create more issues, and cannot solve all heart problems. ""There is a downside to this success, of course. Patients who once migiht have died of heart disease now must live with it, though often in an enervated state, a fraction of their former selves."" I love that he wrestles with what is a ""good death"" - is it better to die quickly and suddenly, as most victims of heart issues did for millions of years - or to slowly watch their bodies swell with edema, perhaps being shocked by pacemakers (often sparking incredible anxiety) or hooked to artificial means to keep their blood circulating - only for an extra six months or couple of years. He uses his own mother's experience as a painful example.BTW loved his Hindu myth his always sacrificing mother used to tell about ""a man who had been promised the world - unlimited riches - if he would just drown his mother. At the riverbed, as he starts to submerge her in the frigid water, she implores, ""Stay out of the water, Son! . . . You'll catch a cold.""In the end Jauhar reminds us that, after years of decreased deaths due to heart disease because of great advancements in cardiology, we may have reached the limits of what biomedicine can do. As long as people follow unhealthy ""Western"" diets, lie on their sofas watching screens, and don't deal with their stress in healthy ways, heart disease will rise. Even though he is a cardiologist trained in Wetern biomedicine, he recognizes the value of eastern biopsychosocial medicine - a healthy diet, yoga, meditation, friends, support groups, healthy stress release - if we are going to get heart disease under control."
52,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,3,"Sandeep Jauhar's ""Heart: A History"" is put forth as a comprehensive representation of the development of cardiovascular physician knowledge and health care procedures (especially in relation to cardiac arrest), but while there are mentions of important benchmark discoveries and daring practitioners, there were just too many memoir tangents for this to adequately complete its mission. The narrative describing how Werner Forssmann was the first to apply cardiac catheterization to the human condition--by inserting a catheter into his own arm (!) and then taking X-ray images as proof--was extremely interesting! I wish there had been more of a focus on those types of stories, rather than about Jauhar being nervous his first time scrubbing in with his demanding superior at his residency hospital. And while the rise and fall in popularity of the controlled cross-circulation technique (during which a close family member is used as the patient's ""heart-lung machine"") was fascinating, there wasn't a clear reason for why certain stories were chosen for inclusion in Jauhar's book over others. For example, I do not recall ANY of the following topics being discussed: cardiopulmonary artery bypass, endoscopic vessel harvesting, human heart transplantation, coronary artery bypass grafting (aka: revascularization, which creates an alternative path to deliver blood supply to the heart and body), or even robot-assisted heart surgery. This might sound a little insensitive, but I found Jauhar's chapter describing his experiences during 9/11 to be inappropriate for this work. Sure, from a distance he witnesses a woman get rescued from the rubble in Lower Manhattan who suffers from palpitations as a result of essentially being buried alive. But that isn't even the bulk of the chapter. Most of the chapter is an action-oriented retelling of the day's events, such as how he got put in charge of tagging and organizing dismembered body parts just because he was the closest, and most-senior, physician in the hospital at the time. But then that's it. There is no conclusion, no message or even reflective afterthought about how that day might have influenced him as a health care professional. It smelled of CDC epidemiologist Ali Khan's Hurricane Katrina chapter in his book on infectious diseases, ""The Next Pandemic"", and I didn't like it. The most redeeming personal story was when Jauhar talks about how he treated a difficult patient for heart failure who was noncompliant during office visits because he trusted his homeopathic supplements more than Jauhar's medical expertise. Jauhar had to basically bring him back from the dead after the patient was admitted to the ER for a heart attack, but after that the patient became just as devoted to his pharmaceutical regimen as he had been to his supplemental one (though he continues to pop magnesium tablets). Overall, this was fine. The narration by Patrick Lawlor was also relentlessly monotone. I learned some things, but I was really frustrated because I knew I would have learned so much more if Jauhar had ACTUALLY followed through on his storytelling promises. This might be interesting to those thinking about cardiology as a field, especially early career physicians, but you will learn more about cardiovascular surgical breakthroughs from a solid Google search than you will from reading ""Heart: A History"". "
53,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64411069-phebeann,4,"This was a fascinating read! It starts out with the history of the ideas about the heart (e.g. as the seat of emotions) and moves on to consider how physicians throughout the ages have come to understand how the heart works, and how to diagnose, prevent, and treat heart disease. There were interesting anecdotes about many of the physicians' experiments (including ill-fated self-experimentations, which were my favourite anecdotes) in the name of science. It covers the development of open heart surgery, angiogram, angioplasty, defibrillators, the heart lung machine, pace makers, and attempts at creating an artificial heart (which are ongoing). I found these technological developments the most interesting part to learn about. I found the information about heart disease somewhat terrifying given my own family history of heart disease, but I also was very interested to learn about how the most recent research affirms the ancient idea of a heart/emotion connection, and the effectiveness of meditation, exercise, diet and social connection on heart health. It gave more affirmation that we literally do/can die from loneliness or a loss/broken heart.One thing I really did not enjoy and struggled with in this book was all the animal experimentation. I nearly quit reading in the frog bit in one of the first chapters, despite the remorse the author expresses over this experiment. As an animal lover and a vegetarian/vegan for most of my life, it was very hard to stomach basically all of the animal experiments described throughout the book - and boy are there a lot. On one hand, it was interesting to know what was learned from these experiments but on the other I was deeply troubled by the ethics of most of these experiments and sickened by the suffering that must have been caused.I also found it a bit hard to stomach some of the medical information, like descriptions of arterial plaque. Yuck. I've always been fine with medical TV shows and the like and but this book revealed to me that I am more squeamish than I thought! Perhaps it is good, after all, that I never became a physician (my high school ambition).While I appreciated Jauhar's stories about his experiences as a physician, medical student, and family member, and his own history with heart disease, I didn't always feel these stories were well integrated with the history of the heart/heart disease/cardiology. What his mother's horrible decline because of Parkinson's, for example, had to with the heart I am not sure, other than her eventual demise from a heart attack, and her obvious importance to him. I think the author's main purpose with his life anecdotes is to humanize the information about heart disease by connecting it to his life as a doctor and as a person. That makes sense, even if it did feel a little thrown in."
54,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10361209-dan-downing,4,"For over 40 years I worked in open-heart surgery. One of my 'hobbies' became reading books on the history of medicine and things cardiac in particular. I still follow the field, albeit at a distance. Interestingly, there are historical milestones in the present volume of which I was unaware. I assume the reason is that earlier texts relied on earlier texts, with maybe a bit of original research thrown in by each author. But today hundreds of thousands of pages of medical literature have been scanned and digitalized and made searchable with a few keystrokes. Once 'lost' accounts of isolated surgical adventures are now available, and the complexion of the history has changed, albeit not in any major way. The lay reader won't notice, and most medically trained people will not, either. By the same token, most will not notice Dr. Jauhar's several errors, especially in the first half or so of the book, when he writes about the development and practice of cardiac surgery. There are a couple of whoppers and a sprinkling of quibbles, easy enough to do when writing about something you do not understand, as surgeons and cardiologists have been telling each other for a century or so.(An aside: I asked Google ""percentage of CABG done off bypass"". One of the first responses read ""Do they stop your heart during bypass surgery?"" One answer:""During coronary bypass surgery, your breastbone is divided in half to expose your heart. Your heart is then connected to a heart-lung machine which completely takes over the function of your heart and lungs, permitting the surgeon to temporarily stop your heart. ... This is called ""off-pump"" coronary bypass surgery."" The last statement is an error, caused by the ellipsis and ignorance. What was described previous to the ellipsis is technically correct, if clumsily written, but the technique is absolutely the opposite of 'off-pump'. Not even Google is trustworthy, as we have found out in a number of ways.) I undertook my side trip because while I can understand the omission of chunks of history, although the added 10-15 pages would have been worthwhile, I do think the development of heart surgery without the use of the heart-lung machine warrants mentioning, along with a paragraph of reflection on how history can be a spiral.Putting personal information into a book often helps create more of an understanding and more empathy between writer and reader. For my taste, Jauhar goes overboard in this area.The latter sections of the book are of great interest and indeed contain hints of a revolution which may come in medicine and politics and society. The connections among stress, cardiac disease, neurobiology and demographics could remake our understanding of our world.Recommended."

As the cardiologist and bestselling author Sandeep Jauhar shows in Heart: A History, it was only recently that we demolished age-old taboos and devised the transformative procedures that have changed the way we live.Deftly alternating between key historical episodes and his own work, combining his family's own moving history of heart disease with gripping scenes from the operating theatre, Jauhar tells the colourful and little-known story of the doctors who risked their careers and the patients who risked their lives to know and heal our most vital organ. Jauhar deftly braids these tales of discovery, hubris, and sorrow with moving accounts of his family's history of heart ailments and the patients he's treated over many years. He also confronts the limits of medical technology, arguing that future progress will depend more on how we choose to live than on the devices we invent.Affecting, engaging, and beautifully written, Heart: A History takes the full measure of the only organ that can move itself.My opinion: I am love in this book, as a science student I was much curious to read it. Also, the book deals with my favourite topic- heart. It's a must read & highly recommended to everyone. Obviously, the book deals with alot of scientific terms & words but use of them was mandatory also they add a spice to the framework of the book. It has some very interesting facts, some heart diseases & prevention and alot of knowledge of our vital organ, so it's a must read because we all have a heart, beating inside us, which is the only reason of our existence.Pros: The best part is that, even if you are not a science student or if you are not aware of much scientific terms then also you should pick this book, because the authors explain each and everything in an easy way. The diagrams provide an easy way to understand things & facts much better. No cons.Rating: 4.75🌟"
57,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74960440-krutika-puranik,4,"Heart. ..Thank you @sandeepjauhar for being kind enough to send this review copy. ..I remember being fascinated by an organ the size of my fist when I sat in my Biology class back in school. This book takes me back to the days when I thoroughly enjoyed drawing heart structure into my records :) ..The author is a renowned cardiologist who has written two medical memoirs and is also a opinion writer for the Times. In this book, he talks about all the doctors who took great risks to conduct their studies on the most vital organ in the body. They were shunned, discouraged and critiqued for their research and interest in curing various diseases that plagued the heart. Contrary to what I thought, this book was not too difficult to comprehend. There are many medical terms, yes, but it has been explained in layman terms and also with a story behind every chapter to keep the readers interested. It’s truly marvellous how doctors over the years have improvised their devices to keep hearts beating in terms of sickness and also how procedures and surgeries were done back in the early days. ..The author himself has gone through a turbulent time when few members of his family faced heart problems and this piqued his interest in knowing and learning everything that he can to explore the vastness of the subject. His personal experience with patients and other peers are well portrayed in these pages and it makes you wonder how can a doctor’s hand be strong and steady as metal! This book was a welcome change to my reading pattern, making me nostalgic about my days of being a Biology student. ..Human body is capable of so many things and it’s a never-ending learning process. Being a doctor isn’t a easy thing. You have to have a courageous heart and nerves of steel to stand so firm on the ground when the world around you is in chaos. Heart is truly an awe inspiring book that educates people about all those people who were brave enough to go against the world in coming up with unique procedures to save dying and diseased men. ..I would rate this book 4/5. "
58,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3995340-reneesarah,2,"I listened to this book on Audible since it is the January selection of the The New York Times/PBS book club. Listening to this book on Audible was not as enjoyable as listening to other books in that format have been because the narrator had what might be described as aggressive articulation. Additionally, when he read the words of females in the book and tried to make his voice sound like a woman's- the results were laughable.My experience of the book was tinged by having read an article the author wrote in The New York Times that he would find it acceptable for a physician to participate in state sponsored executions. This position of his became a topic on the Facebook page associated with the book club. Dr. Jauhar participated by clarifying his position on the topic. Since I believe that the death penalty is wrong and the one who administers the fatal injections is a murderer, our positions regarding this issue are very far apart.One of the things that was very saddening about this book is how many times dogs were used and then killed in cardiology research. At one lab a researcher lets a dog die from atrial fib just because a guest in the lab asked what would happen if the dog, who was experiencing induced atrial fib, was left untreated. I am thinking if you counted up how many dogs are mentioned as dying in cardiac research labs in this book the number would be over 500 and perhaps approaching a thousand. While I understand the argument that animal experimentation is needed for research, each time I read about a dog being killed in this book it broke... my heart.While toward the end of the book the author makes some comments about prevention, he does not articulate the concerns about heart disease development and treatment that exist in the minority and low income communities, and how those concerns are experienced by women and men. What if your cardiologist tells you that you need a $40,000 pacemaker to keep on living and you don't have and can't get that kind of money- do you just die?"
59,0374168652,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"“Like the biological heart, the metaphorical heart has both size and shape. A bighearted person is generous; a small-hearted person is selfish.” I’ve been curious about the physiology of the heart since being diagnosed years ago with a left bundle branch block, which results in a dissipation of the electrical charge to one half of the heart and 89% of the time, in congestive heart failure.Why am I still able to keep up with people half my age at the gym and in endurance kayak races? What causes periodic sharp chest pains when resting but never when exercising vigorously? While The Heart can’t answer these questions, it does explain how we know what we know about the heart and the fascinating history of the science of cardiology.The quote above summarizes one of the central themes that emerge from this erudite and compulsively readable book: While we have learned a great deal about the physiology and biochemistry of the heart, we still have much to learn about its connection to the emotions. People suffer cardiac damage and even death as a result of emotional trauma. In the months after 9/11, implanted defibrillators shocked people far more often as they reacted to post traumatic stress. Stress reduction and social connections are among the most powerful interventions in cardiac disease, though they are ignored for the most part by the medical model now in vogue.In the best science writing tradition, the narrative arc is powerful, recounting the history of important experiments and discoveries. The cardiologist author brings in his own clinical and personal experiences to illustrate the human side of cardiac care. It is therefor a charming and soulful book that reminds me a bit of Sherwin Nuland’s wonderful writing.This book is well worth reading for the pleasure of the writing, for its implications about cardiac care, and as a fascinating history of the heart."
