0,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/836124-hannah,2,"I like reading about organizing my life and being more productive, but I think the major lessons of this book could have been condensed in a page or two. Here are the things I remember:- 2 minute rule: if you remember to do something and it takes you less than two minutes to do it, just go ahead and do it- write things down in lists so that they don't float around your head and nag at you all of the time- check your lists frequently and often, actually doing the things on the list (or delegating them, or archiving the info), otherwise you will lose faith in the system and it will never work- get a filing cabinet, label-maker, and shredder; create a simple filing system and use your filing system often- ""tickler system"" is a series of files for each day of the year. You file stuff away to be reminded or ""tickled"" on that specific day (i.e. magazine subscription renewal, buying tickets to a play, etc)"
1,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,4,"Ironically, looking in to the GTD (Getting Things Done) system has been bouncing around in the back of my head as something to do for quite some time now. This approach to maximizing productivity is popular among the nerdegalian, probably because of its minimum bullshit approach to actually processing, classifying, and executing what the author David Allen calls ""stuff to do."" This book discusses the GTD system in its entirety and, more importantly, teaches you how to put it in place.What I really liked about Allen's work is that it's very straight forward and focused on implementation. It seems like other self-help books in this vein that I've perused are all about inspiration, defining values, motivating yourself, getting in touch with your inner being and letting loose the full potential of you. To those authors I'd like to say the following: No. Stop it. I don't need nor want that, so you can cram it with walnuts, buddy. GTD, in comparison, is prescriptive. Allen gets touchy-feeling in a few places (such as discussing prioritization or project definition) but the vast majority of the book takes a very practical approach to digging yourself out of whatever mountain of commitments you've gotten yourself under and how to stay on top of it once you get there.In short, GTD focuses on getting ""stuff"" --commitments, to do items, reminders to gather information, requests for information or actions, etc.-- out of your short-term memory and into a physical, highly organized system that will remind you of the right stuff at the right time. Dumping everything out of your short-term memory allows you to do something that's very critical to productivity: focus on one thing at a time. If you're confident that your other commitments or to-dos are safely stored away somewhere and will not be lost or buried out of sight, you can devote all your attention, time, and mental energy to one thing before knocking it out and moving on to the next. I like to think of the system as an artificial, external, and infinitely scalable attention span that you can connect to and disconnect from as needed.That's all well and good, but it's probably not beyond the ken of your average retarded monkey. The tough (and in some places nonintuitive) part is the implementation. Again, there's tons more detail, tricks, and tips in the book, but I'll try to capture the gist of it. There are four major parts to the GTD system: 1. Collecting incoming stuff 2. Processing the stuff 3. Doing the stuff 4. Regularly reviewing your system to make sure your action items and project lists are up to dateCollecting stuff is easy. That's just letting stuff accumulate in your physical or virtual receptacles like inboxes, voice mail, or e-mail.Processing stuff is more involved. It requires sitting down with your inboxes and emptying them. That doesn't mean immediately doing the work associated with each piece of stuff as you pick it up --prioritization is important. It means taking a piece of stuff --an e-mail, a document, a voice mail-- and doing something with it: act on it right then, file it, trash it, delegate it, or create what Allen calls a ""Next Action"" item associated with it. Again, the book is replete with practical tips, hacks, tools, and rules of thumb for deciding which of these things to do and how to keep it all straight. Therein lies some of the book's best value, but it's too detailed to go into here.Doing the stuff is self explanatory, but again I'll emphasize the value of being able to focus on one thing at a time without worrying that other things will be forgotten. It's much more productive and much less stressful.Regularly reviewing your system is also important, and comes in two flavors: as needed and weekly. You may review your action item list (a.k.a., your ""to do list"") several times a day as needed, if for nothing but that endorphin rush that comes with checking things off as ""done"" and deciding what to tackle next. Weekly reviews are also important, and are different in that you take the time to check on your list of active projects and make sure you have a Next Action item for each and every one.So I really like the book and its system. I'd recommend it to anyone who feels like they're not being productive enough or getting buried in work. Allen only gets mushy and non-specific in a few places that make it seem like he's trying to pad the page count, but the majority of the book is specific, direct, and practical. I also like that Allen is in tune with the modern technology that most professionals encounter. He spends appropriate amounts of time discussing things like e-mail, Outlook and voice mail. He also talks about implementing GTD with high-tech tools like PDAs, Web 2.0 systems, and palmtop computers, but while GTD lends itself well to these kinds of toys, at its heart it is technology agnostic. You could do the whole thing quite effectively with a pen, some paper, and a bunch of file folders. Indeed, some parts of the system, like the tickler file work best that way."

I eventually made the decision to never finish it. I think this is self-explanatory.[Later...]Now I'm reading 26 Reasons Not to Use GTD, and it does a good job of articulating the ""ehhhh""ness that I felt while reading this.[Even later...]And if you think GTD's followers are a little cult-like (see, for instance, the comments on this review), check this out: When David Allen says in the acknowledgments ""deepest thanks go to my spiritual coach, J-R"", he's talking about a man named John-Roger ""the Mystical Traveler"", who believes he is a reincarnation of Jesus, St. Francis of Assisi, and Abraham Lincoln. Allen is a minister in his Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness church. Yup."

I learned about GTD from Merlin Mann's 43 Folders site, and became an instant convert. Because I love folders, lists, diagrams, flow charts, of course, but most of all because with GTD, you have to have a labeller. I love my labeller. I love making labels for my files, and admiring them in their serried ranks, all neat and labelly.And I do actually seem to be getting more done, even when I factor in all the time I spend labelling."
4,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,5,"Probably the best self-help book I ever read - in any case the one I most adapted to the organization of my life. It does not have an annoying religious aura to it like 7 Habits or the selfish haberdashery spirit of How to Win Friends and Influence People, but is down to earth and highly practical. I was able to get to Inbox Zero and have held on to that principal for years now. If folks are interested, I can repost here my own adaptation of the techniques. Still for me a reference!My advice: the inbox method is truly important and infinitely helpful. I figured it out and truly feel less overwhelmed and stressed out by email.Step 1Create folders in your various mail programs called_01 TODO - this is for items that take more than 2 min to read and take action on_02 TO READ - these are for things you want to read later: newsletters, long explanatory emails, etc_03 FOLLOWUP - these are things you cannot completed but are waiting on feedback from someone else_04 WAITING FOR - these are actions you cannot complete and require action from someone else_05 TICKLER - projects you don’t have time for, but you want to get around to in the near future_06 UPCOMING TRAVEL - air, car, hotel, tickets for future events and travelStep 2With a free hour ahead of you, go through your inbox and apply the following rules 1. If you can take action on the item in less than 2 minutes, do it  2. Else, sort according to the rules above Step 3Rinse and repeatLet me know how it goes for you :-)"

If such terms instead have you thinking wistfully of the sweet, enveloping darkness to be found at the bottom of your nearest 300-foot drop onto rocky crags, then you have, like me, found yourself woefully living in the wrong universe. You want to be three branes over, where there is still all this awesome new technology and decentralization of art and science and society but nary a hard-charger to be found. In that universe, if someone wants to help others to be more productive, that someone wouldn't expect their readers to slog through a 400-page book that contains about 370 pages of enthusiastic self-congratulation on the startling effectiveness of the method outlined in the remaining 30 pages. Writers in that universe also don't get bored of their own choking newspeak every two paragraphs or so, needing to take a break for a witty and apropos quote, one-sentence summary or reminder of the previous two paragraphs that passed as ephemerally through their own mind as it will through that of the readers, or to just start a new section on either the same or a new topic, either one, it doesn't matter, no one will notice, it's just the same randomly-generated buzzwords bouncing off their eyeballs.However, in that universe as well as our own, the general concept outlined in this book of turning yourself into an automaton of your own design is still valid. Only in that universe when someone wants to get more done in their life by exporting their brain to external resources, it's done matter-of-factly and with little fanfare, since that universe has also failed to create an entire race of creatures that can't figure out how to function without following explicitly outlined methodologies taught to them by highly paid professional consultants. People in that universe have external brains because it's obviously the thing to do, not because it'll make them more effective entrepreneurs, more successful businessmen, more highly admired community leaders not to mention better partners and parents. Half those things aren't taken seriously in this other universe and the other half are taken even less seriously but still done well. There, they learn how to be alive while they're being alive, by being alive, not from a book they read in middle age in desperation after having already failed miserably at living and this is the thing that'll finally get their shit together, I swear to high heaven this is it, for real, everything's gonna be different from here on out. God I wish I was in that universe. "

It was full of useless details (e.g. listing the types of materials out of which an inbox might be made), redundant to the point of making me crazy, and overflowing with multi-step systems for this, that, and the other (seriously, keeping the 3- or 4- or 6-step filters straight would require flashcards).While it had some useful tips, I can't imagine anyone having the free time to implement the system fully. Clearly, though, I am wrong in this, just google ""getting things done"" or ""gtd"" and check out the millions of results. "
7,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253531-jarrodtrainque,0,"With first-chapter allusions to martial arts, ""flow,""""mind like water,"" and other concepts borrowed from the East (and usually mangled), you'd almost think this self-helper from David Allen should have been called Zen and the Art of Schedule Maintenance./ Not quite. Yes, Getting Things Done offers a complete system for downloading all those free-floating gotta-do's clogging your brain into a sophisticated framework of files and action lists--all purportedly to free your mind to focus on whatever you're working on. However, it still operates from the decidedly Western notion that if we could just get really, really organized, we could turn ourselves into 24//7 productivity machines. (To wit, Allen, whom the New Economy bible Fast Company has dubbed ""the personal productivity guru,"" suggests that instead of meditating on crouching tigers and hidden dragons while you wait for a plane, you should unsheathe that high-tech saber known as the cell phone and attack that list of calls you need to return.)/ As whole-life-organizing systems go, Allen's is pretty good, even fun and therapeutic. It starts with the exhortation to take every unaccounted-for scrap of paper in your workstation that you can't junk, The next step is to write down every unaccounted-for gotta-do cramming your head onto its own scrap of paper. Finally, throw the whole stew into a giant ""in-basket""/ That's where the processing and prioritizing begin; in Allen's system, it get a little convoluted at times, rife as it is with fancy terms, subterms, and sub-subterms for even the simplest concepts. Thank goodness the spine of his system is captured on a straightforward, one-page flowchart that you can pin over your desk and repeatedly consult without having to refer back to the book. That alone is worth the purchase price. Also of value is Allen's ingenious Two-Minute Rule: if there's anything you absolutely must do that you can do right now in two minutes or less, then do it now, thus freeing up your time and mind tenfold over the long term. It's commonsense advice so obvious that most of us completely overlook it, much to our detriment; Allen excels at dispensing such wisdom in this useful, if somewhat belabored, self-improver aimed at everyone from CEOs to soccer moms (who we all know are more organized than most CEOs to start with). --Timothy Murphy/"
8,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1244228-josh,5,"I have not had much success applying strategies from productivity gurus. I am referring to books like ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"" by Steven Covey, and other books which share use top-down strategies to order our lives. There are two reasons why these have not worked for me. The first is technical: day-to-day life happens on the level of ""stuff"". The myriad of small tasks of varying importance and in multiple contexts hampers the effectiveness of top-down approaches. The second reason is a personal one. The entire mindset of these books is very unappealing to me. Books which simplify and systemize our entire lives, such as Covey's books, seem to suck the imagination and life right out of living. Peter Pan would barf and toss these books to his crocodile buddy.Incredibly, one productivity book has managed to overcome my objections: David Allen's ""Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity"" has succeeded where other books failed. ""Getting Things Done"" (from now on I'll refer to it as GTD) has made quite a splash since its release in 2001. It's influence is already pervasive and some of the most useful blogs on the internet swear by it. I probably see it randomly mentioned every week. So for anyone who doesn't know much about it, I'd like to summarize the book and at the same time show how beneficial Allen's method has been for me.First of all, GTD is not a top-down approach. Allen explains that ""...most people are so embroiled in commitments on a day-to-day level that their ability to focus successfully on the larger horizon is seriously impaired. Consequently, a bottom-up approach is usually more effective."" Allen is dead on. I already do plenty of big-picture thinking, and it really hasn't helped me deal with the nitty-gritty details of whatever messy projects and tasks are on my plate. Allen admits that a lot of times what is needed are a few tricks. GTD has equipped me to better deal with my responsibilities, and in some cases gave me some trick that helped make all the difference.The second problem I've had with productivity books is more complex. I believe it is important to maintain a little bit of a child-like disposition in life. My impressions of the professional world are that it creates uniformity and kills creativity. It's very easy to figure out where my attitudes come from: I grew up watching Mary Poppins and Peter Pan, and Peter Pan was the first ""big book"" that I owned and read. I think I got that book out of my grandpa's library after his funeral. Both of these stories portray growing up as a very dangerous thing to do, and I've never stopped worrying that I will become old, dry, boring, and bored. But whether I like it or not, life happens, and responsibilities accumulate. And here is how ""Getting Things Done"" succeeds where others fail: without wasting time suggesting a cookie-cutter pattern for my life, it aids in conquering mundane tasks and responisibilities so that my energy can return to the activities that excite me. As I've implemented Allen's method, I've found myself able to mentally relax and in general am feeling a lot more creative again. That's pretty much fantastic!Here is a quick summary of the GTD method. Allen describes a five-stage workflow: collecting anything that commands our attention, processing, organizing the results, reviewing the options, and taking action. Going through these steps for the first time is a huge project; Allen suggests taking several days to do this. It took me quite awhile to get all the papers and ""open-loops"" collected or written down, and several hours of work to organize them. Fortunately, Allen does plenty of hand-holding through this. If someone as absent minded and flighty as myself can do it, anyone can. Allen also includes chapters on developing and tracking projects (really excellent stuff) and deciding what to do next at any given moment. As a manual, it is very well written. It gives brief overviews of everything before going into greater detail. By the time you are implementing it, you already have a decent grasp of the material.Allen sold me in the early chapters, so I dived in with both feet. It took awhile, but the results are wonderful. I have no loose unorganized papers anywhere. Before I did GTD, my mind felt like it was completely in knots. It's felt that way for years. Now that I don't carry the anxiety of lots of unidentified mental baggage and millions of unsorted papers, my mind feels relaxed and focused. GTD also helps me keep a clear picture of any tasks in front of me, and it's much easier to decide what to do next. Tackling a ""next action"" list feels a bit like a game. I hope to get one down to zero someday. I am more productive and am feeling more energetic. The method is also somewhat flexible: everyone's implementation will vary a bit. I use a clipboard with next-action divded by context, big wallets to hold file folders in place of a file cabinet, basic office supplies, a paper calendar, and four trays for ""inbox"", ""next action / outbox"", ""data entry"" (for business cards and such), and ""waiting for"". Very low tech, which is how I like it.Only time will tell what effect all this will have on me. Increased responsibilities will be the real test of GTD's effectiveness. Although GTD will hold special appeal to workaholics and productivity worshippers, it is potentially beneficial to anyone who struggles to keep track of all the little tasks we need to get done. Check it out!"

10,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63168028-peter,5,"Time-ManagementThis is the best Self-Help Productivity book ever written. Well, I think so and I’ve been using it for 13 years. It has had such a profound impact on my working life that to this day, it is a part of my daily practice. I have the GTD apps on my phones and tablets, and it is a default webpage I load automatically in my browser. The greatest fear we have when we’re dealing with so many projects or issues or people is that item that we forget because our brain is maxed out with everything else that is flying at us. We need to get it out of our heads and into a trusted system so we can function clearly – today’s modern technology makes this easier. Plug for Toodledo.I have read the typical time management books and if I hear the ‘big rocks first’ story one more time I’ll hurl one of them at someone. What struck home with me in this book was the recognition of things constantly coming our way throughout the day and more than probably from our bosses, or customers who don’t take kindly to being considered anything but a large rock. This book, therefore, deals with a very pragmatic and defined workflow for managing things we need to get done and understanding the priority. The workflow proffered here is 1. Collect 2. Process 3. Organise 4. Review. The book is well written with a style that is easy to read and provides margin notes and images where appropriate. He tends to use bullet points and flowcharts which help illustrate important concepts. If you can take on-board just some of his concepts you’ll notice the difference immediately.I would highly recommend this book and process for managing the To-Dos in your life."
11,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"This is one of those optimistic books in which YOU THE READER can gain control by your own unaided (well almost unaided, you are meant to delegate) efforts, and which doesn't take account of that your workflow might very well be determined by things entirely outside of your control.Not to mention if your working space isn't under your control at all (for example with hot desking) or is very limited (if you are in a drone-zone) then physically some of the ideas here will be impossible. And of course everything in this book is best suited to someone with a secretary or personal assistant.But there are some practical bits and pieces to take away, I've found it useful to not just write a to-do list but also to write by each item what I'm waiting on or what has to be done next to progress the item and the book inspired me to use the email calender feature to pop up reminders of things to do and people to chase.Beware however, just because you can deal with something within two minutes doesn't mean that you should do so!For an absolutely different vision of how a business can work its worth reading Toyota Production System Beyond Large-Scale Production or anything by W. Edwards Deming.In a wider context this is an entirely depressing and soul destroyingly negative book. It's implicit message is that the modern corporate workplace is a meat mincer. Fresh employees are thrown in at one end, the dead and burnt out, ground down and generally used up ones removed and thrown out on to the scrap heap. A functional view of the workplace might be so bold as to posit that people are employed to do a task which contributes towards the achievement of the overall goals and objectives of the organisation. Allen is writing for readers you have experienced something that is very different, in their world nobody cares. If you are struggling to deal with the task you have been employed to do, nobody will notice let alone step in to assist. Your only possible salvation is the life raft of books like this one, offering salvation from the threatening seas of an unlimited workload. Of peculiar interest is that the book is pitched to persons relatively senior - senior enough that they have secretaries or personal assistants. Bizarrely in Allen's world one is appointed to do a job, but there is no reliable way of knowing if you can cope with it or indeed if the job as defined by the organisation can be done by a single person, nor despite the money spent on the employee and their Personal assistant will anybody check or exercise oversight over one's performance.The workplace in Allen's vision is not rational but the site of a particularly lawless gold-rush. Interestingly to my view enough purchasers agree with him to keep him out of the hamster wheel.Like so many 'business' books it ought to be an A4 or A5 laminated card rather than a book hundreds of pages long but apparently there is no money to be made from people in a hurry or who are struggling to achieve stress free productivity."

Allen talks about the 20,000/50,000 foot view, but without enough detail on how to accomplish these.I'd recommend reading through a summary instead of the whole book. There are people who explain Allen's system better than Allen."
15,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1091983-josh,5,"Before I justify the five-star rating, there are a couple of qualifications:1. This book is written toward a certain audience: well-to-do people, mostly business executives, mostly men, mostly older. The large majority of examples mentioned are male corporate leaders. There is the occasional nod to a housewife using the system to get her chores done (I kid you not), and a single reference that I can remember to someone whose work is purely creative. I feel that if you know this coming in, it will be easier to peel the husk and get to the tasty nougat center. 2. The system advocated here will not help you with amorphous creative projects. If you're a writer, Allen offers nothing in the way of how to parcel out a book into attackable chunks and bang out the pages. What it MIGHT do is help you get a clean brain in order to venture into the fog with confidence. If you're the kind of person who has a hard time focusing on creative work because less-important undone projects are nagging at you, this is a great system.I usually dislike business books for exactly the reasons above. But what Allen does is something more applicable to knowledge workers in general. He recognizes that the amount of potential work is infinite, and then says, ""Okay, you'll never get it ALL done. Let's talk about how you can at least put everything in its place, so you can feel good about what you're NOT doing."" It's way simple, and after using the system for about a month, I can say that it's way effective, at least for me. The essence of Allen's strategy is this: Develop a method for capturing everything you have to do in your life on an ongoing basis, periodically break it all down into actionable steps, arrange those actions in order, and then go to town on them. Let's say you realize one day that you need to get a new computer. In practice it means you should write down ""get a new computer"" in a central repository, and then your brain should be doing something like this:""Okay, I need a new computer. But first I need to figure out whether I'm getting a Mac or a PC. My friend Dana has a Mac and loves to talk about it. My next action on this should be to call Dana."" It was a transformative experience to sit down with all the clutter in my life and break it down into next actions. Last night, I strung my guitar because it finally rose up to the top my big list of things to do. Right now I'm taking the time to write a review of this book because I feel on top of all the other things in my life. I am confident that writing this review is the best thing I could be doing at this exact moment. For the first time I can remember, the miscellaneous open loops in my life are not tugging at my attention. I've closed the ones I can close, and I'm okay with the ones I haven't closed yet. I'll get to them when it's time.In short, if you're a creative person who has any kind of outside commitments (i.e., you don't get to lounge about all day writing or painting or watching the stars), then GTD may be a way to give yourself a clean mental slate when you want to do personal creative work.

16,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274099-ruben,4,"I'm really glad my wife and I read this book together. It's already been very helpful in getting us to look at the reason so many things never get done on time or sometimes not at all. The book is well written. The writing is very clear, with lots of examples, though it's a bit dry in the middle and a little flowery on the ends. (That sounds like a description of a scone or something.) We're still working on getting our system set up (I mean filing cabinets for reference material) so I might need to add more to this in a month's time. I'll let you know then if we're getting more things done. As a matter of fact, that's one test to see whether things are still slipping through the cracks. Read, go!Update: one month later, I can say that I do feel less stressed about things, and I'm getting things done like never before. Mind you, I'm not perfect, but I feel there's been a noticeable upswing in how aware I am of what needs to get done. Just having an organized filing cabinet and inbox and next actions list allows me to see at a glance the things that used to just float around my mind, fighting for attention. My wife and I look forward to our weekly review (Sunday nights at 7:30), when we get to go over every project and make sure that everything's on track. I've been implementing this system in my classroom, too, and that helps with the stacks and stacks of papers I collect as a teacher. I'd love to find some way to teach this to my high school students, who can never remember to do their homework or study for tests. Anyway, I highly recommend this book.

Felt pretty good to leave that last day, right?David Allen teaches you how to live your life this way: take all your to-dos, projects, etc. then organize them out into Projects, Next Actions, Someday/Maybe projects, Read and Review, and more if you want. Take the Next Actions and either do them, defer them, delegate them, and/or delete them. It's really that logical and that simple. Now, make a weekly habit of reviewing all those categories. Now you're ""GTD"".Just like it ought to, the book starts out broad, then each chapter goes into more detail of the system. Unless you're some crazy detail-loving mogul, you only need to read about to the half-way mark. I went a bit further just because I loved it so much. For about three weeks now, it's worked for me both at work and more loosely at home. The chapter on organizing your email and keeping your inbox empty is BRILLIANT! If you want to see this book in action, I'll show you my email and desk. I recommend this book to just about everyone.Read the first chapter. I probably only buy 3-4 books a year -- usually because the library doesn't own it, but I bought this one after reading the first chapter in the library's copy. I knew I'd want my own."

Turns out there's a GTD cult to go with the book, it's SO popular. The book is all practical, all realism. It has nothing to do with thinking about your goals; it leaves that up to you. It's all about how to organize your stuff and your lists to get them done.It's been criticized for being both too general and too detailed, but the generality accommodates complexity, and the details are an essential component of the system.On the whole, I'm a fan. If I weren't already pretty tooled up with mental, emotional, and practical productivity skills, I would not think it worthy of the cult. I don't think it comprehensive enough to be a sole source of a system. What I got out of it was an essential suite of concepts that really filled the gaps in my process, and I'm looking forward to finding more efficiency refinements from it.What was truly life-changing for me, though, was processing all my paper in the prescribed method. My filing system is a functional beauty, and I save SO much time just being able to reach straight for something. THAT was worth every minute."

21,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373046-laurence-gonsalves,1,"The advice presented in GTD is not bad. It's pretty good, actually. If I was reviewing the GTD system I'd probably give it 4 stars.This is a book review, though, and while the system may be good, the book is terrible. It's extremely repetitive. I'm convinced the entire 267 pages could be condensed down to less than 10, but I guess nobody would pay $15 for a 10-page leaflet. Having to slog through the huge amount of redundancy made reading this book a real chore. Even the diagrams are repetitive. There are 6 diagrams in the book, and 4 of them are essentially copies of the same diagram!The book also uses a lot of terminology without first defining it. For example he uses the term ""open loop"" all the way through the book, but doesn't define what an open-loop is until about two thirds of the way through. He also uses normal words like ""project"", but about half way through the book he explains that when he says ""project"" he doesn't mean what everyone else means by ""project"".So overall, the book is poorly organized, poorly written, and chock-full of filler. If you want to learn GTD it would be better to just find a summary of the system on the web (eg: search for ""toodledo Getting Things Done"" for a good example)."
22,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1620789-dillon,4,"Five stars for the content, two or three for the way it was delivered. But I suspect the purpose of this book wasn't to write beautiful prose, so I'll cut it a break.Since this is a book about an organizational system I'll talk a little bit about what I've tried to incorporate and how mine works. Hopefully doing so will help me to become more conscious of how I can improve it. In a former life - a stupider one, I tried to capture everything in my head. This had results ranging from moderate success to catastrophic failure. Considerable stress and a nagging feeling of imminent collapse as my constant companions, and sleep escaped me. While this was all going on, in college I started using a blank Moleskine and OneNote to capture more of my thoughts, but still stayed mostly disorganized. At this point I don't think I used either the Moleskine or OneNote very well, and I was still mismanaging my time and thus losing sleep just to keep up. When I got a Mac, before OneNote came out for OSX, I migrated to Evernote for my personal and church things. When I started my current job, I started using Evernote for that as well. Once Evernote decided to charge for cross-device access, I jumped back to OneNote, which was now supported on Mac (the irony is that I don't even use the same OneNote account on more than one device). I use OneNote to keep track of daily to-dos and to keep me accountable to my workday schedule. This change was fairly recent (only barely outside of the past six months, I think) - and it's been evolving since I started with it. It started with just a blank sheet as I would use in college, but then I added daily to-dos, and most recently I added a schedule and weekly to-dos (less specific than the dailies).So for my part, I really like the system he outlines and have made efforts to incorporate it into my own workday and outside-of-work calendar. I particularly like the ""next actions"" concept (I felt like this was half the book) - clearly defining what needs to be done rather than vague ""stuff"" that need to be checked off. This corresponds to my to-do list - it's not a list of projects, but concrete actions. I will try to organize tasks concretly more consciously from now on. Outside of work, I'm not sure that my life is busy enough to warrant organizing ""next actions"" by any further granularity - I just use a small planner for my personal life - though this could be because I haven't captured everything. I also like the idea of having a ""waiting for"" bucket - this was a huge gap in my organizational system and I've added it to my OneNote template. In the short time I've been practicing it, the offloading of mental burdens to an ""external brain"" has been hugely liberating for me. Like he says, one of the biggest humps to overcome is the ""capturing"" phase - for me, if I'm sure I captured everything that needs to be done in a day and the next, I can rest much easier. Also, having the weekly review is a great concept. Without periodic reviews, how can I know if I'm on track or not?We'll see. I'm still in the nascent phase of developing my own organization, but this book has been helpful for me to develop a better framework and ""mind like water"" (I always think of Bruce Lee when he mentioned that phrase in the book). So he had my attention the first time he brought it up.All the good things aside, this book felt much longer than it needed to be - at least from what I took away I think it could have been covered succinctly in five or so chapters, rather than 15. The unnecessary length took away from rather than added to the book - it felt somewhat repetitive and the purpose of one chapter wasn't very clearly distinguishable from the next. Also, the author's face is on the cover and from a distance he looks like another, more famous David (Letterman) - was this a clever marketing ploy to get people to hear what Dave Letterman has to say? If so I'd like to express my disapproval. If not, it's still unusual."

24,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"A colleague recommended this book to me because I was seeing an adult client with ADHD. He also shared that he used the principles in this book to run a skills-teaching group for teens with ADHD, and that he uses this system himself. This recommendation came at a time when I was feeling particularly overwhelmed and overloaded at work, so I figured I would try to see if there was anything here that I could adopt so as to better inform my client about how it works while engaging in my own self-improvement.According to David Allen, we feel overwhelmed and distracted because we have too many commitments on our minds rather than taking action on them and/or filing them away in a system where we can revisit them as needed. These commitments remain in the category of unfinished business, or ""open loops,"" which torture us and stress us out because we haven't figured out how to get rid of them. The first step, says Allen, is to take all the things we're supposed to be doing and collect them into a small number of physical or virtual in-baskets (e.g., a wire tray that sits on your desk plus your e-mail inbox). The number of receptacles for collecting unfinished business should be small, and the information in them needs to be processed regularly.Processing involves going through the items, one by one, and deciding what the next action step is on these items. Although it seems obvious, lots of stuff we need to do stays in never-never land because we never figure out, concretely, what the next step is. Sometimes there is no next step, in which case the item should either be trashed or filed (as reference, or as something to be taken care of at a later date). If there is a next step, you need to decide whether to do it (if it can be done in 2 minutes or less), delegate it (if someone else can do it), or defer it. Deferring an item may include placing it onto a category list, e.g., ""calls,"" ""at computer,"" ""errands,"" ""at office,"" ""at home,"" ""agendas"" (for people and meetings), or ""read/review."" You should also keep a list of your ongoing multi-step projects, to be reviewed weekly, with ""next steps"" categorized into the above categories. Another system is a ""tickler file"" for things that need to be done on certain days. The tickler file is a drawer full of file folders that is subdivided into months of the year, with a file folder for each day on the calendar. This allows you to file tasks that will be done on days other than today. Your calendar is used only to mark appointments; if you clutter it with task reminders, it will get overwhelming.Once everything you have to do is thus organized, you start each day by looking at your calendar to get a sense of your appointments and what windows of time you have in between. You then review your tickler file for that day and your general lists of next actions (e.g., calls to make, things to do at the computer, errands, etc.) to think about what can be done today, where, and when. There's also the issue of choosing which actions to take in the moment, which involves evaluating your context (e.g., are you near a phone? are you near your computer? are you in the car and available for errands?), time available, energy available, and priority (i.e., out of all the options you could take now in this context, with this amount of time and energy available, which is the most important?). Another important aspect of this system is the weekly review. A time and place must be set aside once a week to gather loose papers and put them in the in-basket for processing, process any notes, action items, etc., review past calendar dates for actionable items, review upcoming calendar dates, document and categorize all open loops and their next actions, review project lists and evaluate what needs to be done, review next action lists, and review any additional checklists.Basically, this book felt like FLYlady for the office. It was an interesting experience for me, because whereas I can be a total slob at home and found FLYlady invaluable for working on changing that (with admittedly inconsistent commitment and progress on my part), I'm actually pretty on top of things at work for the most part. Although I wasn't formally following David Allen's system, I was intuitively using some of his ideas and applying them in my own way. That being said, I found many of his suggestions quite useful and even went out and bought myself a four-tiered tray to keep on my desk for in-box, processing, and out-box. This small change was surprisingly helpful and went a long way toward increasing my sense of control over what I have to do and decreasing my overwhelm. I also think that, for people who are struggling with staying on top of all the things they have to do, this system could be very helpful. But like any system, you need to be committed to following it. Sometimes, it comes down to whether you'd rather stress over making sure to take all your preventative steps to stay on top of things, or stress over having to scramble. I think that adults who struggle with ADHD could consider trying this system out and seeing if it works for them. But I know that aspects of the system, and even the system as a whole, have been helpful for individuals without a diagnosis who simply want a system that keeps them organized."

I decided to investigate further a little while back, and finally picked up the book two weeks ago. And now I've read it; and I expect I'll go back and re-read this book in a couple months. I may revise my rating at that time.The things that irritate me in this book are exactly the things I expected might irritate me. There are plenty of the obligatory breezy anecdotes about the clients Allen has worked with and how impressed they were with the system; the margins of every page are filled with quotes; there are lapses into business motivation jargon; and there are numbered lists in droves. I skimmed some parts. But at the same time, there is something I didn't really expect: very concrete advice about organizational tricks and tactics, introduced with the words ""let me assure you that a lot of the value people get from this material is good 'tricks.'"" Recognizable meat! No wonder there are so many technical readers who have latched on to this guy.Of course, I still have to see whether I can get the meat to work for me.

If you have a hint of what you're doing, he is quite vague with no actual hands-on tips.Here are his main ideas:-- Your mind is always keeping a running to-do list in the background while you're doing other things. This noise distracts you from what you're doing and makes you feel worried that you should be doing something on that list. Shut out the running to-do list and you can focus on one thing at a time.-- So, empty your head of every to-do, every thought and keep it all in one place. Write one idea on a piece of paper and scribble sub-ideas on the same sheet of paper.-- Decide on what to do and when. Decide on the next action for each major thought and write it down.-- Make a master to-do list and parse it out based on areas of your life (business/personal, calls vs writing, etc.)-- Have your assistant/secretary do a lot of the remembering for you and remind you (oh, wow, that works so well for us peons)-- Oh, and clear off your cluttered mess of a desk. It's mentally distracting you and see point two of gathering up every piece of information laying around.Sound like new ideas? That's because they're not. The whole thing reads like an advert for his consulting business because he gives you just enough information to feel like you don't know what you're doing but not enough concrete tasks to actually get to work. Pretty ironic for a productivity guy. Unless he's trying to drive up the productivity of his consultancy. One more thing -- the guy doesn't even recommend e-mail filters as a time-saver.

This is essentially a 300-page book about managing to-do lists. That should either exhilarate you or cause you to roll your eyes. Depending on which one you are, you either pick this up or stop reading this review. The advice in the book has stood the test of time, but don't expect him to recommend you any system (rather, attributes of one). The main insights for me:* If you are procrastinating an item it's probably because it's not clearly describing the next action. E.g. ""Apply for Canadian citizenship"" is a terrible task. Split it into the 20 tasks that actually requires: ""Get passport photo taken"", ""Fill out travel history for the past 5 years"", ""Find a good source of information for the Canadian history test"" and so on.* If there's more than two tasks associated with something and it takes less than a year to complete it's a project, not a task--a feature most to-do applications support.* Tag everything based on: energy, context, deadline, and time to complete. If you have these tags properly organized, you know what you can do when you're in a waiting room on your phone (low energy, mobile context, and 5 min or less time to complete). If you don't know what's highest priority where you are right now, your system is not serving its function.* Thinking ""about"" things cause stress. If you think about something and it's in your system, you should be able to immediately dismiss it. Put everything in there.* You cannot run a proper to-do system if you don't review all tasks once a week.* If a task takes less than two minutes, just do it now, the graphs cross of system overhead and cost of doing it immediately just around here.* If you don't trust your system, you need to do a complete dump of everything in your life that needs to get done. The book has multiple-page ""triggers"" to make sure everything in your life is captured.If you've ever opened ""Things"" and had no idea what to do, this book is for you. I've used Things for many years, but find now that I am lacking some power and now consider switching to OmniFocus as a result of reading this book.

34,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3636667-patrick,5,"Taken in the right spirit, this book can change your life. Don't get stuck in the weeds. Take away the things you need and leave the rest. In particular there are many apps and pieces of software (Omnifocus is one of the best, but ther eare others) that can do the work that Allen used to do with folders, papers, index cards.Here's my takeaway, based on some thinking from Merlin Mann and other productivity experts/writers:1) Sit down every week and write down all the stuff you need to do. In every aspect of your life. A giant huge list. Go into great detail. If there is a project, write down each critical thing you need to do. This can be applied to anything from painting your apartment (select color, buy paint, get brushes, etc) to a task at work (set budget, name staff, talk to boss, etc.) This is the capture stage.You will feel immediate relief to have emptied your mind of all these things bothering you. 2) Sit down every week or day and process this list. You can't possibly do it all. So figure out the things you need to do next, the things you want to do after that, and the stuff you hope to do some day. A to-do list app can help you to rank these things and set some deadlines on each item. This is processing. 3) For work, come in each day and check your list. Do the things that need doing. Leave work happy even if you don't accomplish anything, knowing that you have put the time you had available to good use.There's a lot more than that to take away, but this was the first cut, for me. The listmaking and processing are one way to be sure you are working to your goals, not the goals that others are trying to impose on you through calls, meetings, e-mail, or other random factors. When you take on assignments from others, you do so consciously and for a good reason (you share the goal, your boss wants it, your spouse wants it, whatever.) You become less reactive and more effective. "

Let this be the last time that you leave the site of a goal, plan or meeting without a clearly defined and scheduled next action item to make it a reality.2. Plan Your Week. Spend at least a half hour or an hour at the beginning (or end) of each week taking stock of what you accomplished the prior week, what you didn’t accomplish, what you learned and what your desired outcomes are for the week to come. Many people dive right into the week with no plan of what they want their week to look like. And then get frustrated when nothing gets done. Be intentional and get committed. Things will start to happen. Spend an hour sharpening the saw to makes the week’s cutting all the easier. I have been doing this every week for years.3. Schedule It. Things do not get done unless you schedule them. By definition in order for a task to be completed it must physically occupy some portion of your life. Lists have become so arbitrary. They get longer and longer and are rarely prioritized, leaving you overwhelmed when everything doesn’t get checked off. Also, the average person drastically under estimates how long something will take (at least we’re optimistic). This causes them to put 27 hours worth of work on one day’s list. Reserving time on your calendar forces you to be honest with yourself and get completed only what is reasonable in the time you have available. Proper expectations are a huge part of getting things done.4. Schedule A Buffer. We have now come to grips with the fact that everything takes longer than expected. Now except the fact that things always come up that we didn’t plan. They take time and sometimes they have to happen right away. Schedule buffer time for these. I literally block off an hour or two each day that simply says “buffer time”. It almost always gets filled up with something urgent and unexpected and when it doesn’t, I have an hour of my life back–an amazing feeling. That’s when it’s time to get outside and have some fun (or do whatever you like to do with spare time–other than check email).5. Give Yourself Strict and Short Deadlines. This is not contradictory to Schedule It. Yes, things take longer than expected, and they also will take up as much time as you have available. We call this Parkinson’s Law. The time required to complete a project is directly proportional to the time you have available. In other words, if you have time to waste, you will waste it. You have a day to study for an exam. It takes a day. You have two weeks to study. It takes two weeks. Give yourself enough time to complete a task but not a moment more. Set these limits up in advance.6. Don’t Check Email First Thing in the Morning. If you haven’t heard this before, you have not been listening. This is huge. No matter what you’re doing, email will immediately throw you off and suck the time and energy out of your life. Get your most important things done in the first 2-3 hours of the day. Then check some email and a little Facebook. I know I do not need to convince you on merit of this. I just need to break you from your addiction.7. Do Your Most Import Things First. This goes with the above. First thing in the morning (after a good workout and breakfast), since I already have a plan for the week, I know what’s most important for the day. So I dive into those 2-3 tasks first. Often before even opening my computer or connecting to the internet, and definitely before checking email. You will feel mountains better about the rest of the day with your major items behind you. Then there’s plenty of time to waste away on email.8. Get a Good System to Keep Track of Your Life. Everyone does things differently and no system will be perfect for all of us. But there are some amazing tools out there for free or almost free to get you started. Whatever the cost, if it gets you organized and motivates you to get things done, it’s worth the investment. I use a combination of the Tony Robbins Time of Your Life Planning System, 7 Habits and 4-Hour Work Week in conjunction with my iCal, Google Calendar, Things and Evernote, all synced to my iPhone for what I feel has become my own little work of art. Can’t forget a good clean work space of your own and maybe some physical file cabinets either. It took a while for me to get the right system in place and its always changing, but it’s empowering once you get it. Find some sexy productivity toys and have some fun.These steps are easy and any one of them alone will dramatically transform the way you go about your moments, days, weeks and life.

There is no step by step to anything and each section is super long-winded. He also doesn't use clear, concise, or understandable and practical examples and stays really, really vague. There are however a couple of things he mentions that I find useful:1) Capturing everything — the idea that every task needs to be recorded somehow otherwise it will take up space in your brain.2) the two-minute rule — if it takes two minutes or less to get it done, do it right away as it comes in.The other things he mentions are things I already implement: 1) having a stable archiving system (both digital and analog)2) having a physical and digital space for incoming things to process3) doing a weekly reviewWhile his methods might be interesting, the book itself is badly written (at least so far) so I would recommend instead reading a short digital version or overview of his approach like this: https://hamberg.no/gtd"
41,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2040319-denar,4,"Well well well, David's got a point. Stressing out won't get things done, you gotta organize and approach it systematically. I like his analogy of big and small stones falling in water. My key take away is his vertical and horizontal approach to sorting tasks, reminds me of Asana for some reason. Anyways, highly recommended for people who are under a lot of load."

I almost gave up many times, and ended up skimming through a lot of it. It’s so repetitive and there was so much irrelevant information for me. I wish I had read a condensed version of it with just the basics, which are not a lot. If you have a friend or colleague that uses the system, I would suggest to start by talking to that person and learning the basics from there, maybe you don’t even need to read the book, really...it’s not that I’m not grateful for all the work that has been done to come up with the system and write the book, I really am.

I learned them through blog posts and other people without being aware that they are of GTD. Some of them I discovered myself, simply because they made sense.The principles of GTD - essential. The techniques - good, but I didn't and wouldn't recommend adopting all of them. The book itself - could be cut in half without losing content. I would recommend the book for anyone who experiences procrastination and anxiety around trying to get things done. Just be prepared to skim and roll your eyes at all-older-white-male examples."
44,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068161-tryn,5,"Since the age of 14 I’ve been obsessed with how to make the most of each day, how to use my time to the greatest effect. So I’ve read a fair number of books on this topic and gleaned principles along the way. This is the best book of its kind I have read so far. Maybe I feel this way because David Allen takes a similar approach to my own in getting things done. He confirm that some of my intuitive time-management practices are sound and effective. Allen also taught me how to refine those processes and make them more conscious. And he added new strategies to my repertoire that I am excited to incorporate.Besides all the practical strategies I got from this book, I relearned an important life principle, this time through the lens of productivity. Tasks you tell yourself to do or projects that you make an agreement with yourself to take care of and then don't do not only clutter your mind and make it hard to concentrate on anything, they actually feel like broken promises to yourself and weigh on your spirit. To have what the author describes as a “mind like water,” meaning a mind that is fluid, creative, relaxed, and capable of sustained attention, requires that you know what you have to do right away and what you have agreed with yourself you can put off. You have to be able to feel good about what you are not doing right now in order to feel good about what you are doing right now. If you keep agreements with yourself, you will feel peaceful. If you break them you will feel bogged down and guilty. The mind and spirit do not differentiate between small, relatively insignificant tasks, like getting your carpets cleaned, which you told yourself you would do this month or important life resolutions, like spending more time with your children, which you to told yourself you would do this month as well. They are both just broken agreements that weigh on you if you don’t follow through.So here is the biggest gem from this book: Renegotiate with yourself often. This is how you keep a mind like water. You renegotiate your list. You go through your in-box every day and assign everything a spot. You look at each project on your project list at least once a week, deciding what the next action is and adding it to the appropriate list, determining when you will do it. Allen says that the day most people feel best about their work is the day before they go on vacation because that is when most people take the time to renegotiate their to-do list and reassign every task a spot. You can feel like that all the time if you regularly process your in-box, assign everything a spot, and then frequently renegotiate what will be done and when. Allen acknowledges that there is never enough time in this life to do everything. But when you have a good system, you can feel peaceful about what you are choosing to do at each moment and enter fully into the experience with attention and presence of mind.  "
45,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755874-peter,4,"I went through parts of this book/lecture series when I was an undergrad, but am revisiting the audiobook now. It provides some very helpful ways to look at life and how you do the things you do.There are some key points in this book that can really change how you conduct your life. For me, a few of the big things are:(1) if you keep everything you worry about doing in your mind, you'll have more anxiety. Instead you should write everything down that you have to do in some sort of trusted system so that your mind is free to enjoy whatever it is you're doing at the moment instead of worrying about some random thing you have to do later.(2) If it takes 2 minutes or less, just do it now. For me, this means quit putting off sending emails that only take a minute anyway.(3) Break big projects down into smaller actions that can be done. Instead of writing the name of some project on your to do list, think of next specific actions that you must do to move forward with that project.(4) Once you get the day-to-day things done—once you clear your mind—then your life is more freed up to be creative and to do the things you want."

It was quite hard work to read, perhaps because I only wanted to read it as fast as I was putting things into practice -- and so it has taken me about 3 years to read it all the way through!! The key ideas have been a) collecting and recording every single input into a trusted system of lists etc b) the 2 minute rule (deal with it immediately if it takes less than 2 minutes) c) the ""Next Action"": never record somthing in vague terms, instead define exactly what needs to be done next. I haven't implemented the whole David Allen system, but it's still proving helpful. One of the best things was that every time I read a chapter it motivated me to be very productive for about a day!"

Either do stuff when it comes up, do it later, or get other people to do it for you. 2. Write stuff down so you don't forget to do it. 3. $15, please."" Allen also has an incredibly smug and off-putting classist mentality, at one point talking about how ""your children's nanny"" won't need to use these skills and never using down-to-earth hypotheticals when he can invoke a vacation home or private jet instead.

Mind like water, Grasshopper. I've recommended this book to several people who felt overwhelmed at their jobs and they've all loved it. Just be careful not to take the system too far - the excitement of something that works will have you spending hundreds of dollars playing with various software programs, tweaking your productivity flow.

53,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597186-rada,5,"This was a re-read, I first read this book some 15yrs ago. I found it inspirational, not as much for the actual “system” to get organized (although I borrowed some elements from it), but for the strong message that it’s important to have “a” system to stay organized and get things done, while also keeping a “mind like water” (ie, mind free from worries, etc)"
54,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4254869-lauren-james,0,"THE BEST. This is just - my entire jam. All about organisation and to do lists, in what is basically a precursor to bullet journalling."
55,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4615416-michael-jones,5,"I really liked this book a lot. I didn't like it as much for its detailed descriptions of physically how to organize things (some of those are way over the top... thirty-one folders, one for each day of the month? Really? And then twelve more for the next twelve months? You've got to be kidding me!) as for the basics of how to think about the stuff you have to do. Maybe it was easier for me to see the point because I was already well on my way to creating my own similar system; I had put most of the things I needed to get done into what I thought was a comprehensive list (turns out Allen had some categories of things that I hadn't thought of adding, but it was as comprehensive as I thought at the time that I could make it) and had begun to categorize them, but Allen helped me kick my thinking up a notch. He also helped me understand why the system I was building had been helping me, and what I could to to make it help even more.Allen's primary mantra is this: if it needs doing, get it out of your head and into a system where you will find it at the appropriate time. His secondary mantra is: what's the next step that needs to be taken to advance this task? In a nutshell, the idea is that whenever a task or project comes your way, you immediately record it on paper, or into your computer, or whatever works. Later when you can make a few minutes, process those items to figure out what step needs to be taken to get them rolling, and categorize them into things that need doing immediately, things that can be put off, things that can be delegated, and things that actually don't need doing and can go into the trash can. Once everything that needs doing is cataloged and processed this way, you wind up with an extensive list of incremental steps you can take to advance everything you need to do. It lowers the barriers to getting started on things, and it very nearly eliminates even the temptation to procrastinate, because it's just so fun to be able to check things off your list!I did find the book repetitive in a few spots; a couple of times I wondered if I had the wrong disc of the audiobook in the player because I recognized whole paragraphs from earlier on. I've mentioned that some of the implementation details, such as using physical in-baskets and label-maker machines and single-handedly keeping the file-folder industry afloat, seem a bit dated in an age where everyone carries a smartphone and data is increasingly available in the cloud from anywhere at any time. And I have to admit that in a few spots my mind wandered a bit when Allen described situations that are far removed from my own (I'm not a CEO, and some experiences which are apparently common to CEOs are completely foreign to my frame of reference) or when he began to wax less concrete and more philosophical. And as someone who doesn't have a chance to travel very much, I found his recurring airplane analogy a bit annoying, although it's a perfectly good analogy (or maybe not, because he had used it a good four or five times when I realized that by ""runway level"" he meant ""at the highest level of detail"" and not ""about to take off""). But I will say that I intend, as the author recommends, to review the book maybe four or five months from now and see if I find things in it that I missed before.The basic principles in this book are so common-sense and simple that although they require a bit of a time investment at the outset to get going, I can't help but believe wholeheartedly that they can be effectively used by just about anyone. The book was recommended to me by someone who saw the system I was building for myself and recognized that I had stumbled on some of Allen's principles, and I would without hesitation recommend it to others. I just wish the guy who told me about it had told me years earlier!"
56,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576733-jeff-yoak,5,"This book and implementing the GTD framework has really changed my life. It has enabled me to get control of my obligations and projects and has started me on a course of starting to be able to plan and organize on a much longer horizon, planning over a span of years instead of being the fairly reactive person I was prior to embarking on this adventure. I would recommend this book to everyone! It's one of my favorites.2011: It was fascinating to read this again. Whereas part 2, which mostly focuses on the actual practices was my runaway favorite last time, this time part 1, which has a lot of general philosophy and ways to think about things. Having thoroughly integrated the mechanical processes of GTD into my life for years, I was amazed at how much it still had to offer.2020: This may be the first time that I read the second edition. Not because of differences, but because I have fallen off the wagon, this is the second-most influential reading of my life. The motivational factor in remembering what it was like to be truly on top of things, feeling ""mind like water"" has sent me into a frenzy of improvement. So happy."
57,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7569985-james-rye,3,"I bought this book because I had been excited by using the free productivity software IQTELL which links emails, calendars, and to do lists, and has been built around the principles of Getting Things Done (GTD). Having found the software useful, I bought the book.Frankly, I was disappointed, for two reasons. First, the version I read was an ancient one and give the impression that people had only just started to use computers, so it talked a lot about making lists on bits of paper. Secondly, although the GTD principles are explained clearly based on the author's many hours of experience of working with over-burdened and burnt-out executives, the principles are simple and could have been stated in about one tenth of the space. They needed a pamphlet, not a book. There was a lot of repetition and stating the obvious which I found tedious.On the plus side, the GTD principles are interesting, different, and I am finding them useful. GTD deserves attention, even if they need presenting in a different way. I can thoroughly recommend the IQTELL free apps for busy people who are trying to regain some control of their lives and an understanding of GTD will help."
58,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31712855-acordul-fin,2,"I do think that some of his ideas are useful (like how important it is to clarify what your goal/project/commitment is and then write down the first physical actions you need to take to complete it), but, quoting another reviewer, the book is ""profoundly American"". It's extremely repetitive and the jargon he came up with to make his book sound more edgy makes the reading experience a lot less pleasant. I found myself frequently annoyed with his expressions. His system could have been summed up in 30-50 pages, but that wouldn't make a bestseller, would it? Also, while the overall idea of his system is good, I don't see how it can be described stress-free and globally practical. It gets quite complicated as you get deeper into it, you end up spending so much time planning that you are exhausted by the time you need to take action. I'm sure it's a wonderful tool for the exceedingly anal, but I doubt the majority can apply this to their lives. However, if you don't follow it letter by letter, you can take the couple of useful ideas, adapt them and come up with a system of your own. Experimentation is the key. "
59,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14321329-christina-pilkington,5,"This was an audio reread for me of a book that literally changed my life when I first read it several years ago. It revolutionized the way I view time management and allows me to accomplish an incredible amount of things in my life. Not that my life is perfect or that I am perfect!!! There are plenty of unproductive days in my life! But when I am following this system, I can literally have 150 things on my to do lists and still feel in control of things and be relaxed and calm. Part of the reason why I'm sure I'll top 150 books this year on top of being a wife, mom, homeschooling 2 children, being a gymnastics meet director, volunteering at our church, traveling a lot (we took a total of 9 trips last year), keeping up with all the housework, organizing lots of activities and trips for other homeschooling families and keeping up with the other dozens of life details, is because Getting Things Done. Needless to say, I believe this is a must read for everyone. "
60,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53202284-chris,5,"This has been on my to-read list for about 3 years, starting from a time when i was really struggling with productivity, and even now after having worked through that bad patch.I've gleaned a lot of the concepts from other sources, but it's really interesting to see it presented in one form. It's a really outstanding system, but will take a lot of commitment (the author will argue that it's a worthwhile commitment).The only real criticism is the author seems to have a rather big ego, but I guess I might also have one if I'd made millions from commercialising a personal productivity system.Of all the business/self-help books I've read, this one sticks out, as it provides practical step-by-step instructions, rather than broad blue-sky principles. Inasmuch as it requires quite a commitment, it can also work on many levels - ie. you can start with very specific things and build up from there as you go.Looking forward to reading this again in maybe a year."

It is the concepts such as 'Open loops' (anything pulling your attention that doesn't belong where it is, the way it is) that have helped me the most.If you try to implement this methodology, I suggest you try to do it your way, and the way you feel comfortable with (= cherrypicking), as it's easy to get bogged down in the details."

73,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,4,"At first I was concerned that the advice in this book would be at odds with my Live With Mess and my Why Time is a Feminist Issue (http://m.dailylife.com.au/health-and-...) philosophy that much (if not most) of what society tells us we Have to do is just  Feminine Mystique nonsense that we do not, in fact, actually have to do. I'm therefore naturally suspicious of anyone who says (as  David Allen does) that our problem is just that we don't have the Right System for Getting Organized.I was able to achieve Hegelian synthesis by noting that an important part of Allen's system is the option to Not Make the Agreement (or, as  Ayn Rand would say, shrug). Even if you're going to Live With Mess, there are still going to be things you want to get done, and Allen's system will help you decide what task you should be working on right now. Not Making the Agreement is not, as Allen says, lowering your standards; it's a truly integral part of being happy and making time for the important things in life.The book is a little dated. His methods, which involve lots of lists, seem much more practical now that we have smart phones. If I think of something, I can add it directly to the appropriate list on my phone, rather than write the note down on a post-it, keep track of the post-it long enough to put it in my in-box, and then add it to the appropriate list.I'm not likely to adopt the full method (I am not spending two perfectly good days Getting Organized, and I still can't wrap my head around what I would do with a physical in-box), but there were some worthy ideas here nonetheless:The Two-Minute Rule. If it takes less than two minutes, do it now, while you're thinking of it. This rule obviously needs to be tailored to the situation at hand (if I'm trying to catch the train, I really don't have two minutes to spare), but the general principle is that if the effort to capture the task somewhere where you'll remember to do it later is greater than the effort to just do it now, it really is easier to just do it now. I think this principle will help me file things rather than be tempted to stick them in a To File pile.Physical Space Matters. If filing isn't easy to do, you're less likely to do it. I had a paper organizer in the kitchen, where I keep mail and things to file, but there's actually no good reason for it to be in the kitchen. After reading this book, I moved the organizer to the guest room, where the files are. Likewise, if the files are overstuffed, it's going to be physically difficult to get files in and out. Either get additional filing cabinets or purge old files. After reading this book, I grabbed a fistful of old bank statements and tossed them, and now it really is a lot more pleasant to file.Have Separate To Do Lists By Context. If your to-do list includes ""Pick up CO2 cartridge at hardware store"", when you want to remember it is when you're at the hardware store or near it, not when you're commuting home on the train. By having separate ""At home"", ""At home computer"", ""While out and about"", and ""Phone"" lists, you can make sure you see the tasks you need to do while you're able to do them, and not get distracted by the tasks you can't do right now. In a similar vein, keep a ""Someday/maybe"" list, separate from your to-do list. You won't get distracted by it when looking for tasks that need to get done, but you'll also be able to store ideas that you may not be sure yet you want to pursue, but you don't want to forget, either.Always Ask, ""What's the Next Action?"" I think I already knew this one, but it doesn't hurt to be reminded. Try to do the cognitive work of deciding the next action up front, so that you can give yourself a menu of different actions to do, so that no matter your location, time available, and energy level, there's something on your to-do list you can get done.***""In training and coaching thousands of professionals, I have found that lack of time is not the major issue for them (though they themselves think it is); the real problem is a lack of clarity and definition about what a project really is, and what the associated next-action steps required are.""""I don't want to waste time thinking about things more than once. That's an inefficient use of creative energy and a source of frustration and stress. And you can't fudge this thinking.

Kennedy""'Long-term' does not mean 'Someday/Maybe'.

74,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5285795-una,4,"Do you constantly have a random choir on your mind which is neither urgent nor significant for your future existence? Do you feel overwhelmed with the mental list of all the things you should get to in the near future (“open loops”)? Are you always making to-do lists which are yet to be done? If so, this book is for you. Just don’t expect five simple steps for changing your life supported by vague wisdom such as “Unleash the power within” or “Goals allow you to control the direction of change in your favor”. Allen cultivates a completely bullshit free approach, and this is a completely unsexy book based on in-boxes, to-do lists, folders and labels, to paraphrase Roy Baumeister who touched upon Allen’s GTD system in his book on willpower. The main premise of GTD is that your inner voice is nagging you due to the “open loops” in your mind. This could be a trivial thing, such as calling a colleague or buying new towels, and the reason they are clogging up your short-term memory is that you have not properly defined the next concrete action for them (and you don’t have the systems is place to do so – this is where lists, folders etc. come in). Allen offers a pretty simple system to deal with your open loops (as shown here), which I am not going to summarize as I think practical examples throughout the book have more value than the theoretical concept itself.This brings me to my last point. The reason I am giving this book a 4 despite it being full of practical advice which can be used right away is the poor construction of its chapters. The first chapter is completely theoretical and did not resonate with me well, as I could not find any practical use in it. My advice is to just skip it as Allen goes through all these points again in the second chapter focused on implementation. "
75,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36069918-ramon-van-dam,5,"Having read several productivity books over the last couple of years, it's clear after reading this famous publication where those other authors got their inspiration. ""Getting Things Done"" feels like the basis for most of the newer systems and it will probably prove to be very helpful to me for finally having read this original work.I've been using the Bullet Journal method for almost two years now and I love most of that way of working, but I do lack a grip on the more general overview of projects and tasks that are not relevant for the current week. This is exactly where GTD seems to excel, so I can't wait to dive in and experience this other way of achieving focus. During the next period I'm going to follow this method using a system I've set up in Notion, hoping to find a combination of GTD and Bullet Journal that resides in my sweet spot.It's quite difficult to rate productivity books, since they have to prove their worth over a longer period of time. I do think that the last section is bit less interesting due to it's repetitive nature and listings of scientific research, but the second part where Allen dives fully into the method step-by-step alone is worth 5 stars."
76,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1512545-caitlin,4,"This is my second time reading Getting Things Done. The first time was in 2009. I used GTD for my freelance work, and then it saw me through my Masters degree and I only fell off the wagon a bit (not totally) when I stopped studying and my life got a little vague for a couple of years. Now I'm teetering on the brink of starting a PhD (on Monday!) it seemed like a good time to review my systems and try to smarten things up a bit.I really like this book. David Allen's system to me seems logical and clear and it works for me. As someone who tends to have an insanely high stress baseline and who also has a fondness for systems, I find the GTD approach really does help to keep me feeling in control and calm. It definitely isn't for everyone though, and if you absolutely hate lists and/or refuse to work with a diary/calendar, then you're seriously going to loathe Mr Allen and you should probably look elsewhere for your organisational needs.I find the book an easy read. Allen's writing, while definitely business-world-oriented and to be honest, a little dated in my edition (don't know if they've updated the text since the Palm Pilot was around, but I had a little giggle this time round here and there), is straightforward and the book's structure is effective. I've read criticisms in the past of it being somewhat repetitive, and this is true - but largely with purpose. Much of the apparent repetition is because of the structure, which I feel is a strength of the book. Allen gives an overview of the system in Chapter 2 'Getting Control of Your Life: The Five Stages of Mastering Workflow' and the whole second part of the book elaborates on how to do this. So if you're not sure it's for you, I'd recommend you get it out of the library and read chapter 2 because if it all sounds insane at that point, then there's no point continuing. Chapter 1 is about why everything feels out of control and I feel is useful for understanding some of the terminology Allen employs later in the book, but Chapter 2's what you want if you just want to find out what it's all about right now.The benefit of Allen's approach is that it tracks everything, but it presents you with only actual tasks you could do right now, which reduces decision fatigue which makes actually doing the things easier. The downside is that there is a LOT of setup work. And there are maintenance tasks to ensure it keeps running, although those are much less onerous. I suspect it's the setup that people balk at. For me, the setup was a massive relief, actually. Everything became such a disaster during the Vague Years that it felt really good to trawl through things and sort them out. Here's just a quick summary as an example:- Transferred my terrifying to-do lists out of my diary (where they were OK when I had very little on but had become unmanageable once my workload increased) and into Remember The Milk, which was my app/website of choice for a very long time and seems to have only improved in the interim. I resurrected my GTD system of tags and lists I used to use and refined it once the system was up and running (happy to share my setup if you're interested, of course!). I won't lie: at first, this was awful. So. Much. Stuff. But I've been able to quickly work my way through a lot of it which had been neglected for a long time. Now I'm getting used to it again and, 2 weeks after starting, I'm feeling much happier about everything.- My paper diary is now only for things that have an expiry date. Yes, meetings, etc. but also tasks which won't be valid after a certain time. This makes it easy to see what must be done today/this week or be abandoned totally.- I've done a major cull and reassessment of my digital storage services of which I had a ridiculous number. I now know which locations to look in for certain types of information or files (short-term/long-term, current or archived, for example) which is making everything clearer, both for finding and adding.- to be honest, I've yet to sort through the physical storage in my studio, which resembles exactly the sort of office situation Allen describes in his book - piles of unordered files everywhere, no filing cabinet, having to look for things in six different places. It's a mess, but I've found his policy of make-a-separate-folder-for-everything-that-needs-it-even-if-it's-just-one-sheet-of-paper to be extremely useful in the past - mostly I need to sort out storage.This has all taken me about 2 weeks (although, that's also been 2 weeks which have seen three major gigs to be prepared for/produced/played plus a lot of other stuff) and I've probably got about a weekend of dedicated work left once I get a filing cabinet in the studio to sort out the papery bits. Yes, it's a lot of time, but for me it's totally worth and it already paying off.Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. And if your organisational needs are simple, it's quite possibly overkill. But if you're interested, have a read and see for yourself. That may sound obvious and simplistic, but there's a lot of guff written about GTD on the internet which is of the ""it's the answer!""/""it's rubbish!"" variety. Like most things, you won't know till you try it!** After reading this book in 2009, I gave it 5 stars. I've dropped this back to 4 for this time round, mostly because I do feel that this edition at least is a little dated because of the massive changes in technology that have occurred in the last 7 years. I would imagine that most people considering using this system will be contemplating some sort of app for their phone to help them manage it but for current suggestions on what to use and how to use it, you'll need to supplement your reading of this text with a trawl through the (lunatic fringe of the) internet."
77,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25497268-miguel-palhas,4,"Filled with overall great advice, and a proven methodology and step-by-step program towards a more organized life.Granted, the first half of the book wasn't particularly useful, since it had only two things:* advice that seems a bit outdated in the digital age. At least to me and anyone that may have moved to a more paper-less life* advice that, as it turns out, I was already doing. Perhaps just not to the extent that the book teaches.The biggest takeway was by far the concept of completely emptying your mind, by taking notes, setting up reminders, and removing distractions, for 100% of your projects & goals. While I already relied a lot on reminders, a digital calendar, etc, the idea of going 100% on this never ocurred to me. But the principle makes sense. The brain doesn't deal well with time. We remember important things when they're not relevant or actionable. And then we forget about them in the worst possible situations. We're good at doing whatever is on our minds right now. We're not so good at controling what is on our mind right now.That was for me the biggest take-away.And it already made me adopt some changes in my life. I spent a few hours offloading a lot of my thoughts to digital notes & reminders. It might just be a temporary burst of productivity and motivation, but it already proved the book's point."

Even skimming it is a waste of time and energy: A) it could have been a useful reference article (go online and find it, I’m certain someone wrote a summary) B) I’m naturally doing most of the things proposed by the method anyway. C) why make something so simple SO bloody complicated?The only crucial point of GTD is to capture EVERYTHING you have to do, get it out of your head and put it into a reliable system you can refer to. Then you reflect on your list, prioritize, plan, execute, review progress, reflect… and voilà! The better you get at relying on your list, the more productive and stress-free you will be."
79,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216260-chris,0,"I’m going to mark this as read, but I’m not going to review it yet. I’ll think I’ll assign a star rating six months after the date of completion. I want to see if this is just another “how to be productive” book that I enthuse about for a week and then fall off of, or if it actually sticks. Getting things to stick has been the issue so far. This one feels promising, but let’s give it six months and see before we give it the life-changing five or the no-good one.The short version of David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” method is the complete and utter dumping out of every single possible obligation, task, notion of a task, project, long-term goal, shopping list, to-do list around the house, future vacation plans, things you might like to buy someday, ideas for Christmas presents, and fit them all to a sort of master list system. The idea is that you should have a sort of to-do list headquarters at which you can see every single possible thing that could be nagging you, either in your front-brain, or in that back part where you know you haven’t thought about it in ages, but you wish you could find time to get it done, just to have it out of your head. Just dump it all out, spread it out in front of you, and then – the second most important part – figure out “what’s the next step?” for anything active.To me, this is a pretty genius concept. As Allen notes, there’s a lot of times at work when you’ll leave a strategy meeting and everybody’s fired up about the idea of this new thing to work on, but nothing’s really been assign, no deadlines have been set. At best, you might get a follow-up meeting in 2 weeks to see how things are going. And then two days before, you say to yourself “oh no, who was supposed to work on this? Who does what? What are we trying to get done?”Allen gives examples of how to do this. For instance, if I decide that one of my projects is “get a physical,” your first question is “what’s the first step?” You might think it’s a one-step process: pick up the phone, dial the seven digits. But first you have to know what possible days you could afford to take off work to get a physical. Then you have to look up the number, and know the right time to call the doctor’s office. *Then* you call. That’s a really simple version, but it works very well with larger projects with lots of moving parts. Forget all those other parts, all the things you have to finalize and figure out later, the revisions and approvals from departments and getting the budget set and the specs from production. What’s the *next* step. Sometimes, it’s as simple as “call your supervisor and ask for a follow-up meeting to ask more questions in private.” But before that, it might be “go over the rough notes I took in the meeting and clarify the three questions I need to ask to get this started.” Sometimes, the road to the very next thing can be surprisingly far.So, you have all of your projects on a board (I like Trello) and your next-steps page. You’re also supposed to have a file of people who you are waiting on. You can’t proceed with updating the site until this person sends you their article. You’ve written them, and now there’s nothing to do about wait. You should have a file of these people that you revisit regularly. Then there’s a “tickler file” that you revisit via calendar notifications – do I want to study Excel in depth next year? Check back in 12 months. Also a “someday/maybe.” I don’t know when I’m going to get around to studying French, but let’s at least be thinking about it in case an opportunity presents itself.The part where it can break down (if it does) is that you have to be in and on top of this list *all day*, every day for it to work. When new emails come in, you track them – can they be discarded? Should I save them for future references? Are they pertinent to a project I’m working on? Do they require action? When new projects are assigned, you add them and figure out next-step, and ideally, some of the other major steps to be done. When you have a notion for a vacation for next year, you add it to “someday/maybe” or just down in the projects list. Allen suggests Friday afternoons, you spend 1-2 hours (!) every week going over next-actions for the next week, dumping any paperwork, emails, or ideas you’ve accumulated during busy days into the schedule, bring it up to date. If I can see it going wrong anywhere, it’s here. It’s incredibly gratifying to see every conceivable thing you could worry about in front of you. The downside is you then see that you have hundreds of tasks in front of you at all time. That could be an issue, or it could be a power. I know that I have a ton of projects I need to do someday (send a tape to that guy, send a zine to that guy, learn Excel better so I can freelance, finish this article, start this other article, sell these CDs for money), and seeing them all the time is beneficial to me, but I could see where it might also lead to paralysis. But as the author said, you should be able to see it all. Then, to use his words, you can “feel good about what you’re not doing.” Because at least you haven’t forgotten about it until the last minute. The question is whether you’ll get slack about updating it with each new thing, in which case you’re checking on the to-do list equivalent of the Parthenon.This is the dilemma. It’s a neat system, but it still requires a ton of vigilance and upkeep. I hope that works. So far, I’m enjoying it. But I’ll check back nearer the end of the year/start of next year. Hell, I’ll put it in my tickler file.See you in six months!"

According to him the first three chapters were the most useful. After skimming through the book I agree so I stuck to those, but I might read the rest of the book later. The writer gives the reader a concept for reducing stress by making a planning and an action plan. This sounds simple but it is elaborated really well and there are some surprising elements. Some eye-openers: David Allen says that the reasons some things give you stress are that you either haven't clarified what the intended outcome is, you haven't decided the next physical action step, or you haven't put reminders of the action required in a system you trust. Such a thing is referred to in the book as 'stuff' (because it hasn't been defined properly yet). Now that I think about it this applies to most things I'm currently stressed about. Some quotes (also for myself to reread): ""It is possible to be effectively doing while you are delightfully being""""Rule your mind or it will rule you""""The beginning is half of every action""""Things rarely get stuck because of lack of time.

Not because it's given me a new way necessarily of viewing the world — not like that – but in giving me a new approach to ORGANIZING my life which, maybe in the end, DOES affect how I view the world.Since adopting Allen's GTD method, I'm certainly feeling liberated — intellectually, creatively, you name it. The GTD method revolves around the principle that a person needs to move tasks out of the mind by recording them externally. That way, the mind is freed from the job of remembering everything that needs to be done, and can concentrate on actually performing those tasks (thanks Wiki!) The basic requirements for managing your commitments are:• If it's on your mind, your mind isn't clear• You must clarify what your commitment is and decide what you have to do to make progress toward fulfilling it• Once you've decided all actions you need to take, must keep reminders organized in a system you review regularlyAllen meticulously describes ways to tackle these requirements in his book. Is it ""light"" reading? Not really. It's not really all that fabulous of writing either. But it's the concept that makes it so great and if you have a NY Resolution to ""get organized in 2010"", this book HAS to be on your to-read list!!! (Random aside: Allen incorporates lots of ""side"" quotes into the book -- here are a few of my faves:The constant, unproductive preoccupation with all the things we have to do is the single largest consumer of time and energy. — Kerry GleesonThose who make the worst use of their time are the first to complain of its shortness — Jean de La BruysreYour work is to discover your work and then with all your heart to give yourself to it. — BuddhaLuck affects everything. Let your hook always be cast; in the stream where you least expect it there will be a fish. — OvidThe secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret to getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting with the first one. — Mark TwainCeasing negative imaging will always cause your energy to increasePeople are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them. — George Bernard ShawLife affords no higher pleasure than that of surmounting difficulties, passing from one step of success to another, forming new wishes and seeing them gratified. — Dr. Samuel Johnson"

91,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13106364-brett-whysel,4,"Read this book if you want some ideas to begin to organize your life and hopefully get more done with less stress and anxiety, assuming you already have a good sense of your values, priorities and mission (s) in life. The most valuable part of this book for me was the exercise of writing down everything that was on my mind that I either need or want to do now or someday in the future (chapter 5). As the author promised, this freed up some brainpower that had been leaking trying to remember this stuff in the background. It also gave me an opportunity to think more creatively about things I really want to do, for example, taking a psychology class and tennis lessons (someday). It also offers a helpful flowchart for thinking about how to handle potential new projects as they appear on your radar. The rule of thumb of completing projects that take two minutes or less as soon as they appear is helpful. I also have found constructive the rule of reserving the calendar for things that have actual hard deadlines. This keeps makes my calendar less intimidating and more dependable place ""sacred territory"" to hold things that absolutely must get done. I also like the idea of a deep weekly review that makes sure all of my projects are on track.Don't read this book if you have trouble setting priorities or are still figuring out your major goals and raisons d'etre. To determine which of the 100+ projects I came up with in the exercise above to do next, the author advises the reader to use their intuition, based on the context, your energy level, time available and priority. This is the book's greatest weakness because it requires deep thinking and thoughtful decision making several times a day, which consumes energy that could be spent completing the tasks. I'd like to see an algorithm or heuristic for deciding which project comes next. I expect to figure something out after a few weeks of using the GTD system.Overall, a useful read. My advice is to read most closely chapters 2 - 7, 9, conclusion. The rest can be safely skimmed."
92,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1382279-austin,1,"This is a classic of time and task management that I read as part of leveling up my organizational skills for work, and while there's a lot of wisdom in the book and plenty of time-tested principles, it felt a little too diffuse and prolific to stand as the most coherent, simple, and airtight way to manage one's work. I think partly this is because it was published in 2001, before Google Calendar was in wide use, but much of the discussion about using paper and binders is now obsolete for those comfortable with digital tools. Granted, there may be some value in physical rituals of prioritization and reminder, and I do in fact use paper notebooks to track my daily work items and master lists, but it's really a much simpler system than what he describes, and one that is effective for me.The book is replete with amazing quotes from great luminaries, as well as solid principles of self management; here are some of my favorite: --""Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax."" pg. 10--Things are often on our mind because we haven't clarified exactly what the intended outcome is, or decided exactly what our next step will be, or have not put effective reminders to continue the process of completion over time. pg. 15--Our Reticular Activating System in the brain means that, ""You won't see how to do it until you see yourself doing it."" pg. 68. IOW, imagine yourself vividly doing and then do. --""We must strive to reach that simplicity that lies beyond sophistication."" pg. 148--""To make knowledge productive, we will have to learn to see both forest and tree.

Most experienced people will probably already be doing checklists if that is something that matches how their brain works (which leads to my second point).2) If the reader is experienced, then the person will most likely either a) already have started on techniques like checklists, or b) if checklists don't match the personality, then a book won't be the right way to learn this. Learning the techniques presented in the book naturally appeal to people who are already very structured.***SPOILER ALERT***In my view, the book could be summarized in a few bullets:* Do anything that can be done in less than 2 minutes straight away* Keep track of your tasks in lists* Check your lists frequently so you don't lose track of what's important* Create a simple system for your files including reminders if you need to get back to any of them at a set future pointThe book argues that because technology is changing so rapidly, it doesn't make sense to recommended tools to how people can best accomplish the techniques. While this may be true, it does mean that the reader will anyhow have to invent their own process as most tools aren't flexible enough to cater for any kind of process.My ""tech stack"" to solve the above as of this writing includes:* OneNote (went away from using Evernote as prefer the OneNote app for iPhone/iPad)* Gmail* Google Calendar* Google Keep* Pen and paper (quick notes and drawings to structure my thoughts on the go before adding to OneNote for future retrieval)"

I wish I had read this book much sooner!David Allen has been called one of the world’s most influential thinkers on productivity and has been a keynote speaker and facilitator for such organizations as New York Life, the World Bank, the Ford Foundation, L.L.

Before this, I had never used anything more sophisticated than daily check lists, and those were serving me pretty well - but again, I think Allen identifies some actual, real issues with the ways our brains process ""stuff to do"" and his system seems efficient at capitalizing on what our brains naturally do very well, as well as handling what our brains do NOT do well (I mean most of his arguments are loose and self-help-ish, I just think he's probably right. And he has does have ONE chapter on like actual, peer-reviewed psychology). And it's cool that the whole system really boils down to like 2 or 3 principles that can be implemented in ANY way you could possible want. But yeah, if you're looking to develop ~better productivity habits~... I would recommend at LEAST finding like a blog post or something about this book. On the book: 1. I think the information in this book could probably be communicated in like 30 pages or less. This seems to be the case with like every self-help book. That said, this IS one of the better ones I've read. 2. He has this obsession with paper that's super weird to me. I mean, I'm sure it's a generational thing. But this is supposed to be the ""updated"" version where he talks about implementing these ideas using like ~computers~ and software...but it seems like he added like maybe two paragraphs to the original (written in like...the 90s, I think?) that were like ""also, computers exist! they have DIGITAL folders! and email!""

96,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/323067-mike,4,"I heard a lot about this book in various Apple and scholarly blogs. It has a rabid following amongst technology types and some academics. As I LOVE my to do list, and am prone to stressing out about things on said list, I was intrigued enough to check the book out. I didn't read the entire book, but I did get a lot out of it. His basic point is that in order to have a clear mind for concentrating on the task at hand, you need to have a system in place to capture all of the projects/tasks rattling around in your head. Once you get it all down, you can be free to focus on - wait for it - getting things done.It makes sense, and I have implemented a number of his suggestions. First, I've stopped putting due dates on tasks that don't actually have to be done on a certain day. I used to fall prey to feeling bad that I didn't complete the tasks I had lined up for my day, but of course I never finished my goals for the day. Now I don't feel bad as things slip. Also, he advocates three basic kinds of lists: action lists, project lists, and tickler lists. The first are immediately achievable, the second require multiple action items, and the last are not achievable at this time but should be revisited later. I was already doing something like that, but the book helped me refine my process. This book was good to read right before getting my iPhone and migrating to a new to do list system, Remember The Milk. Definitely check out www.rememberthemilk.com if you are interested in a great online task manager."
97,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6404508-neeraj-sachdeva,4,"Complete Review Available HereIs this book worth reading?Short Answer: An emphatic YES (Scroll to the bottom for breakdown)Long Answer (Brace yourself):The book delivers what it promises, the art of getting things done.The book is succinctly divided into 3 different parts, each explaining the concept, practical implications (how to) and further explanation. It breaks down each and every task – from shopping for toilet paper to leading a conference – into a list of actions that can streamline your productivity and help you achieve the best out of your time.Often, the tasks involved do take up lot of time (especially in the initial stages), but this is offset by saving time spent on doing them. Plus, the method requires a HIGH level of consistent functioning, which can be off-putting to many a soul. But if it is off-putting to you, well, there are more issues to resolve (and not just how to get things done!)The book can be a little difficult to read at times. Another issue is lack of work-sheets. I would have expected a book such as this (those that motivate you to take action) to issue worksheets that can kick-start your organisation process. However, I presume there are business reasons behind this (now they cannot feed you everything in one basket, can they?). Still, only read this book if you are willing to change things and get organised. Rest assured, this book will do wonders for you, only if you want it to!"
98,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/334225-steve,5,"You've got too much to do and you're trying to juggle it all. How do you manage the overload of tasks? David Allen's ""Getting Things Done"" book offers a comprehensive, it-makes-sense system for keeping all of your various tasks under control.The basic idea of the system is that your brain is unreliable and focuses on the wrong things at the wrong times, so you need to either work on something as soon as it arrives or use a system that you trust holds all of your pending work-to-do. Since so much of modern work comes in all at once, it's hard to do the former, so this book focuses on how to deal with the latter.It's most definitely not perfect -- it works much better, IMO, for ""manager"" or ""consultant"" style work (where there are lots of little discrete tasks) rather than creative ""flow"" work where you really need immersion for long periods of time and tasks/milestones really do require large amounts of time -- but it's the best thing I've run across for dealing with the random stuff that falls into my lap.Also, it's incredibly popular on the Internet, which means that people are generating software tools to help you implement this. It really only needs paper, but you can get as complicated as you want, which is part of the fun of the system. (Just beware falling into the trap of optimizing your system instead of actually doing work.)Highly recommended."
99,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/297735-jess,5,"I read this book 2015 and read it again in 2018. I got value out of it both times I read it.The first time I read the book, I applied many of the techniques in the book to my weekly habits. I started using the weekly review technique. I started using the two minute rule. I used a trusted system, Basecamp, to store all my to do‘s. These techniques were a tremendous help to me.When I read the book again, about three years later, I relearned some techniques. I had forgotten them for the first reading. I realized I could apply them to make my productivity even better. The second reading reminded me to separate my next actions into projects. It reminded me how to keep track of things I am waiting for other people to do. It also helped me realize that keeping a long list of to do’s is not effective. I have a daily to do list, and after rereading this book, I only put what absolutely needs to get done on that list. (Otherwise, the to-do list can get unwieldy, overwhelming, and ineffective.)People say this is one of those books you can read over and over again every few years, and each time you read it, you will glean something new from it. After the second reading, I agree with this assessment. I highly recommend reading the book at least once. If you read it a second time, you’ll gain even more value from it."

Despite the fact that Allen's physical implementation of his methodology can been seen as outdated by many when we have apps like OmniFocus on our computers, smartphones and tablets, there's something to be said about keeping things simple. I personally find big productivity apps distracting so getting back to basics with ""Next Action Lists"" and the other ideas expressed in this book was actually a relief for me.Even if you don't want to implement the GTD system that Allen gives us in the book, it's still a great book to read as it gets you thinking about ""Desired Outcomes"" so instead of saying, ""I need to clean my office!"" you take the time to think about what your desired outcome for your office is! How can I streamline my office to best serve what I'll be doing in my office? What things do I need within arms reach and what can be stored in the bookcase at the other side of the room.I also love the whole idea of getting all of the ""Open Loops (defined in the book)"" out of your head so you can achieve a ""Mind Like Water.""So far I've listened to the audio book that's narrated by Allen himself and it was a great listen. Allen has a voice that's easy to listen too and his personality really comes out in his reading of the book which makes that more interesting."

(Usually, that kind of cover would make me run in the other direction.) However, I took a chance on this book because of the overwhelming praise from the the Book Riot community. I can honestly say that this book has changed how I organize my personal and professional life. The concepts in this book are relatively simple, but designed into a brilliant system for managing our over-flowing ""to do"" lists. I have already started following many of the GTD practices and am already noticing a difference in my stress levels. I've gone from feeling overwhelmed to feeling productive and in control. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to improve the management systems in their lives, either at work or at home. The advice in the book can be applied broadly to any aspect of one's life.My only complaint is with the book itself, which could have been much shorter. The first section is essentially one long introduction, which was unnecessary. For a book about productivity, Allen could have written a much shorter, more concise book.I would recommend reading the revised 2015, which was rewritten to include more modern productivity tools, such as smart phones."

Till the half of the book, he will keep promising you about the great effect of GTD, with no real applicable points.2. Many times the author will keep repeating: it is great, it is awesome, it is heaven on earth, blah blah blah, just to make you psychologically believing in this just by repetitions.3. Then finally in the middle of the book, he will jump to what he calls applicable actions, to discover a very poor content. It is even hilarious that tens of pages are just listings of what a list could contain, I can understand one example, two, five, ten, but not more than 30 examples! That's useless.4. The style is boring, and ideas are repetitive, he could summarize the whole book in 30 pages, but the author loves to say things again and again, he sometimes says even very basic things which makes you wonder, does this have a value to repeat it so many times. 5. Do not waste your time. The ideas provided are very small and primitive, I can summarize them for you as: if it takes 2 mins, do it. if you can delegate it, do. Collect or ideas in list, prioritize as you want, and always break tasks to subtasks, keep it visually in front of you and not in your mind! Really! what a discovery! This are things that no one was aware of ! what a shame."

The first time it felt very tedious and boring, giving all these information on creating lists and organizing tasks.But the second time around I could actually get a clearer picture of how beneficial and helpful this book could be in life, both personally and professionally. Of course, you can be more creative and use an android application or similar platform to keep track of your life and goals.At work, I always created a to-do list which would be useless by mid-day, since there were so many tasks that kept on piling up as the day went by. In the end, I was exhausted and more confused that ever. But after reading this book, I have a better means of coping with this and knowing how to put everything in order.What is profoundly important is the author's explanation and idea on how to organize your projects and goals in a systematic and effective way, in a manner that will ensure you don't mix up your projects and works. I loved the author's workflow charts and different models of organizing and reviewing projects on a daily, weekly and regular basis.A gem for all individuals wanting to survive in today's chaotic world."

To be honest, I mostly read them for the temporary motivational boost, and only occasionally incorporate the presented tricks into my own life. However, this time, it’s a different experience. There weren’t much “empowerment”, but more ""this might work"". In other words, there're less BS and more implementation details.So I was compelled to try out this method. It took quite a bit of effort to set up because I have to reassess his method and incorporate it into my existing one. But I’m quite pleased with the result. Now I am aware of all the commitments that I made, both to myself and others. As a result, I have a greater sense of control and is less stressed about the things. I believe this system will yield more fruits going forwards. Just need a bit of maintaining.As for recommendation, I would recommend this book to people who has set up some forms of tracking system but are not happy with the result. For those who has never maintained a tracking systems, this might be a bit challenging. But would still work if you invest some more time in the setup."

Firstly - David Allen is not the greatest narrator, to say the least. He's voice is monotonous, not-involving. It's easy to float away from the book and start paying attention at a road while you're driving (which might not be a bad thing after all :) ). Secondly and worst of all - common David, it's 2012 ! I know that the book was written in 2002 (at least the latest revision of it), but why not to update the contents for an audio-version (released in 2008) ?In a world ruled by iPhones and desktop computers David still suggests to organize flow using paper clips and paper folders. What's worse - he spends a great deal of the book talking about it. I'd much rather him to talk more about the ideas and leave the rest for readers imagination, than spend 30 minutes talking about in what folder put thoughts and what to do if a thing doesn't fit the folder.Still - ideas are great. I'll be looking for another book, something like 'GTD in modern world'"

I was relieved to find out I was wrong on only one account. It was mind numbingly boring, true [but isn't that the case with how-to books?]. But I did glean bits here and there about productivity. There were a lot of things written down that were self affirmations, but Allen presented neat tricks that I am confident in integrating in my daily life. Not everything- because I feel if I followed him step by step, I would feel like a robot. With that being said, the book started off great. I was instantly drawn to his 'voice'. Instead of mere written words, I felt like he was in the room with me, coaching me out of my procrastinating habits. But then I got to the middle of the book and my mind dozed off with no redeeming information that would draw my attention back to the text.

The author's contention is that taking care of the details and emphasizing the ""Next Action"" habit creates the freedom for more creative and longer-term thinking. Following up with the little things is also important for maintaining trust in any group, whether it's a business, community organization, or family. I'd recommend this book for anyone who is responsible for creating and/or putting into place multi-step actions, and for any group that meets and has a tendency end without clarity about what the attendees are charged with doing."

134,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51717117-thomas,5,"TL;DR: Your brain is full to overflowing with all the ""oh yeah, I really need to do that"" of life and as a result it's hard to think straight and actually do anything. So make sure you have a good system to get the to-do's out of your head and into a system you trust.NB: This book isn't kidding, it helps A LOT.I did a training in Getting Things Done at work a couple of years ago. A bunch of things clicked into place and I realised that this was exactly what I had been looking for. I put the basic stuff into practice and I'm already a crazy machine of productive efficiency. Then I thought, ""you know, I should really that book and see if I can pick up anything new"". So I did!The core argument is that our brain can only juggle so many things at a time in its short term memory. As a result, if we try to simply remember the things we need to do, we're going to end up forgetting something important (very recognizable) or we're going to be too distracted by other stuff we're suddenly remembering in the moment to focus on any one task for long. It detracts from both the quality of our work and our peace of mind - constantly stressed out about things we realize we should be doing.The solution is to offload your mental to-do list into a physical system (aka writing it down, or putting it in an app) that you know you will use and that you trust to be complete and exhaustive, but that won't contain unnecessary clutter. Use a periodic process (I do it weekly) to bring it up to date and make sure all your other inboxes are empty. For each item, think about what the next physical, concrete step is to making it happen to stop yourself from procrastinating. Also, decide about what things you're NOT going to do because you already have enough on your plate.It sounds so simple, but it works extremely well. I recommend it to literally anyone - PLEASE read this book if I have to interact with you, because it will make it easier to get stuff organized :P I use it both professionally and personally.The only critique I would say I have of this method, which the book doesn't actually go into very much, is that becoming more productive doesn't necessarily give you more free time. Unfortunately, what happens over time is that your standards rise of what you think you should be able to do, and you take more onto your plate. (This is similar to the concept of induced demand in traffic). Being able to get more done is still pretty cool, but I feel like this book on efficiency needs requires a more spiritual response somewhere along the lines of: do I really need to be doing all this stuff? Shouldn't I slow down somewhere?Still, that's a pretty nice problem to have."
135,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,4,"Who among does not have trouble Getting Things Done? I'm conflicted about this book. The core advice is solid, but the follow-through to the hard parts is often skimpy.The goal of Getting Things Done is a productivity flow state, or what Bruce Lee called a ""mind like water"". Allen's insight is based around the cognitive-psych wisdom that working memory is a very limited resource, and that anything you have on your mind, even minor stuff like a mental to-do list or inbox, is taking up resources that should be used to make important executive decisions; you are after all an import business executive, right?The first tool for doing this is a mental model of do-defer-delegate-delete. Anything that hits your awareness should either be done immediately, if it can be done so, deferred or delegated to the right person or future block of time for a complex task, or deleted. Most things in the universe are spam. The second tool is a rigorous system of alphabetical folders, which should contain every pieces of paper in your life, and every piece of information similar to paper, especially emails.I buy the importance of these two tools, the need to reduce clutter, and the need to block out large chunks of time for purge and organization to set up the system. Allen also recommends that you add your personal life to the system. After all, a successful business executive like yourself would never let family and friends waste away because they aren't on the agenda. The thing is that setting up a knowledge management system across multiple email accounts, computers, cloud file systems, etc, is legitimately hard, and there's not much there. Allen also recommends a weekly review session to make sure that there's alignment between long term goals, your projects (something you intend to finish in less than a year), and what you're doing right now, but didn't have much to guide these review sessions except ""think wisely"".Getting Things Done is not actively wrong business advice, some of which I've read, but there's a major gap between what's recommended and what's doable, and I'm not sure how well the half-measures work."
136,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51059965-codeblue,4,"I am not sure whether I should be upset or relieved by the fact that the author openly admits there is likely nothing in this book that I am not already doing personally to get my ducks lined up in a row. However, I stuck with it and found myself during several explanations shaking my head in agreement. The framework makes sense. I even compared it to my knowledge and expectations in how software projects are managed using Kanban, Scrum, and Agile. There are similarities that can be drawn between all three. The collection habit is requirements gathering, the processing habit is requirements analysis, .. and the process continues. So why were Kanban, Scrum, and Agile so hard for me to implement in my personal life without feeling like something was missing? Maybe it was just the assurance of the framework, or perhaps it was the difficulty in managing several projects at once, but really I think that David Allen hits it on the head, at least for me, by providing a means to determine what the best next action is for me to be taking and by renegotiating the rest of my actions so that there is no guilt. In order to do this, Getting Things Done has the user provide a lot of up-front analysis to determine every single open loop that is sapping away precious brain power and defining at least one single next action that will move it forward. While the idea is possible in Kanban, Scrum, or Agile - most do not want this kind of up-front analysis because it could lead to analysis paralysis and may cause difficulty in pivoting to go a different direction. For me, this is why this method pertains better to personal everyday life - and best of all, can be paired with a Kanban, Scrum, or Agile methodology to complement the Getting Things Done method. After all, once the initial analysis is done David Allen says you are only managing a series of lists. I will have to see if I am singing this same tune after another read through the book/audiobook."

138,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27510691-ray,5,"I started reading this book during the Christmas break my senior year of college (2 years go). I had pulled it out from the library and read about half of it before having to return the book and go back to school. After looking at it on my goodreads ""currently reading"" list for so long I finally decided to get it from the library and finish it.I do not understand why there is so much hate in the reviews. Is the book perfect no? Is it very detailed? Yes. Do you have to follow every step? Absolutely not. Does the author's connections to the East invalidate his ideas? Nope. It's a self-help book for goodness sake. If someone is reading this they're probably trying to get a little more organized (or are unfortunately forced to read it by someone trying to ""fix"" them). If you're trying to get more organized this book has a nice methodology that works for some people. Give it a read/skim, try the ideas you like, discard the ideas you don't like, and call it a day. The quick summary of the book is:If you write everything down then it relieves the burden of forgetting.If you write everything down then it'll quickly become a big mess so you'll need to organize/prioritize regularly.The book has really concrete examples of how to do this that you can pick and choose from.If it takes less than two minutes to do, do it now.A fair criticism of this that you shouldn't have to write things down because if it's truly important you won't forget it and it's okay to forget the rest. That's great if you have a mind (trained or natural born) that does this for you. That doesn't work so well for everyone, especially when what's important to you and what's important to the people you're accountable to aren't the same. So just do what works for you and don't worry about people saying you should/shouldn't write everything down. Enjoy your life :) "

And I was so happy for the solutions he offered that I would have overlooked a lot worse.Growing up with ADD meant my head was often filled with chaos and sadness. I like to describe the feeling as constant static on my mental TV screen. It wasn’t whimsical or random, just stressful and confusing. Background noise everywhere. Life felt like a swamp to muddle through.Adulthood has been better, but it wasn’t until this year that I realized how much power I have to get out of the fog for good. What life can look like with a healthy body, clear mind, and clean conscience. Getting Things Done won’t help with your body, but it’s been a powerful weapon against anxiety and depression. There’s a moral dimension here too: doing the right thing is so much easier when you can see your options clearly. I’d recommend Getting Things Done to anyone who wants a way out of the junkyard of their mind, anyone who wants the answer spelled out in a big marquee. Anyone who wants to take the next step towards stewarding their time well. "

Some of the systems make sense but others have become outdated, for example the folder filing system is too crude and useless. Much of the book has become outdated, since some of the cognitive rules still apply, the book is worth a quick skim, other than that the book isn't going to add huge value to you. And the book is thoroughly boring i.e. you will find yourself asleep at regular intervals during the reading, it is a tough book to read i.e. written like a science text book without adding any value to turning the next page, there is no concern to keep the user engaged or curious about the contents of the next page.

It has also completely rewired the way I think about to-do's; I try to now only think of things as projects (throw a birthday party for mom) and next actions (text brother asking what flavor cake mom likes) vs the ambgious to-do of ""Mom's bday.""Also, the book isn't ""only"" about how to tactically implement the GTD system but it also talks a lot about the psychology + reasoning behind why the system works which I really enjoyed.

(your use of the system) shifts from implementing the most effective way of dealing with the inputs and demands of your day-to-day world to optimally taking advantage of self-created contexts and triggers to produce creative ideas, perspectives, and actions that wouldn’t normally occur.” I can only imagine how awful the original manuscript was if this this is the edited version.

I don't value productivity for the sake of productivity, but I do care about being more present in situations and reflective about what I do. The book's core thesis is about clarifying the ambiguous thoughts that are always in our head for a matter of things, externalizing it to free up your capacity to be more present. This act of clarifying also serves as a reflective exercise to connect what you do with your purpose behind it and the why.In terms of practical advice, the feedback of doing what takes under 2-minutes immediately, managing tasks not just by urgency but also by context, time, and energy, as well as making sure your to do list is only of items that are clarified to purpose and next steps were what stood out most.The book's advice is actually quite helpful, but it's not the most fun read. The second half of the book almost serves as a test to see if you've learned the material in the first half to see if you're actually capable of getting things done. I think I would have quit halfway but continued on because the irony of not finishing a book titled ""Getting Things Done"" was too much (the second half ended up being helpful too, even though it was more of a push to finish)"

A lot of his descriptions of why we get anxious and avoid doing the things we want to do when we are disorganized really resonated with me. And while it's true that the book is long, repetitive, and arguably gets bogged down in details, I kind of liked that because I didn't grow up with the greatest education in executive functioning and sometimes struggle with the nitty-gritty of planning and action. So it was good in a way to have some of that described in the most basic possible terms. Still, I can't really compare this with other systems, and I can't say if I recommend it until I see whether taking its suggestions is feasible for me or has a positive effect on my life. Maybe I'll update this when I find out."

Every next read is about getting more into the details.- 2 minute rule: if you remember to do something and it takes you less than two minutes to do it, just go ahead and do it- write things down in lists so that they don't float around your head and nag at you all of the time- check your lists frequently and often, actually doing the things on the list (or delegating them, or archiving the info), otherwise you will lose faith in the system and it will never work.I think that Michael Finocchiaro's review here is spot on: ""It does not have an annoying religious aura to it like 7 Habits or the selfish haberdashery spirit of How to Win Friends and Influence People, but is down to earth and highly practical."""

It gives you total control over your work. The five crucial steps in the GTD process are:1. Capture your thoughts in external collection tools that you routinely empty. This frees up your mind to do what it’s really good at: thinking and solving problems.2. Clarify what each item is and what you can do with it.3. Organize the outcomes into a structure of lists, like your Calendar and your Projects, Next Actions, Someday/Maybe and Waiting For lists.4. Reflect on what is important to you and review the items in your system. This is crucial because it ensures that you continue to trust in the system.5. Engage your tasks. Pick which action you can do something about given the context, time and energy available, as well as your priorities."

I may or may not revisit this review once I've tried to implement.If you are a person who is already very organized, does not get distracted worrying about all the things you need to do and rarely loses track of things, this book is probably not for you."
149,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95506724-joseph,2,"The first third of the book is worth the read, since it deals with concepts and general strategy. As I got into rest of the book, I realized how far we have shot into the future with Project Management tools since 2001. There really isn't an excuse for most people in full time office work (or if you have a smart phone) for not being able to manage your time and ""things to do."" Managing people is another issue, which is the hardest part about all of this. People aren't projects, but work projects involve people. I work in an environment where very little is done in Executive Management to follow the principles laid out in this book for managing projects & people. Because of that fact, it's almost pointless to follow these methods unless you work alone or use this for personal / private project management."

It became so redundant that I started skimming chapters just to finish it so I could return it on time. The writing is painful to get through, complete with jargon for common words. For example, he uses ""Next Action"" rather than a ""to-do"" list. It also has no target audience. Its target audience is people who are extremely disorganized and unproductive. 1) They probably won't be reading this in the first place, because of procrastination. 2) The system, in its entirety, is so complex and difficult that you'll probably spend more time worrying about the system rather than getting things done. There are a few nuggets of information, but nothing mind-blowing."
151,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4000322-joel,3,"Some helpful tips in this book:1. Write down everything you need to do to free up your mind.2. If something will take less than 2 minutes just do it.3. Determine the next steps for each of your To Do items.4. When thinking of your To Do items envision what the outcome will look like.5. Regularly review all of your To Do items (like once a week).Things I didn't care for:1. This book is quite dated, with a lot of references to paper based organization.2. The system the author suggests is too complicated with maintaining multiple lists (Projects, Next Actions, Waiting, Someday/Maybe, etc.). A simpler approach is to use a Kanban board (like Trello) and have cards that move across columns like To Do, In Progress, and Done. Each card can contain all the status information.3.

The steps for actually setting up GTD are discussed briefly in far-flung sections of the book, which makes it really hard to remember and implement.The methodology actually sounds very useful, but the way this book lays it out is so abstract. It almost seems like he's trying to get you to purchase a practical follow up book, like the step-by-step ""installation guide"" pdf he sells for $10 on his website. Shouldn't that be something that is included in the book itself?"

All it really boils down to is a simple yet effective system for managing lists that helps make sure nothing slips through the cracks. It turns out that just getting things off your mind, organised into the right list, and defining what needs to happen next really does feel good and frees up the energy and motivation needed to actually get things done. I'll need to check back in a year to see if I'm still managing to keep the system going, but a few weeks in and it's already helped me feel more in control of an outrageous number of ""to-dos"". Not 5* because even the new 2015 edition feels dated and a few of the latter chapters felt a bit like filler. "

Most is common sense and I’ve been doing some aspects of it already but two big things that are new to me and should help tremendously:1) if it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now. Old Ryan has been guilty in the past of putting items on a list that really have no business being there at all. 2) the next action list needs to have just that, a specific action. I’ve been guilty in the past of putting some vague high level project on a to do list and it sits there forever. Thinking of what the next thing I can do to progress it is really helpful. "

All the good stuff is instantly available for next to nothing or free. I love the core idea that goes something along the lines of ""Your head is not a filing cabinet"". Light 4/5"

157,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4056983-mitchell-mohorovich,3,"The main goal of this book is to strive for the state of ""mind like water"", where your mind is able to absorb, process, plan and compartmentalize work using a thorough methodology. By doing so, freeing your mind from the stresses of trying to constantly recall ""open loops"" (uncompleted actions you are tracking in your mind), and instead relying on your external database of sorts to store that information for later recall. There is of course a lot more to the book than that, but that's the foundation that I took from it.Does the book accomplish teaching you and presenting this methodology? Yes. The three stars are given for the content of this book. This methodology is something that a lot of people working in the knowledge economy or just with complex lives where you have to keep track of multiple actions for multiple people over the course of time will greatly benefit from.My main issue with the book is subjective, and has to do with how it's written and presented. The first is the age of the book. While I read the newest edition, it's painfully obvious that majority of the content is carried over from another era. The tacked on technological references which are ironic, given the author's sort of averse tone towards electronics – sometimes coming across as the kind of person who's proud to not know how to change the input of a TV. Then the examples get better and more out of touch with the general public, like I get it, and there are literally multiple chapters where he goes on about how amazing he is at coaching high powered executives, but when you use examples like, ""I've got to call my financial advisor about the trust fund"". All I can think (in the most sarcastic tone possible) is aha, oh yes, don't you hate it when you forget about your trust fund! Happens to the best of us!Anyways, references to brief cases, rolodexes, filing cabinets and trust funds aside, the methodology is solid. While I had already implemented a large subset of what he outlined, the parts new to me, in just a week of implementation have already significantly improved my work life."
158,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97631-jessica-thebluestocking,5,"So, I've apparently been living under a rock. I did not hear about this book until a couple of months ago, as I was Googling ways to be more organized. I had a crazy December at work, which was made even crazier by the fact that a few things fell through the cracks. In an effort to keep things like that from happening again, I ordered Getting Things Done. And I love it. Here is the publisher's peppy synopsis:In today's world, yesterday's methods just don't work. Veteran coach and management consultant David Allen recognizes that time management is useless the minute your schedule is interrupted; setting priorities isn't relevant when your e-mail is down; procrastination solutions won't help if your goals aren't clear. Instead, Allen shares with readers the proven methods he has already introduced in seminars and at top organizations across the country. The key to Getting Things Done? Relaxation.Allen's premise is simple: our ability to be productive is directly proportional to our ability to relax. Only when our minds are clear and our thoughts are organized can we achieve stress-free productivity. His seamless system teaches us how to identify, track, and-most important-choose the next action on all our tasks, commitments, and projects and thus master all the demands on our time while unleashing our creative potential. The book's stylish, dynamic design makes it easy to follow Allen's tips, examples, and inspiration to achieve what we all seek-energy, focus, and relaxed control.So, I loved this book. It has really revolutionized the way I organize my life. It's a very simple concept. We can't be truly organized, productive, or relaxed, until we develop a trusted system to handle things. Allen argues that we spend a lot of energy letting things roll around in our minds. How many times have you laid awake in bed with thoughts running through your head? (I need to pick up milk. Oh, I need to return that phone call. Yikes. I really need to talk to my boss about that.) Getting Things Done teaches you how to empty your head and inbox into a trusted system so that you don't have to stress about forgetting things and, when you do have time to get things done, all of things you could be doing are listed before you to enable you to pick the best thing to do. Here are a couple of quotes from the beginning of the book that really struck me as profound:More and more people's jobs are made up of dozens or even hundreds of e-mails a day, with no latitude left to ignore a single request, complaint, or order. There are few people who can (or even should) expect to code everything an ""A,"" a ""B,"" or a ""C"" priority, or who can maintain some predetermined list of to-dos that the first telephone call or interruption from their boss won't totally undo. (8)Intellectually, the most appropriate way ought to be to work from the top down, first uncovering personal and corporate missions, then defining critical objectives, and finally focusing on the details of implementation. The trouble is, however, that most people are so embroiled in commitments on a day-to-day level that their ability to focus successfully on the larger horizon is seriously impaired. Consequently, a bottom-up approach is usually more effective. (19-20)It's genius. And, shockingly, it's very readable. I generally avoid business books like the plague, because they're all the same. Five pages worth of ideas spread over 200 pages. Eck. But Getting Things Done is actually filled with useful information. I've even gone back recently and reread important chapters.Finally, it's a bit of a tradition with ""GTD""-ers to post about their set up. So, here's a brief description of mine. Keep in mind, I've been honing this for a month or so, and it's still being refined. Also, I work from home most of the time, while keeping an eye on my one-year-old, and I'm physically in the office only once a week. Thus, I need a system that I can use wherever I am. I have an iPhone, a personal laptop, and a work desktop. While I love paper, I came to the conclusion that an electronic system was going to be the most efficient.For calendaring, I use Outlook for work items (required by my office) and Google Calendar for personal items. These two calendars sync to my iPhone. For next actions (GTD lingo for tasks), project lists, waiting for list, and someday/maybe list, I have been switching back and forth between two applications: Toodledo and Nirvana. They both have their strengths. Toodledo is established, has an iPhone app, and interfaces with dozens of other applications. But the user interface leaves much to be desired. Nirvana is still in beta and has only a mobile internet interface, but it is beautiful and handles project-based planning better than Toodledo. Both of them are web-based, which means I can access them from anywhere.For my project support materials, I use good old-fashioned file folders. I also have a limited physical filing system. So far, I have opted not to use a tickler file or contexts for next actions.See what fun it is? You get to develop a system! I highly recommend this book."

Finally, I found the most recent edition on audio, and decided that listening to it would be the easiest way to read it. I was right.

To get things done, we have to begin with looking at our purpose, our vision, and the next steps. I’m always jumping forward to the doing without thinking so much about the foundation and I felt GTD did a good job of reminding me to pause, organise, think, do and review."

This should also add more to my planning system.And what I love about those methods, you don't have to incorporate all at once and be extremely overwhelmed, just add one at a time and check if it works or not.

There are chapters at the end that go over information that was presented in previous chapters, but in deeper detail. I skimmed a lot of those. I like the concept, and I like the system.

So I already swear by inbox zero, having a separate ""waiting"" list for items that you need other people to act on, and defining your task as specifically as possible. And ""What's the next action?"" is my new mantra. :- DI listened to this book on audio and it was a pleasant experience (it is narrated by the author and he did a good job) but I know that I wasn't able to fully absorb all the information coming at me, so I definitely want to get a physical copy of this book to be able to revisit the material whenever I need. Nevertheless, I became aware of several points I can start working on right away. I had high expectations going into this book, since it is so well-loved, and I was not disappointed.

It took me a while to get through because it is really down to the nitty gritty. I thought that I would find it more interesting knowing that I like to find new ways to organize. It did have some really interesting concepts that I took away from the book, and it did help me get a few things that were sitting on my plate completed. If you are looking for a systematic way to organize home and work, this can help. If you really like to get down to the very specifics, you will like it more. I found it a slow read as I also found that I reading about the very descriptive details can bore me."

I'm an unorganized person who dreams of being organized.I definitely buy into Allen's fundamental premise: the mind is an inefficient place to store information and tasks; getting all that 'stuff' into a good system frees up the brain to be A) more relaxed, and B) more creative. Allen's methodology for capturing, processing, and completing projects and actions is, in my mind, intuitive and powerful. Recently I have started combining Allen's ideas with a small bullet journal as a way of organizing my daily tasks. I like it. But at the end of the day, I think I will always buy into GTD.

210,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1412589-remocpi,5,"Antes de empezar este resumen, leed este texto (viene de este artículo) y pensad en si os sentís identificados: I was going to tackle my procrastination problem last weekend but I never got around to it.By Sunday at 5:48 pm I realized I had blown it again. Throughout the week I feel like I barely have enough time to cook, eat, tidy up, write an article and do the odd errand. I lean towards the weekend, when I have two whole days to finally get some work done. To improve my blog, to catch up on my correspondence, to get some monkeys off my back like fixing things that need fixing, organizing things that need organizing, tackling things that need tackling.But the weekends go by and I never catch up. I don’t use the time well. Time is not what I’m short on, even though that’s what I tell myself all week.Sometimes I do sit down early in the day and pound something out, but then I give myself a well-deserved break and that’s usually the end of any productivity. I end up clicking around on the internet, then clean up, then cook something, then watch a bit of a documentary online, then try to work again, then get distracted. Then I decide to wait until after supper to do some work, then I start reading something after supper, then if I’m still home, it’s already after 9:00 so I decide I’ll get an early start the next day.I avoid taking on the real important stuff. I create work of secondary importance so that I never really have to confront the really worthwhile things. When I get on a roll, I back off and stay backed off. I take breaks that turn into written-off days. I am addicted to hanging it up for the night, to letting myself off the hook.The important stuff doesn’t get done, at least not before my procrastinatory tendencies have created an obvious, impending consequence of not doing it, like incurring a fine, really letting someone down, or getting fired.So much of what I want to do isn’t terribly difficult and wouldn’t take a lot of time to get done. Looking at my projects list now I have items like: book an appointment for X, send in that change of address form, phone so-and-so about Y, write a short piece for Z. And many of them have been sitting there for weeks or months. I have the most bizarre aversion to tackling things.Getting Things Donee (GTD) es un clásico de los libros de productividad. Propone un método para eliminar el estrés de nuestras ajetreadas vidas, con prioridades no siempre bien definidas y siempre cambiantes. No hace distingos entre vida personal y profesional. Para él, organizar una primera comunión de nuestra hija o contratar a un ingeniero son tareas que entran de la misma manera en el flujo de trabajo que propone. El libro es de 2001, por lo que muchas de las cosas que propone son físicas, con archivadores y cajones. Hoy en día todo lo que propone lo puedo hacer ocn un programa conmo Evernote, que me ayuda a archivar, clasificar y tener siempre a mano en cualquier lugar con conexión a internet todos los documentos que yo quiera. El núcleo del método es el flujo de trabajo: 

En esta entrada de Nacho Espino hay un resumen muy breve del método y aquí hay un paper científico que toma GTD como una vía de acceso a una praxeología, o una teoría de la acción práctica (los filósofos modernos se dedican a algunas cosas que desconocía, claro). Me lo he tomado muy en serio y la verdad es que si uno se pone a seguir estas normas sí es cierto que de repente el flujo de trabajo se simplifica. Siempre hay una única cosa que hacer, todas las demás están apuntadas y listas para revisión y ordenadas por prioridad. Hay trabajo de revisión diario y semanal, pero se hace (lo hago) con bastante alegría. Y he metido mano a tareas que llevaban pendientes conmigo desde hacía años. Y, sobre todo, me libera de tiempo para pensar no en lo inmediato sino en mis objetivos estratégicos. Qué quiero hacer con mis hobbies y en un plazo superior a un mes en el trabajo. A dónde quiero llegar. La verdad es que llego tarde pero con ganas. Y lo recomiendo."
211,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2274384-robin,5,"Rather difficult to review this book, as I haven't had a chance to put it into practice yet. I'm sort of in limbo between 2 households.This is a long review, and I have skipped some minor points, but I think this is it in a nutshell.**spoiler alert**In places GTD reads like a self-help/motivational seminar, which is okay -- that's what it is. Some people (and I admit to being one) just need a hand to hold while they deal with 'Pandora's boxes' (my own term for things put aside to deal with ""later""). Allen's theory - how you need a comprehensive outside system to keep all your information for you and free up what he calls your 'brain RAM' - makes a lot of sense, and the Work-Flow system really does work. It is, as others have said, very much 'Duh!', but the presumption is for someone already stymied to have the Work-Flow system out in front to keep them on track, to help prevent them from being truly overwhelmed with everything being dealt with.And you will feel overwhelmed if you implement the GTD system! In the beginning, you set aside some time for brainstorming through ALL your commitments and projects, write each one on a separate piece of paper, and put it in an IN box (regular office style, or even just a designated place) to work through later using the Work-Flow system. Allen advocates putting Absolutely Everything in your life on the table for processing, because otherwise, he says, your brain will still be using its RAM, running round in circles, making sure you haven't forgotten anything. The GTD system is set up to free your brain from expending all that energy. Allen says that implementing this will free you from the stress of always trying to remember everything, as you'll have one system, instead of myriad little notes and to-do lists. After brainstorming, you start at the top of your IN box and with each item or piece of paper, go through the Work-Flow system.I've paraphrased that system below, and basically it runs like this --1. 'Stuff' to IN box (like I said, that can be anything - your brainstorming notes, papers, books and folders to file or just put away, projects to be worked on)2. Define to yourself 'what it is'; in other words, take just 15 seconds to actually look at it. Don't do it yet (that comes later), but right now clarify and acknowledge its presence in your life.3. Ask yourself 'Is it actionable?' Does something need done about this; is there a 'next action' needed?4. If you answer 'No', then either -- a) Throw it away, *OR* b) File it for later reference, *OR* c) Put it aside for later thinking and review5. If you answer 'Yes', then is it part of a project? If so, then put it aside for either -- a) Planning and brainstorming, *OR* b) Review for Next Action6. If you answer 'Yes', and it is not a project, then ask if the Next Action can be done in the next 2 minutes. If the answer to that question is 'No', then either --  a) Delegate it (if need be) to the person who can do it, *OR* b) Do it yourself ASAP, *OR* c) Do it at a later specified time7. If the Next Action can be done in 2 minutes, then JUST DO IT.As you can see, a good filing system is a must for using this plan!The real trick to GTD is, once you have things in running order, to keep up with it, brainstorming when needed, and going through the Work-Flow chart once a week, especially the Review files (what Allen calls the Tickler files), the Project files, and things you've Delegated. I suppose that's the trick anyway to Life-with-a-capital-L, but it seems to me the GTD program is one that would incorporate your complete Life, and be much easier to jump back into if things slid by for a bit.Some reviewers have said Allen should have just presented the Work-Flow system in pamphlet form instead of a couple hundred pages. But there are other ideas in here -- and besides, I think the book was written for those who need a day-long seminar, who need various other ideas, anecdotes and suggestions to allow us to wrap our brains around what turns out to be a true lifestyle change.... At least, I'm presuming the GTD system will be all that. I'm still in the brainstorming stage!"

214,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8964382-supriya,2,"(Listened to the abridged version on Blinkist).Nothing new, though. Already known stuff and methods. *shrug*"
215,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5248325-sandy-h,4,"I listened to this as an audiobook on a road trip this past week. For the first half of the book, I found myself thinking, ""Yep, already do that--yep, already do that too."" I didn't think I'd get much out of the book in the end. But when I'd finished listening to the whole book, I'd decided I needed to buy it so I could go back through and highlight some things and I was inspired to immediately put a couple of habits into action as soon as I got home. I'm already pretty well organized in my work life--I use Outlook tools and OneNote like nobody's business. Still, though, there's always room for improvement to catch those things that pretty routinely fall through the cracks; plus, my personal responsibilities tend to lag a bit in the organizational department. If I know I have to call a contractor or set up an appointment, it tends to take me several days (or weeks) to get around to doing it. As I've got some new developments in my life that will require an even higher level of organization in the months to come, it's time for me to assess what I'm already doing and tweak it to make it better. I will be going through some of the processes he outlines in this book to get myself back up to speed.Although he does sometimes reference particular tools he doesn't rely on one product or another--he talks, instead, about looking at what you're already using and seeing if you can use it more effectively; he also talks about categories of tools you'll need (calendar, file system, etc), leaving the decision about what exact type of tool in that category works best for you. His website has a store and you can buy his brand of organizers and such, but the book doesn't talk about his own brand of things, so I didn't feel I was getting marketed to the whole time. I did purchase a book written by someone else on using OneNote with his system, again, in the context of trying to see if there are more effective ways I could be using what I'm already using. After listening to the book, I also was inspired to get back in the habit of using an app on my smartphone, LifeTopix, more fully. I've been using it consistently for some aspects of my personal life (I like to keep my personal business out of my work Outlook), but wasn't using it as effectively as I could have been. His book inspired me to update some information in it and recommit myself to using LifeTopix more. If I were starting from scratch, I'd probably have rated this book higher than three stars. I think for people who are feeling really scattered, there's a lot of good information in here about ways to pull it together. I wasn't keen on the level of seeming-dependence on paper in his system, but he does talk about digital options if one doesn't want to do paper--I try to be as paper-free as possible in all things. I think it will be a fairly simple proposition to adapt his system to my more highly digital life. So, I'm rating it 3 stars for me as it has good information but wasn't exactly life-changing for me. (The book The Power of Full Engagement was more so an eye-opener for me.) But if you're feeling the need to really get yourself organized, this would likely be more of a four-star or five-star book for you.**Later Update**I've now finished reading the Kindle version of the book and updated my rating to four stars. I really have found myself using several of his techniques pretty regularly the last few weeks, so apparently more sank in than the original three stars I had given it. It does help me feel more in control, despite the fact that I kept coming up with more things I needed to remember to take care of every time I sat down to read another chapter. "
216,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20580737-duncan,5,"""Oh, I do GTD"" everyone says. ""Do it, Delegate it, Defer it"", it's simple. But the majority of people seem to never get around to actually reading it. And, well, no, it's not quite that simple. And yes, you should absolutely should read this book. And yes, this is a rant about a particular task management system and how it would be great for you. I know the cliche. But perhaps this time you'll actually pull your finger out and actually read the thing. It took me seven years before I finally did...School these days prepares us pretty horribly for dealing with the multitude of inputs to our lives that slap us this way and that minute-to-minute and day-to-day. Usually people end up running several todo lists when things get overwhelming, but these are just partial brain-dumps that temporarily alleviate the deluge. The GTD system is pretty simple at its core, and much of the book is actually dedicated to implementing it. The ideas are pretty simple - firstly you get everything out of your head and into some external management system that you trust. Then you use a pretty simple algorithm (that's where the ""do it, delegate it, defer it"" line comes from, but that's only a part of it) to deal with new stuff that comes at you. Then, the process of ""getting things done"" really comes down to essentially having two dimensions on your data. One is the ""project"" and the other is the ""context"". When you plan things you use a project view: what needs to be done to complete this project (a project being anything with more than one step, and anything that is just one step ending up in a general ""miscellaneous"" project). The second is the ""context"", which is much like the todo lists you're probably sporadically utilising at the moment, only they contain /everything/ that you need to do in a particular place (supermarket, home, work, byt the computer, visiting mom and dad, at the chemist, ...) so that you never end up thinking ""what was that thing that I need to do in this place"", and then remembering when it's too late.It's a great system, and the only thing I could say about the book is that it could do with an update to make it more modern. These days you really can use a task management app for most of the stuff that he suggests that you write out on paper. I use Omnifocus myself after experimenting with some other less pricey apps. The advantage of Omnifocus is that it's not a general task management app, it's specifically tailored to GTD, and it does that extremely well. You have an inbox to dump things to, in order to get them out of your head. Then you move those things to the general miscellaneous bucket list, or to a project of their own. You break down the projects into tasks and to everything you assign a context. Then wherever you are (be it at the computer using the mac app, or out and about somewhere using the iPhone app, you have everything right there at your finger tips.Well, that's probably enough ranting about the merits of GTD. It's definitely worth looking at as a way to solve your perpetually swamped, disorganised and hectic life, and to get rid of all those ""piles"" of ""suff"" that you leave everywhere and you'll definitely get round to sorting out one of these days..."
217,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15998949-caroline-bennett,4,"I've read lots of stuff good and bad on the internet relating to this method of time management. I can only give you my own opinion having tried it.I've been using this method now since early October. That's only three months but I feel like a different person. This REALLY works for me. I've been disorganised all my life pretty much. I started trying to write everything in lists at work and it didn't work because I would have to look through the lists of vague ideas for stuff I had to do. Then I didn't know where to start. The way of sorting lists in this book is really simple but it has solved all the problems I had with my organisation system before.I now use the system outlined in the book at work and at home. I work on paper because I tried an online list system and it didn't work for me. I love doing my weekly review. I feel so calm and happy when I've just done it and it only takes an hour. I do my personal one on a Sunday night and my work one on a Monday morning. What this system can't do is give me fifty hours in the day. But it does give me clarity.I used to run from one thing to another wondering why I couldn't keep up with my life. I now know where I am. That is so useful. I don't have to remember everything anymore. I just write it down and stick it in my intray and know that I'll come to it. It also means when I am dog tired I don't have to decide ""what shall I do right now?"" I just look at my list and there it is and I just do it. So why not five stars? Two minor points. Maybe it's because I'm British but the authors teeth on the front cover freak me out every time I look at it. It looks like he's wearing a white gumshield. The teeth also make other people think he's some telethon preacher. It felt like an embarrassing book to hold up in public. Second point. The man is obsessed with the word elegant. DUDE! Find a thesaurus. But apart from that - I love it!Update: It is now December 2018 and I am still using this system. I now work from home (a jump I wouldn’t have dared make without knowing I could be organised enough). I have switched to a mostly paper system and still tweak my system but it brings me so much peace of mind. We just finished Christmas and got all my cards written and posted in time, made my own cake, marzipanned it, then iced it all on schedule. Presents were bought and wrapped, posted or delivered on time. Meet ups with family organised well in advance, stuff needed for random Christmas gatherings added to the weekly shopping list, so no need to make frantic dashes to supermarkets at inconvenient times. On Christmas eve I had nothing to do but enjoy myself. This all sounds like bragging but in 2014 this would have been unthinkable. I was a scatty, self-blaming mess. Now I feel calm and capable. This book has truly changed my life for the better.Update: It is Summer 2020 (hello Coronavirus) and I am still using this system. Five years on and it is still super useful, learning more and getting more out of it all the time. I hope I will be 82 one day and still using GTD. "
218,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5607449-jessica,2,Not my favorite. Overwhelming organizational filing system that seems outdated. Liked the 2 min rule. Found myself procrastinating to finish the book.
219,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/814660-greg,2,"For something that is supposed to save time and simplify my life, the Getting Things Done approach (author David Allen) seems overly complicated and time consuming to me. It is replete with laundry lists” of things to do and methods for doing them, to the point that, if I adopted the methods whole cloth, I think I would be managing my time all day long rather than actually getting things done. I still like the simplicity and directness of Covey’s “priority management” approach, as described in his book First Things First. While not strictly time management – in fact, he argues that one cannot manage time, only priorities – Covey’s four quadrants have helped me immeasurably to think about and focus on what is most important to me and to do those things in their proper order.Nonetheless, I found some useful (to me) tidbits in Allen’s book. He describes five phases of getting organized:1. Collection: gathering everything needed to get organized – all your “to do’s,” paperwork, project inputs, etc. – all in one place, and then placing them into some sort of in-basket. That can be physical, electronic, voice recorded, or any other means one prefers. 2. Processing: Encompassed in a few questions and actions. Question #1 is “What is it?” Based on that answer, the next question is “Is it actionable.” If so, the third (and most valuable to me) question is “What’s the next action?” (see my review of Regina Brett’s God Never Blinks for a similar idea). Another useful idea is the two minute rule – if the next action would take two minutes or less, do it now. Keep in mind, though, that many things that can be done in two minutes aren't worth doing at all! Finally, for everything else, do it, delegate it, or defer it...mostly, do them. 3. Organizing: After doing what you can, then distribute the remainder into three locations: trash, incubation, or reference storage. In my experience, most of what I would have put into reference storage twenty (or even ten) years ago is now easily found on the web or in easily accessed databases. Avoiding “compulsive keeping” (my words, not his) is my biggest challenge to staying organized and simplifying my life and office.4. Reviewing: Simply staying on top of what needs to be done so that it doesn’t become forgotten. Many ways to do this, but the book is somewhat dated as it was published in 2001. The principle is what matters here, not the method.5. Doing: This one is obvious…The most useful insights to me were what I found in the section on processing, and in particularly the questions to ask yourself as you engage in daily, weekly and more long-term planning. This is one book that I think would have been better as a meaty article. In book length, it feels too much like what some of my students do...padding a paper with non-essential material to make it reach the desired length. "
220,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6941120-ingrid,5,"EDIT EDIT: 3 years later and I still implement the GTD method in my personal workflow, using the all-in-one workspace wiki Notion.EDIT: As of Fall of 2017 I no longer use ""The Secret Weapon"" GTD-spinoff for my daily planning. I exclusively stick to the David Allen philosophy, and I also want to mention that in the end, Evernote did not work for me as a planning system anymore. Simple tasks, yes. But project planning, and time allocation, no. I now use Trello, a project and task management program that has made my GTD workflow tremendously easier. It has been a year and a half since this journey down productivity-paradise, and I can say I am a firm believer in the GTD method and give it 5/5.This book left my mind in shambles after reading, as well as my preconceptions about time management and efficiency over effectiveness. I've actually already been a diligent user of the slightly tweaked GTD method for five months now (Check out http://www.thesecretweapon.org/ if you're looking for a smoother computerized integration with your GTD system) , but this semester of school definitely exposed the rough cracks in the pre-book system I made. Ironically, in my Evernote GTD system, I added a note/task of ""Read GTD book by David Allen"", and here I am six months later. Talk about procrastination. This book is definitely for people with little control over their management flow of their personal and work lives, and who need legit guidance on how to allocate their time and energy resourcefully. If I hadn't spent a whole ten days reading this book, I wouldn't have realized how sorely lacking the GTD system I'd created was. There are millions of articles out there that give extraordinary accounts of David Allen's book, but in my opinion, I'd prefer to taste the cuisine than read an abstract of how great the cuisine is, if you know what I mean. So what did I personally gain from this book? Lucrative advice on how NEVER to leave your inbox of ""stuff"" to pile and desecrate itself. The four (or possibly five, I lost count) key parts of building the GTD system are : 1. collecting 2. organizing 3. processing and 4.daily/weekly reviewing. But failure to dust and sweep your system every day and week (the reviewing phase), and your system could vaporize before your very eyes.I actually wavered between a 3 and 4 star review because, again, much of what he advocated I had already implemented prior to reading his books. Because this is a pre-2000s productivity book, much of his advice sordidly praised systems I would stare aghast in sure shock. No Generation Z or millennial is thinking about buying 43 (WHAT!) folders for the ""tickler system"". Nevertheless, his advice seems to still be relevant for the majority of Americans living 9-5 jobs in work offices and the sort, so I couldn't discount any of his techniques. Just ordered this book on Amazon for keeps sake. Will be even happier in the next few days when my paperback copy is in my hands!"
221,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6453713-sally,5,"I really liked David Allen's holistic work-management system based on principles, not specific actions. The principles of identifying open loops at every level (life/vision/responsibilities/projects/actions) and keeping everything in the same physical system to clear your mind are intuitive. I recognize a lot of similarity between Allen's GTD and the KonMari Method: basically, one is for the clutter of physical stuff, and the other is for the clutter of work/mental stuff! Meanwhile, most of the methods he recommended in this book based on loose papers, in-baskets, files and cabinets are outdated and not particularly useful in the digital age. For example, in the next-actions list part, Allen recommended setting up lists by context, e.g. ""calls"", ""errands,"" ""at home,"" ""at office,"" and ""at computer""...nowadays 99% of my to-dos are ""at computer."""

223,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6920466-tyler-suzuki-nelson,4,"I started this book years ago, but didn't end up finishing it. It's more of a manual than anything else, with instructions on how to implement David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) method. Back home where I first started reading this book, I had too much stuff which would translate to too much time to go through everything. Fortunately, I have since then moved out to UBC (at UBC's Marine Drive Residence) where my clutter is greatly reduced (though still not minimal). As a result, I decided to try this book again over the Winter break.Over the course of about 5 whole days, I managed to actually get through the book and start implementing the system. (If you are planning on trying out the GTD system, you really do need to set aside quite a few full days to get started if you want to do it best. I think it would have taken me substantially longer if I broke it up into small chunks after work.) Now, my room is still a mess (though, in the process of getting cleaned), but I actually feel organized and in control again. Last term, although I knew I was in control of everything I needed to get done, I didn't feel totally in control of it all. This book seems to have helped with that.Ultimately, the GTD philosophy, at least as I interpreted it, seems to be summarized as this: get everything out of your head and into an organized system; this will allow you to focus on tasks at hand, without the distraction of your worrying about anything you're forgetting about. Roughly, the GTD method involves a series of steps, which roughly can be described as a collection step (in which everything you can think of that is actionable or not in its ""proper place"" must be collected together), a processing and organizing step (in which all collected items have their fates decided; that is, for example, it is decided whether something is recycled, added to a calendar, or added to a to-do list), and a review step (in which case all organized collections are reviewed to ensure that everything that needs attention gets that attention; this is supposed to happen weekly).Thus, I have tried it, and I like it so far. I will probably quickly skim through the book to review it in a couple months, but I think I understand most of the steps well enough. It seems time consuming, but I think it ultimately does save time in the long run. Good luck to anyone who tries out the method (really, if you read this book, you should be implementing the method; I don't really see much point otherwise)! Let me know if you have any questions :)"

I'm a stay-at-home-mom, and hoping that after reading this book I'll be able to be ""stress free"" as the title suggests.This book was written for professionals in an office environment. He has a few examples in the book about life/home. But 95% is office based examples. As a stay-at-home-mom with a ZILLION things on my plate every moment of the day, it was a little difficult to see how the concepts apply to me. While reading, I tried my best to imagine my life in the book. Aka.... when he says ""a client walks in your office unexpectedly and brings a new project that you'll need to start on right away"" and I imagined ""your 2 year old running into the bathroom with uncapped markers in hand and self-inflicted artwork from head to toe"". Catch my drift? All of the examples he used were irrelevant to someone in my ""profession"" as Mother/Homemaker. However, I appreciate his main objective: getting everything off your mind and into a trusted system so your brain doesn’t have to work overtime trying to remember all the ‘stuff’.I can see how stress free living is possible with his system. I hope that I can make it work for me. I like that he says you can choose what NOT to do. So if you know ALL the things you want/could/should do, you can effectively choose what to do and what NOT to do at any given time. Knowing all your to-do list items (aka, Next Action items), and allowing yourself to choose if you do them or not. For example: enjoy time with kids, enjoy your weekend. No need to stress about your to-do list and also the 153 things that aren't on your to-do list that you know you still have to do.I recommend that if you read this book, just buy it. Because it’s the kind of book you'll want to highlight, mark up, make notes, and reference back to frequently as you are organizing your ‘stuff’. Also, plan to read it over a period of time (not all in one or two sittings). I suggest DOING what he suggests AS YOU READ IT, taking it all step-by-step. I didn't do this; I just read the book and sent it back to the library. My initial rating after reading this book is 4 stars. I'm trying to implement his methods to organize my life. Depending on how well his ideas work for me, I’ll adjust my rating up or down :-)"

Like RAMs on a PC, too much ""stuff"" stored in a person’s short-term memory can blow a fuse. The conscious mind is a focusing tool, not a storage place.GTDs aim is to make you have 100% trust in a system for collecting tasks, ideas, and projects—both vague things and concrete things.Lists you need:1. Inbox - Put everything into inbox, organize it weekly and remove stuff from here into other lists.2. Next actions - Tasks that need to get completed.3. Waiting for - Tasks that are waiting for people to respond.4. Projects - Lists of different projects.5. Some day/maybe - Throw stuff in here that you are planning to do someday. Rules:- Store everything in your inbox.- Empty your inbox an maintain your lists once a week. If its not maintained, your brain won't trust it.- Use fewest collection buckets that you can get away with. - Only put time specific tasks on calendar.- List all stuff as clear actions. Action is defined as the next physical, visible activity that needs to be engaged in, in order to move the current reality toward completion.- Non-actionable stuff: Throw away or keep as reference material.- Will next action take less than 2 minutes? If yes, do it. If no, delegate it or defer it.- Organize and do tasks by context. Like phone tasks, internet tasks, shopping tasks etc..- Tools should be fun to use—but not too fun! If you have a slow and complicated tool for managing your lists you will subconsciously resist collecting small tasks, and if your tool is too fun to use you will end up over-using it and spend time playing with its amazing features. Find something that works for you.- For larger tasks that require two or more steps, create project folders for them. Distill each related task into tiny to-dos, each one easy to check off, and build up to completing the project.- 20 minutes before the end of a meeting, one should ask, ""So what’s the next action here?"" to increase clarity. Example contexts: @Home@Shopping@Hospital@PhoneExample Lists:-Life Goals-Reference Storage-List of Projects-Calendar-Reminders of next actions-Things you’re waiting for"
226,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6001927-tech-wizard,5,"Some of you may have heard about Getting Things Done, GTD, a trademarked program by David Allen. There may be some of you have heard about it but arent really sure what it is. It would be impossible for me to go over the whole program, but one of the best things I can say about the ideas behind this book is that I can happily say they work, and you coming and sharing this website with me and learning from some of my ideas is the only proof I need. And the only proof really that you need. The real goal is to train yourself to run on autopilot for productivity so you can decide where you want to point your attention. You should get to the point where you spend a day brain storming and idea, coming up with actions, but then spend the week just carrying out those plans, do anxiety or stress because you know what you have to get done. (There will be humps....there will always be humps.) I have been implimenting the program diligently, and I am a master proscrastinator, often getting consumed in the idea I have rather than trying to make it happen. Sometimes there seems to be too much to do, or I start on one thing and jump to another, with no real guidance I find myself frustrated. But I took my brother's advice and started reading this book and now have found myself with Specific Projects set up with the next actions I need to take to accomplish them. Some planning and organizing leads to a very fluid and manageable program allowing for idea to be seen through to actualization, and does so in a way that it is really pretty fun at times. Personal Outline:Get Thoughts out of your HeadWrite Everything DownHave specific actionsBreak ideas into projectsDo one action at a time, alway have the next action readyProductivity on Autopilot Get the book as you can find it used on Amazon and is the single best investment you can make for getting your projects together and your mind clear.

Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity provides an effective vaccination against day-to-day firefighting.Stress typically occurs from inappropriately managed commitments you make or accept. The Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology helps you clarify your commitments by getting them out of your head and specifying what ""done"" looks like. The secret sauce is ... lists -- lots of them!It is a waste of time and energy to keep thinking about something that you make no progress on. Instead, create a list, identifying the desired outcome and specifying the next action. If the desired outcome requires multiple next actions then you have a project. Most people have between 30 and 100 projects swimming around in their head, causing stress. Get these projects out of your head! Developing the habit of keeping nothing on your mind explains the Art of Stress-Free Productivity.The behavior most critical for success is the Weekly Review. Participating in this activity will likely prove frustrating if you haven't yet captured, clarified and organized all of your ""stuff.""

228,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4064254-riki,3,"It seems fitting that my first book of the new year would be one about stress-free productivity. As a college student with plenty of other life's pursuits on my plate I am often concerned with getting everything done and had been wanting to read this book for a while. In its opening David Allen describes a productive life in which we aren't bogged down by the minutiae, yet are highly productive in the necessary areas of life by utilizing proven tools to focus our efforts. The book is then divided into three parts.In Part One, Allen lays out the program. After a lengthy bit of office jargon he introduces the idea of ""mind like water,"" where we react simply and appropriately to issues that arise before returning to our previous state of mind. It centers on the idea that overreacting or under reacting to daily interruptions and situations undermines our productivity. We want to be in the ""zone."" He hints at how the program will help achieve this before moving on.In Part Two Allen introduces the actual facets of the program and breaks down each part in detail based on his 5-part process. Including details such as collection of ideas and making plans, he stresses the importance of a weekly review in which you assess where you stand on projects and items you have collected and recorded. Beginning with how to set up and get started, he launches into the practicalities of using the program on a day-to-day basis. Among the gems in this section is the two-minute rule of doing anything that will take two minutes or less immediately.In Part Three Allen gives practical examples of the program at work and wraps up his findings. After completing he book I have a few great ideas of how to implement better productivity strategies, but feltlike the book was filled with a lot of jargon. The concepts are helpful and easy to implement, but the delivery of information is wordy and boring. I'd like to have read a sort of Cliff's Notes version of his ideas rather than devoting so much time reading the entire lengthy book."
229,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/398304-elizabeth-schlatter,3,"So the reason for the 3 stars is that this new edition offers very little in terms of extra content than the version originally published in 2002. There's a bit more at the end about mastering GTD and a chapter on GTD and Cognitive Science, but otherwise not much. Clearly, Allen should work with a co-author to do an edition of GTD that embraces new technology. In this version, there are throwaways lines and paragraphs that pretty much amount to ""if you're good with computers and mobile devices, you can do this digitally."" But the bulk of the GTD system is still described in terms of paper, and sometimes Allen talks about the benefits of paper vs. digital (with paper winning). I use Evernote for my GTD system, and have for at least 2 years now. I set it up using the GTD & Evernote guide published by David Allen Co (https://gettingthingsdone.com/store/h...), and they also offer guides for Google docs and Omnifocus. So I assumed that the book would be all-in in terms of marrying the system with various apps. But, uh, no. And I get that Allen doesn't want to be seen as endorsing different technologies or apps, or making references that will date this revised version quickly. But still, way more could've been done here to flesh out using the system using digital tools. It could also have been offered as a model of incorporating sustainability into the GTD practice. The only reasons I'm not giving it a 2-star review is because...1. It's always good to review the GTD book to refresh your memory of the system so you can better adapt it to your needs. So I appreciate that opportunity.2. In the chapter about mastering GTD, Allen starts with the sentences: ""GTD is actually a lifelong practice with multiple levels of mastery. ... It's like mathematics, pottery, art history, or even parenting. All of these endeavors involve learning and applying a particular set of moves and techniques, and there's no end to how good you can become at them, or how many subtleties there are to explore.""

The methods described in the book are a bit outdated, especially for the younger crowd, but the principles are solid gold. Being a hardcore productivity nerd, I've found this to be the best book on the subject. In short, the GTD philosophy is this: your brain is a terrible place to keep things you need to do. If you remember them at all, you'll remember them in the wrong place. For example, you remember that the flashlight needs new batteries when you pick up the dead flashlight, not when you're at Walmart and could buy them. Your brain becomes very stressed out by knowing you have things to do, so it's actively trying to remember all of them all the time, not just when you need the information. (Why this philosophy is great for people who worry or are anxious!) The idea is that you need to get everything out of your head and written down in a system you trust; one you will review regularly and be able to trust it won't lose the information (or make it hard to find). That's it. Personally, I implement the system with a physical inbox at home and at work, Remember the Milk for lists accessible on all my devices, and Google Calendar for appointments. I'm currently experimenting with using Wunderlist to gather my ""keep in mind"" lists, such as a bucket list and writing topics. The initial purge of information from my brain was one of the best feelings ever. I sat down and just wrote pages and pages of things that needed to be done. Read reviews of GTD methods and see what you think would work best for you, then try a couple of them. For ideas on how to implement GTD, the blog Lifehacker is a great resource, both for reviews of tools for the system (such as RTM, Producteev, Orchestra, Wunderlist, etc) and little things to make those tasks easier. (Best blog EVER.)"
231,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9653496-hanne,4,"This is something my colleagues often mock me about: when I go in complete über-stress mode and deadlines are coming up sooner than they seem humanly possible, I close everything down and start cleaning my desk. Then I take a big empty paper and write every little thing that has to be done (even things like “carry this to the other building”).By having some time away from it and jotting it all down in little actions things all of a sudden become manageable again. I might lose one or more hours doing this, but somehow in the end I gain much more. I know that this might not make sense, but it does. It just calms my mind and then I can focus it on things one at the time.This book is basically telling me to run into a mode similar to that all the time instead of just three times a year.“The short-term memory part of your mind – the part that tends to hold all of the incomplete, undecided, and unorganized “stuff” – functions much like RAM on a personal computer. Your conscious mind, like the computer screen, is a focusing tool, not a storage place. You can think about only two or three things at once. But the incomplete items are still being stored in the short-term-memory space. And as with RAM, there’s limited capacity; there’s only so much “stuff” you can store in there and still have that part of your brain function at a high level. Most people walk around with their RAM bursting at the seams. They’re constantly distracted, their focus disturbed by their own internal mental overload…”I’m not sure I will implement everything he suggests, but there are a ton of very useful tips that I have already implemented and let’s see how it works out.Oh, and I spent money on not one, but two Filofaxes!

Personally I don't buy this. One could argue that time has moved on yet the method is so anachronistic one would need to severely modify this to the modern way of thinking and working and it's only a decade or so old. I swear Allen must have shares in filing cabinets suppliers and must go through a million sheets of paper a year.The basic model is to capture everything you want to do, log everything and record it and decide a next action and review everything. The guidance on assigning importance really is a bit woolly and to be honest the method is just about dealing with 'stuff'. Time management tools like the Covey matrix are much more effective.The general notion of having a clear folder structure for stuff and being ruthless with things like email 'do it / defer it / forward it' is pretty much common sense. Some of these messages may be useful for persons who really are lost but the book is of little use to anyone in the modern world who has thought for more than five minutes as to how they receive and process their inputs.There is much about his coaching of others in here yet Allen is anything but a coach - the method is prescriptive and isn't that effective.Yes, we need to determine what we are doing and what's important. I like the idea of 'next actions' but really most of this model could be a pdf of two pages and I feel I have wasted quite a lot of time reading this book."

On the other, if you ever feel like you don't have enough time in the day, you'll want to remind yourself of those things by reading Allen's book.I have trouble remembering things unless I write them down, so when I stumbled upon the Getting Things Done system, it complemented my weaknesses perfectly. I knew everything about Allen's system before I picked up the book, but the book makes everything clearer with concrete examples and a lot of details.I'm not a self-help book guy, but I actually enjoyed this book a lot. I was excited to read it when I got it from the library, because I'd tried to implement the system without much success. It doesn't read like a self-help book most of the time, either. Allen has terms for all the concepts he talks about, but I never felt like I had to use those terms to explain it someone else, which is a credit to Allen as a teacher. You really come away understanding the details and subtleties of why freeing up your mind really works.You get some Zen undercurrents with this, and sometimes his system seems very mechanical, but it's exciting to implement and feels completely natural after you've done it for a while. The quotes in the sidebar are kind of annoying, and the last third of the book is much less useful than the first two. But there are a lot of concrete details on organizational tips and how to use your time most efficiently. I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels like there just isn't enough time in the day, because there can be."

While previous books on the subject often do little more than reinforce your need to organize and improve efficiency, I found that this one did bring something different to the table. His discussion of concepts like ""outcome thinking,"" ""mind like water"" and ""open loops"" have left a strong impression on me.I liked his method to increase organization and many of the tips weren't new, but they were the kind that can be repeated ad infinitum without problem. I won't be incorporating all of his suggestions but I have definitely tried to incorporate most of them. It inspired me to tackle my ""to do list"" which I can see based on his way of teaching, is a bad way to organize your ""to dos."" I've completely revolutionized that list from one big rambling never ending anxiety producer to manageable categorized lists that put things into a better perspective. I am trying hardest to learn that ""the calendar is sacred"" and not to put my entire to do list on it, but instead think critically about my time and only put on there what I know without a shadow of a doubt I can accomplish in that day. It's a hard lesson to learn! I want to write everything down, but then I can't possibly do it all, so I get overwhelmed and do nothing. If you follow his ""calendar is sacred"" rule and only put what you are capable of, then you actually do it and then feel less stressed at the end of the day. This book is definitely for anyone who wants to increase their productivity or for anyone who just needs a refresher on how to organize their workflow and life."

I thought it was the best book ever.In order to combat my overly enthusiastic response to the book, I waited to write my review, knowing that my initial infatuation with the book would fade with time and I would write a more rational, less emotional review when the next book on my reading list moved up to the ""best book ever"" ranking.However, a month later, I'm still a big fan of this book and still feel that it may be (at least one of) the best books ever on execution and getting things done. It’s clear, concise, and practical. There is valuable information for anyone, regardless of their current level of organization. David Allen provides a number of great ""tricks"" that help to rid your mind of all the thought clutter. The key is letting your brain know that you have a reliable system that you check regularly. With such a system, your brain doesn't feel the pressure to remember everything (what you need from the store, that you need to follow up with a client, that your son has a soccer game at six) and is free to relax and be more creative… leading to less stress.I liked it. I'm using many of the practical applications Allen introduced. I'll likely read it again... although I can't promise that I'll still feel it's the best book ever."

There are some that even have lauded me as the most organized person that they know. I alphabetize my spice rack for goodness sakes (a fact that once made me the butt of many jokes at a women's networking event). I even employ some of the techniques that Allen suggests, but while reading this book, I felt disheartened that I would never engage in, as the book's title suggests, ""stress-free productivity.""Allen does provide several helpful suggestions, but he left me hanging on some fundamental issues, such as do I use my blackberry as my storage device or do I employ a hard calendar (I actually use both). I also could have used some more real-life examples of how to categorize activities that strain brain power. My suggestion is to read this book with an open mind, take what suggestions you can that are feasible, and that will not make you go crazy if you do not implement them, and recognize that for organizing your life there is no one size fits all methodology.

Right now, almost everyone has a PDA in their pocket, although we call them ""smartphones"" instead of PDAs; there are references to ""common"" binders and rolodexes and that kind of furniture that, in today's world, is a pretty rare thing and most of the stuff we deal each day is digital.There are some topics which are largely just propaganda for the method itself instead of going straight into it to give people an general idea of how things work and then going deeper (he does it later, but the very start is boring as hell).Also, some final topics are mostly ""One of my clients said she couldn't understand how she lived till this day doing things not GTD"" or ""I do this 'cause I like it"", which although good to know, it's not representative of the method itself.So while GTD is a pretty damn good method to keep things organized, the book that describes this is not well written, IMHO.Get it for the methodology, and be ready to skip a lot of useless stuff."

As I listened through the audiobook I was pleased to find out that several of the things Mr. Allen talks about I have already incorporated into my system. I also learned and practiced over the course of this book getting EVERYTHING into the inbox. It was amazing what came out of that including personal conversations I need to have. There was so much more good I could go on for several paragraphs. Idea of checklists and organization for reference makes so much sense.But the negative parts pulled at me as much as the positive. I found his system very archaic and extremely burdensome. I have very little use for file folders in my life and I eliminated my brief case long ago. He references a few places need for paper processing referencing passports, birth certificates, etc as reason the need. I have permanent homes for such items and when they are not in use they reside there. I don't need to put into an inbox to file I just file.Another thing that pulled at me in a negative way is that he condones and is a self admitted ""Pack Rat"". Reference material is important but just keep it ""just in case"" is really against my grain. To his credit he discussed purging unneeded and indexing what you keep, but he has no problem adding file cabinets or digital storage as your library grows. All in all this a good book, but maybe this system is not THE SYSTEM for everyone. "
239,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31698147-jon-jones,5,"I read this book in order to help me to get shit done. This book has been on my reading list for many a year and I've always resisted reading it. The concept of reading a book in order to be more productive, instead of actually doing the work always seemed counter-intuitive. Looking back this was a stupid idea and I now wish I had read this book sooner. As an owner of several businesses, I thought this book could help me learn to manage my business better. Good Points:One of the main unexpected takeaways from the book was the realization of how much unconscious mental clutter I have. A lot of anxiety and late-night rumination is caused by trying to mentally remember a ton of stuff. The act of writing everything down in one location can improve my mindset. By having a good system I could stop thinking about businesses so much after 9-5.Another big-win of the book is to always think in terms of what's the next action. Instead of having a list of random todo items. Be more specific and write the next step. I tend to have lots of tasks I deffer as I can't decide what course of action to take. This ends up in a big pile of outstanding things. Forcing yourself to decide the next action prevents these situations form occuring.Grouping your to-do lists by context was also something I never thought of. Having an at home list, an at worklist, an on phone list,an on tube list makes life easier by reducing the amount of thinking you need to do later on."
240,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1003057-myridian,3,"I felt like this book was more about Allen trying to market the system to you than it was about teaching you the system itself. For me, the very fact that I bought the book indicated that I want to try the system, therefore all the testimonials and the rationals behind the instructions were just fluff I felt I had to get through. I would have been happier had the book read a little more like stereo instructions for putting together the organizational system. Additionally, one thought I had was that given the time Allen recommends someone put into establishing the organizational system, 10 to 16 hours, the participant is going to be really invested in making sure it works for them after that, so it's not that surprising that he gets positive feedback re the system. I have set it up myself though and I do like it so far, though I'm not sure I'm that much more productive because of it. Acutally scheduling time in my calendar to do tasks may turn out to be a better system for me, but I'm going to continue with my trial of the pure GTD system, and I do want to set it up for my SO. Here are a couple of the good things I learned from the books though:Four criteria model for choosing actions in the moment1.  Context2.  Time available3.  Energy available4.  PriorityNatural planning model1.  Defining purpose and principles2.  Outcome visualizing 3.  Brainstorming4.  Organizing5.  Identifying next action "
241,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2964944-jonathan,4,"I started this a number of times - always with the hope of finally getting organized. This time I got it Done! Really part of the issue is one's desire for control. ""I want to be FREE! Not a slave to a system!"" But this system provides freedom. I know that as I implement the dreaded system and actually follow the recomendations for daily and weekly review, I feel more comforable that all the crap in my head has been captured, organized and is in process. Ah, THAT is freedom.Now onward and upward. Continue the implementation, ONE-DAY-AT-A-TIME. If I fall off, get back on track. To be truthful, my ""inbox"" still has stuff in it from weeks ago, but I know that as I go down the stack, I can actually deal with all the current stuff and some of the old stuff. I feel I am gaining control. My electronic inbox is down from 4,500 entries to under 1,000! Still unreal for many people but ""progress, not perfection"" is my motto. By the end of the week it should be only current items (and less than 30 at that)!My daily ""ToDo"" list (ncluding My Master Control - project next steps)is now only 1 page, and that gets completed with daily! My WIP (Work In Process or Project) files are all on my credenza, easily accessible. My notepad is next to the phone, with a pen on it. My Tickler Files are in my desk drawer (reviewed daily - still Painful!)The bottom line is that this is a good (possibly great) system, IF IT IS USED AND TRUSTED. That takes time."

Well, it was written for me! I've always been a list maker, but it was always in an effort to clear my mind (that gets so bogged down with things to do that just bounce around distracting and worrying me instead of me actually GETTING THINGS DONE) and then I wouldn't actually USE the list- and it helped but only a little. Now I see what I've been missing, this takes it the next step. Make a REAL LIST, empty your piles and your brain. USE the list. Keep it UPDATED. File or trash the rest. And I LIKE detailed instructions. The examples are exactly what I needed. Sounds like there's a million sites that discuss GTD, but this it THE SOURCE, so uh yeah, it's gonna be detailed. I'd be mad if I bought a book dedicated to an organizing system that didn't give DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS. If you want a summary, then skim it or look online. And if it doesn't work for you, that's okay, because thankfully we're all different. But man oh man, this was just what I needed and I will be sharing it with my dad, who I blame all my dis-organized brain problems on.If you're unsure- give it a quick skim. The flow chart alone will tell you the heart of it all. Then you can decide whether to read the 259 pages of it.I, personally, thank GOD for the man that wrote this book and the random reference that led me to look it up then read it."
243,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11352701-john,4,"I received this book as a gift from my brother, who gave it to me after I made a career change that thrust me from a highly-regimented workday into a very free-form workday where I could schedule a lot of my own time. I've picked up a lot of Allen's tips from my older brother already (he has implemented most aspects of GTD into his life to an admirable degree), and from other habit-forming and scheduling systems that I've come across over the years. However, Allen does a good job of including something for everyone in this book, whether you are totally overwhelmed with life and don't know how you got there, or if you have things under control but want to get even better at it.I am wholeheartedly in agreement with Allen's thesis: that creating a system of scheduling that works for you is critical to enjoying life. Schedule your appointments, file what's important, throw what's not out...and in the process, free your brain to concentrate on what's truly important to you. The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is that Allen suffers from a kind of nostalgia about the past. There is a constant thread going in the book about how difficult modern life is, when in fact the ancients and the medievals were complaining about the exact same things, and figured out their own great schedules to combat the feeling of being overwhelmed. I wish he would have plumbed the depths of that wisdom as well."

The result: an overwhelming collection of paper notes and digital lists in places I intend to look but often forget.Thanks to David Allen for letting me know I've done something right. ""Writing it down"" is Step 1 -- that action gets each task out of your head and should reduce one's ""what if I forget"" anxiety. Thanks, too, for explaining why, with all the effort I've made to ""write it down,"" the feeling of overwhelm hasn't gone away,Allen has a method for turning good intentions into finished projects--and it all starts with writing it down. But with an understanding that everything written down falls within 3 levels of priority and has follow-up actions necessary for completion, nothing can fall through the cracks. And everything gets completed.I'm just getting started with the system. It's easy to understand, simple to implement--just has to become a habit. It's also pure logic--why didn't I think of it!?This is a book I'd have benefited from years ago. Instead, I'm glad to start benefitting from Allen's uber-organized mind today!"

Finally getting around to reading it did help push me toward organizing some of my to do lists (I use Google Keep for my lists) into better categories: ""things to do around the house"", ""things to do at a computer"", ""things to consider buying"", etc. and pushed me toward actually looking at them sometimes (usually not til after I've done several of the things, but then I can check them off and be reminded of other stuff I'd thought of before). It also made me realize that when I set reminders for myself to do things at specific times when it's not actually important for the thing to happen at that time, I'm setting myself up for failure when the notifications actually are time sensitive: I've trained myself not to take the reminder notifications seriously. Unfortunately I don't yet have a habit of sitting down and looking through my to dos regularly, so I still sometimes set the reminders, and then try to either do it when I see it, or re-set the reminder for a later time when I think I'm more likely to actually be able to do it.I've also started doing a better job of identifying and writing down next steps vs. final goals (i.e writing more specific things like ""ask person Y about Z to advance project X"" rather than ""finish project X"")."

It worked, but I have to say that the book could have been half as long. He gave an overview, and then explained the system ""in detail"" in the next half. Frankly, I got it in the first half and picked up very little additional in the 2nd section. Since I have the program on my Mac, I don't need as many paper files and folders, etc, and I can't handle the thought of spending two (or more!) entire days gathering every teeny tiny thing that could go into my inbox and putting it in there all at once- WAY too daunting to me! Since my laptop goes everywhere I do, I am adding things to the ""Inbox"" in the ""Things"" program as I go along. I figure eventually, everything that matters will end up there by default at some point doing it this way. I do like the just-do-it-if-it-will-take-less-than-two-minutes guideline, as well considering something that will take more than one step a ""project"" so I don't forget to complete all of the to-dos for that item. The ""tickler"" file was a new one for me, and I can see how that would be very handy. Overall, a useful and handy way of doing things."

Reading this book has definitely helped optimize my workflow and planning into something quite a bit more efficient. Right now I'm still looking to overhaul my tooling, OneNote isn't available on UNIX-like system (though it mostly works with wine), and Emacs ORG mode isn't practical for pasting images, screenshots, video, audio, files, etc. and such for reference.It's tried a bunch of Java tools (Thinking Rock and GTD Free) but they're not very good for reference, note taking and reminders / calendar stuff. So far it's proving hard to beat the OneNote + Outlook + Project combo.One tool I've been using for a while now (probably an year or so) is Tracks. http://getontracks.org/ . It's a RoR webapp that covers most things in the GTD workflow. Although import/export isn't yet available as of version 2.0, it gets the job done.

I set it up differently in each place to reflect the differences in my environment/personal taste/valuations of some methods vs others. At home I'm primarily folder & paper-based, and at work I'm almost 100% digital (using one-note). Both are super-functional.Now I know exactly where all the papers/notes/letters/ideas/STUFF is, what I plan to do with it, and what the first action I have to take is to get projects moving (well, almost - I still have project management on my next actions list). All the actions I'm committed to doing are on a list on a single sheet of paper (I have small writing), in groups like 'on the phone', 'at computer', 'errands', 'agendas with specific people', 'at work' so that when the moment is right I can start hacking them off the lists wholesale.It's empowering, even without a label-maker!"
249,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12832115-greg,5,"The name of the author David Allen is almost synonymous with his book Getting Things Done, at least in my opinion. After several years since its original publication, Getting Things Done now has its revised edition published this year 2015. The new edition has full of wisdom and more relevant to the world where there is an ubiquity of smartphones and other gadgets.I would say that this book stood the test of time mainly because the lessons given here are timeless. Yes, they are timeless. The main idea of the book of clearing your mind by having the facility to capture all your ""stuff"" supports every notion of being productive. Clearing ones mind of all the things needed or nice things to do gives anyone the focus required to getting things done.If you haven't read the original edition just like me I strongly suggest for you to get a copy of the newest edition. Not only that it is more relevant, it has more explanation as to how the Getting Things Done process was used and the reaction of some people to it.This is one of the books that I will continue to use. Reading the principles of GTD is not enough. I have to use this process in getting things done in my life. "

There weren't revolutionary ideas or techniques, but more of a detailed manual for organizing your thought process, making decisions and taking action. I found there were parts of the process I already do naturally, but it made me realized that I could do my natural thought process in an organized way that would help me become more productive and organized.I was recommended this book and I wasn't really convince by the author's process at the beginning. I wish there was more science (surveys, studies, whatever) behind the author's belief in the process that he laid out. I wish he really proved his process was beneficial with statistics. Something more convincing then opinions. I do think this book can help people who are completely overwhelmed. There are time in life when going back to the basics is what you need to do to get the job done well and that is what I got from this book. Maybe after another reading, I will get something else from the book. "

Getting Things Done, or GTD, is based on Allen's concept of natural planning and follows some very practical strategies.1) Free up as much ""psychic RAM"" as possible by regularly dumping information into a trusted system for later recall. Write out the ideas and set them into the ""In"" basket. 2) Organize the information into logical categories, projects, contexts.3) Get the ""In"" basket to zero by working on each piece of information. ""If it can be done in under two minutes, do it. Otherwise, file it in the right place and schedule a time to work on it. 3) Always identify the next action step4) Review all open loops or the master project list at least one time each week. I've not captured the entire philosophy here, just a few of the big ideas. Bottom line: this is working wonders for me even though I fall off the wagon and have to climb back on about every month. Each time I reengage, I'm able to see farther and farther out ahead."

I seem to be on a streak of reading books by crackpots: ([return][return]I can see where this highly organized system for running your life might cause problems with someone who was already OCD. But still I'm a bit miffed I wasn't given something like this in my high school senior Study Skills class.[return][return]David Allen's system covers the nuts & bolts that Steven Covey left out of the 'Highly Effective Habits'. This is a curious mix of Zen and Taylorism. [return][return]Is this the answer to adrenal burnout? I plan to incrementally try a few things from this book. When I'm too the point that I can efficiently get the icky jobs over with ASAP I'm hoping that will leave me time to dawdle over the tasks I love to do.[return][return]No where did he say to be sure to put 'downtime' in your schedule.

Heard of this a long time ago, and don't know why I didn't get to it sooner, but glad I finally did. Very few things in here that I'd consider ""shocking"" or ""revolutionary"", but a solid set of basic strategies for organization and idea/project management, which when implemented properly, come together beautifully. Beginning to apply them myself, and seeing some great results, with much honing and work eagerly ahead of me. Most fundamental of the tips is to write down any lingering actions/tasks/projects/ideas, and record the next action step. So don't just write ""gardening"", but also write ""buy pots"" or ""look at species of flowers to plant"". Writing everything down frees your mind to explore more ideas and not have to worry about remembering/forgetting, and knowing the next action step removes the mental friction from getting started.

If I had to boil down the whole book into two main points, this would be it –1.	Make lists of everything that you need to remember, everything that is occupying your mind.2.	Then set reminders to yourself to do those things. I’m a big time list maker so I loved this concept immediately. But I did not have a phone with apps then so my lists were on paper and I quickly found myself with lists on scraps of paper everywhere. That ended up not being very practical. THEN I got a smart phone and discovered the app Remember the Milk. It is PERFECT for GTD !!! Now RTM and GTD are humming along happily on my phone like a well-oiled machine  This is not just a book that I like. It’s pretty much something I live every day. If you think reading a whole book on something as common sense as making lists and setting reminders is too much, I’d say check out the GTD blogs online or the GTD videos on You Tube! Those are good too. "

I'm giving it three stars because I've gleaned a few useful tricks from it that I might be using in the future but basically, the contents of the whole book could be summarized in a 500-word blog entry and most of it was the basic common-sense advice my mother had shared with me when I was 6 years old.I'm only saying this to point out that all GTD has to offer is basic organizational advice - useful but definitely not solving the actual problem of time management. It's really not worth the money I paid for my copy.One book I'd seriously recommend to everyone who's serious about time management is Mark Forster's Do It Tomorrow. I've been using it for the last 5 years and it works like a flippin' dream. I've no idea where I'd be without it now - probably snowed under a mountain of projects and backlogs (and a year's worth of unanswered emails flagged as Urgent).

They could easily be condensed into a list of cute little information nuggets, but instead it becomes a repetitive, bloated book.If this method were a bulleted list and not a book, I'd be cool with it. I have a system for noting tasks that's similar to what's mentioned in the book, so part of the book didn't apply to me because I already get things done, okay. But it did offer additional lessons, like:- immediately do any task you're given if it will take two minutes or less (which Aneesa told me about a couple of years ago and I've lived by it since then)- make note of anything remotely actionable instead of trying to just remember it- ensure that your to-do list consists of first steps rather than vague projects so that you're more likely to get the ball rolling (like ""Gather receipts from conference"" instead of ""Do expense report"")And I would like to ensure that I consistently do these things, as I do believe they'll lead to more productivity and so forth.

Part 1 : This is a good warm up and the best part of the book. The techniques here are timeless and resonated with the situations I have faced in recent past. I loved it. The side quotes are excellent too. In fact, worth the price of the book too and one star is for the Part 1 and one for the quotes.Part 2: This part is like if this was from some other era. Really dated with Out Bins and Incoming Bins? Maybe it worked then but cant see workspace organized like this. This is the largest part of the book too and really just very very boring. I labored to finish the Part 2. Avoidable and you won't miss a thing. Organize well, clean frequently and think about your jobs - well there is more detail but that's about it. Part 3: Well, this part goes into some kind of a Zen mode and there isn't a thing I would note or take down from here.

Allan has about 5 good ideas, but these could easily be summed up in a third of space, and so it is easy to put this book down and forget it. The first third is a long-winded description of why you should use his methods. Most readers should just browse through. The second third is the meat of the book, in which Allan lays out how to change your life habits in order to be more productive. It is here where Allan succeeds; if you can truly change your ways, these methods can be life altering. The last third is devoted to another drawn out discussion about life goals and keeping up with your habits.I break this book out each Friday for my weekly review. I am a true convert, but I feel Allan could have done a lot better if he distilled his methods down so that more people could relate to them and not get caught up in Allan's need to explain himself."

I'm not completely organized, but the GTD methodology at least makes me feel like I can be as organized as I want to be, especially when paired with the online resources that have built around the concept.The book itself is not beautifully written, but the ideas in it are clear and the examples given of how GTD can be employed are invaluable.Because of when the book was written (pre-2001), it's missing a lot of the tech things we now take for granted (iphones, Gmail, Wi-Fi, cheap storage) that can take GTD to the next level for those of us who are always-connected. Would definitely recommend checking out Merlin Mann's 43Folders Web site and lifehacker.com for supplemental info on GTD. I'm now reading David's follow-up, ""Making It All Work,"" which he said in an interview I did will address many of the reasons why some of us fall off the GTD wagon."

I highly recommend this book to anyone who is feeling like they overwhelmed with paperwork, communications, taskwork, or any combination. I especially recommend this book to people who think they are organized (using a calendar, planner, lists, etc); and yet still feel like they never getting anything accomplished - this book is very useful on zeroing in on why that may be happening. Its sort of an odd book to read, because on one hand, you spend alot of time going ""well, DUH, that is just all common sense!"" but at the same time, it ends up being all common sense that you are probably not doing, and if you start, makes a big difference your productivity levels.

With so much travel throughout the year I found that I could often get overwhelmed with work building up out of control to welcome me back from any trip.

It is only that I have a deadline for getting the whole book read that has pushed me to keep reading.

In particular, Allen's emphasis on freeing the mind from the nagging sense that things are unresolved rings true. The recommendation to collect ALL mental commitments (even personal ones) seems like a sentence to endlessly file away ideas. As he demonstrates, however, the work of collecting thoughts becomes easier and faster with a system and practice. The benefit is a mind free of constant anxiety about things that need completing.I won't be adopting the specific methodology recommended (file cabinets, folders, etc.), but I will be integrating Allen's framework. The structure of collecting, processing, organizing, review, and doing will give me a process that will eliminate a lot of distractedness and anxiety. "

I like the fact that this book doesn’t just focus on the how, but also the why. The whole idea of unconscious pressure on one’s psyche is something that before I read this would have thought was a bunch of B.S. After reading everything the author has to say about it, I can see that it does make sense. I know that I have so many ‘open loops’. I know that because of the unfinished things I have in my psyche there must be a great deal of pressure that I feel on a daily basis. It actually explains a lot. I know that once I can get these things off my mind and into a system to get them completed, some of that pressure will be relieved. Like anything else with me, the problem is starting."

There are the well known things like open-loops causing constant, low level anxiety. But I found the sections on procrastination and guilt particularly enlightening.Read:* December 28, 2010* April 13, 1014 - April 13, 2014"

If you are an executive with staff this is also a good system for helping you stay on top and enabling you to ""inspect what you expect"" in a timely manner.If you're a procrastinator that doesn't know where to begin to dig out of the mountain you're under, or worker-bee/stay at home parent then check out flylady.com as her mantra of 'you can't organize clutter you have to get rid of it' and 'you can do anything for 15 minutes' is going to help you a heck of a lot more than Mr. Allen's flowcharts and projects with subprojects. Though there are basic similarities with her control journals and his 43 folders system, because at the heart of it all you do need to have a way to organize information that will be needed later."

It took much longer than I thought and required quite some discipline... but not the kind of disciple that urges you to procrastinate :PIt's not a book of shortcuts, I must say... and it is not a one time activity...Lots of things mentioned are common sense and some of which I've been already applying, but it was interesting to add a little tweak to my organizing and archiving system...The idea of this book is really simple: empty your head, declutter your stuff, and decide on the next action to get things done. This book might not be for everyone... specially those who are not ""list-making"" type of people :PIt was a bit wordy... I think that many sections could have been made shorter with less repetition... but that didn't bother me much... "

Then life happened and I needed to bring some sort of structure to it. GTD is a set of really nice principles, if one can follow them. And as other reviewers say, this can be condensed into an article. Can, but should? One of the good things about reading a book instead of an article that (a good) book is usually choke full of cases which hold some proof of the teachings, and readers may be able to relate to some of these. Like I did. And yeah, there were some repetitions, and I skipped some of the chapters but overall it's a good book.Although this is supposed to be updated for the digital age, I found it lacking in that respect. But I guess driven people should be able to work around it. "

I read it and re-read it years ago and have been using his inbox processing system ever since, along with bits and pieces of the rest. It could be boiled down to a few pages, really, once you've read it, but it's still worth the reading.A few random points I took away from this re-reading:Get it off your mind and into a list.You can't get everything done. Nope. Can't do it.One task at a time.Decide on the next action for each of your projects and put it on one of your action lists.This time through, I'm transitioning out of all my technology tools and apps and going back to paper (a Circa junior notebook with calendar, lists, projects section, and a pouch for loose post-its).

I put emphasis now on the things I could improve:- Processing means —> define next **physical specific action**- Organize well your tasks- Have a list of open projects (loosely defined as anything that requires 2 or more actions)- Be consistent with the weekly reviews- Fully list all open loops for peace of mind- Define specific & measurable outcome. The end vision produces clarity and motivationI’m still struggling with finding the right tool for me. Before I was using Evernote to manage all my tasks. I believe now it’s not up for the job.

The most significant one I have read until this one is the classic by Julie Morgenstern; however, it is principally a look at over arching principles regarding time management. As I face a completely new and demanding challenge in my professional career, I decided to take a two week period and research time management skills and principles by the authors who books are the best sellers in the field. In fact, I am going to read five, this was the first. However, a little complex, David Allen gives great practical systematic ideas. I have always possessed good time management skills BUT have always had problems facing projects that need to be broken down into smaller steps. His book is much much richer than what I am saying here, but it is worth the read, trust me! The best I have read ever thus far."

It’s a book that I see anyone benefiting from its great productivity system👍🏻📖"
273,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/607453-russell,4,"I liked the idea of this system a lot and was able to incorporate the most important part of it into my life.The focus is on simplicity and immediacy. If you have a project that can be completed in under 2 minutes, do it immediately (this is the part I actually do).He also suggests writing all your tasks on 3 X 5 cards. That way you just carry around a stack of cards instead of writing a new list each day when you don't accomplish all of yesterday's tasks. (I do this sometimes. I'm the nut in the Daley center throwing 3 X 5 cards in the garbage all day)He suggests just carrying around a file with a file for each of the next 30 days and one for each coming month. Each file should have 3 X 5 cards or documents you'll need at that date. (I wish I did this)."
274,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay,4,"So I was in a business meeting three years ago and was writing down notes on 3x5 cards. The customer I was interviewing commented on the cards, saying I suppose you are also into ""Getting Things Done"". And I pulled my unread copy of the book out of my bag. I carried that book with me for a few years but didn't get the mojo to finish it until recently. I'm glad I did. With a recent change of job and email application, I wanted to start on the right track, with as close to Inbox Zero as I could get. The strategies to catalog and process the things I have to do for work and home have helped me keep near there. I would recommend some of the additional documents that Allen offers on his website, as well as some of the free podcasts that give some different perspectives on organizing your time."

I spent two hours on a Monday morning getting my email inbox to empty after being gone on vacation for a week. Seeing that big white empty screen made me feel as if a large weight had been taken off my shoulders. I am now attacking the amorphous blob piles on my desk eagerly searching for the next action to identify and have greatly increased clarity on what to do in those moments between larger projects. I am a procrastinator by nature and this book has me excited about going to full implementation of GTD in every aspect of my life. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who could use some perspective in their lives."
276,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20454189-al-maki,3,"Most techniques for task management that I'm familiar with are oriented toward a goal or a project, i.e. creating stuff. Allen's approach is different. He is dealing with the problem of how to organize all the stuff that comes at you. So his technique is about how to deal with incoming stuff quickly and efficiently so it will be dealt with effectively if and when necessary but it won't preoccupy you.What impresses me about him is that his method is simple and comprehensive, efficient and effective. That's hard to do.What I don't like is his examples are oriented toward the usual American worship of success. It's full of examples of planning mergers and taking Fiona to ballet lessons."
277,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42159900-shea-fisher,5,"David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) is THE go-to toolbox for managing the complexity of life in the Information Age and knowledge economy. I've yet to instill every dimension of it, as that would require a serious concerted effort of behavioral change and habit engineering. I do, however, use many of the techniques and strategies from the book as I need them. What I have always found most useful is to ""get everything out of your head."" Sometimes you just need to do a brain dump and get it all on paper. Everything from the cat food that you need to pick up to your biggest life goals. Put it down. Get it out of your memory and you'll feel a huge sense of relief. There's far more than just that in GTD, though. Highly recommended. "
278,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4632177-brad-mills,4,"A short book. Kind of boring. This is my second pass. It was super helpful the first time I read it in 2009, and a good refresher the second time.Hard to pay attention, but the author is aware of this and in fact called me on my bullshit as I was daydreaming of projects in the middle of a chapter...it was creepy.Just replace ever time he talks about an inbox on your desk and a filing system with Evernote and it will still be relevant.One of the biggest nuggets was the section near the end about visualization - he has us go through an exercise where we visualize eating a lemon and my mouth started watering. It drive home the point that visualization affects your brain, so being clean and tidy and visualizing finishing tasks will have a positive effect on your productivity and midset."

My husband, who has had to go through these books and even gone to seminars, had the right synopsis of all these sorts of things: ""Write shit down and try to remember it."" That's what it boils down to. There were some good takeaways from this book I might try, though finding the time for it, especially at work, is not realistic. Don' even know if I'll be willing to put in all this time for my organizing at home. Two days? Really?

281,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76596539-kristoffer-sand-n,4,"3.75/5Allen provides his life management philosophy in this updated version of his classic book. His ""revolutionizing"" strategies are in my opinion a bit overhyped, but looking from a more abstract perspective, he communicates a wise tone of how to manage your life. Thereto, several points and specific tactics are gold, such as his renowned 2-minute rule.While some fans are probably benefiting lots from using Allan's ideas and I'm also sure there is something for most people to take away here. Conversely, others will find most of it to be common sense. In either case, reading the whole book is less necessary and to use one of Allan's own approaches as an argument against himself, his book could easily be scribbled down on a napkin. "

Until I read this book. Surprisingly, the idea that unclear tasks and ill-defined ideas clutter your mind and ultimately clog it up with stress, had not occurred to me. It's such a simple and profound realization (one of those that make you feel like a proper idiot). While I've only just begun to implement the principles and processes in this book I can already feel the benefits of a workflow where you unload everything from your head into a trustworthy external system. A must-read for anyone struggling with productivity and stress (who isn't already familiar with the concept)."

This was a good time to re-read anything about organization, but this guy was particularly helpful. I have been able to put some of his advice into practice and get a lot more done. I did not take 2 days to collect all my stuff to do. But in moving to my new office, I tried to jettison what I will not need again (or can easily find electronically). I like his ""what's the next step"" practice for keeping projects moving. And for going through incoming (especially email), I'm using the 2-minute rule. So far, so much better."

285,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/667292-espen,4,"I normally don't like self-help books, but this one is low-key, immensely practical, and not tied to paying the author money or hiring him as a personal consultant (though the option is available). I have tried to implement some of his thoughts, using Evernote, and it is sort of working, at least when I force myself to be a little bit disciplined. I like the way David Allen leaves options open for individual variations - and his almost complete lack of self-promotion (for instance, he says that quite a few of his customers have become successful leaders, but attributes it more to their organizing and self-discipline skills than to his method, which he regards as a technology."
286,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312898-ben,3,"I really, really got excited in the first chapter, where he explained his philosophy, but in the rest of the book, I didn't like his methods; they seemed clunky and over-complicated. I think I have him beat with my own simple, stream-lined system, especially if I can be more consistent in using it. But the main take-away point for me was this insight: Don't have things on your mind. Whenever you have something on your mind, either act on it to completion or put it into your planning/organization system for future action, because it is in your mind's supposed idle time, times of quiet and clarity that strokes of genius will come from your supposedly idle subconscious."

Normally, I resist this type of self-help book, but while running my own business, I became overwhelmed with processing the myriad of ‘stuff’ I had to do. David Allen’s system is great for organizing all your inputs, and setting up relevant reminders. The system is exhaustive, so it’s meant to be used for all types of inputs, both professional and personal. It also forces you to spend an extra 10 seconds on each input, determining what actual action is required. So much stuff came to my attention, and unsure of what to do, I’d stack it on my desk where it’d die an ignominious death."
288,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7236889-scott,3,"Three major takeaways from this book:1. Write EVERY thought down - Record these thoughts in a place where you will be reminded in a timely way, and where you can regularly review. 2. Don't be frustrated by breaking commitments you make with yourself - just renegotiate with yourself. 3. Implementing an airtight personal organization system will help you achieve genuine relaxation, even amidst balancing a surmounting amount personal and professional responsibilities. Note: The book was written prior to the age of smartphones. Therefore, about a third of the content is simple irrelevant. Especially, his physical filing system that he so proudly recommends. "
289,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52571918-simon-akam,0,"Recommended this book by Ian Irvine - in the past have been sceptical about this sort of thing but actually found it extremely useful and am aiming to implement its principles. In essence, his argument is that if you try to get someone to steer their life from the top down - deciding overall goals, direction etc - the process tends to be overwhelming and does not stick. By contrast, if you work from the bottom up - organise their sock drawer, then their email inbox, then their filing, then their diary etc etc it builds organically and is much more sustainable. A potentially powerful philosophy I think... "
290,0142000280,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51634776-dax,5,"Core idea: If you don't have a system in place to help you keep track of what you need to do there will be a constant load on your brain keeping track of things. Even if you do have a system in place, if it isn't comprehensive you lose benefits of having one because your brain will still have a load on it trying to remember if it forgot anything.I had seen before and thought was some dumb productivity hack meme before reading. Having read and implemented can say it has drastically improved how I manage work/projects and reduced my overall stress levels. Results may vary; I had a bad system in place so any system is better than nothing. "

The biggest lesson I took from this book is that you need to break tasks down into their smallest components, then dole out one ""next action"" at a time for each project you're working on. This really does make a world of difference in preventing panic and brain freeze.Well, I say that now, but I just finished the book today. Let's see if I'm still adhering to these principles and getting things done 4 weeks from now."

That way you don't have a daily to do list that never gets done and only wastes time copying it from one day to the next. Oh, and if it can be done in 2 minutes, just do it now.
