1,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,5,"This exuberantly brilliant book never fails to remind me of one of the more obvious puzzles surrounding those who subscribe to strict creationism. You know, the people who actually believe that the Lord created the universe according to the seven-day timetable laid out in Genesis. Quite apart from the convoluted mental processes needed to accommodate such inconvenient evidence as the entire fossil record, (remember, these people would have us believe that humans and dinosaurs coexisted, Flintstone-like, in some kind of post-Genesis theme park), why would anyone choose such a parched, unimaginative view of the natural world when the reality is so much more glorious? Whether or not one believes in the existence of a divine entity at the back of it all, the fact is that the magnificent variation and huge diversity of evolutionary survival strategies that are explained by Darwin’s theory imply a universe that is infinitely more fascinating than the simplistic view of the strict creationists.Olivia Judson’s “Dr. Tatiana’s Sex Advice to All Creation” provides a comprehensive, hugely readable, account of one of evolution’s most important aspects – sexual selection. Dr. Judson has chosen a particularly delightful conceit to enlighten and entertain her readers – the book is structured as a series of letters and answers, spanning the entire natural world, to the eponymous “agony aunt” of the title, Dr. Tatiana. From the opening letter from a golden potto in the Gabon who wonders why her boyfriend’s penis is covered in enormous spines to the scandalized primate in the Ivory Coast complaining about the slutty behavior of the female chimpanzees in the neighborhood, the vignettes presented in this book are informative, wide-ranging, hilariously funny – in a single word, awesome. The book’s thirteen chapters are divided into three main sections: Part I: Let Slip the Whores of War1.	A Sketch of the Battlefield2.	The Expense is Damnable3.	Fruits of Knowledge4.	Swords or Pistols5.	How to Win Even if You’re a LoserPart II: The Evolution of Depravity6.	How to Make Love to a Cannibal7.	Crimes of Passion8.	Hell Hath no Fury9.	Aphrodisiacs, Love Potions, and Other Recipes from Cupid’s Kitchen10.	Till Death Do us PartPart III: Are Men Necessary? Usually, But Not Always11. The Fornications of Kings12. Eve’s Testicles13. Wholly VirginThis is definitely on my top 5 list of science books published within the last decade. It is funny, imaginative, informative and hugely entertaining. So much so that one is forced to break out the most repulsive of reviewer cliches - Dr Judson's accomplishment represents a true  tour de force."
2,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724491-paige,3,"2.5 stars.Sigh. This is the kind of book that I really want to like. It is jam-packed full of information about reproduction, biology, life cycles, etc. throughout all kinds of life forms (with an emphasis on insects, it seems). What's more: the references are extensive; every ""column"" has its own section in back where she cites each claim's source. I was impressed with the documentation and with the wealth of knowledge.So why only 2.5 stars? There are a couple of reasons:1. The format concept. It's written like an advice column in Cosmo or something. But the ""answers"" ramble on and on and she'll make disparate points in one ""answer,"" it doesn't seem to gel together for me. Also it's a lot of the same kind of stuff over and over, and while there was some truly fascinating things in here, I feel like I'm going to forget most of this information within a week. There was nothing to make the separate pieces of information stick in my head, with few exceptions (which had more to do with shocking reality of things--like in the spotted hyena's case--than with her writing). I've read other books and articles that deal with similar topics and the writers manage to make the information novel enough and different enough to stay in my memory.2. The tone of the book. Because it's written like a Cosmo column, the persistent ""I'm super cool and sassy"" delivery distracted me and got old pretty quickly. In this vein: she uses the word ""slut,"" wonders if rape in the animal kingdom is really the result of females ""asking for it,"" constantly uses the words ""girls"" and ""boys"" to describe mature animals engaging in reproductive sex... She anthropomorphizes a lot a lot a lot (which I don't have an issue with in itself, really, it just seems to make things more confusing in this case). She seems to think ""radical feminists"" hate men and want to destroy them. Which I found odd, since she's apparently a pretty smart scientist (degrees from Stanford, Oxford) and the vast majority of her acknowledgements go to males; you'd think she'd know better than anyone the challenges women face in the sciences. But maybe that's exactly the problem--maybe in order to make it that far she's had to ingratiate herself or something. Who knows? I don't. But I do know I didn't appreciate that aspect of it."
3,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237469-mir,4,"Judson's stylistic conceit -- various species writing to an advice column about their sex lives -- is clever and well-done, although it does get tired upon repetition. Her prose is lively and entertaining, remarkably so for what often boils down to biological studies of insects. What I really found invaluable about this book was her insistence that people look at real science rather than a few pseudo-scientific ideas that support various social standpoints. I wish I'd had this back when I lived in the Midwest and constantly had people telling me that women had to stay home with the kids because of ""biological design."" Buy this book and use it to hit people who try to tell you their bullshit bigotry is supported by scientific research."

Well then, it's a book about the sex lives of various creatures - oh let me just make it easier and give you some quotes, so you can see what sorts of questions Dr. Tatiana receives, and some of her answers. This will give you a better idea how the book is both humorous and completely weird. Not to mention hard to categorize.Pg. 176, from Chapter 11: The Fornications of Kings, in ""Part III: Are Men Necessary? Usually, But Not Always.""""Dear Dr. Tatiana,I'm a true armyworm moth, and I've gone deaf in one ear. I've read this is from having too much sex. Trouble is, I'm (sob) still a virgin. So what's happening to me?---Piqued in DarienBe assured, you have nothing to worry about. It's just that your inner ear is now hosting a torrid, incestuous orgy. ...What happened is that one evening when you stopped to sip nectar from a flower, a mite scrambled up your tongue as if it were a ladder. When she reached your face, she crawled through the tangle of your scales and hairs to the outer caverns of your ears... Then she stepped up to the delicate membrane...that screens off the inner ear from the outer ear, and she pierced it. In doing so, she destroyed forever your ability to hear with that ear.After settling and and perhaps taking a light supper of - I'm afraid - your blood, she started to lay her eggs, about eighty in all. A couple of days later, the eggs hatched... First to emerge were the males of the brood; then came all their sisters. The males grew up faster than their sisters, prepared one of the innermost galleries of your ear as a bedchamber, carried their sister brides thence...""And you now get the idea of what's going on in Piqued in Darien's ear. There are some details I cut purely for reasons of space - because the details and examples of various matings is what makes the book so fascinating.Another example, this is part of an answer to a male stickleback whose eggs were stolen. Dr Tatiana brings up the male bowerbird, which also the gender that does the nest building, and has to deal with rivals messing with their nests.:page 73, from Chapter 4: Swords or Pistols, in Part 1, Let Slip the Whores of War! ""...Because they are quite big, bowerbirds are easily able to monopolize fruit trees, scattering smaller birds out of their way. Thus, like aristocrats everywhere, most of these birds have lots of free time. And so, naturally, they have a hobby. It's art.Male bowerbirds spent weeks building and decorating elaborate ""bowers."" Depending on the species, the bower could be anything from a clearing strewn artfully with leaves to huts more than four meters (thirteen feet) wide or towers more than three meters (ten feet) high, woven out of sticks, painted with juice from crushed fruits, and decorated with flowers, mushrooms, feathers, snakeskins, snail shells, butterfly wings, beetle heads - or anything else that catches the artist's eye. One scientist nearly had his camera stolen by a bowerbird who wanted to add it to his decor; another almost lost his socks. Artistic styles differ greatly among populations - even populations of the same species - so that whereas flowers might be fashionable in one area, beetle wings will be all the rage in the next. Moreover, this is no random collection of junk: the objects are selected and placed with great care...Why do they do this? To impress girls, of course. Females come to the bowers to mate. And one way to make your bower look even better than a rival's is to resort to theft and vandalism. Yes, I'm afraid that bowerbirds are not above foul play to further their own ends. Stealing is rife. Rare or fashionable objects vanish from one bower only to appear in another. And some bowers are regularly vandalized or completely destroyed.""This example in particular so interested me that if someone had asked me (just after I'd read the page) to join an expedition to observe and take notes on bowerbirds over the next decade I would have probably signed on. (Especially if I'd managed to forget how many poisonous things are frolicking around Australia.) The book is full of such unique examples, pointing out similarities between species and theorizing as to why such behaviors and traits had helped species succeed in the big race to procreate.I do have to add that the chapter on the praying mantis' habit of eating her husband is grim yet amusing. That would be Chapter 6: How to Make Love to a Cannibal. Because it's not just the mantis that tends to do this. So this is science with a sense of humor, albeit sometimes a dark humor. There are end notes and a long bibliography should you want to find out more about any particular creature. (I'm trying not to look and find more to read about the bowerbird - I already have a huge To Read stack.) This is also a great book to pick up, read a chapter or two, and put down. I must admit that I've reread it a few times - but then I'm a bit of a zoology geek. "
5,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834216-this-is-not-the-michael-you-re-looking-for,5,"This is an excellent book about the the sexual habits of life (not just humans, but all life), examined from an evolutionary perspective. The material is whimsically presented as a collection of sex advice columns from Dr. Tatiana: think Dr. Ruth giving advice to insects and fish, reptiles and mammals. An example of a “letter” from one of her readers, early in the book:“Dear Dr. Tatiana,My boyfriend is the handsomest golden potto I ever saw. He's got beautiful golden fur on his back, creamy white fur on his belly, he smells delicious, and he has ever such dainty hands and feet. There's just one thing. Please Dr. Tatiana, why is his penis covered with enormous spines?”Most of the book is focused on animal sexual behavior, but plants and even bacteria are both also touched on. In a remarkable way, the book deanthropomorphizes sex by first anthropomorphizing it, a tricky task to be sure. The writing is humorous, ribald, and highly intelligent. A wide range of topics and behaviors are covered, including such wide ranging mysteries as complex genitalia, promiscuity in both males and females, sperm competition, asexuality, cannibalism of mates, the strange and rare situation of monogamy, hermaphroditism, homosexuality, and incest. And while most of the book is focused on non-human sexual behavior, humans are not left out, with many of the chapters applying some of the factors to human sex and reproduction.Having heard the author (Olivia Judson, a science writer/journalist with a PhD in evolutionary biology from Stanford) speak about the book a few months ago, I must admit that I also ""read"" the book in her British accent, something which may have added an extra touch of atmosphere. There is definitely a British sense of humor underlying much of the book.Highly recommended!"
6,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,3,"Non-Fiction. Dr. Tatiana is the Dr. Ruth of the animal kingdom, that much is fictional, but the advice she gives is all fact, or, at the very least, theory.This is evolutionary biology framed like a relationship column. Dr. Tatiana takes letters from the birds, the bees, and the stick insects and advises them on their difficult love lives. It's a great way to get information across and the book is structured well, one topic easily leading to another. Judson never gets too technical and covers a lot of different sexual and reproductive practices, even dipping into the plant world from time to time. The book also has an index, author's notes, and an extensive bibliography, making it a good resource to find specific information, or to find further reading on the subject. The problem comes when Judson takes the conversational tone of an advice columnist and applies it to animals; it's almost as if she forgets that her readers are still human. She makes a lot of bad word choices. She repeatedly uses the word ""slut"" and its synonyms in ways that could be considered negative. She uses ""cripple"" and ""imbecile"" and there are entire chapters on forced sexual activity (""rape"") and incest. At times, reading this was very much like being poked in the eye.I do love the way she repeatedly uses ""sexy"" to describe the myriad characteristics that animals find attractive; it's a good reminder that everyone has different things that turn them on, and overall her message seems to be one of acceptance for those of different genders, sexual practices, or lack of sexual practices, but the problematic language undermines that attitude.Three stars, would have gotten four if not for the consistently poor word choices; it took away a lot of my enjoyment of the book."
7,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2282835-naomi,4,"Well... I enjoyed this book very much and I probably would have given it five stars had I bought it myself. But the book was given to me by the author's father *unsigned* with the promise that she would autograph it the next time she visited. But it's not like I kept the book at his house and now she's living on another continent and seriously, it's not like I need to reread sex advice for bugs, so, Lady, you need to come sign this thing so that I can regift it to my virgin god daughters. Actually, just send me two new signed copies. I'm keeping mine. "

But I know the perfect solution to reduce that worry. Read Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice for All Creation.

10,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/326195-sadie,4,"This book is a really fun way to read about different reproductive strategies and behaviors in the animal world. Dr. Judson gives some strikingly funny examples in a ""Dr. Ruth"" framework, then rationally explains how the behaviors and strategies might have evolved. Unlike some other scientists writings for popular audiences, she is very good at pointing out how little we know about why or even how some of the processes work.  Most of all, though, I appreciate the way she has referenced the whole book unintrusively. A friend and I were recently berating a certain famous scientist (Jared Diamond) for writing popular books which are well written and widely read, and thus taken as gospel truths, and for which you cannot pick out specific sources - not that he didn't use them, but that it makes it hard to argue against them scientifically because you can't find the grounding of them to start with. Point aside, Olivia Judson manages to bridge the science-popular bridge by including references, not in the text, but at the end, with a nice road map for each chapter of ""if you want to know more about Gorilla strategies, here's a few good papers..."" which is a very gentle way to let people with the desire to know more, pursue it.  In all, this is a great book and I want more. I left off one star because it's not the most WOW inducing book for me, but it definitely is a great read."
11,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/379793-abigail,5,"I LOVE this book. Written in the style of an advice-columnist for all organisms big and small, Olivia Judson-- a Stanford- and Oxford-educated PhD-- makes learning biology fun and easy. This is all about evolutionary biology as it applies to sex, and this is fascinating. The variety of ways different species interact, have sex, reproduce, eat their spouses, kill their children. . . it's fabulous. It actually made me appreciate things like sea worms and mites. Mites!!"
12,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/171430-rivka,3,Good bathroom reading. Works well in small snippets.Amusing and educational; would have preferred the omission of the lectures. Just because something is normal for bugs or snails doesn't make it so for humans. And I prefer not to have thinly-disguised anti-religious screeds tacked onto otherwise enjoyable books.
13,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5946093-bill,4,"As I started to read this book, I was at first disappointed. I am a big fan of Olivia Judson's New York Times' columns and was looking forward to finally getting around to this. And it was written with her usual efficiency and humor so that was good. But...really...I didn't care about the sex lives of ""all creation"" and found myself really bored. Bummer.But I pushed on, and as I should have expected, I was quite rewarded. The book is a fascinating compendium of creatures large and small and how evolutionary forces have crafted their unique aspects. Neither too heavy or too light, it's really a near-perfect balance of comedy and science (with the emphasis on science, of course). The only thing I found myself wishing for was a bit of insight into our human species. Perhaps the next book (which is long overdue!)?This is, in my opinion, another instance where if you can read this book and still not believe in evolution, you need help. Because if God created all these creatures, well, then he is a bit crazy and I'm sure you don't want your god to be a crazy god.Most fascinating factoid to me: the figs that you may eat are filled with dead, male, wasps. Enjoy!"
14,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3717406-j-p-drury,2,"While Judson lays out some fantastic natural history, she ultimately spreads herself too thin and falls short of the synthesis she hopes to deliver. Her engagement with sexual selection theory is passe; nothing new, nothing critical.Perhaps her biggest offense is using the word ""rape"" to describe forced copulation, a mistake that has been argued against for several decades by feminist biologists. This most grave mistake is felt most deeply when she suggests that rape is an adaptive behavior, even in humans! Don't believe everything you read.She makes a lot of jumps on very data-less ground and commits the ultimate crime a scientist can make by convincing her readers that something is true that we are not in a position to assess.Although the last third of the book is a pretty fair (if not cliche) treatment of the evolution of sex, my advice to all creation is to NOT take this book as the end all be all of evolutionary biology. The story is far more interesting and mysterious than Judson would let on."
15,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5214156-sup,4,"As a science doctoral student, I received this book from a professor teaching a class on epigenetics and other non-Mendelian hereditary patterns. Generally, despite what others seem to think because of my current career path, I do not enjoy reading science-related books in my spare time-- that's what fiction is for! However, I gave this book a go and was so pleasantly surprised to realise that I not only enjoyed it, but actually really liked it. It explores many of the evolutionary aspects of sex and sexual behaviours in a variety of species (with the ultimate [mostly unstated] parallels to the usefulness & nature of sex in Homo sapiens) in a manner that is highly scientifically accurate but is also accessible to the general populace by structuring it as a ""Dear Abby"" sex advice column. Albeit some of the science cited is now outdated (the book would benefit from an updated edition!), it's definitely worth a read for anyone who has ever wondered how & why sex came about when it seems like such an inefficient reproductive strategy."
16,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30738581-carrie-borchardt,4,"Judson's quirky how-to guide to evolutionary biology which reads as a raunchy magazine advice column is a must read for anyone interested in natural selection through mating. Judson unapologetically parades the anomalous and jarring ways nature has selected to replicate itself while anthropomorphizing the specific dilemmas each species face in its brutal struggle to survive and reproduce. Thoroughly researched, wittily written and charmingly provocative, you'll find yourself empathizing with a slew of divergent beings just trying to have a little fun and leave a little legacy before their inevitable demise. If nothing else, you'll have a less prescriptive view of sexuality after reading. After all, if one enjoys postcoital cannibalism, hermaphroditic orgies, penis fencing, gang raping, gender bending, frantic promiscuity and eighty-five million year dry spells, who are we, the immature Homo Sapiens species, to judge strategies that have flourished longer than we've existed?"

It's written like an advice column in a newspaper, and each section starts out with a letter from a certain specie to Dr. Tatiana (the first one begins with Twiggy, the stick insect...""Dear Dr. Tatiana. My name's Twiggy and I'm a stick insect. It's with great embarrassment that I write to you while copulating, but my mate and I have been copulating for ten weeks already. I'm bored out of my skull, but he shows no sign of flagging. How can I get him to quit?""In the process of replying and explicating, Dr. Tatiana debunks a whole bunch of myths about the two sexes. You'll learn about species that bite off their sex partners' heads during sex, as well as the ingenuous strategies other male species employ to keep their females theirs. :-)"
18,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1350905-scurra,5,"Pop-science books are quite hard to write, because the author is often too close to their subject and tends to make assumptions about the reader. Olivia Judson side-steps this issue nicely by adopting an alternate persona of a sort of tv confessional show host as her authorial voice, and maintaining this conceit throughout the book, which is a glorious romp through the insane reproductive methods employed throughout the living world, from assexual to multisexual and all points in-between.She takes particular delight in illustrating that what we consider to be somehow unique human perversions are not only mirrored in the animal world, but sometimes made to look pretty tame by comparison.Don't expect a serious textbook on evolutionary biology - there's very little here that tries to explain why these strange circumstances came about; instead just enjoy the wild ride."

Olivia Judson is an evolutionary biologist who makes her living studying the mating behaviors of various species. She writes for both The Economist and the New York Times.For this book, she takes on the persona of Dr. Tatiana, a Dear Abbey-like sex therapist, who fields letters from all sorts of animals having troubles in the bedroom. Here's one example:Dear Dr. Tatiana,I'm a European praying mantis, and I've noticed I enjoy sex more if I bite my lovers' heads off first. . . .Do you find this too?I Like 'Em Headless in LondonShe then goes on to provide her advice to this insect, but really, she's just explaining the science and evolutionary possibilities for the very odd sexual behaviors we find in nature.I thought this was an interesting book. Probably would have been enough to just read a long article, but interesting none-the-less."
20,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2485937-alan-marchant,3,"Olivia Judson's tell-all book would rate at least 4 stars if she had stuck to her knitting. She provides plenty of fascinating details illustrating the diversity of sex in the natural world.But the presentation is diluted by her tiresome sex therapist schtick. Then there is the repetitive reliance on the empty Darwinian tautology to explain gee-whiz sexual phenomena. In many cases, she provides the necessary detail (protection for the young, eliminating competing gametes, improved energy efficiency . . .). But when she doesn't have a real explanation, Ms. Judson should just say ""I don't know"" instead of invoking Darwin.The last chapter (explaining the evolutionary headwinds faced by asexual reproduction) approaches the important topic of venereal disease. But like sex experts everywhere, she averts her gaze just when the going gets good. "
21,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,3,"Judson whirls through evolutionary biology, highlighting some of its most interesting and magical stories. Judson's conceit-- sex advice columnist for the animal (well, organism) kingdom is delightful at first but grows a little tedious as the book progresses. Her anthropomorphism is sometimes confusing-- the reader isn't clear if she's attributing desires and preferences to organisms for stylistic effect, or because they possess these things. This is most problematic in her section on rape. Her anthropomorphic blurred us compounded here by the fact that the section coverage rape is the only one in which Judson discusses humans-- explaining rape through evolutionary psychology. Why not the sections on promiscuity, child care, monogamy, cannibalism? It's a real drawback in an otherwise fascinating book."

What's up with that?"" And the good doctor will couch an answer in a theory of evolutionary biology, along with many other juicy reproductive tidbits from the animal kingdom. What's not to love? I liked the facts, but got bored with the voice and gimmick. Also, I'm a wuss - can't be bothered to read about chromosomes.Also, thanks to this book, I couldn't eat figs for a year."
23,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098143-debs,3,"Although it was entertaining, it was a bit watered down for my taste - it's primary goal seemed to be to entertain (""teehee, I'm reading about sex"") rather than make a serious study of it. I found that she sometimes jumped to conclusions that didn't have much to do with what she was saying or just randomly switched subjects.If entertainment what you're looking for, you'll like it. If you want a little more depth and want to think seriously, try ""Bonk"". It was fun, but I tend to get more out of more serious books that assume at least a basic grasp of evolutionary/genetic knowledge, so this one wasn't quite for me."
24,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18416112-david-albert,3,"The conceit of the book (advice columnist responding to letters from insects and microbes) is a bit silly and occasionally tiresome, but it doesn't get in the way too much. The style of the final 30 pages, written as an episode of a Mauri Povich style talk show, is more annoying and space consuming than the rest of the book, but the information that is slowly doled out over those 30 is none the less interesting. Overall, this book has lots of discrete, fascinating stories about sex, gender, and a tiny bit of genetics. Whether you love or hate the fictional correspondence aspect, it's still worth a read if you find the freaks in nature fascinating. "

I liked the conceit of Dr. Tatiana receiving letters from confused critters, however I thought her answers were often too long-winded and cited too many examples. By the end of each answer, I had often forgotten what the original question was and my mind would be swimming with so many different types of creatures and behavior. It is a good primer in how evolutionary biology gets expressed in so many different ways. "

32,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10957717-dhanya-narayanan,5,"It was on May 31st that a Senior Indian Judge, on the last day of his office, made an unscientific and ridiculous comment about peacocks being ‘celibate’ birds and peahens getting pregnant by drinking peacock tears. There was a lot of media outcry on this issue criticising and ridiculing the Judge, which I did not believe to be a constructive approach. Other than giving unwanted publicity to such outrageous and foolish remarks, that ruckus did not serve any purpose. Amidst all the hues and cries, some sane and sensible person wrote a post on Facebook suggesting that it was the right time to ‘re read’ the book, ‘Dr Tatiana’s Sex advice to all creation: Definitive guide to the evolutionary biology of sex’ by Olivia Judson. Even as a Medical Genetics professional, I was not aware of this marvellous book written by a trained evolutionary biologist and this created an ‘insecurity’ in me, prompting to order the book and start reading it without any further delay.For those who do not know Olivia Judson, she is an evolutionary biologist and a science writer ( Someone whom I aspire to be!) with a Phd from the University of Oxford, currently working as a research scholar in Imperial college, London. In her early career as a science writer in The Economist, she wrote an award winning article ‘Sex is war’ which served as the kickoff for what ended up as her first book, ‘Dr Tatiana’s Sex advice to all creation’, published in 2002, winning the praise of critics for being ‘witty without losing scientific temper’.Olivia Judson deserves special appreciation for the choice of her topic for study, evolution of sex, which I think is intriguing to researchers and lay persons alike. The book is written in the form of letters by different animals to a sex expert and agony aunt, Dr Tatiana, who takes times to understand their issues and gives witty answers and solutions in the light of evolutionary biology.The book has three main sections with multiple sub headings, which are themselves amusing and thought provoking. The first section is, ‘Let slip the whores of the war’ and deals with various strategies used by the animal world in the war of sex. Dr Tatiana counsels, “No matter, how good your survival skills are—you can be the champion at evading predators, or have the best nose for finding food, or be immune to every disease—it will all be for naught if you cannot find, impress, and seduce a mate.” So the eternal war and amazing strategies continue to tantalise us ! In reply to a question posed by a golden potto as to why the penis of her boy friend has enormous spines, Dr Tatiana starts her reply by , “All the better to tickle you with, my dear’ and then goes on to describe the science behind evolution of penis in animals. Her mischievous remark, “By comparison, human penis is dull, notable only for its girth”, makes it hard to suppress a giggle.In response to a letter by a peacock worrying about not being able to impress peahens, Dr Tatiana talks about the benefits of joining a ‘lek’, which means, ‘a group of males displaying together to get the attraction of females’. So peacocks are not celibate as our Judge believed but instead join a lek and unashamedly do everything to gain the attention of a peahen.Dr Tatiana believes that females are body fascists. This is the reason why males in all species have ‘ridiculously long tails’ or ‘fancy headdresses’, countering the argument posed by men in general that males in all species are more beautiful than females. It is essential and mandatory for males to be attractive and beautiful to gain the attention of naturally promiscuous females; or else their genes will go waste.The second section titled, ‘The evolution of depravity’ , deals with issues related to sexual mating faced by animals ranging from cannibals to animals and birds championing fidelity. Dr Tatiana openly discusses issues of same sex relationship and incest in animal world.The concluding section titled “Are men necessary” is the one I loved most. The book ends with a chapter , ‘Wholly virgin’, where Dr Tatiana invites Miss Philodina roseola ( bdelloid rotifer) to her TV show , ‘Under the microscope: the deviant life style show!’. What follows is an uproarious interview of the world’s ancient asexual eukaryotic organism, bdelloid rotifer, which has survived for millions of years without sex and males!In the last chapter which was informative, riotous and captivating, Dr Tatiana examines the evolution of sex and the advantages and disadvantages a species can have with or without sex. She goes on, “So, men, you’re safe for now. But if you don’t want to be abolished, let me give you some advice. Asexuality is particularly attractive to girls in species where males are lazy and never give a hand with the child care. The benefits of asexuality are greatly reduced if males help out.” I hope more individuals ruminate on the above statement and reflect on what Dr Tatiana really intends to convey. I would recommend this book to anyone who is amazed by the diversity of the world we live in and I dream of a day when this book is taught in schools and media takes effort in popularising such books instead of lamenting on somebody’s stupidity, so that our future generation would not have the misfortune of listening to unscientific and perverted theories about sex and sexuality.

34,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5603048-jeruen,4,"An edited version of this article was first published as Book Review: Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation by Olivia Judson on Blogcritics.org.It is a rare event that I pick up a non-fiction book and actually enjoy reading it. Based on my track record, non-fiction usually results in disappointment: my previous experiences were mostly based on reading memoirs where I just didn't sympathize with the authors. It thus failed to provide a temporary escape from reality, which I should say, is one of the major reasons why I read. But, this current one is an exception. It is rare in many different ways, one of them being the fact that I had to go to my university's Science and Engineering Library to borrow this one, which is a location that I rarely go to borrow books to read for fun. Another quirk is that this book isn't your regular non-fiction read: it's not a diary, not a memoir, nothing like that. Instead, this is actually a science book. But it's not your regular science book; it's a science book about sex, written in the format of an advice column.Yes folks, you've read that correctly. It is written as an advice column, like your Dear Abby snippet in the newspaper. And yes, the topic is about sex. But not just sex, I mean SEX. Sex, from banana slugs to spotted hyenas, all explained from an evolutionary perspective. And that, is perhaps one of the most captivating aspects of this book, in my opinion.This book is actually arranged in themes: from the basic, to violence in sex, to monogamy and infidelity, to homosexuality. And yes, it covers a wide variety of species, all of them writing their letters soliciting advice from the fictional Dr. Tatiana. And Dr. Tatiana answers all these sex questions in a wonderful and evolutionary manner. It definitely puts humans and human sexual behavior into perspective. See, I was definitely impressed with the evolutionary perspective that this book has taken. Sexual behavior in many different species were explained, even radical ones, like for example the annoying habit of female praying mantis to bite off the head of the male during sex. I've learned that doing so makes the males go into a violent spasm that allows the sperm to fertilize the eggs better. Thus, it is death for procreation, something that in evolutionary terms, makes perfect sense. The aspect of this book that I am amazed about the most is actually not derived from the contents of the book per se, but from the implications that this book has, with respect to current human thinking. Humans tend to think that monogamy should be the norm, that homosexuality should be outlawed, and that rape should be a crime. But by looking at the various species that are present in this planet, we can see several examples in which sex is promiscuous, that males have sex with fellow males, and that sex is a brutal and forced affair. Without condoning rape (I am still a firm believer of free will), I think that this suggests that humans and their idealized view of sex is more of a deviance than is the norm, if one considers the whole spectrum of species that are present in the world. So, have I enjoyed this book? Definitely. I recommend this to anyone who would love to learn something new. I am not an evolutionary biologist, but this book was so accessible that after reading this, I have the feeling that I have a set of new facts sitting in the back of my head, and somehow, I am glad that I have learned them. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.See my other book reviews here."
35,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,5,"From an evolutionary biology perspective, the battle of the sexes isn't just a metaphor: it's a war.Consider when male and female interests are not aligned: for many species, it's in a female's interest to mate with multiple males, in order to improve the genetic diversity of her offspring. Of course, it's in the male's interest for the female to mate only with him, so that he can fertilize all of the eggs and not have to worry about his offspring competing with their siblings. If the male has a trait that helps him in his goal, his genes will spread through the population; contrariwise, if a female evolves a countermeasure, her genes will likewise spread. It's an ongoing arms race, and a gruesome process: for example, the colony of feral sheep on Ile Longue in the Kerguelen Archipelago, which ""makes Lord of the Flies look like a teddy bear convention"". Rams will try to knock other rams off of ewes: from the male's perspective, if the female dies from the incessant battering, it's unfortunate, but not much different from the situation where another male besides him mates with her. We'll see how long the colony survives: maybe females will evolve to fight back. In fact, in many species the female kills and eats her mates, possibly as a response to just such a situation.Judson also addresses those most sexually deviant among all of creation: the true monogamists. (With the advent of DNA testing, it turns out there's even fewer of them than we thought.) A number of hypotheses have been proposed to account for this bizarre practice: there's the Danger Theory of Monogamy (in which leaving to find another mate entails a long or dangerous journey), the Pop-'Em-Out Theory of Monogamy (in which females are ready to breed again in less time than it would take to find another mate), the Sociopath Theory of Monogamy (in which individuals kill off any other members of their own sex, so there are no rivals to be had), and, of course, the Mutually Assured Destruction Theory of Monogamy (in which the female and her offspring absolutely require the male's presence to survive). Lest you think these are all pipe dreams, species exemplify each mode: the mantis shrimp Lysiosquilla sulcata, the Djungarian hamsters of Mongolia, the banded shrimp, and the hornbill, respectively.Judson closes with that timeless question, Are Men Necessary and concludes ""usually, but not always"". It's not uncommon for a species to revert from sexual to asexual reproduction, but such species usually go extinct shortly thereafter, with the glaring exception of the bdelloid rotifers, who, with more than 360 species without having reproduced sexually in the past 85 million years, seem to be doing just fine.Mammals, in fact, seem to be the only clade of animals without any known examples of asexual reproduction. For the most part, mammal sex isn't terribly interesting (only two sexes, no hermaphrodites, we don't gift one another with chemicals that protect us from predators, etc.), with the exception of the spotted hyena, which, I can only say, is truly remarkable for having survived as long as it has (more than 10% of females die the first time they give birth, and more than half of firstborn cubs are stillborn. Take that, intelligent design.)"
36,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,3,"I think I found Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation through Amazon first, and then Moby wrote about it in his journal, and then my roommate bought it based on his review, and that's how I ended up with a copy in my hands. The book is a collection of mock advice columns written from a variety of life forms to the fictional sexpert Dr. Tatiana, promising on the back cover to reveal ""when necrophilia is acceptable, how to have a virgin birth, and when to eat your lover."" The book is packed with trivia, and at the outset I was delighted: The fruit fly Drosophila bifurca produces sperm twenty times the length of its own body! Male elephants' penises turn green when they get horny! Slime molds have hundreds of sexes instead of just two! Female spotted hyenas have huge phalluses! And, I mean, all this trivia IS exciting. The problem is that the book amounts to a huge collection of loosely connected trivia, without enough depth to make much of the trivia stick. (I had to go hunting back through the book just to come up with interesting trivia to post in this paragraph.) Each ""column"" starts out with a letter from some hapless creature, to which Dr. Tatiana responds by first giving a little information about the species in question, then compares that species' sexual peculiarities to those of one or two other species, and then wraps up the column by responding directly to the letter's original question. Since each chapter contains a number of columns, it's easy to see how quickly the trivia piles up, and how little attention she ends up giving to any particular species.For reasons unknown to me, the final chapter of the book does away with the established format and instead acts as a transcription of an episode of the fictional TV show Under The Microscope, which is hosted, of course, by Dr. Tatiana. The cheese factor, which is a little embarrassingly high to begin with in the book, skyrockets in this chapter, but for once we see an entire chapter dedicated to a particular species (in this case, the bdelloid rotifer). This is the only chapter that really left me feeling like I'd learned something, rather than just picked up some interesting trivia to show off at dinner parties. If you can put up with some cheesy phrasings and the author's unfortunate penchant for writing horrible sex poetry (""When it comes to the topic of gender/Mother Nature's been having some fun/Take nothing for granted! Remember/You won't find any rules - not a one!""), Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation is a great way to pick up some trivia and amuse yourself with the diversity of sexual behaviors in the world. Just don't expect to learn much about any particular species represented in the book - it's all breadth and no depth, a fun read but ultimately not very lasting."
37,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/981514-minli,4,"An evolutionary biologist adopts the role of a sex advice columnist, answering questions from all sorts of species, from mammals to birds to insects to bacteria. (Though be warned, heavy on the insects.)Most of the funny comes from anthropomorphizing the writers of these letters--after all, there's something pretty freaking hilarious about a green spoon worm inhaling her husband. Judson does a great job ""debunking"" certain ideas, especially ideas of gender, with her thorough research and wry wit. So you thought males were the less faithful sex? Not always. And just what biological basis exists for monogamy? By far, the most interesting chapter was the discussion of homosexuality--how can it be genetic if homosexuals do not reproduce? The letters and responses are grouped together by theme, to tidy organization and flow. Judson's voice is refreshing and really, really entertaining, going so far as to fictionalize a talkshow episode where the special guest was a bdelloid rotifer whose species hadn't had sex for 85 million years. She's made Dr. Tatiana, and the species represented in the book, into great characters: weedy mama's boys, belligerent feminists, the works. And she seems fair and balanced, too--take note Jerry Springer.There were moments I found uncomfortable, actually stemming from the fact that Judson had characterized her letter-writers so well. The chapter Crimes of Passion discusses rape. Maybe I'm not supposed to feel compassion for a solitary bee who writes in about how the males molest her when she's doing her chores. Not that I accuse Judson of treating rape lightly or making it funny--far from it--but reading about it in this context triggered my squick buttons. "

39,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14092665-grace,4,"I love evolutionary bio books, and this one had too unique a premise to pass up. The author writes as the fictional columnist Dr. Tatiana, giving advice and explanations about mating behaviors and reproductive strategies to the plethora of species that ""write"" to her. This format gives you a few pages on each of a number of topics. This is great for exposing yourself to a ton of different kinds of research in evolutionary bio. However, the toss up is that towards the end of the book I became frustrated with switching topics so often. I think that says more about my preferences than the quality of the book. A high point was the discussion on homosexuality and thoughts on why behavior that inhibits an individual's chances at having offspring is so common in different parts of the animal kingdom. It was bizarre to read a discussion about homosexuality without any kind of religious, moral, or cultural judgments. It was very interesting and I thought that it was completely apolitical (and therefore non-offensive). I would love to hear an LGBT person's review of this book because I wonder how their opinion of that section may be different. I have a tiny complaint but I found the ""talk show"" chapter at the end with the ""radical feminists"" a little strange. I think the author was trying to be funny and edgy but the joke fell flat. I otherwise loved the discussion on asexuality as a reproductive strategy in that chapter. "
40,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653410-mel,4,"My family read this book together to pass the time on our weekly trip to my parent's house. The short chapters and anecdotal style were particularly well suited to the venue.Dr. Judson (aka Dr. Tatiana) uses a fictional advice column to introduce a species with differentiated sexual characteristics in each section, then compares and contrasts other species. The variety of material is excellent, the descriptions are clear and compelling, and the analysis is at good level for a non-biologist to enjoy.Many popular biology books draw parallels to human behavior and try to use the text to carry a subtext about human nature. With the advice column's anthropomorphized letters from mollusks and bacteria, I feared the same heavy-handed treatment from this book, but was pleasantly surprised. The first chapter or two takes on Bateman's Hypothesis (roughly that men are biologically prone to the promiscuous and women are biologically prone to monogamy) and tears it to shreds. A whole book on that theme would have been monotonous, but thankfully the remainder of the book moves on from the simplistic treatment commonly given to humans to explore less familiar species and provide a tidy thesis ""Life isn't simple"" from which any number of theories like Bateman's can be discarded."

Not for the faint of heart, this book contains possible triggers for readers throughout, including cannibalism, murder, rape, incest, and spiders. The term “hermaphrodite” is also used, though only in discussing non-human members of the animal kingdom.udson discusses the various themes of the book when she states, “evolution does not obey human notions of morality, nor is human morality a reflection of some natural law.” Many of the topics in the book, like polyamory and cheating on a partner, are huge moral topics in the human world. The rest of the animal kingdom has it’s own rules, and human ideas of what is right have only hold us back when it comes studying the world around us.Parts are organized around general themes, and the chapters within them are grouped by related topics, such as crimes of passion, or aphrodisiacs.

The first problem was I just couldn't find myself getting into the layout. It was set up similarly to those personal advice columns written by complacent know-it-alls. The second issue I had was that while all the information given was very scientific and was well-sourced (attested by the large notes and bibliography section in the back), it was presented in such a fast rolling, hyper way that I hardly doubt I'll truly be able to retain much of it. I can see the author was trying for a nontypical approach to penning her book, perhaps in hopes that it would make ""science-y"" stuff more interesting to the masses, or maybe to just seem cool--I don't know--but in my opinion it was wholly unnecessary. I'm not trying to say that people interested in the subject matter should avoid this book, but it would probably do them well to know what they're getting into beforehand.

Using the guise of breezy sex columnist Dr. Tatiana Judson explores the many forms of reproduction practiced by a wide variety of organisms. Along the way she introduces major tenets of evolutionary biology and suggests evolutionary explanations for seemingly bizarre sexual practices. This is not a book for creationists; Judson firmly believes in evolution and is able to explain almost anything through an evolutionary lens. She provides copious end notes to back up all her assertions, and has sterling academic credentials from Stanford and Oxford. This is science writing at its best, thoroughly researched, educational, well-written and highly entertaining. And considering every chapter is about sex, it might even get apathetic teenagers interested. "

Each ""column"" covers a specific practice - with several creatures being discussed. The columns are then grouped together into 3 main sections; Let Slip the Whores Of War! (promiscuity), The Evolution of Depravity (self-explanatory) and Are Men Necessary? Usually, But Not Always (parthogenesis). At the end of each section, Judson draws some general ""advice"" based on the group of practices previously discussed. I'm not sure if she also tried to draw parallels with human sexual behaviour or not in these reviews.

Nevertheless, I was impressed at the unique and amusing approach to explaining the evolutionary biology of sex. I don't think just anyone could have pulled it off. The author obviously knows her stuff, did thorough research, and, judging from her photo on the back inside cover, got some good genes in her own evolutionary biology. Hey, an attractive and obviously intelligent woman writing about sex? Alert the male of the species!Using the literary device of ""letters from the lovelorn"" to advice columnist ""Dr. Tatiana"" was pretty clever and very well done. In some cases, the letters were the most amusing bit. I didn't read everything, just picked out letters that interested me and read those. The lasting impression I will have is that in terms of the evolutionary biology of sex, humans may be more related to elephants than primates. Now, why was that....?"

I doubt that I will retain much of it, though, except for what really is going on in my dogs' ears when they get ear mites. And, the fact that there is very little, if any, monogamy in nature. If one extrapolates from bugs to humans the result is mind-boggling. Not having much of a scientific bent, however, I got a bit bored with the book as it continued along chapter after chapter in the same voice. It was only a bit more than 200 pages (I did not bother with the notes at the end), but I could have done with less.

Species from rotifers to gorillas get a mention, comparing the success of different behaviors that have evolved to make reproduction optimally successful. If that sounds a little dry, well, unfortunately that's the case. Though the premise of a sexpert responding to the pleas of lovelorn beetles is adorable, the q & a format is quickly abandoned in each ""column"" to make way for a listing of creatures with similar mating habits. The clever premise quickly turns into dusty academic journaling so often that it was all too easy to start skimming, and though I'm a biologist myself, I wished for a lot more pop in my pop science. So many of the descriptive passages had me wishing like anything that they were video clips instead (bugs with eyestalks longer than their bodies???) that I'm quite sure with the right narrator this could be reworked into a fantastic tv series."

The answers take you through larger principles of evolutionary biology--and their manifestation in many species--that relate to the question.

I especially like the section on female spotted hyenas, who have phalluses so large and similar to males that until recently, scientists thought spotted hyenas were hermaphrodites.Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of language laziness - words like 'normal' and 'should.'

(Sarah Vowell's humorous books are the historical counterparts to this one if you like to be tricked into learning). Chopped into short, easy-to-read social advice column letters from the weirdest species you can think of, this book reveals the oddest and most counter-intuitive sex practices in creation. It was fascinating, and made me change the way I think about why species have evolved the way they have. Or, it made me start thinking about it in the first place, and I'm not really a sciencey person. I suspect that sciencey people don't use the word sciencey. Whether you're sciencey or not, you'll enjoy it."
52,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4820006-alexis,5,"This book is fantastic! It's formatted like a love & sex advice column... except all the letters are from various members of the animal kingdom. ""Dr. Tatiana"" imparts suggestions to these forlorn metazoans on how to better their intimate lives. Are you a European praying mantis who is troubled by the fact that you enjoy coitus better when it involves biting your lover's head off? ""Dr. Tatiana"" may have some words of sage wisdom for you. Are you a black vulture crusading for family values in Louisiana? ""Dr. Tatiana"" wants to let you in on the latest research regarding monogamy in Avians. Written by evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson, this book is both smart and hilarious. Even Dan Savage doesn't get letters as weird as these. Read it!"
53,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4723517-rory,3,"It's not a case of style versus substance, since there is a lot of substance to this book. However, the format leaves the reader with a long confused list of species reproductive strategies at the back of their minds with little coherence or structure.The format, while titillating and unique for a popular science book, ultimately fails. Easily readily = easily forgettable.On the academic side, for a modern book about sexual anatomy and sexual behaviours, there is a conspicuous absence of any reference to the gene as the unit of selection, to the theories of Trivers or the writings of Dawkins, neither of whom even get a mention.Fantastic Notes and Bibliography sections save this from a two-star rating."
54,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5482913-liz,4,"Definitely one of those books you can put down for awhile and then pick right back up. It's mostly written as a series of advice columns (except for the last chapter), and Judson uses that format to mix in humor without diluting the science. This is not to say she gets technical and uses jargon, she actually stays away from most science terms and keeps the titillating world of animal sex titillating instead of boring.Definitely recommended for those who want to learn some fun facts, but don't have a background in science(like myself), though I'm sure those with more of a science back ground would enjoy it as well (especially for the excellent bibliography).Oh, and I never, ever want to be a female hyena! See chapter 12."

Being ridiculously prompt and surrounded by people who aren't, I often find myself waiting about with a bit of time to kill. This book is perfect for filling in those little snippets. The style of an advice column is precisely right for conveying the meticulously researched and extremely entertaining nuggets of facts about the sex lives of the creatures around us. I often found myself getting strange looks for giggling while sitting alone reading in restaurants and it had the added bonus of fueling some wonderful conversation starters when my companions finally arrived. ""Say, did you know that if we were a white nosed horn blowers from Patagonia, I'd be compelled to rip off your toes after we had sex?"" That will teach them to be late. "

This is great to read a few pages at a time, but gets really monotonous if you read too much. It's a great premise. Animals with sex problems write Dear Abbey letters to Dr. Tatiana, who answers them in character. Again, humorous and informative at first, tedious and informative later on. The outlines of most of the stories are the same. Anyway, I learned a lot of weird sex stuff about the animal kingdom. Asexual reproduction, theories for why sex is important, bizarre mating habits, why some species have almost no males, species who devour one another before or after sex, who has a big penis...it's all there."
57,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7358-jen,5,"This book is fantastic readable evolutionary biology, although I remember having the urge to hide the cover as I read it on the bus. An organism's fitness is ultimately determined by how many surviving offspring it can produce, and Olivia Judson has a great way to describe all the amazing adaptations that animals have to get to this goal. I've always wanted to use it with a class, but haven't had kids old enough - certain selections would be great for high school bio. (I had to come home and consult my copy yesterday, after learning how to extract Drosophila testes. Why do fruit flies have sperm roughly their own body length? Just ask Dr. Tatiana...) "

Not only is she a gorgeous evolutionary bioligist, she's an engaging writer. Moreover, I'm bound to love any book in which monogamous heterosexual couples are presented as nature's most deviant sex practitioners. The diversity of how the ""birds do it, bees do it"" and countless other examples are presented as letters to a sex advice columnist, Dr. Tatiana, and her delicious, educated responses discuss (not always conclusively) the biology behind sex. My only complaint: the book's short on ideas on how to spice up my own sex life."
59,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/265983-liz,4,"This was a very enjoyable and informative book about the evolution of sex in all creatures. It is written like an advice column with all sorts of animals writing in from bees to elephants to green spoon worms (which I had never heard of before). Judson does not use a lot of scientific jargon and explains the concepts very clearly, making the book an easy read. She also pokes fun at the very human notions of fidelity, chastity, and typical gender roles.Sidenote: I kinda felt the need to keep the book on my lap while on the bus to avoid strange looks.

The question and answer style soon got boring and I found myself wanting more meat in the information. Each question is asked by some animal or plant or bacteria and then answered by referencing other examples in nature of the same phenomenon. The problem with this is you get such a shallow understanding of the problem or phenomenon. Just when you're getting into it, it's time for a new question and new species.

She uses science to explain WHY they do what they do, something I love. The only downside about this book is that it's written in a too cutesy way. ""Ask Dr. Tatiana"" gets really old after a chapter or two. I would recommend it, but don't try to read it all at once. "

It's written in the form of a sex column for creatures, which was super cute and funny...for maybe 20 pages. The question and answer style soon got boring and I found myself wanting more meat in the information. Each question is asked by some animal or plant or bacteria and then answered by referencing other examples in nature of the same phenomenon. The problem with this is you get such a shallow understanding of the problem or phenomenon. Just when you're getting into it, it's time for a new question and new species. And so I really didn't learn much that I didn't already know."
271,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44210676-rupinder,5,"A hilarious, fun, and engaging book on the myriad reproductive quirks and strategies of animal kingdom. I won't repeat the description, but will add that this ""agony aunt letter"" format works really well for this book. Though meant to be a fun little book about the 'birds and bees' of 'birds and bees' (see what I did there?), the book is remarkably up-to-date and educational about some of the most intriguing aspects of sex and its importance in evolutionary biology.Though almost any well-educated chap will like this, but a little familiarity with various reproductive systems (of animals) will be helpful in understanding this book."

He is trained in scientific method. I am trained in intersectionality. He hates the word intersectionality. I hate the words ""evolutionary biology"". And so it goes.But, through our battles of theory and will, we have forced each other to read wonderful things, and this may be my favorite of his contributions. Though I have not been wooed to the dark side of ""objective truth"" (foolish scientists), this book makes me chuckle."

It even makes you laugh.Animals send ""Dear Dr Tatiana"" letters and others are interviewed on talk shows.Did you know that asexual animals are at an evolutionary dead end? They are going extinct, except for one, the bdelloid rotifer, that's 85 million years old. It hasn't had sex for 85 million years.And even more bizarre, if you google bdelloid rotifers, you'll find discussion groups about them.Here's a picture for the terminally curious: http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/img/..."

It's really fun to compare what we know of human sexual habits with the habits of the creatures in this book . . . and it really seems as though humans are still in flux, still experimenting with the best way to carry on human genes.Then again, maybe all creatures are still exploring ""alternative sexualities,"" but just not in front of the researchers!LOL, thought-provoking and amusing book."
276,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/726590-leah,3,"It was enteraining, but I found myself overwhelmed by the amount of information included in each section. It's written in an advice column format, with creatures writing into Dr. Tatiana (Judson) with questions about the strange sex practices in nature. She's definitely knowledgable, but I felt she packed too much into each answer. It's hard to feel like I learned anthing becuase there was a constant stream of new information, and I didn't have much time to absorb what I'd just read unless I wanted to take a break every other sentence.

277,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12320249-lee,4,"This is a whirlwind of a book about the biology of procreation. Written in a hilariously funny Dear Abby, or rather, Dear Dr. T, format. Who knew that a troubled fruit fly (drosophila melanogaster, any one from SEHS remember Bio Bob’s fly labs?) could write such a provocative letter? It just goes to say there is more that one way to skin a cat... ur um, where did that phrase come from and why would anyone want to do that? Used by many first rate colleges as a biology textbook. One that the students will want to read! And, you might too.Signed, your science nerd and a kitty lover, me"

Structuring the book as a series of advice columns to forlorn and confused animals was wonderful, breaking up each entry into succulent sections that could be enjoyed quickly. What I most enjoyed about this book, beside the ability to trot out fact to nauseate friends at dinner was that after reading about each animal sex-scapade I wanted to find out more. Judson has crafted an amazing and accessible book that will draw you into the world of between-the-sheets biology. "
279,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6446096-bethany,3,"While I did enjoy this, it just didn't suit my reading style. I tend to sit down and read a book cover-to-cover, and in doing that, the writing style (that of a sex advice columnist dispensing advice to bees, plants, lizards, etc) became somewhat exhausting. I think it'd be better read in short shifts, but I have to get it back to the library.That said, I could see using either a chapter or a single ""column"" in an environmental ed program. It's definitely going on my list of resources/books to recommend."

It is hilarious, yet really comprehensive in what is discussed. She uses examples in nature to explore and explain sexual selection concepts, while making it not feel like a textbook.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a nature/ecology buff (like me), who is looking for a hilarious and engaging quick read."
281,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115600-ht-goodwill,4,"This was a fun book to read. Dr. Tatiana is a fictional advise-columnist/sex expert. In the book different animals write to her asking questions about their methods and means of procreating. This leads to a broad survey of the sexual strategies employed successfully by life on our planet. As the son of a biologist, I found this to be a fascinating glimpse into the unbelievable variety found on this planet."
282,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/671457-carin,5,"a laugh-out-loud funny book about biology, zoology, entymology. Written as if actual bigs and critters were writing in to a sex advice columnist questions such as ""I've just had the most amazing sex of my life... and then I bit his head off and killed him. Is that wrong?"" Answer: not if you're a praying mantis. I've never enjoyed learning so much in my life! And I failed biology! Science has never been so fun."

The implications toward human sexuality are fantastic little ripples I enjoy breaking from the book to consider in my life and the lives of people around me. Plus, her sense of humor makes me smile. :)"
284,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1600246-ann,4,"What a wonderful way to teach science and biology in a very interesting way. ""Dr Tatiana"" is the sex advice columnist for all the living things on earth and in giving ""advice"" to disgruntled slime molds (for example) you receive an excellent understanding of the biology and reproduction of the slime mold. Lots to laugh about in this book too, as the advice is often tongue-in-cheek and/or acerbic!"
285,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2205985-crystal-muno,4,"This book was a lot of fun. The voice of Dr. Tatiana is wry and witty. I can completely picture a biologist version of Carrie Bradshaw (sipping a Bug Juice Cocktail perhaps?) typing these well informed and extremely interesting columns for her animal kingdom readers.I would love to hand this book to every high school biology teacher on the planet, there's no way teens would find the sex cycles of plants or the anatomy of insects boring ever again."
286,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2183977-kiran,4,"As evolutionary biology goes this was an incredibly informative and entertaining read. The author focuses on the evolution of current mating customs and rituals within the animal kingdom. The format itself is pretty cutesy, in a good way, with the bulk of the book written as a series of questions and answers similar to a Dear Abby advice column. I also appreciated that Judson provided an extensive bibliography in case the reader wants to do additional research etc. "
287,0099283751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2480529-nicole,3,"I learned all sorts of interesting facts from this book, although I'm not sure how many of them will ever be useful to me. I appreciated how the author admitted when the answer to a particular question was unknown and how she provided extensive, but not obtrusive, references. The writing was clear and accessible and kept jargon to a minimum, but I found myself tired of the advice column gimmick before I finished the book."

Lots of funny, fascinating tidbits about creatures you've never even heard of and a few that you have. The only downside was that I felt that it was a little heavy on the lesser known creatures and didn't feature much on ones that would maybe have been more interesting since we're already familiar with them. Still, an enjoyable read with a cover that scandalizes everyone who sees you reading it. "

I only give this book 3 stars as I have come across much of this information before. For those that have no prior knowledge of the subject this is a great book; overflowing with case studies, highly referenced and comprehensive. I'm still not sure the narrative works but kudos to the author for trying something a little different. In short, read it."

It is based on a series of spoof ""agony aunt"" columns by ""Dr. Tatiana"", supposedly responding to animals writing in for help with their sex problems. In fact, the book offers accurate and up-to-date information, based on the author's reading of hundreds of scientific articles quoted in the almost-40-page bibliography. The book is brilliant and full of fascinating facts and arguments ... and very funny. "

It isn't for the faint of heart... there is some sick, weird stuff that goes on in the natural world, but it's fascinating. And it's written in a way that I think it would be very accessible to most.

Instead of simply compiling and composing a scintillating volume of the sex lives of critters, it's written in the style of a write-in advice column collection.
