0,1400064287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7-sundeep,4,"from my blog, thesunrising.comSummary: When marketing anything, keep these six concepts in mind if you want your message to shtick: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories; yes, my friends, that spells SUCCESs. If it sounds like too much work, these two concepts also work: Free, Sex (noooo, that’s not in the book…but it works I tell you!).Recommended? Si. It’s a quick, fun read full of interesting anecdotes and examples that make the book’s message more *concrete* (a-hem). If you’re never going to pick it up, at least read a breakdown of the six principles on the book’s website.One(ish)-liners for each of the six principles: * Simplicity - boil it all down to the core message you want people to walk away with….the one thing they should know/do…the key takeaway….the essence of your point…the singular (okay, I’ll stop). * Unexpectedness - generate interest and curiosity by being counter-intuitive or using surprise/some other technique. Oh, and you should send me money (see? that’s called “surprise”). * Concreteness - explain ideas “in terms of human actions, in terms of sensory information”; people think in pictures, so paint a picture. For example, I’m sitting at my desk in my room typing this on my Dell laptop, sipping water and eating green curry chicken over rice. If you make it to the end of this post, I bet you’ll remember what I ate, but you won’t remember all six principles. * Credibility - it’s only what is said because of who says it; make sense? If you can’t get a spokesperson (Oprah), be vividly detailed; “sticky ideas have to carry their own credentials”. * Emotions - get people to care about your idea by evoking a feeling around your idea, and keep in mind that “we are wired to feel things for people, not for abstraction.” You make me happy by reading this blog post. (Don’t you feel happier knowing that, mom?) * Stories - wrap the idea with context and it’ll be remembered as associated with that context; sometimes, analogies work great here as they ground the idea in a story or context folks are familiar with (analogies also allow you to check off “simple” and “concrete”; for example, “my blog is the Pinto of the blogosphere” says a lot about my blog. And me, unfortunately.)Key takeaways: * Think about what YOU would respond to if YOU were your target audience (make sense?). First this means understanding the frame of mind/perspective of your target audience (note: this is HARD). Then, it’s asking questions like “what would make me take notice?” Throw off what the authors affectionately refer to as the “Curse of Knowledge” (corny, but true) and go from there. How does your target audience views the world? What’s important to them? (Which raises some good questions…who are you people? And what’s important to you?) * Make ideas interesting in some way/shape/form. Sounds incredibly obvious but it’s in fact hard to do (think of all the crap advertising you see these days…clearly, if it were interesting it wouldn’t be crap…I’ll bet you had a hard time remembering explicit crap ads precisely because they were crap). Playing into people’s curiosity can be a powerful way to make things interesting (guess what color boxers I’m wearing). * When pitching something, emphasize benefits, not features; people want to know what’s in it for them (self-interest), or how what you’re offering supports something they believe in (identity). If you can nail both, you’ve got a winner (this whole “organic” craze, for example). * Final excerpt from the book. “For an idea to stick, for it to be useful and lasting, it’s got to make the audience: 1. Pay attention 2. Understand and remember it 3. Agree/Believe 4. Care 5. Be able to act on it” 6. Think free. Or sex. Or both.Okay, without looking, what are the six principles? And what did I eat? And how much money are you sending me?"
1,1400064287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"I came upon this book in a convoluted fashion. It was nearly recommended to me in a round about sort of way by Richard, a GoodReads friend, when he pointed to a review of Blink by someone else on GoodReads who is some sort of expert in the field (although, I have to admit I’m still not totally sure which field that is). The expert felt Gladwell was a little too simplistic. I enjoyed Gladwell’s books very much and so was keen to see what made them seem too simplistic to someone ‘in the field’ and what a book they would recommend as not being too simplistic would be like. I was surprised, then, when this one started by praising Gladwell’s The Tipping Point.This is a very interesting book. There is no question that this book would be very useful if you are a teacher or a journalist – it shows how stories are better than lists of facts and statistics and shows how structuring your message around concrete examples that are directly relevant to the needs of your audience is going to make your audience much more interested in what you have to say. This all sounds far too familiar and far too simple – but actually, the book is remarkably good at breathing new life into these near clichés. The problem is that everyone knows things like KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) but no one ever bothers following this advice, mostly because it is given as abstract advice (some idiot talking about the KISS Principle) rather than in good, clear examples in ways that are designed to make the lesson stick.Many of the stories in this book I had heard before, in fact, many more of the stories in this book than in any of Gladwell’s books, but they are told not so much to get you to drop your jaw in surprise, which does seem to be Gladwell’s gift even when I don’t agree with him, but rather to instruct,The clever thing they do in the book is to use lots of stories from not-for-profit organisations that are seeking to get their message across – stories not just about people making money – and how these organisations have been ‘creative’ in attracting the attention of their potential audience. The point that is made over and again is that it really has nothing to do with being creative, it is about knowing what the rules are that make a good story – a story that is directed at illuminating your key message.That is another thing that I learned in this book – that there should be one message, not three, that if you have three main messages no one will remember any of your ‘messages’. At the start of this book I was worried that it might turn out to be a ‘standard American Self-help book’ as it did have that kind of smell about it. But it redeemed itself nicely. The advice is the kind of advice one can never hear too frequently about the benefits of keeping a message simple and direct. It is not about dumbing down the message, it is about making the message clear. And there is a hell of a difference between those two.Like a good self-help book there is even a crappy acronym, which in this case is SUCCES:•	Simple — find the core of any idea•	Unexpected — grab people's attention by surprising them •	Concrete — make sure an idea can be grasped and remembered later •	Credibility — give an idea believability •	Emotion — help people see the importance of an idea •	Stories — empower people to use an idea through narrative But crappy acronyms can be sadly underrated and this one worked well at structuring the book and in summarising the message. (I’ve stolen the dotpoints from here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_to_...)This is, in fact, a very good book and the sort of book that anyone who tends towards corporate speak should be forced to read – well, forced to read after they have been sent to a re-education camp for due punishment for six months. I’m thinking along the lines of bamboo under fingernails or perhaps waterboarding before Obama bans it. If you are afraid that you might make PowerPoint presentations that are just like everyone else’s – and that idea sends a shiver down your spine – this book is for you.I’ve been rather lucky lately, I’ve found a string of fascinatingly interesting books. Enjoy…"
2,1400064287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493577-mark-dickson,2,"Perhaps it was because this book came highly recommended from a reliable source, but I was greatly disappointed. This book was a redundant snooze. The ultimate test, I suppose, is whether the ideas from this book do, in fact, stick. It suffices to say that ""enjoyability"" is NOT on the list of what makes an idea stick. It's quite clear that the authors are doing their utmost to follow their own advice. That this makes the book almost unreadably repetitive is possibly an argument against the book's worth. On the other hand, if the ideas in the book stay with you, then their premise that beating you over the skull with a blunt object is the best way to make ideas stick may be both accurate and demonstrable. Don't get me wrong. I wanted to like this book. It just read so much like a boring textbook for college freshmen that it was often hard to stomach. Of course, this could just be a mismatched audience gripe. If you're a clueless corporate advertising wannabe, this book will probably be right up your alley. Or if you're teaching a course on advertising or communication, your students might get something out of it. If you're actually into what makes ideas stick, why not pick something a little more rigorous, perhaps on memetics. I recommend Susan Blackmore's ""Meme Machines"" or Richard Brodie's ""Virus of the Mind"". For the more philosophically inclined, Dan Dennett's ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" might also be a lot of fun."

How to formulate it so that it 'sticks' in the minds of the listeners. The core idea is that: in order for a message to be 'sticky' it has to combine these 6 characteristics: 1) Simple 2) Unexpected 3)Credible 4) Concrete 5)emotional 6)StorySUCCES(without the extra 'S' spelling success)The authors tell very engaging stories on each of their success factors.I think this is a great book for consultants. One of their main jobs is to communicate ideas, so this is integral."
5,1400064287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1096492-kevan,5,"Update #2: Yep. Still recommending it. I Update #1, at the halfway point: five stars already.I want to read this book twice, at least. This will directly change how I write, present, think, create and make things. I know I need to keep experimenting to make my communication more memorable, more meaningful, and I'll be playing with many of the techniques described here. A few key points that I want to experiment with in my own work:""If you've asked somebody to remember three things, you've asked them to remember nothing."" I need to simplify messages to ONE key element. (I will use this when writing Voice & Tone guidelines for clients)Use mystery to open a knowledge gap for people. It keeps people glued to the end if you've activated their curiosity - it's why people stick around to finish even bad movies; they need to know how it ends. So, can you open a piece by asking a question? Can you start a presentation by asking how somebody would approach a certain problem? Can you pace content with clues and reveals?Make examples concrete. Use physical objects and demonstrations. Heck, create a physical installation art piece instead of a powerpoint presentation. Help people to experience, touch and see your idea, make it UNabstract, to make it memorable. There's an an amazing story of HP pitching Disney by creating a walkthrough pop-up museum that showcased HP technology in-use at a Disney park -- INSTEAD of creating a powerpoint presentation.Boil down goals to simple, concrete statements. Sony wanted to make a ""pocketable radio"" long before radios were pocket sized, and they said so in those words. It motivates legions of engineers. JFK's ""put a man on the moon by the end of the decade"" statement (instead of ""prove our superiority in long-distance transportation technology over the blah-blah-blah""). To kill corporate blah, you need to mention specific objects, nouns, locations, timespans. Think Aesop's Fables: simple stories, simple messages, starring animals performing tasks. They've endured for millennia because there is nothing remotely abstract about them.What I'm learning so far: Kill the abstract. Get concrete. Choose ONE message, not several. I'm really excited to keep pushing myself to write/present/think better using these techniques. There is especially a lot here for when you want to motivate internal teams, launch projects, influence a company culture, all of which are skills I want to be better at. I'm halfway through the book; expect another update soon."
6,1400064287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19191451-lili-manolache,5,"The book ""Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die"" by Chip Heath and Dan Heath Chow, is about how to make your ideas memorable; be it promoting a product / project, being a professional, forwarding a company's strategy or lessons to students. Everything revolves around the SUCCESS methodology. For an idea to stick, for it to be useful and lasting, it's got to make the audience:Pay attention - UnexpectedUnderstand and remember it - ConcreteAgree/Believe - CredibleCare - EmotionalBe able to act on it - Story. ""Made to Stick"" is a book that stands as proof of how to apply the suggestions in it, if you get as it is written: with many stories as examples, with simple language, and without long and pompous paragraphs. And with occasion, I will tell you a lesson taken from the book: it's written in the inverted pyramid style.This is a type of book I would recommend to anybody!"

The Curse of Knowledge is a big problem, when you know too much that you can no longer explain it simply--I actually think it's the stage just before assimilating a concept because once it is woven into your knowledge base then you can zoom in and out--or as Einstein says, 'If you can't explain it to a five year old then you don't understand it.' There's a lot of good things here, but I like this quote referencing McKee: ""Curiosity is the intellectual need to answer questions and close open patterns. Story plays to this universal desire by doing the opposite, posing questions and opening situations."""
8,1400064287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6977074-snuggles-with-rainbows,5,"I don’t know why I’m surprised at my 5star rating. I was recommended this book by multiple people, including the professionals of Goodreads. The final nail on the coffin was when my Dad just handed me this book saying, “You know for a Doctor, you should really read this book!” Way to go Dad! That’s what did it. He throws in that ‘doctor’-word in there and I’m eating from the palm of his hand. But on a serious note, this book was enlightening to me on so many levels. Not only did I resonate with it from the perspective of a new healthcare professional but also as an individual who loves to learn new things. Furthermore, the authors of the book have made the premise very appealing to anyone. As a doctor, I face the challenge of selling harder yet healthy ways of life to my patients everyday. With the advent of the internet, it has making my job harder and harder. It is much easier now for people to have preconceived notions about their health and treatment plan before I ever see them. Something as simple as vaccinations now has become this hazy and controversial topic. I completely see now [after reading this book] how an idea can infiltrate a nation of individuals seamlessly. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to broaden their horizons. It will make you question a lot of things you hear and see. It will definitely make you reconsider how you present your thoughts and ideas to someone else. I hope you like it as much as I did! "
9,1400064287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/759114-james,3,"Some business books are written to promote consulting gigs. This is one such book. You can usually tell when the summary chapter just takes the table of contents and re-arranges it a little. I picked this up because one of the authors is the founder of an innovative website used extensively by my kids---Thinkwell.com. There is nothing inherently wrong with this book. The ideas are coherent, presented well, and made relatively easy to digest (following the their own enunciated principle of the ""pomelo scheme""). The examples are good if outdated (the wood block Palm Pilot example is a little dated. Do people even know what a Palm Pilot is anymore?). The ideas are even useful. And the mnemonic SUCCESs to describe their central idea is cute.But there is no practical way to translate these ideas into the real world. For example, the Sinatra Test (one successful outcome means that every outcome will be successful) is a little dubious and the example of Safexpress tells about the outcome, but not how it was achieved. I suspect that here is where you would need consultants.Again, it's not a bad book. It's not meant to be a how to manual. But I suggest that you borrow, not buy, your copy."

The authors did a good job of structuring their material by setting up their formula for ""sticky ideas"" and then dedicating a chapter to each ingredient. They finished by having a chapter dedicated to symptoms/problems and antidotes/ways to solve them. And these were very close to real life, the troubles/questions that a lot of their readers surely have, so it's definitely helpful.I appreciated that Chip & Dan Heath included lots of real-world examples in the chapters - ideas, slogans, quotes, advertisements, proverbs etc. - and analyzed their success or failure.

It will consist of three books: ""The Tipping Point"" by Malcolm Gladwell, ""Influence"" by Robert Cialdini, and this book, which is maybe the one of the three that knocked me on my butt most often as I was reading it.The (adorable!) Heath brothers (check out their nerdy-preppy hottitude on the back cover!) are Chip, a Stanford business professor, and Dan, an education and new media consultant in NC. This book examines why certain stories, marketing ploys, teaching methods, lesson plans, public-service announcements, and other forms of communication succeed and others fail. For example, why is a lurid but absurd urban legend so much easier to remember than the highly worthy and well-supported mission statement of a nonprofit?The book breaks down into six components the qualities an idea needs to have in order to ""stick""--to be remembered by people and influence their behavior. The Heath Bros do a great job practicing what they preach; the book is clear, engaging, and packed with wonderful (and memorable) anecdotes and examples. The Shark Attack clinic is an instant classic; I also loved their discussions of effective (and ineffective) anti-smoking and anti-littering ads.This book will be highly useful to any entrepreneur, parent, pastor/rabbi, teacher, advertiser, CEO, or other communicator who needs to get his or her point across.

Maybe I’ve read too much Godin and Gary Vee, or maybe this 12 year old book is a little dated. Either way it’s hard to pinpoint why memes, trends, and some things become popular over others.This book is a perfectly acceptable attempt to understand why some things stick more than others, but hindsight is always 20/20. If Chip had followed more of his own advice, maybe this book would have been a little more interesting. “The most basic way to get someone's attention is this: Break a pattern.

And, that since a couple of the books I've written are bestsellers, I must make them interesting to readers. Why mention this? Because my copy of Made to Stick is filled with sticky notes that are covered with ideas for upcoming speeches and writings. This book motivates application of the ideas it contains. Yes, I've used several of the core techniques described in the book for years--using stories, making ideas concrete, keeping the core message central, tapping into why the audience should care, using surprise, and ensuring credibility. And, I've continually worked on trying to limit what I want to convey. However, this book ORGANIZED my thoughts about these techniques and gave me a great description of my own trap--the Curse of Knowledge, the fact that once we're experts on something, we tend to talk more abstractedly. It's tough to step into the shoes of someone who is new to Jungian type or a student who doesn't grasp what algebra is and understand what they need. Made to Stick isn't about propaganda techniques, but about a language that helps people understand what you're communicating.Ample examples for both the world of education and the world of business, this is a reference I will return to many times."

They look at the key aspects of what makes some ideas and stories stick in people's minds. They boil things down to 6 key principles of simplicity that make things stick in people's memories.Some of the cases they analyze are urban legends, because these seem to get around fast and are remembered long after they are heard. For example, have you heard about the traveling businessman who went back to his hotel room with a woman he met at the bar, only to wake up in the bathtub, full of ice, with one kidney cut out of him?After reading it I bought a copy for an old friend of mine who is a professor teaching film studies, since selling a screenplay is the ultimate challenge.

To summarize, here’s our checklist for creating a successful idea: a Simple Unexpected Concrete Credentialed Emotional Story. A clever observer will note that this sentence can be compacted into the acronym SUCCESs. This is sheer coincidence, of course. (Okay, we admit, SUCCESs is a little corny. We could have changed ‘Simple’ to ‘Core’ and reordered a few letters. But, you have to admit, CCUCES is less memorable.)” (pg. 18)Understanding how connections can be wired between ideas and people – between your ideas and the people you hope will be struck by them. The expert ""wants to talk about chess strategies, not about bishops moving diagonally."" It's the showing, not the telling. The stickest most important lesson: They know that with ideas it's not the telling but the showing that counts, so they've filled their book with stories that illustrate their theories.“Stickiness means that a message makes an impact. You can't get it out of your head. It sticks in your memory.""What makes some ideas famous? They came up with 6 common themes that super hit ideas share. These 6 themes allow anyone to reverse engineer their ideas and make them more sticky. More pass-able.1. SIMPLE = CORE + COMPACT - Like a proverb. Short, but meaningful. Simplicity: the idea must be stripped to its core idea, the touchstone, and the most important benefits of the touchstone should jump out. “A writer knows they have achieved perfection not when they can think of nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away without losing the essence of the idea. The CORE! “It’s hard to make ideas stick in a noisy, unpredictable, chaotic environment. If we’re to succeed, the first step is this: Be simple. Not simple in terms of ‘dumbing down’ or ‘sound bites.’ What we mean by ‘simple’ is finding the core of the idea. ‘Finding the core’ means stripping an idea down to its most critical essence.” (pgs. 27, 28)2. UNEXPECTED - The twist in the story makes it memorable. Break peoples usual patterns of perception , feelings and the actions that result from those perceptions and feelings based in past, present, future. Unexpectedness: the idea must destroy preconceived notions about something. This forces people to stop, think, and remember. “If we are to motivate people to pay attention, we should seize the power of big suprises, curiosity” Capture and Hold Attention – We have 3 seconds to capture attention. Create mystery by pointing out a knowledge gap, tease with information. “The gap theory"" of curiosity. This is the notion that a gap in knowledge is painful – it's like having an itch that needs to be scratched. It's also the reason that murder mysteries, crossword puzzles, sport contests, and even Pokémon succeed in grabbing attention: An audience is challenged to predict an outcome and then left wondering, ""What will happen?"" and ""Was I right?"" We need to first open gaps before we close them. Most often, the communicator's tendency is ""to tell people the facts. First, though, the recipient of the message must realize that they need these facts."" “The most basic way to get someone’s attention is this: Break a pattern. Humans adapt incredibly quickly to consistent patterns. Figure out what is counterintuitive about the message—i.e., What are the unexpected implications of your core message? Communicate your message in a way that breaks your audiences’ guessing machines.” (pgs. 64, 72)3. CONCRETE - As opposed to abstract. Visible in real life experiences. Concreteness: avoid statistics, use real-world analogies to help people understand complex ideas. Help people understand and remember from the their past and present experience. Use the Velco Theory of memory. The more memory hooks you give them to attach your ideas to their past and present experience. Make them experience your ideas in the past present and the possibilities of the future. Help them bring their knowledge to the idea. “Abstraction makes it harder to understand an idea and to remember it. It also makes it harder to coordinate our activities with others, who may interpret the abstraction in very different ways. Concreteness helps us avoid these problems.” (pg. 100) Use analogies. Parallels. Metaphors. Pictures. Tangible ideas makes it easy for people to understand remember your blog posts.4. CREDIBLE - Must be believable. Credibility: if people don't trust you, they'll ignore you. In some cases, they will be openly hostile, which means they'll actively try to dispute your message! Help people believe by using authority and anti-authority figures, institutions, ideas. Honesty and trustworthiness matter!!! Internal Credibility: What they know from their own past and present experiences. Thoughts and Emotions, Results, Actions. External Credibility – Statistics. “How do we get people to believe our ideas? We’ve got to find a source of credibility to draw on. A person’s knowledge of details is often a good proxy for her expertise. Think of how a history buff can quickly establish her credibility by telling an interesting Civil War anecdote. But concrete details don’t just lend credibility to the authorities who provide them; they lend credibility to the idea itself.” (pgs. 138, 163) Give specific details and quote experts to make your post credible. Add testimonials and show the number of people who comment on your blog to make your blog seem credible. Improve your crediblity and people will believe in you - and agree with you more often.5. EMOTIONS - Emotions: information makes people think, but emotion makes them act. Appeal to emotional needs, sometimes even way up on Maslow's hierarchy. Internal Emotions: What they know from their own past and present experiences. What kind of Emotions do they draw from this. What kind emotions do they want for the Future? Take the benefits and apply them to their Self Interest. What do they want to avoid and what do they want to gain? Engage what they want to feel, visualize, experience. Thoughts and Emotions, Results, Actions. “How can we make people care about our ideas? We get them to take off their Analytical Hats. We create empathy for specific individuals. We show how our ideas are associated with things that people already care about. We appeal to their self-interest, but we also appeal to their identities—not only to the people they are right now but also to the people they would like to be.” (pg. 203) One easy trick to touch people’s hearts is writing for one single person. Use a lot of “You” in your blog posts. Use powerful words and phrases instead of weaker overused cliches.6. STORIES - Providing inspiration to towards ideas or away from ideas and simulation of how a person can see themselves doing the same thing. Stories: telling a story [gets] people into paying closer attention, and feeling more connected. Remember the Jared Subway commercials? Get people to ACT. Take ACTION. Stories are a Simulation, a plan which they can see, feel themselves in doing the same thing. Stories about the future and the possibilities. “A story is powerful because it provides the context missing from abstract prose. This is the role that stories play—putting knowledge into a framework that is more lifelike, more true to our day-to-day existence. Stories are almost always CONCRETE. Most of them have EMOTIONAL and UNEXPECTED elements. The hardest part of using stories effectively is make sure they’re SIMPLE—that they reflect your core message. It’s not enough to tell a great story; the story has to reflect your agenda.” (pgs. 214, 237) Tell stories and anecdotes to make your point. People will forget theory. But they won’t forget stories that convey the same message as those theories. Stories are a powerful means to make people take action.create a mystery, curiosity, make us aware of a gap in our knowledgeFLOW OF ENERGY – (TEAR) THOUGHT-EMOTION-ACTION-RESULTSThe mind is contaminated by emotions, moods, desires, goals, and simple self-interest...."

It presents six principles and explains them with plenty of specific examples and comparisons of “sticky” and “non-sticky” ideas. Its lessons are applicable whether your ideas will be used in marketing and advertising a business or in spreading the mission of a nonprofit.One of the themes of the book is overcoming the “curse of knowledge,” which is when you’re so familiar with your mission/product/service that you can’t see things from the perspective of those who aren’t familiar, and can’t express yourself to “outsiders.”I read it primarily to improve the marketing of my web design business, OptimWise, but also seeking concepts to use for our clients, and in my volunteer work for various nonprofits.I had heard about this book from several sources, and finally decided to read it when Daniel Pink recommended it in To Sell is Human. The audiobook narrated by Charles Kahlenberg is of excellent quality.Notes“The test of our success as idea creators isn’t whether people mimic our exact words, it’s whether we achieve our goals.”Step 1: Find the core of the idea.Step 2: Translate the core using the SUCCES checklist.6 Principles of Successful Ideas (SUCCES checklist)	• Simple	• Unexpected	• Concrete	• Credentialed	• Emotional	• StorySimple	• The core should have profound compactness, like a proverb.	• Use analogies and metaphors.	• “A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” - Antoine de Saint-ExuperyUnexpected	• Break a pattern.	• Present a mystery to pique curiosity.ConcreteTo solve problems, you need a common “language.” It needs to be concrete, not abstract.Credentialed	• Concrete details add credibility.	• Use endorsements from authorities and non-authorities (average people).	• Stats add credibility. Use them to show relationships, not for absolute numbers.	• Use the “Sinatra test”: “if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” Give one notable, concrete example to prove your credibility.	• Use testable credentials: ask the audience, “see for yourself.”Emotional“If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.” Mother TheresaHow can we make people care about our ideas?	• Get them to take off their analytical hats.	• Create empathy for specific individuals.	• Show how our ideas are associated with things people already care about.	• Appeal to self-interest. Example: John Caples’ headline, “They laughed when I sat down at the piano...”	• Appeal to identity (example: “Don’t Mess with Texas”).	- • Group interest is often a better predictor of political opinion than self-interest.	- • People don't ask “what's in it for me?” but, “what's in it for my group?”	- • Appeal to who people already are, and also who they would like to be.	• Stay out of “Maslow’s basement.” People aren’t necessarily motivated by the lowest levels of Maslow’s “hierarchy of needs.” It isn't actually a hierarchy; people pursue the various levels simultaneously; there's overlap.Stories	• Stories provide simulation; they cause the listener to mentally play along.	• Mental practice is more effective for mental activity than physical activity. Metal practice yields two thirds the benefit of physical practice.	• Stories provide inspiration, which drive action.Inspirational story plots	• Challenge: underdog story, such as David and Goliath.	• Connection: overcoming barriers, such as in The Good Samaritan and Romeo and Juliet.	• Creativity: mental breakthrough, such as the apple falling on Newton’s head.Example: Jared’s Subway Diet	• Simple: Eat subs and lose weight.	• Unexpected: A guy lost a ton of weight by eating fast food.	• Concrete: Oversized pants, loss of girth, particular sandwiches.	• Credible: Has anti-authority truthfulness: the guy who wore 60-inch pants is giving diet advice.	• Emotional: We care more about an individual (Jared) than about a mass. It taps into profound areas of Maslow’s hierarchy: It’s about a guy who reached his potential with the help of a sub shop.	• Story: Our protagonist overcomes big odds to triumph. It inspires the rest of us to do the same."

Through powerful anecdotes (uber intentionally) and very approachable technical explanations, Heath and Heath do an amazing job giving concrete examples of how to present your ideas in a readily-remembered way that will encourage retention and action by the recipient.Less vaguely speaking (a cardinal Curse of Knowledge sin according to the Heaths), for me personally as a YouTube content creator this means crafting my videos in a way that will not only grab attention in the first ten seconds (crucial) but will also honestly communicate a facet of effectively learning English that will be taken to heart, perhaps remembered at first because of its emotional appeal but later because it works for the viewer - meaning it was translatable. I will be returning to ""SUCCES"" and the Easy Reference Guide often.As a side note, I played the Tapper-Listener game with my wife and some friends and we were all fascinated.

I also like to read about stories, what makes them work, how they excite our imagination, how we use them to enrich our communications. Made To Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive And Others Die is about all that and more. Good salespeople, advertisers, marketers, PR professionals, even managers wanting to motivate their employees and entrepreneurs needing to excite their investors can make good use of the techniques described in this book. The authors achieved their goal, ""...to help you make your ideas...understood and remembered, and have a lasting impact...."" In other words, they help you make your ideas ""stick."" As the author of several books about persuasion in business myself, I took away several great points: ""Belief counts for a lot, but belief isn't enough. For people to take action, they have to care."" ""We appeal to their self-interest, but we also appeal to their identities--not only to the people they are right now but also to the people they would like to be."" ""One of the worst things about knowing a lot, or having access to a lot of information, is that we're tempted to share it all.""

31,1400064287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,4,"Basically, yet another manual on storytelling and what it is and how it works and what it boils down to. While if's fun to read and, well, a very dopaminergic read (if I may say so), still there is precious little that's not been discussed in all kinds of topical blogs and all kinds of corporate trainings and ... While looking for the perfect storytelling via this book, the author lost a large chunk of the book. Which is my fav pet peeve with the storytelling exercise. Some of the ideas cool. Some insipid and probably just the thing that leads people's thinking to modern superficially. For example:Q:An accurate but useless idea is still useless. (c) Electricity was useless, at a time. And? Should they have chucked it? Q:It’s hard to make ideas stick in a noisy, unpredictable, chaotic environment. If we’re to succeed, the first step is this: Be simple. Not simple in terms of “dumbing down” or “sound bites.” You don’t have to speak in monosyllables to be simple. What we mean by “simple” is finding the core of the idea. “Finding the core” means stripping an idea down to its most critical essence. To get to the core, we’ve got to weed out superfluous and tangential elements. But that’s the easy part. The hard part is weeding out ideas that may be really important but just aren’t the most important idea. The Army’s Commander’s Intent forces its officers to highlight the most important goal of an operation. The value of the Intent comes from its singularity. You can’t have five North Stars, you can’t have five “most important goals,” and you can’t have five Commander’s Intents. Finding the core is analogous to writing the Commander’s Intent—it’s about discarding a lot of great insights in order to let the most important insight shine. The French aviator and author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once offered a definition of engineering elegance: “A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” A designer of simple ideas should aspire to the same goal: knowing how much can be wrung out of an idea before it begins to lose its essence.” (c) Frankly, we are not all designers. And often, this creates a lot of tiptoeing around perfectly sound ideas in order to achieve some unfathomable perfection of ideation. Sound familiar?Still, a fast and fun read. Q:The most basic way to get someone's attention is this: Break a pattern (c)Q:Then, Covey superimposes a very human metaphor over the statistics. He says, ""If, say, a soccer team had these same scores, only 4 of the 11 players on the field would know which goal is theirs. Only 2 of the 11 would care. Only 2 of the 11 would know what position they play and know exactly what they are supposed to do. And all but 2 players would, in some way, be competing against their own team members rather than the opponent.” (c)Q:mental practice alone produced about two thirds of the benefits of actual physical practice (c)Q:Good metaphors are “generative.”13 The psychologist Donald Schon introduced this term to describe metaphors that generate “new perceptions, explanations, and inventions.” (c)Q:Your brain hosts a truly staggering number of loops. (c)Q:Surprise isn't enough. We also need insight. (c)Q:avoid useless accuracy, and to dodge the Curse of Knowledge, is to use analogies.” (c)Q:Stories are like flight simulators for the brain.

I wanted to see what stuck. For me, it was the idea that my communication needs to be simple (find the central idea) and concrete (like a story) in order to stick.The SUCCESs acronym didn't fully stick, so I had to look it up again to confirm what it was: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories. (So it turns out I elided ""Concrete"" with ""Stories""—is that my fault or the authors'?)Chip and Dan Heath write with an earnest but perhaps a bit breezy style, one I would call ""Gladwellian."" That argument-by-anecdote formula (with a generous dose of pop social science) is easily assimilated, but it always leaves me wishing for a more stable authority to which to appeal. I get the feeling that this book will feel its age more quickly than, say, the persuasive modes of Aristotle (logos, pathos, and ethos), which have served a similar function in the history of rhetoric to the one SUCCESs now proposes to take.From a Christian theological perspective, the Heaths have no doubt uncovered truths about humanity from God's general revelation. I'm willing to say that God made people to like stories, even if the Bible doesn't directly say so. And judged against other books in the genre, the Heaths may deserve five stars instead of three—they certainly held my attention. But in the end, I'm annoyed by utilitarian books. I'd rather hear from a speaker/writer who is rhetorically faulty but spiritually authentic than from someone who has learned the strategies for winning friends and influencing people. Of course I'm making a false dichotomy here; the ideal is both authenticity and rhetorical skill. And for help with the latter I'm indebted to Made to Stick."

First, I had to admit, I had a very hard time getting used to *listening* to a book. I also found my self rewinding and listening to parts again, not because I was interested in what was being said, but mostly because I was busy driving and missed what was being said. I'm going to try another few audiobooks before I give up, but I'm not sure non-fiction was meant to be listened to while weaving through rush hour traffic.The book itself was pretty interesting. The ideas conveyed by the authors are interesting and engaging, although towards the end of the book I felt like they were kind of repeating themselves. They offer a lot of good examples, which helps take some of the abstract concepts they discuss and make them more realistic and down-to-earth. The fact that I remember stories more than the actual content of the book is actually one of the points of the book, so I guess they were right on that one.

Sure, the book has a lot of interesting anecdotes and is presented in an entertaining way, but a lot of the content feels like common sense. And it is. But the Heath brothers make you realize that although you're not aware of it, the ""Curse of Knowledge"" is making you ignore the common sense way of communicating and is instead twisting your words into meaningless jargon. They present SUCCESs (Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional Stories) as a dead-simple way of creating ""sticky"" messages. The more I think about it, the more I appreciate how the Heath brothers have created a concrete framework for effective communication.

Why is it really hard to make some ideas stick?One major factor is the curse of knowledge. Once you know something, it is hard to think what it is like to not know. This makes it difficult to share our knowledge with others because we cannot recreate our listeners' state of mind. The book highlights six helpful principles to make ideas stick (""SUCCESS""):1. SimplicityIdeas that could provoke schemes in people's mind accelerate the listeners' learning process. One example is analogy. Disney calls the maintenance staff in theme parks ""Cast Members"" to make them think of their role as performance rather than solely maintenance. 2. UnexpectednessSurprise triggers our attention when our schemes failed. Then it helps us understand why the failure occur. 3. ConcretenessIdeas explained with human actions and sensory information ensure consistency among different audience.4. CredibilitySinatra test (If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.), details, and statistics make ideas more real.5. EmotionsAssociations are created using one person example rather than a mass. As Mother Teresa said, ""If I look at the the mass, I will never act. If I look at one, I will.""6. StoriesStories are mental simulations that help us mentally rehearse ideas. This invokes people to participate with you. Stories engages little voice inside your head. If you work in harmony with the little voice by engaging it and giving it something to do, the little voice will invoke a second story in the listener's head. I will try to incorporate these practical advice in business situations such as persuasion, negotiation, and selling. "

The authors want us to understand how a good slogan or pedagogy can work with audience expectations - then reverse or otherwise shock them. (Very modernist approach)-analogies can be powerful. (This lit prof concurs)-it helps to address audience's self-interest, but to explore doing so across a range of Bloom's taxonomy.The book is very repetitive, which can be a problem.

But that's OK. It's not an overly long book, so the ratio of signal to noise is bearable. If you need to craft messages in order to motivate teams or to sell products, I would recommend this despite all flaws. There are two or three nice examples in this book that gave me some good and actionable ideas for my own daily work.I have three qualms with the book:1. Every example is about American companies, American sports clubs, American products or American people. Virtually NONE of them have any meaning to me, except for JFK, of course, who is some godlike figure that gets used as an example in every single self-help book ever written. This problem is of course a personal one, if I grew up in the US, I would have had a better connection to the content.2. The one chapter that tries to bring some serious science into play and quotes Kahneman on priming effects, uses a bunch of studies that all turned out to be not reproducible. (see https://replicationindex.com/2017/02/...)3. In several chapters we find sentences like ""this food is labelled as low fat, we all know that this is the healthier option"" -- I admit, this is a personal pet peeve of mine, but after reading A LOT about nutrition this year, my blood starts boiling when some uninformed idiot starts parroting the benefits of the American food pyramid. This author seriously believes that eating food high in fat makes you fat.Granted, wether or not the food that was part of the example is actually healthy, has no impact on the lesson that the author tried to get across, but this and point #2 raise red flags for me. It seems that the author is a rather uninformed person, heard some outdated science a while ago that fit well into his own confirmation bias and so he decided to write a quick book."

The chapters are succinct and full of small stories that convey the point easily. What I like is that in the end, the 15-20 pages provide a recap of the book and you can remember and revise, much like a cheat-sheet before exam. I can't say how long it will stick with me.

Another good book about the power of stories and other methods to make your idea stick in the vast ocean of information. This is one of the few books that I have read recently that referenced the 8th Habit by Stephen Covey. Core principles to follow (SUCCESs):* Simplicity - what is the core message you want people to walk away with, the one thing they should know/do. “When you say three things, you say nothing.” The art of simplifying is to encapsulate the core idea in terms that anyone can understand, without changing its meaning. i.e. Southwest Airlines ""THE low fare airline.""* Unexpectedness - generate interest and curiosity by being counter-intuitive or using surprise/some other technique. * Concreteness - explain ideas in terms of human actions, in terms of sensory information. People think in pictures, so paint a picture. * Credibility - it’s only what is said because of who says it; If you can’t get a spokesperson (like Oprah), be vividly detailed; “sticky ideas have to carry their own credentials”. Having experts back a story up. Giving a common reference point that people can understand (a pomelo is a sized up grapefruit). * Emotions - get people to care about your idea by evoking a feeling around your idea, and keep in mind that we are wired to feel things for people, not for abstraction (the example experiment about amount of donations when mentioning millions of starving people VS just one specific individual, presenting both gives the worst outcome as our rational mind kicks in). * Stories - using an idea through narrative, wrap the idea with context and it’ll be remembered as associated with that context; sometimes, analogies work great here as they ground the idea in a story or context folks are familiar with. Stories inspiring people to take action (David VS Goliath); stories inspiring better social behavior (the good Samaritian); encouraging people to see the world from a new perspective (apple falling on Newton's head).Creating a curiosity gap at the beginning of presentation will make them want to hear more about the topic and be more focused. “To make our communications more effective, we need to shift our thinking from ""What information do I need to convey?"" to ""What questions do I want my audience to ask?” “The first problem of communication is getting people's attention.” “So, a good process for making your ideas stickier is: (1) Identify the central message you need to communicate—find the core; (2) Figure out what is counterintuitive about the message—i.e., What are the unexpected implications of your core message? Why isn’t it already happening naturally? (3) Communicate your message in a way that breaks your audience’s guessing machines along the critical, counterintuitive dimension. Then, once their guessing machines have failed, help them refine their machines.” “A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” “No plan survives contact with the enemy.” (War quotes)"

As a result, I've read a lot of books in this ""self-help-for-business"" genre. At this point, I sometimes feel like I've read all the advice before. This book pleasantly surprised me; all of it was engaging and entertaining as well as educational and thought-provoking. I learned something new and related the lessons back to my experiences with every turn of the page.In my full-time job, I create a lot of content. And I do that for a company that does something typically perceived as boring—insurance—in a way that is actually fundamentally different from everyone else. We have a business model and structure that is specifically intended to fix the things people hate about insurance, and we are purpose-driven and passionate. We have a story to tell, and a message that resonates with people when (if) we can do a good job of telling it. Working for a great company is the easy part (usually...). Making others understand—and care about—that greatness is the hard part.So many quotes hit home for me. Some are:""The hard part is weeding out ideas that may be really important but just aren’t the most important idea.""""People are tempted to tell you everything, with perfect accuracy, right up front, when they should be giving you just enough info to be useful, then a little more, then a little more.""""To make our communications more effective, we need to shift our thinking from 'What information do I need to convey?' to 'What questions do I want my audience to ask?'""""One important implication of the gap theory is that we need to open gaps before we close them. Our tendency is to tell people the facts. First, though, they must realize that they need these facts. The trick to convincing people that they need our message, according to Loewenstein, is to first highlight some specific knowledge that they’re missing.""I borrowed this book from the library, but I think I'm going to purchase a print version so I can re-highlight, dog-ear, and reference it later. It truly motivated me to go to work and try to put this advice into practice.No wonder this book is so widely read. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to pick it up!"
56,1400064287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17561595-jessica,4,"I was able to make good use of the strategies in the Heath brothers' Switch, so it took me far too long to pick up their first book (especially since I own a copy of it!). Their format is simple but effective — give you the steps to achieve a goal (in this case, to share a message that people will remember), and for each step, break it down into several possible angles and share memorable stories to illustrate each point. It got me thinking about everything from how to better share assessment results to how our organization, despite being mission-focused, has a mission that's too squishy to ensure that any two workers faced with the same decision would make the same choice.The downside to any book like this that's built around an explicit framework is that concepts and stories don't stay neatly in their boxes. It's not clear why, for example, re-framing a concept as a mystery falls under ""Unexpected"" and not ""Story,"" or why adding tangible details to a story is an example of ""Credible,"" not ""Concrete."" This meant that at times the book took too much of a stream-of-consciousness path, and the brothers didn't always follow their own advice to have a solid core. (I'm still not sure what definition of ""Unexpected"" is broad enough to encompass a textbook lesson that starts, ""What do you think Saturn's rings are made out of?"" and ends with the not-that-unexpected answer, ""Ice-covered dust!"")That said, the stories throughout the book by themselves make the book worth it, because as the authors say, the story contains the moral, but the moral doesn't contain any stories. Even if this isn't a foolproof six-step guide to influencing others, it's bound to provide you with inspiration in one area or another. Also, the insight about the Curse of Knowledge seems obvious but is vital to keep in mind.This book has enough solid takeaways that I'm happy to give it a place on my work shelf next to Switch, and I'll be thinking about what I can apply the next time I need to convey some information."
57,1400064287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,4,"I'll tell you up front: I didn't read this all the way through, but I skimmed the book for its main ideas. Most of the book, Made to Stick, is just an elaboration of what brothers Chip and Dean Heath call the SUCCESs model, making the book easily skimmable. SUCCESs stands for Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional Stories. Telling stories is about keeping them simple and on-message, but since our minds are attracted to novelty, there should be something unexpected about the story you tell, even if that means relaying unusual info about otherwise familiar objects, events, etc. Concreteness is about attaching the story you're telling to people or tangible objects, or if you can't do that--because you're talking about an abstract idea, say--then use a metaphor or simile for the big idea you want to talk about that will make the idea seem tangible. As for the final letters in the SUCCESs model, there's establishing your credible to get the audience to trust you know what you're talking about and there's appealing to emotion (as well as, of course, logic or reason).At the end of the book, the Heaths include an appendix where they give some barriers to the SUCCESs model that they felt like they left out in the first edition of the book. Here are two that resonated with me. First is what they call the curse of knowledge. This is where the storyteller knows more than his or her audience and so assumes more familiar with the topic than they do. There should be some testing at the beginning of a story to make sure your audience is on the same page as you. If you're uncertain, workshop it. That is, get the opinions of people you trust who are laypeople to see if they understand your story. Another barrier is the lack of a common language. This is related to the previous barrier, and, again, is about making sure that people can understand what you're talking about."

I expected more.This book is about getting your ideas to stick, but I'm not sure that the authors' messages stuck. I wrote them down, and I still have to check back and review their concepts.The book has useful points. However, the stories (anecdotes) they use to illustrate their concepts are dated and I've heard most of them before.I would have liked this book to have more practical exercises that would help us create our own sticky ideas. For example, unless you are completely new to this subject, you know that to get your message across you have to find the message's core -- the most important thing you need to communicate. Everything else is structured from your core message. Though the authors talk about the core message and give examples of some businesses' core messages in this book, they do not provide a practical exercise that will help you find your own core message. They tell you it is important you find it, but do not explain how. The most useful bit of information I found in this book about finding the core message is to keep asking ""Why?"" until there are no more ""Because--s"" left.This book would be way more useful if they used their knowledge to devise a workbook that would help you create your own sticky idea. Instead, my head is full of stories and abstract concepts that I have to translate into something practical on my own. This book has plenty of breadcrumbs, but I was hoping for a loaf.I would recommend this book to high-school students as an introduction. For anyone looking to go beyond the basics, this book is not for you.I borrowed the audiobook (great recording) from the Toronto Public Library."
59,1400064287,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43782327-christopher-rytting,3,"This book's language is facile and dully straightforward as, indeed, it aims to be. What makes for a boring read, though - for the syntactically and semantically hungry, anyway - proves to be a useful tool for getting our messages to ""stick"" instead of rattle off people's skulls and into the ether. Maybe it's time for language snobs of all shapes, sizes, and colors to get off their esoteric high horse, where nobody is paying them attention anyway, and hark. Anyway. I digress. Essentially, the authors claim that sticky ideas possess some combination of 6 characteristics, namely that they are:SimpleUnexpectedCredibleConcreteEmotionalStory(Just pretend for the sake of my construction's parallel integrity that the word Story is an adjective plz. I refuse any responsibility for this book's inconsistencies)I think I agree with most of what they've claimed. Heath and Heath provide a battery of statistics demonstrating that when a given idea is none of the aforementioned 6 ideas it basically stands no chance.I feel better when books like this prescribe some kind of field-relevant action for me to take in order to apply my new wisdoms. How does one incorporate the ""simple"" bullet in fiction, for example? Does one? I also wonder what Heath and Heath would say if I were to tell them that my favorite kind of thought is not simple, concrete, or story, because this kind of thought makes my blood pump and my breath quicken. Maybe, though, an exciting idea and a sticky one aren't always the same thing. In any case, worth skimming if you're in the business of selling ideas. And if you're not in the business of selling ideas, what are you in the business of?"
