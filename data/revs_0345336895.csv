0,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5022331-alex,3,"It's very hard to give a review and rating for the entirety of this book. From chapter to chapter it feels disjointed and varies quite a bit in both content and quality. I seem forced to review the different parts and chapters individually. The first ""part"" of the book, titled ""Science and Human Concern"" and encompassing the first four chapters, showcases Sagan's eloquent and brilliant writing especially well. In these chapters I learned new things and gained a new appreciation for Einstein's incredible mind; One would be hard-pressed to argue the book doesn't start off strong. The next part, called ""The Paradoxers"", starts of well enough, explaining and refuting various pseudoscientific and paranormal beliefs. But in chapter 7 Sagan spends over 50 pages refuting the claims made in a specific book called ""Worlds in Collision"" written by a specific author named Velikovsky. This would be fine if I were reading Broca's brain 30 years ago when it was published, but as it is I have never heard anyone repeating the ridiculous claims spouted by Velikovsky so I wasn't very interested in their refutations. I ended up skimming through most of the chapter. This is just one of the ways the book suffers from how dated it is. After this, part two continues with a couple good chapters, the first on theological arguments and second on science fiction. The next two parts of Broca's Brain are both mostly concerned with astronomy, space exploration, and humanity's future. They continue to vary in quality from a great chapter on Robert H. Goddard's tireless work towards space exploration to a terribly boring chapter on choosing namesakes for features of other planets. The final part skeptically examines religion and does a pretty good job until it ends with a chapter concerning hypothesis that explains religious stories and experiences in terms of subconscious memories of birth that's almost Freudian in its level of wild speculation. Broca's Brain is magnificent at times, but at times it's dense enough to make up for it, and overall it just felt too muddled for me to give it a very good rating."

I read it immediately after ""Cosmos"" was aired on Doordarshan (the national TV channel of India). Sagan is a great explainer - reading him will automatically engender a love for science!"
3,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,3,"A re-read after 13 years certainly was worth the effort for at least a few chapters. Although a lot of information must be now updated considering this being a 1979 (updated) edition, this book must have been intense at that time. An entire section is dedicated to debunking ""Paradoxers"" which occupies more than a quarter of the book, especially on Immanuel Velikovsky's theories.Certain introductory chapters dealing with ""Why Science?"", ""Albert Einstein"" and ""about the lack of public education in science"" were very nice to read.Other chapters that were interesting to read were related to The Solar System and the usage of Nomenclature within it; on life in our Solar System based on their atmospheres; a chapter based on the Surface and Atmosphere of Titan, the moon of Saturn; Climates of Earth and Mars; Asteroids and Meteorites; Planetary Exploration; Communication and Transportation Speeds; In defense of Robots and AI; the quest for Extraterrestrial Life; Views on God and Religion, our Galaxy and the Universe; and finally a chapter on the usage of psychedelic drugs and its usage to induce Perinatal Memories while relating it to understand the Origins and Nature of Religion and to Cosmology.If only Mr. Sagan have had lived today, I would have loved to read a revised edition of this book now after nearly four decades of its first publication in 1974."
4,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Considering this book was written forty years ago, it's a masterpiece. In it, Carl Sagan covers a range of different topics. In one whole chapter, which I think is the bulk of this book, Sagan makes a critical analysis of Velikovsky's book, Worlds in Collision. Sometimes the borderline between science and pseudoscience is so thin, you have to be a scientist to point it out. That being said, in most cases we can apply methods and tools of skepticism and critical thinking to come to a sound decision. Sagan wisely asserts that skepticism is not denialism or cynicism. It's just that you need to ask for sufficient evidence in case of extraordinary claims."
5,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1995871-jake,4,"Museums have an inner world that the public never sees. In one of these hideaways, Carl Sagan was permitted to view the brain of Paul Broca, a surgeon who died in 1880. As Dr. Sagan looked at the cerebral remains of one of his heroes, he had this thought: “It was difficult to hold Broca’s brain without wondering whether in some sense Broca was still in there.”Sagan wondered at a possible future where technology would allow us to download Broca’s memories. And then he wrote something that struck me. In considering the opportunity to literally read a mind, Sagan posited, “It would be the ultimate breach of privacy.”I was a bit awed at Sagan’s willingness to troubleshoot the ethics of his own pipedream. After all, what if we could tap the intelligence of brilliant men and women, now deceased? It’s a fascinating thought, but also a troubling one. I admired Sagan for volunteering the questionable nature of his own desire for access.The above is just one of many intriguing reflections offered by Carl Sagan in Broca’s Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science. This book is a collection of essays, many previously published in magazines. With a firm command of both science and humanity, Sagan explores a range of issues related to our existence. Especially engrossing, even haunting, are his ruminations on the process of dying. Sagan writes with candor about the issues facing our species. He does not patronize readers with comfort for comfort’s sake, but neither does he gravitate toward sensationalism. Sagan’s dialogue style is thoughtful and dignified, but with splashes of humor. He also throws some pointed jabs at absurd notions that regrettably retain traction in modern society. As our world becomes almost wholly dependent on scientific technology, works like this will be an essential frame of reference for laypersons. The more I read Sagan and others, the more I am convinced that being conversant in science is a matter of civic responsibility.With some technical exceptions, the content of this book is very accessible. For those who have already read other works by Carl Sagan, I highly recommend it. If you have not yet tried Sagan, I suggest starting with the novel Contact, or getting a hold of his groundbreaking work Cosmos. The latter is available on DVD and in book form. "
6,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1081965-jay,5,This should be a school textbook. The world would be a better place.
7,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31320014-rita,4,"It took me a lot more time than I expected, mainly because I kept checking for update information about most of the interesting topics. I still love Carl Sagan's writing though."
8,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1895570-jim,4,"I read most of Carl Sagan's Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science while I was in Guatemala in January. I had never read any of Sagan's work before, and rather like well-written popularizations of science. Some of the chapters were, however, well beyond my own knowledge; but I soldiered through them."
9,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/551453-william,3,"I've been on a Sagan kick, but this was a tough read to get through. The book is a little technical, but even more tedious in sections, discussing in depth discoveries of the 1950s and 1960s. The best parts of the book require a grasping understand of the nature of present day astronomy to compare and contrast with what Sagan thinks will occur. Ever the optimist, it is a little disappointing to realize that we have not come close to the explorations that Sagan envisioned in the late 1970s. Some of his hopes have been achieved, and he would have been awed by the discoveries made by the Cassini and Huygens probes, making this book bittersweet knowing that he will never have the opportunity to comment on today's discovery. A suggestion for future readers would be just to skip the vivisection of Dr. Velikovsky, unless you want an example of what would happen to the likes of homeopathy or astrology if scientists truly decided to turn their attention to those false disciplines."
10,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,2,"This book is a collection of essays, some dated and some that probably didn't belong in the first place. In the better essays, Sagan's love of science comes through, but reading Cosmos would deliver all of that and none of the fluff. 2½ stars at best."
11,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,2,"The science and mathematics text books that were used at my school time all started off with a little pledge that set out to instill in the young minds a scientific spirit. It spoke of endless curiosity, an investigative spirit and the willingness to observe and rework. I don’t remember the words nor the structure but I can remember looking at those pages in something like fondness for they were the only islands of difference in an otherwise droll sea of studies. The essays in Sagan’s book are a toast to this scientific mindset for he is an outspoken advocate of believing only after something is being proved beyond reasonable doubt. His writings in this book are reflections on varied topics including the lives of scientific greats, planetary wonders, the dangers of pseudo-science et al.Sagan as a writer does not disappoint with his style. He is never a high-brow scientist writer who mumbles away just for the benefit of his computer and to no one else. It would not be an exaggeration to say that I did begin to feel a lot more affinity to Science as a discipline after reading him and Feynman. That’s right folks ! School was the best way to discard Science in the badlands of my mind. He does cover a wide variety of topics in his writing and this did arouse curiosity in my mind. Sadly, this strength of Sagan is also the biggest undoing of this little book.The book suffers a serious problem in terms of its content (both in terms of being logically connected and also in terms of quality). After a couple of chapters I was left to wonder if Sagan ever meant this to be a book or whether the publishers cashed in on his popularity and swept in quite a few of his writings and hammered it into a shape that resembled a book. Earlier works of his that I have been acquainted with ( read Cosmos, Dragons Of Eden) have been logical and lucid in terms of their approach to the subjects. In here however, Sagan wanders all over the place. We jump right from Albert Einstein to circus freak-shows from one essay to the next. From the number of reviews in the site, it appears that there are quite a few folks who had no issues with such a style but for me it was a jumbled mass. Attention wanders as a result of this and I left the book much disappointed. Not one of his best !"
12,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3049744-daniel-gon-alves,4,"Carl Sagan instigates within me a deep will to know, to leave the myths that might reduce me to lurk in the shadows of deep-seated ignorance. I've read many of his books so far and they have all inspired me, they all served a specific purpose.This book followed the premise of all of the others and made me, in essence a better, wiser person."
13,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7553986-dan-debono,5,"One of the best books of all time. If this doesn't make you think (and wonder), your brain needs a jump start! Sagan is one of my all-time favorite human beings!"
14,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/286151-z,5,"""...we do not advance the human cause by refusing to consider ideas that make us frightened.""It's so odd to say that I miss Carl Sagan, and yet it's altogether true - I miss his wisdom, his wry humour, his empathetic presentation of hard-nosed science and constant questing and questioning of the world around us. Broca's Brain was published in 1979 and naturally some of the information in it is dated, although it only spurs the reader to research where the ideas eventually landed (Voyager 1 and 2, the exploration of Mars, using a solar sail to travel to Halley's Comet, for example). In totality, though, this collection of essays is timeless, reminding us of the vastness and magic of the universe and allowing us for a brief while to escape the mundanity of daily life.What would Sagan have to say about what we now know of Mars, and the Cassini-Huygens mission of 2004 to Titan, a moon close to his heart? About SARS-CoV-4? About the current crop of national leaders? One can only imagine... Thanks for the cosmic journey, Carl. The earth misses you!P.S. my answer to those ""which dead person would you invite to dinner"" sort of questions is always you."
15,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18782259-neeraj-adhikari,3,"Good collection of Carl Sagan essays. Most are on themes Sagan is well-known for writing. Perhaps it is foolish but I keep expecting to feel the same intensity of emotion and wonder I felt when reading Cosmos and keep getting disappointed.The most boring, and also the longest, chapter in this book was the debunking of the Velikovskian collision hypothesis. It was at times almost unbearable - to me, from my biased point of view in the future, the whole planet collision theory seemed outrageously absurd and nonsensical. It is understandable why Sagan had to dissect it carefully and in great detail, but including it in this book wasn't a great decision.And the bit on the last chapter about cosmological models coming straight from perinatal experiences, what was that? Too reminiscent of the crazy pseudoscientific stuff debunked in the first part of the book."
16,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51055891-j-crossley,4,"Although some of the book is dated since it was written in the early 1970’s, it was still an interesting book. It contains essays covering different topics. Although the ideas can be deep, Sagan is able to communicate the ideas to the masses. The title of the book comes from the opportunity Sagan had to hold the brain of one of his idols. He wondered if future scientific advances would allow us to be able to obtain the memories of a deceased person. He then goes on to say that it would be the ultimate invasion of privacy. I found it amazing that Sagan could look at the ethics involved in his theory. A portion of the book refutes current ideas and authors. By current i mean the early 70’s. This is the part of the book that is dated. "
17,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49288309-prakash-holla,5,"Re-read it....Carl Sagan arguably is one of the best writers on science specially astrophysics. Science and faith have always been at loggerheads since mankind started juxtaposing the two and it became the task of scientific analysers like Carl Sagan to argue, defend and convince the importance of scientific approach vi’s a vi’s the popular approach of faith which he does in this book lucidly.."
18,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82541063-isaac-carrada,4,"Even if it’s an “old” book lots of its contents still apply and arre useful for our contemporary times. Brilliant, as Carl Sagan always was "
19,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26552573-trevor,4,"This is one of Sagan's most eclectic works, covering a wide range of topics from Albert Einstein's political views and involvement to the hesitated acceptance of new scientific discoveries (the theory of relativity was repressed by Nazi Germany), the origins of life, and even the nomenclature of planets, craters and asteroids. This is really not a single book but five books in one package. Each major topic can be read independently. Sagan reveals early on in the book that the gist of this book can be understood by the common layperson. There several points which cover easily understandable subjects then awkwardly and unexpectedly transition into deeply technical speculations and mathematical proofs which are likely to be lost in translation by a reader who has insufficient background in astronomy or physics. There are several chapters that are dedicated entirely to the refutation of pseudo-scientific theories and there is an appendix at the end of the book which disproves a theory in even greater detail. Sagan reminds us, however, that ideas which seem incredulous should not be immediately repressed by the scientific community; many discoveries which we take for granted today, such as that the Earth is not the center of the universe, were considered blasphemous by the general consensus when they originated.Overall, there is a great deal of knowledge to be found in reading this book. Even for the common person, such as myself, who is not fully capable of keeping up with all of the technicalities Sagan presents, the majority of the material is presented in an accessible and often emotional manner which emphasizes the importance of scientific inquiry, skepticism, and humility. "
20,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233507-s-ach,3,"Carl Sagan could have been the most favourite science teacher I never had. The way he advocated the wonders and romances of science, it would have been extremely difficult for any of his students to opt for anything other than a deeper study of matter, the world and the universe. In his scientific discourse he never hesitated to interject his social, political and historical remarks, without fearing any controversies, and that made him one of the intrepid science exponents of all time. Broca's Brain is collection of his essays on myriad of subjects - from Einstein to Kabba, from views on science fiction to criticisms on his contemporaries. Each of the essays are independent of each other, and gives the flexibility to the reader to read the book in any sequence. Some of his essays, especially the ones where he criticized the views of some of his fellow scientists, are skippable though. My favoured ones are, obviously, where he discusses the position of science vis-à-vis the realm of religion. Clearly, he had the same position as I hold - that of an agnostic - ""To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed. A wide range of intermediate positions seems admissible, and considering the enormous emotional energies with which the subject is invested, a questing, courageous, and open mind is, I think, the essential tool for narrowing the range of our collective ignorance on the subject of the existence of God."""
21,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,3,"As a fan of Carl Sagan, this book is principally interesting because it appeared just before he ""went viral"" with his famous book Cosmos and the widely viewed TV series based on it. In Broca's Brain Sagan is at a transition between practicing scientist and the near-mythical popular science advocate he was about to become. Much of the science is dated—it's current to about 1975 or so—yet it is historically interesting to those tracking scientific development. And the chapter on ""robots"" is simply embarrassing due to his failure to predict the enormous advances in computing that were to occur within ten years of publication—but he wasn't alone in that regard: almost no one foresaw the emergence of Moore's Law.Alternatively, for readers wanting to access the more visible Sagan, I recommend Cosmos; for readers wanting the ultimate distillation of his beliefs and to experience his mind at its greatest, I cannot recommend too strongly The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark. That, his penultimate book, is one of the great ones of philosophical science."
22,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27348874-sagar-vibhute,5,"Carl Sagan is science's poet. I might read Broca's Brain a few times more just to immerse into his almost idyllic prose, not to mention that Carl Sagan has, in a masterful style, tackled a very difficult beast in this book, that of convincing the reader of what makes science tick.Science is a human endeavor, and so is susceptible to all the follies of our nature that plague our worldly pursuits. What makes science special is the very human agreement between its practitioners of putting evidence before faith, and facts before beliefs. A scientist might passionately pursue a question for ages and hypothesize an answer, but if confronted with a better solution will have to abandon his own in favor of the new one. It is this kind of brutal honesty that keeps science useful.But science is not only for the scientist, or the skeptics. It is for all of us! We all have a stake in understanding the world and having a chance to make the right choices and decisions in our everyday lives. We shouldn't be taking the word of a politician or a businessman on issues like global warming, pollution, deforestation and so many more, but be able to actually understand why we should take one side over the other.Science is not hard, in fact it is the only thing that is simple, because it doesn't bullshit to you. Please, please, please read this book to get an understanding of the beauty and romance of science!"
23,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701804-jay,3,"I really love Carl Sagan! His mission to popularize science is admirable and I thought that the Cosmos Series and the film Contact are both wonderful works. That being said... I found Broca's Brain to be quite interesting, but it doesn't hold together as one book. In particular, the chapter on Venus and Dr. Velikovsky was drawn out. Carl Sagan's reflections on the romance of science got bogged down in overly detailed arguments against Dr. Velikovsky's first book ""Worlds in Collision"". After reading more than 50 pages I thought I was reading a different book. All of the other chapters are much briefer and much more compelling. They can be read separately and virtually in any order. They stand or fall on their own merits. The topics are varied, though connected to the theme of popularizing and understanding science and its applications to the cosmos and the world in which we live."
24,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178754-kate,3,"Ultimately I found this a bit disappointing. I liked the descriptions of historical scientists, and some of the language was beautiful, but mostly the book just dragged. Sagan's dissection of Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision--a 55-page takedown of a now-obscure pseudoscience tract that I've never read and never hope to--was particularly punishing. I also felt that Sagan occasionally forgot he was supposed to be addressing lay audiences--either that, or my poor performance in high school geometry and physics has put me at more of a disadvantage than I realized.I'll probably keep reading Sagan's books, because I really enjoyed Cosmos and have been interested in hearing more from him for a really long time. I definitely enjoyed reading his thoughts on planetary exploration and the nature of the universe. However many I read, though, Broca's Brain will probably never be my favorite."
25,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51457273-two-readers-in-love,5,"Part of my five start rating is for the book itself, but a big part of my experience of ""Broca's Brain"" is inextricably tangled up with memories of sitting late at night at the kitchen table with my father when I was a teenager, discussing Sagan, the brain, and life itself. We didn't know then that my erudite, articulate father's future would involve a fall and a chronic brain injury that would profoundly affect Wernicke's area and his ability to read and communicate. Much of the neuroscience in this book now seems outdated, but Sagan's way of communicating the science, and more importantly, his way of drawing out new science readers' own curiosity and thinking, is evergreen. Knowing my father's thoughts on the brain, the mind, and the self helped me accept the inherit indignities of his later situation, and be more flexible about the concept of the 'self' that this was all 'happening to'. Thank you Carl Sagan."
26,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8369129-john,3,"Because the collection of material here is so eclectic, there is no over-arching theme or narrative. Consequently, While I really enjoyed some parts, breezing through them in a heartbeat, others were a little more tedious -- I just didn't find them particularly interesting.However, it's still Carl Sagan, and even when the subject matter isn't particularly engaging, his writing style is. I couldn't read a single line of Broca's Brain without hearing it spoken in his voice. :)I would recommend it to Sagan fans, or those with a passing interest in the evolution of science, scientific method, and how science can be subject to abuse and/or misuse. But I think most casual readers would be turned off by the disjointed presentation of the various subjects covered."
27,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,4,"This is a collection of essays, all somehow related to science. I read it over the course of several months - not because it wasn't interesting, but because sometimes I just wasn't in the mood for it. The articles on skepticism and the history of science were fascinating, but the later descriptions of the ""current"" situation in astronomy and planetary science was more than a touch dated. (It was written in the 1970s.) All the same, it was still Sagan, and I do so enjoy reading Sagan. I look forward to his other works. "
28,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182695-james-morrison,5,I read the reviews here and they seemed mixed. I loved the book and thought it was both informative and well written. By well written I mean he kept my interest and presented some technical subjects in a way that was easily understood by a novice. If you have an interest in science I think you will like this one. 
29,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,3,"This is simply a collection of essays written by Sagan over a number of years and published in a variety of popular magazines.

33,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626390,5,"A great book by Sagan. It explores a variety of science related topics like science teaching, pseudo-science and the necessity to face and respond to its advocates publicly, etc."
34,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"Albert Einstein said that, “The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.” Carl Sagan definitely subscribed to this belief. He was fascinated by the universe and everything it in.This book is named to honor Pierre Paul Broca. He was a French physician who is best known for his research on Broca's area. This is a region of the frontal lobe that is involved with language. Through language humans can communicate. We share our knowledge and history but also our fears and concerns. Sharing what we do not know is at least as important as sharing what we do know or, actually, what we think we know.This book was written in 1975. A lot of the science in this book has been augmented, changed, added to, or replaced since it was published forty-five years ago. However, Sagan’s enthusiasm for science, for investigation, for understanding, and most of all, for questioning has successfully survived the decades.I like to describe science as the organized process of creating two or more questions where only one existed before. It is all about questioning what we know and trying to know more. No falling back on “common knowledge” or “tradition” but constantly pushing forward into the unknown. The universe is vast and the questions contained in it far more that any of us will answer in our lifetimes. Sagan glorified in this quest.Many of the chapters about space exploration were decades out of date but still contained good concepts. I particularly loved the section on Ultimate Questions. Sagan was often asked if he believed in god. His answer was to ask the questioner, what is your definition of god? Most people were unable to give anything near of a coherent answer. For him, it was not a question of whether or not god existed but exactly what was it you were defining. Thinking is about questioning, not believing something on “faith”.Let us face it, life is both difficult and scary and what we do not know is far greater than what we do know. Thunder and lighting, when we are sitting in the dark, is terrifying. We want a quick answer, something to believe in so that can stop being afraid. Unfortunately, quick answers are usually wrong. It is the willingness to sit with our fear and uncertainty that leads to discovery. Realizing that the Earth is not the center of the universe pushed humans down a great number of pegs in their self estimation. The big question is; are we strong enough, questioning enough, and desiring of knowledge enough to seek the answers."
35,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80831211-patrick-kelly,4,"An interesting book. Ever filled with the philosophy of the world, the universe, and science, that I love Sagan for. This book was a bit scattered and rambling. He went from topic to topic, often with little connection. He has deep scientific sections discussing planets, which are fascinating. His talks about extraterrestrials is as always optimistic and realistic at the same time. He makes it seem finding extraterrestrial life, so simple yet impossible. There is a is a big section that he spends refuting some ones book. The book seems absurd and I am not sure why Sagan spent so much time on it. It may have a been a personal/professional issue. He briefly talks about the expansion of the universe, the Big Bang, and the cosmological constant, which are subjects that I rarely hear him talk about. I have to keep remembering that Sagan was writing in the 70’s because we did not have PC’s, the internet, and many space probes had not been launched yet. Some of these things would come in his life time and he would play a role in them. It’s wonderful to see knowledge grow in his life and Sagan have a greater understanding of the universe. There are times that I wish he were alive to see the growth of the internet, to see the great advances in technology and science. Other times I am happy he is not here to see the detriments of these technologies and the destruction of the planet that he tried to warn us about. As is so common he saw things before most of us. There is a fascinating section on the AI and the threats and benefits that it poses. He talks about how it will displace jobs and wondering what he should do with those workers. He also starts to talk about our trauma from birth and gets into some psychological freudian shit. A great line is about religion ‘a body of belief can not be alive and growing if it can not survive the most serious criticism thrown at it. The first amendment encourages diversity of religions but does not prohibit criticism of religion.’Sagan was an atheist but also a curious scientist, he states that ‘if there were an afterlife he would love to experience it, even if just to learn more.’This was a good book with great sections but lacked the aw and cohesiveness of other Sagan works.

36,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69348187-xavier,3,"Broca's Brain by Carl Sagan is a series of essays that touch upon different aspects of science. Some topics range from the expansion of the universe, religion versus science, short biographies on scientific figures and the different dangers posed by pseudoscience.There are a total of 25 chapters and I thought some of the essays were a bit dry and too long for my liking. One chapter was particularly long (about 50-something pages) and was a slog to read through. Carl picks apart the claims of another scientist who believes that events described in certain religious text (Great Flood or the splitting of Red Sea, etc) can be proven to be true by scientific means. While it was cool to see Sagan rip this hypotheses apart with this own wit and knowledge I ended up skimming through the rest of the pages.Sagan usually does a fantastic job writing for the layman and making complicated topics easy to read and relate to but in Broca's Brain the writing can go from easy to difficult in a matter of paragraphs. This made some passages hard to keep up with. However some other essays were an absolute joy to read! I particularly enjoyed the chapters about Albert Einstein and Robert H. Goddard. Those piqued my interest and persuaded me to learn more about them. Another chapter spoke on the process of how the nomenclature of the different planets and of their craters and mountains were chosen. The fact that Uranus was almost named George was hilarious! In the chapter ""Science Fiction: A Personal View"" he speaks on how the science-fiction stories of his youth helped start the spark for his love of science. It was nice to gain some insight into Carl's childhood.Overall I enjoyed the book although it certainly wasn't my favorite. There are a handful of chapters I would go back to and reread but overall I found the book on some days a chore to read through."
37,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4304479-iain,4,"“MUCH OF HUMAN HISTORY can, I think, be described as a gradual and sometimes painful liberation from provincialism, the emerging awareness that there is more to the world than was generally believed by our ancestors.” Carl Sagan through his entire career and through his writing lived and breathed this sentiment. The wonders of our immense universe, the deep questions, the journey into the unknown. In Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science published in 1979 is actually a series of essays that Sagan wrote between 1974 and 1979. In this collection he Sagan examines the paradoxes and pseudo sciences that attempt to challenge science and replace it with false idols and certainty, which he challenges with, “I believe that the extraordinary should certainly be pursued. But extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” Furthering his argument with, “Science is based on experiment, on a willingness to challenge old dogma, on an openness to see the universe as it really is.” The exploration and naming of celestial bodies within our universe is looked at and the importance of science fiction as an inspirational platform to launch the young into the fields of scientific discovery. Carl Sagan definitely puts together a fascinating reading list for the reader. In the final section of the book, ""Ultimate Questions."" Sagan writes:...My deeply held belief is that if a god of anything like the traditional sort exists, our curiosity and intelligence were provided by such a god...on the other hand if such a god does not exist then our curiosity and intelligence are the essential tools for survival. In either case the enterprise of knowledge is essential for the welfare of the human species.Another Carl Sagan classic.  "
38,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19228856-sanchit-agarwal,5,"Definitely willing to start a petition to make this book a compulsory read at all schools.This is a book that so accurately justifies the term 'Romance of Science' because that is what it is.It's a love letter from one of the brilliant minds in the world to the one artform he owes his life to. Science, when illustrated by Carl Sagan goes beyond simply facts and theories and concepts to vague to be taken seriously. No, Sagan loves science. This is reflected in each and every sentence in the book, where Sagan so masterfully explains to the layman all of what is Science and Technology and Modernism and the Evolution of mankind.And he does that by not just simply throwing scientific jargon and facts at your face, but by presenting evidences and opportunities and threats to what each and every topic of research in the Sciences holds in store for humanity. Be it discussing AI or Astral projections or worldwide superstitions, Sagan takes all of these topics in the very seriousness as he would take perhaps the origin of the universe or the Theory of Relativity.The book was a heartwarming reminder for me why I chose to pursue the Sciences in the first place and how the ‘Romance’ of it probably got lost in the way.Give this to a kid and I swear he’d dream of nothing else but to be a Scientist as and when he grows up. "
39,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35643641-andr-s-astudillo,5,"Broca's Brain... a little bit of every little thing. Carl Sagan delights us with many essays, concerning many issues. There are robots, human evolution, intelligence, sci-fi novels, fundamentalism and religion... there are also many questions. Once again he manages to deeply explain topics in the most accesible way. At one point, he dedicates to literary criticism: Immanuil Velikovski and his novel ""Worlds in collision"". Sagan manages to explain what really happened in order to let people know that many times, unsuccessful ideas come disguised in pseudo-scientific discussions. If you want to know how stars, moons and comets are named, he explains that too.At times it got a bit too dense, and also the annexes throw off some big-ass equations... to sum up, this one is amazing. But to me, aside mathematics or radio wavelength, his magic comes when he starts reflections (ironically) concerning God, science and human civilization future. "
40,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64503769-fer,4,"Book was written before internet; but it gives the impression you are reading an online blog. The book tittle has its roots in Paul Broca, a French neurosurgeon and anthropologist who was fond in studying human beings. He collected a wide range of skulls. At that time (1840’s), Sagan narrates that the study of humans in France was considered a dangerous subject. Sagan explain that Paul Broca is best known for his discovery of a small region “in the left frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, a region now known as Broca’s area”. Further studies connect specific brain functions with specific sections in the brain, including a link-activity between the anatomy of the brain and its performance known as “mind”. On this basis, Sagan explain some science misconceptions on several chapters, that goes from the universe to religion and alien life."
41,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89147505-pandit,4,"Sagan was a childhood hero of mine, and gave me a lifelong love of science. I read and watched Cosmos several times. I read Boca's brain as an 18 year old and treasured it.In my later years I came to realise just how wrong Sagan was about many things. Well, he is a popularizer after all, not really a research scientist. re-reading the book, it lost some of it's wonder. This book is a 'collection' of essays (blogs we'd now call them) journeying through science, from grains of salt, black stars worshipped by African tribes, to telescopes. For the most part the stories are still relevant, and thought provoking. Sagan might not be a adulthood hero of mine, but he does always do a good and sincere job. "
42,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16193091-michael,4,"A collection of essays centered on science, especially discussions on cosmology and astronomy. The subjects vary from a background piece on Einstein to an interesting piece that compares discussions of those who return from the dead to the birth experience. Some pieces are typical only for the 70s such as the evaluation of Velikovsky's nonsense (my words... Sagan is too fair-minded for this opinion.) The section on climate change needs updating, lest it become ballast for those who might use it for their irresponsible agenda of denial, but that of course isn't going to happen. Listening to it, I can imagine how the oil industry would love to use it to express doubt about the obvious findings on how the environment suffers from the human footprint."
43,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2269692-mark,4,"In the first couple of chapters Sagan strongly and convincingly pushes back against so much of the pseudo-scientific dribble going in the 1970's (and earlier) when the book was written, just as he does in the ""Demon-Haunted World"" later in the 1990's, much of which still goes on today and which can be detrimental in so many ways. Later chapters include interesting accounts and reviews of the state of astronomy research in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, along with predictions of the future state of astronomy and planetary science and exploration (which have subsequently been shown to be accurate and have come to pass since the publication of this book in the mid-1970's)."
44,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312898-ben,4,"Good, but where I expected Sagan’s broad scientific passion and astronomic expertise to spend some time scouting the science of neurology and linguistics, instead this was more a bunk-extermination patrol which spends a large fraction of its effort deflating Worlds in Collision by Immanuel Velikovsky, an Israeli scholar attempting to invent scientific rationalizations for events of the Torah/Old Testament. It’s an admirable goal, but it hasn’t stayed relevant in its details the way, for example, The Dragons of Eden has.Given a little more thought, the current value of Sagan addressing an absurd and outdated book is that he demonstrates how to do it while minimizing his own prejudice, steel-manning his opponent’s position."
45,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26237700-johanna-leo,2,"This book started off great and I had really high hopes for it, but progressively got worse. The writing style is really good, but I'm not so sure about the content. After the huge chapter on Velikovsky, it got really hard for me to get back on track with this book. I managed, but it just was meh. I do want to read more by Sagan, but maybe this particular book just did not cut it for me. It was really hard to rate this because the book feels disjointed and simply doesn't flow smoothly, and I think it would have caught my attention a lot more if that had not been an issue. The book was really good on some chapters, but on others, way too dense for me to stay interested. I'd say 2.5 stars."
46,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86359100-jacob-landis,3,"Definitely not as good as Cosmos or Dragons of Eden. I think both of those books are almost must reads and they cover very different subjects. Belva’s Brain doesn’t have its own subject. Cosmos is a classic that made me so excited about science. Carl Sagan’s passion for science and astronomy is contagious. Dragons of Eden explores the evolution of the human species and ties present day challenges to perinatal experiences and the evolution and growth of the brain. This book has a little too much of everything. If a reader has not read Sagan before, they would probably enjoy this book a great deal. But it’s not his best and seems to skim the surface of his other two more well-known books. "
47,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5807484-talal,4,"I love reading Sagan, especially after some Feynman. The book was just eloquent in its explanations and discussions of the biggest questions we can think of - the future, the scientific method, and the universe. The only part that felt like it dragged on were his chapters on the refutation of the apocalypse theory of some pseudo-scientist. To be fair, Sagan did pick him apart piece by piece. I highly recommend it. "
48,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74777457-emir,5,"Absolutely impressive. Sagan guides you through the scientific view and his ideas throughout the book while supporting his views in a classy way against pseudoscientific ideas of the time. It is impossible not to notice how accurately Sagan predicted the future almost 40 years ago, ironically though the most impressive part of his book is not the one about his field but his views about humans' perinatal experiences."
49,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26619092-adrian,4,"3.75/5 starsThere were some really really great chapters, but there were some wherein I was just lost. That chapter about the colliding worlds theory for example, although that was pretty amusing.It took me 2 months to finish this because I just hid it in our uni's library and I read other books in between but I never for one second regret taking this long to read it. If I had rushed it, I wouldn't have understood at that time what Carl Sagan was trying to say."
50,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11232235-daniel,3,"In my view, this is one of Dr Sagan's weakest for two main reasons. Firstly​, considering it was written​ in the late seventies, it didn't age that well regarding scientific advances accomplished since. Secondly, he engaged in profound debate with a couple of charlatans on several chapters, which isn't always an interesting thing to read because of the specific matter discussed might have been burried years past now."
51,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65300063-hayden-reed,2,"Despite being ~presumably~ agnostic, Mr. Sagan seems religiously devoted to the enlightened western Holy Trinity: Science, Reason, and Progress. These are great tools, but they make for poor gods.More condescending and less insightful than ""Dragons of Eden"", I was expecting something similar and was a bit disappointed.Nonetheless, Carl Sagan was a brilliant and respectable man, even if this book didn't quite do it for me."
52,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50325642-inas,5,"Currently re-reading Sagan's works after first falling in love with his writings two decades ago. Growing up, Sagan's books made me fall in love with science and astronomy. I especially liked his critical analysis and counter arguments of Velikovsky's theories.I wish books like this would be part of the science curriculum in schools!"
53,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36645977-craig,3,First 3 or 4 chapters and the chapter towards the end about science and religion (The Sermon) were outstanding. Everything else in between was interesting. The average person (me) has no concept of the depth of knowledge that existed 40 years ago (or even 40 years before that!) I found myself wishing someone had added footnotes to describe where we are today on versus when this book was written.
54,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63720524-rachel-umansky,5,"Carl Sagan never disappoints. This is one of his earlier collections of writings and lectures published in the seventies while he was a professor at Cornell. Not every chapter was top-tier, but he sandwiched the book with two of the greatest chapters of any book ever. So profound, so moving, and utterly awe-inspiring. "
55,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87513860-sawyer-bernath,4,"If you like Sagan, or are interested generally in science or space, I recommend this. There are a few chapters that are quite out of date, but even then it's interesting to hear Sagan's thoughts on his contemporary situation. The best chapters verge on revelatory. I plan to go back to parts of this book throughout my life to reignite my passion for science and for the human enterprise."
56,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7829004-marick,2,"Many essays in this book would've been much more enjoyable to read at their time of publication. Reading them today, however, many feel extremely outdated and at times irrelevant (that unending Velikovsky chapter, I'm looking at you). "
57,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12700288-paul,3,Cheerful and exuberant but nothing substantial. One chapter is literally spent rebuffing claims by a crazy guy. I understand the principle at stake explained by the author but it's a waste of my time (which is why people don't bother doing that!).
58,0345336895,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324316-rob-christopher,4,He's so optimistic. It makes one wistful.
