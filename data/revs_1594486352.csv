0,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"I loved this book. I want to give it 10 stars just for the sheer enjoyment of reading it. It's so well written, well-researched and beautifully, tightly edited. It was a real experience reading it. The book scientifically explores bird behaviour and culture, if you define culture as something an individual or group have preferences they choose, or something that is learned rather than instinctive. Bower birds are an example. Although birds of the same species build very similar bowers and decorate them in more or less the same way, various individuals or groups might choose to use use certain artefacts that another group nearby would ignore. This was tested with pretty poker chips. One group went nuts about them and were forever stealing them from each other to decorate their bowers, another group totally ignored them and preferred stones and sticks! In the area tested by Jared Diamond (view spoiler)[before he became famous for Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (hide spoiler)] there were two groups of birds. One, who is described in the book as having ""Gothic tastes"" like black and brown stones and sticks and weren't at all tempted by the pretty poker chips. The females didn't fancy the males who had colourful bowers. These two sets of birds are of exactly the same species. But given time, the se non-interbreeding populations would probably diverge and, over thousands of years, evolve into different species that could not interbreed. Is this culture - art - driving evolution?So how do we define art? Like everything else to do with animals and science, where once we were certain that animals did this and humans did that and therein lies the difference, we are no longer certain at all. Think of tools, then it was discovered that not only primates use tools, so do birds and other species. Farming is carried on, both raising livestock and vegetation by ants. So why not the ability to produce and appreciate art for it's beauty by birds?Every single behaviour the author examines in birds, he relates to evolution and people. I love that. I've never understood the non-evolutionists horror of our closest relatives being apes. I like the idea just as much that what we do isn't even original although we think it is, but that birds do it too, and we are all part of one great big interlinked world."
1,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10600325-zola,4,I can't even handle that Noah Strycker is my age and he's already written two books about birds I AM WASTING MY LIFE
2,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3,5,"Author Noah Strycker is not someone to sit back and enjoy birds from a distance. He’s trekked within a few feet of a mating albatross pair, grabbed hold of penguins to attach GPS tags, and as a teenager he brought home a roadside deer carcass in his trunk, which filled his car with such an overwhelming stench that even at 65 miles an hour he had to drive with his head hanging out the window, just so he could could get close up photos the of turkey vultures as they feasted on gore for a week in his backyard. As both a field scientist and bird enthusiast Strycker has lots of fascinating information and personal stories about birds for this book, as anyone who was anywhere near me while I was reading knows since it was impossible not to share (sorry family and friends). Each chapter focuses on the wonders of a particular bird, including homing pigeons, mummerating starlings, fighting hummingbirds, self aware magpies, and architecturally gifted bowerbirds, but from there the discourse spreads out to include such topics as neuroscience, the definition of art, game theory, memory palaces, altruism, the fight or flight response, and what unique species qualities are left to humans (a diminishing list). There were just a few stories I found disturbing, like the one about his friend who hates non-native starlings so much he relishes shooting them with an air gun, clipping their wings, and feeding them disabled but alive to hawks (which Strycker reported as a field scientist neither condemning nor applauding), but those are the exception. Most of the book totally enthralled me with wonderful birds, vicarious birding adventures, and thoughtful commentary."
3,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127767-coral,4,"I love birds and really enjoy learning about them, especially about bird behavior, so it was with great excitement that I agreed to review this book. And overall, it is enjoyable and educational, full of interesting facts and anecdotes, not only about birds but about numerous other animals, including humans. I was disappointed, though, to see a scientist, who so lovingly describes bird behavior with a great eye for detail and nuance, fall back on unflattering generalizations about female humans, such as his statement that ""males with more possessions and creativity are generally more likely to attract women"" and some evolutionary biological discussion of men and women having been ""segregated in their work,"" leading to a lack of fight-or-flight impulse in the latter. These statements were unnecessary, insulting, and distracting. Without them—and a fair number of unnecessary ""he""s when referring to scientists—this would have been a really fantastic book. "
4,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,4,"This could have been titled Birds and Philosophy. Noah Strycker illustrates interesting behavior in the bird world, and compares it with human behavior. Sometimes it's unexpected behavior, other times it's downright startling. As we learn more about what makes other creatures tick, it gets harder to pin down what makes us different, what makes us human.The male bower bird, for instance, spends ten months a year building, decorating, and perfecting an nest-like area that only serves to impress potential mates. Once the female bower bird has been sufficiently impressed by the male's building and decorating accomplishments, they mate, then she flies off to build her own nest and raise her chicks on her own. The male continues to work on his bower, and may mate with a dozen female bower birds per season. Since there's no apparent practical value in the bower itself, one wonders, is it art? Magpies can recognize themselves in a mirror, unlike other birds, and most mammals. Does this mean they have a sense of self, that they can recognize their reflections outside of themselves?Nutcrackers have amazing memories, recalling hundreds of locations where they've stored seeds for the winter. Having eliminated smell, luck, and some kind of marking system as methods of finding the seeds, researchers are convinced the nutcrackers memorize where the seeds are much the same way we would, by relying on landmarks and other patterns to remember.When birds and animals exhibit behavior that we typically think of as human, it's difficult not to anthropomorphize. Strycker keeps this to a minimum, but does occasionally make cutesy comments about the birds. And when it came to albatrosses, who mate for life, he was quite lyrical about romantic love. On the other hand, I learned quite a lot about birds. I recently watched a PBS Nature show about hummingbirds. It was a fabulously photographed hour of the tiny birds, but I learned more about them from one chapter in The Thing With Feathers than in that whole program. Fascinating book on birds, and also about what it means to be human.(Thanks to NetGalley and Riverhead Books for a review copy.)"

6,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,4,"This was a fairly light, entertaining read crafted by an ornithologist who has a flair with words about birds. Strycker keeps things fairly light, and although he gets into some incredible scientific studies about our feathered friends, never goes beyond the abilities of his average reader.The book is structured into chapters that start with some personal anecdote about a particular bird species behavior, which the author then explores by discussing scientific research on the subject. He is always able to relate some of the aspects of the bird behavior to our own human behavior at some level, which makes things interesting without going too far into anthropomorphism.I have had a particular fondness of corvids (crows, magpies, nutcrackers, etc.) the last few years, as the more I see of them in my semi-rural neighborhood, while hiking or camping, the more I admire their intelligent resourcefulness. Strycker spends a fair amount of time on these birds, due to their incredible intelligence, but he also explores for us: the homing abilities of pigeons, the pecking-order social hierarchies of chickens, and even the long-haul monogamy of the long-haul flying albatross.This is well worth the read if you are at all interesting in animal intelligence or have a fondness for birds."
7,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1423789-charlie,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It wasn't trying to make any earth-shaking points, and most of the science was probably basic for people with a strong interest in ornithology. Still, it often had me exclaiming over what I read and wanting to share it with others. A Dickinson allusion in the title can't help but make a former English teacher smile as well. Strycker does a great job of mixing science facts, philosophical musings, and personal anecdotes to create a compelling read. I would have liked the various sections to connect to each other a bit more, but that's a tall order for a book of this type. The chapters on humming birds and bower birds were particularly revelatory for me. I wouldn't say they did anything to change my view of the world beyond showing that it's even more wondrous than I knew, or of humanity. That makes the subtitle seem a bit overblown, but people have to make a living. I would recommend this for people who like personal essays in the style of Annie Dillard (minus God), people who have feelings, people who like evolution, and people who think birding would be interesting if it didn't require going to inconvenient places at inconvenient times and holding really still for long stretches."
8,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26433844-ashley-seymour,5,"I really enjoyed this book. If you are even remotely interested in bird behavior, I highly recommend it. or human and other smart animal behavior b/c he covers it all- art, love, memory, etc. Did you know the Aztec god of war was a hummingbird? If you read this book, you will know why. So good! "
9,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112265-katie,4,"Each chapter in this book focuses on a certain bird behavior, most often that of a particular species, and explores that behavior in depth while relating it to human behavior and psychology. All of the chapters were interesting, and about half were incredibly fascinating. I think what I found most interesting is how different bird species have evolved different types of intelligence and behaviors both in ways we don't understand and for reasons we don't necessarily understand. I'm really amazed by the navigation abilities of many species of birds, even when they are deprived of certain senses and intentionally disoriented by scientists. Even though I'm not a huge fan of starlings, their flocking and flying instincts are incredible. (Do a YouTube search for ""starling murmuration"" if you have never seen it.) I loved reading about all the intelligent behaviors of magpies and crows and that whole family. The nests that male bowerbirds build to woo females are amazing. (Again, do a google image search if you haven't seen these displays.) I really like the mating/courting/child rearing rituals of albatross. Overall, the book was really accessible and easy to read. I found that it went into just enough detail so that I learned a lot, but I wasn't bored or overwhelmed with too much information. "
10,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11035839-sylvia,5,"My step-daughter gave this to me for my birthday. I wasn't sure I would like it and would never have chosen it to read. But I read it and it is wonderful. The author has been intrigued with birds since he was a child which resulted in his passion. His book explores a variety of birds with characteristics that are common to humans. The bowerbird is especially interesting. Is it an artist? It's courting behavior certainly is artistic. I first learned of this bird at an exhibit at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, MA. A human artist paints pictures of the bowerbird's very artistically arranged bowers. And then there is their are the birds who mate for life and have been seen caressing their beloved. (A couple of years ago I was following the Virginia Eagle Cam. The female got hit by a plane and her mate definatly mourned her passing. It was so, so sad to watch.)"
11,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9113276-patricia,5,"A fascinating and well researched book studying the behaviors of specific bird species and the linkages to human behaviors. I was more interested in the birds than in the human aspects. Pigeons were analyzed for their remarkable homing instincts. As we know they have been used during wars to relay messages. They have been transported worldwide, released, and find their way home with incredible speed.Starlings are not indigenous to the U.S; they were introduced from Europe where many flocks are nearly extinct. They flock for protection, have acute spacial acuity, and conduct ""murmuration"" where they flock and fly across the sky in beautiful patterns. Turkey Vultures have a sense of smell but also need visual cues to find carrion. They smell mercaptans added to natural gas to give it a noxious odor and the bird often senses this as some type of decaying carcass.Snow Owls become nomads outside their normal habitats when lemming food supplies become scarce. They seem to gravitate to Boston and the Midwest in their search for food. Ebird.org is a data driven organization for tracking bird migration, unusual sightings, etc. by ornithologists. Hummingbirds are extremely territorial in the protection of their food source. In the average lifespan their hear beats 1.26 billion times. They do not mate for life. They rest at night by slowing their heart rate down to 50 beats/minute from 1200 in flight.Penguins have a fear of going into the ocean because of seals lurking waiting to eat them. Otherwise they seem to be quite trusting and have little fear of humans, etc. Parrots (and Asian elephants) have the ability to sense a beat in music. I loved the stories of Snowball and Frostie the dancing cockatoos on YouTube. Bird Lovers Only is a rescue shelter caring for neglected birds.Chickens have a hierarchy ""pecking order"" in a coop which rarely is challenged. Outsiders need to be introduced in pairs. The color red stimulates aggressive behavior in chickens. Nutcrackers have an amazing memory for thousands of locations where they hide buried seeds. Their memory is facilitated by physical cues in the landscape. Remove the cues and they are far less successful in finding their seeds.Magpies were exceptionally interesting. They are the world's smartest bird and among the top in the animal kingdom. They have self-awareness, self-recognition in a mirror, exhibit grieving, teasing, taunting, friendship and theft.Bowerbird is known for the males to design aesthetically pleasing and visual nests. The concept of what is art and how is it defined was explored. They have the ability to create forced perception of objects (stones, shells, plastics, etc) for their female visitors. The elaborate ground nests are created for courtship.Fairy-wrens are cooperative for the greater good and vast genetically related communities support generations of offspring. They are altruistic.Albatross mate for life yet independently travel about four million miles worldwide during their life time. They find their mate every one to three years. A very fun, educational read."
12,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23428788-john-kaufmann,4,"A gem. This book isn't just a dry book about bird behavior. Rather, it is about human behavior, via what we know about birds; it is about what bird behavior can teach us about human behavior, and how what we know about humans can explain various bird behaviors. The author isn't just a bird expert; he appears to be very well versed in various disciplines such as evolution, brain science, and game theory.Each chapter deals with a different bird species and a defining behavioral characteristic. For example, one chapter was about magpies and self-awareness; magpies are one of the few birds/animals that can pass the mirror test. Another was about the Australian fairy-wren, which share nests and help raise each other's young; the author includes an excellent discussion of what we have learned about game theory to explain what is otherwise an evolutionarily inexplicable behavior.The book includes chapters about pigeons and sense of direction; starlings and spontaneous (emergent) order to explain the synchronous flying of starling flocks (""murmurations""); penguins and (lack of) fear; nutcrackers and memory; albatrosses and love, among others. Along the way are many interesting facts and factoids about birds, but more it is a book about ecology, evolution, psychology, social order, and brain science. "
13,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/792844-angie,2,"My, the incredibly terrible things we do to animals in the name of ""science."" Lots of great stories about things like the clipping of magnetic nerves in pigeons to see if they can find their way home afterwards. Or stabbing vultures in the eyes to blind them to see if they have a sense of smell. Or you can just stuff something into their nares to see if it affects their search for food. Or just, you know, shooting a snowy owl just because it happened to land on a landing strip in Hawaii. Or you just shoot a bunch of them because you want to take the carcasses back and show them to people.That being said, there are other interesting stories about observation of bird behaviour without interference from man. Those were awesome and highly interesting.My favorite parts of the book were Noah Strycker's bird illustrations that appear at the beginning of each chapter."
14,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716223-julie,5,"Alright - all of you bird nerds - here's a book for you. It's educational, entertaining and filled with great facts to use at your next bird watching event or Trivial Pursuit game. Divided into three sections - Body, Mind and Spirit, Noah Strycker takes a look at 13 different bird species and provides information about a certain aspect of each of them them. He then compares that information to studies done on the same topic in humans - hence the subtitle of the book. It provides for a book that makes you think (and laugh a bit along the way) while you grab your birding glasses to go see for yourself. If you have any interest in birds, I highly recommend this book. And - if you ever decide to call me a bird brain - I'll take that as a huge compliment. Enjoy!"
15,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2426667-drew,4,I was fortunate enough to attend two lectures by Noah Strycker at the Othello Sandhill Crane Festival this year. He's a dynamic speaker and is able to translate his speaking style into his writing. This book was fascinating and fun to read. It even made me more sympathetic to the starlings nesting in the tree next to my patio. This is a great read for anyone who is even marginally interested in birds and the natural world.
16,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,5,"The Thing with Feathers is a book of stories about birds that you never knew and never expected, stories about the abilities of vultures and starlings and snowy owls and hummingbirds and penguins and parrots and nutcrackers and magpies and bowerbirds and fairy helpers and albatrosses, and all the surprising things they can do. If you want to know more about birds, you probably want to add this book to your list."
17,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/707579-marija-s,4,This is one of those intelligent and informative books that talk about everything in a conversational tone with just the right amount of philosophical reflections.
18,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2533905-jen,4,"Writing was a bit disjointed, but I learned a lot of nifty things."
19,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25898891-r-k,2,"ugh.........This book was so dull that I felt sleepy after reading it and delayed my review for it.I read halfway then skimmed the rest..Here's the thing, this book is not bad in itself, rather it's just that it's audience is different. Basically, if you're someone who really loves birds/animals, respects them, know quite a few scientific facts about them, know what threatens them, knows the common facts about them, then this book is NOT for you!Another thing is that this book is very structured. Strycker splits the books into some 4-5 segments. Each segment are divided into chapters that focus on one bird. Each chapter begins with some real life experience. The first half of the middle is bird info. The second half is human info. Conclusion is the end result of the real life experience. It got boring and repetitive real fast. So if you're someone who hates rules, regulations, structure (like me), you're going to loathe this book.Finally, the chapters focuses on some small aspect of the bird. For ex, when Strycker talked about penguins he mentioned how they essentially mob form around the tip of the ice berg waiting for one bird to fall in before they all jump. Now if you have the smallest info on penguins you will know why they do this. It's pretty straight forward. If you see a person inching toward the swimming pool, what's the first thing you tell them? But apparently Strycker doesn't think we know why and proceeds to tell us then mentions how humans also have this in them.wow. amazing.The problem was that either he talked about common information or random mundane info that did not enhance my knowledge in the bird nor in humans.TL;DRI GOT BORED. SO BORED MY EYELIDS COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THEMSELVES."
20,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3083148-sooj,4,"I am the most amateurish of birdwatchers. I pat myself on the back when I see a cardinal or a bluejay. I can't tell the difference between a falcon and a hawk, much less distinguish between all the various kinds of sparrows. I know nothing about nests, habits, calls, or bird behavior. The Thing with Feathers was the perfect light reading. Strycker provides fun facts while keeping the tone friendly and accessible. Some of the chapters dealt with birds that everyone knows (penguins, chickens, pigeons) while others, such as the bowerbird and the fairywren, were unknown to me. I kept a smartphone by me so that I can google images and be wowed by the bowerbird's stunning and colorful homes or the fairywren's coloration.For me, personally, I most enjoyed learning about the birds. Less interesting were the bits talking about how certain traits were analogous to human behavior. Hummingbirds have a heart rate of 1,200 beats per minute in flight. Human beings with lower resting heart rates generally live longer. Hummingbirds have a high rate of heart attacks. Ergo, human beings (although they should exercise) should live a leisurely life. To me, this isn't deep insight into human life. Instead, I was gratified to learn about hummingbird's strong, war-like nature when protecting territory, their mating habits, and their endless need for energy. Learning about the hummingbird was enough without extrapolating a human lesson. However, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise enjoyable and engaging read. "
21,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2958674-nikki,2,"Unfortunately I did not find this book terribly entertaining or interesting. In fact I found it more a compilation of many of the cruelties inflicted upon birds in the name of science and just typical terrible human behavior (Just shoot the bird that turns up on the runway! Why not?). It really never fails to irritate me that people not only inflict animals with all of these experiments but do it to learn something about ""ourselves"" as if the act of doing it doesn't tell us something about ourselves. This was in fact one of my major issues with the book: the subtitle. Why can we not want to know about birds and other species we share the planet with just for the sake of knowing about them? Why does it always have to be about us?Another issue I had with the book was that it came down to feeling essentially more like a term paper I would have been assigned in college considering most of the book was about experiments and their findings rather than the author's firsthand knowledge or discussion. The only reason I did not give this 1 star is that I did enjoy hearing about the birds even if much of it was not new to me and much of it just highlighted human cruelty. "
22,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34855670-rebecca-knight,5,"Great read! Loved it, loved the humorous style and the scientific approach to cool questions about birds, humans, behaviors, culture, love, food, and everything else. This book has so much packed in it, and with such an easy flow, it was continuous fun. I liked the layout of the whole book, in three main sections - mind, body, and spirit. And I really liked how each chapter was stand-alone and self-contained, you can just pick it up anywhere, and read one chapter if you want. Each chapter focuses on a particular bird, and includes so much more than just bird facts. The chapters can be read in any order, but taken all together, it is such a compelling story of life, I didn't skip a word. Some sections were so fascinating, I went back and read them over again. Twice I read out loud, just for dramatic effect, the stuff was that cool. This book makes a bird-nerd for sure!"
23,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3189888-bob,5,"Since long before I was born, my family was interested in, and protective of, birds. Especially Barn Swallows and Bluebirds. I've continued the tradition by building birdhouses, too many to count or keep track of. As of a few years ago I figured out I have built about 3,000 and the number is considerably higher, now.So when I saw this book on Goodreads a while back, I was immediately interested.Birds are astonishing in a million ways. Far more ways than anybody really knows about. How do they do what they do to survive? The mechanisms are not well understood, and almost seem to be magic.From building Wren houses, it has long seemed to me that birds (or at least Wrens, anyway) are a whole lot like people. This book supports that theory."
24,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96584-erma,4,"The Thing with Feathers gives a fascinating glimpse of the lives and habits of our feathered friends, from tiny hummingbirds to buzzards. Strycker uses research and personal observation to explore the uncanny abilities of birds: the homing instinct of pigeons, the altruism of fairy-wrens, the incredible flocking ability of starlings, the artistry of bowerbirds, the musical sense of parrots, the memory of nutcrackers, and the fidelity of albatrosses. He relates these human-like traits to our own. A worthwhile read!"

But a few incredibly asinine comments about women made me question any and all expertise the author might have in human behaviour, and so called into question both his thesis and his expertise in animal behaviour as well.

33,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"Noah Strycker has been utterly besotted by birds for as long as he can remember. This passion has taken him to some of the remotest parts of the world, Antartica and the Falklands, to the Galápagos, one of the richest for all sorts of wildlife. His travels mean that he has seen a vast number of species from the ubiquitous pigeon that can travel vast distances to the same place each time, huge murmurations of starlings, magpies that can recognise themselves and bower birds that construct the most amazing structures to procreate. His studies and thoughts show that we have as many similarities as we do differences. Strycker has drawn together a lot of interesting analogies and observations of our feathered friends. There is a lot of recent cutting-edge science in here too and subjects as varied as game theory and intelligence. He has made it easy to read as he peppers the text with lots of personal anecdotes and humorous stories about some of the mad things he has done in the name of research. Quite impressed by this and will definitely be reading his latest when it is out on breaking the record of spotting the most number of species in a year. 3.5 stars."

Yes, yes I did. And though my initial motivation for reading was a humorous whim, I found The Thing with Feathers thoroughly completely engrossing and entertaining. Noah Strycker's passion shines through, and I loved the blend of scientific fact and personal memoir throughout, which helped this be a fairly brisk read.The chapters on homing pigeons, albatrosses (which I did not know actually existed out of Famous Literary Endeavors), and magpies were particularly amazing. Truly, I still don't know precisely what birds are, but I now know they are infinitely more complex and amazing than I ever thought."

I loved it. The author has a very British tone and sense of humor (in my opinion) and I really, really enjoyed it. I’m not usually interested in books about animals but I was fascinated with some of the more “human” traits of some incredible animals.In college there were professors who loved their subject so deeply that I couldn’t help but love them too-even if I’d previously disliked it. Similarly, I think I would enjoy anything by this guy because he has so much passion!"
37,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32478026-maciej-gajewski,5,"This book is a beautifully crafted mix of ornithology, psychology and sociology with a bit of math, physics & history. Noah Strycker has a great skill in choosing a highly engaging narrative so that I wish this book could have lasted for at least a bit longer. It's definitely recommended if you are curious about the world surrounding you and want to notice more in all those nature's elements we take for a given & often do not give them any attention at all. And what Noah reminded me of is that they are undoubtedly worthy of it. "
38,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1201237-sara-leigh,4,"That was delightful! The bowerbird section (on art and creativity) was particularly interesting, as I could visualize it having seen Netflix's Dancing with the Birds, which had a segment on MacGregor's Bowerbird. Fascinating! The section on pigeons and their homing abilities was more meaningful to me because way back in the early '70s at my very first job, I had proofread a book on pigeons, mostly tables of data on their flights. Birds really are surprising."
39,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40574766-stuart-malcolm,4,4.5 stars. An excellently written series of vignettes about bird behavior and corresponding human behavior. Strycker has a superb way with words and is obviously an extremely knowledgeable birder. Some chapters left me wanting more as I had questions that were unanswered - I would have liked a longer more detailed book which is the only reason it doesn’t get 5 stars.

41,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8719023-candace,1,"The author presents as arrogant with no respect toward wildlife.

50,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76740103-jed,3,This book made me consider some interesting points about the nature of human emotion including love and altruism through the naturalist lens of a bird watcher. I liked it. 
51,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5374827-hazel-bright,4,"I quite enjoyed this book, being a bird owner, but also as a bird owner, I was left with some unanswered questions. The differences between bird species and their vastly varying behaviors is primary among these. Why, when pigeons can find their way home across hundreds of miles, do my cockatiels get lost if they accidentally fly into the bathroom? It was an interesting collection of anecdotal observations, but I would have enjoyed a more structured look at differences in behavior from one bird species to another, how these differences arose, and whether or not these variations translate at all to differences in human behavior. For example, why are some 30% of people authoritarian in nature? Are these people the starlings of humanity, so attuned to in-group behavior that their aerial choreography is a visual representation of the otherwise incomprehensible socio-political en masse human behaviors so recently shown in American politics? What about psychopaths, are they performing a scavenger role in human society, gorging on the spoils gained by manipulating people who are doomed to helplessly engage in regimented authoritarian follower behavior? The information in this book is all relatively common: bower bird behavior, flocking logistics, etc., which was interesting, but the deeper, more interesting revelations that could have been derived by comparing human and bird behavior were never made. "
52,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,2,"Admitting up front that the subject--the endlessly engrossing world of birds, of course--got this to two stars. This should be an easy favorite but I had several problems with it.1) The structure of each chapter was disjointed. Information that could have flowed from one paragraph to the next (or even the same one) often didn't appear until a few paragraphs later, after some digression that illuminated nothing.2) The subtitle is ambitious and unfulfilled. The comparisons are weak and, when they do tell us something about being human, it is often our crueler aspects that our illustrated.3) He writes that the Passenger Pigeon went extinct. Not that humans hunted it into extinction--these immense flocks of billions of birds that were murdered into extinction. This is key--by saying ""went"" instead of ""driven to"" the author is eliding human culpability. If he's willing to ignore a basic fact it made me wonder what else he decided to leave out that might prove germane.Stay away."
53,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,4,"I love birds, so this book was right up my alley, so to speak. There’s lots of interesting incredible stuff about birds, much of it unknown to me. Interspersed with the bird stories, and sometimes more lengthy, the author gets into human psychology (which is fair, given the subtitle). I’m not saying the science was suspicious, just that comparing birds to people was my least favorite part of the book. The extreme case is when he concludes that albatrosses experience deeper love than humans because they are so affectionate after years of living apart. I have never even seen an albatross, but my guess is that it’s a little more complicate than that. One other problem I have is the author takes sides in some unsettled disputes between scientists. For example, he concludes that vultures do not find food with their sense of smell. So, we were amused and surprised to find a museum wildlife exhibit describing vultures “keen sense of smell.” Who is right?"
54,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168368-lukie,5,"A really great read about bird behavior and parallels in human behavior. Amazing that Strycker was able to identify over a hundred individual fairy wrens in their natural habitat and observe them for hours in 110 degree heat! I like to imagine that I might have become a biologist of some kind but I dunno....there's a lot of physical discomfort and challenges that go along with cataloging animal behavior. So thanks for doing it for us, Strycker. I couldn't read the last chapter on albatrosses without images of dead chicks with stomachs full of plastic waste from the ocean hovering in my mind and kept expecting him to mention it. He didn't. But the fact that albatrosses only raise one chick every couple of years, makes the tragedy all the more poignant. I finished the book with a heavy heart as a result, but also filled with new-found awe for these immense and magnificent birds. "
55,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,4,"An enjoyable and interesting read about bird behavior and its relationship to human behavior, this book has a lot of interesting and fun stories that question the lines we draw between ourselves and other animals. It's also pretty interesting the way that contrasting our own ways with that of birds (or animals in general) can help us define what we mean by things. The last third of the book, particularly the parts about bowerbirds and albatrosses, was particularly great."
56,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342448-brenda,2,"Interesting as far as birds go, but does not live up to its title.

Overall it was a delight and I'd read more by this author."
58,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"One of the blessings of living in a semi-rural area like myself is the daily sightings of birds -- and not just the neighborhood regulars like robins, sparrows, and cardinals, but sights as grand as great egrets and red-tailed hawks.   But birds aren't just beautiful,  argues ornithologist and avid birder Noah Styrcker:     studying them can inform our appreciation on emergent order,  altrusim, and consciousness.   The Thing With Feathers  documents exceptional  behavior in a variety of species (the nest-making of bowerbirds, say,   or the apparent dread penguins have of the sort) and then lightly explore that topic, usually with an eye to connecting it to the human experience.   The book combines nature writing and science,  though it's light-ish fare, and the human connections are sometimes a bit of a stretch, as in the chapter on hummingbirds. Styrker  wraps up with the following reflection:""Hummingbirds are slaves to speed, desperately fighting for control of calories, so single-minded that they don’t even partner up to raise a family. They apparently have an unusually high rate of heart attacks and ruptures, which is hardly surprising. Hummers blast through their billion heartbeats in one brilliantly intense rush, and when the engine shorts out, they fade just as quickly into aether, hardly leaving any trace to show that they ever existed at all. It seems like humans are speeding up—we strive for more gratification with fewer delays. Our fast-food culture isn’t a cliché; it’s a fact. And things are only accelerating. But do we really want to become hummingbirds?""The avian content itself  has much to offer. There's been considered debate and many experiments done to see if vultures could smell, for instance;  although the first round of testing indicated that they can't (vultures would pitifully try to pick at drawings of dead animals and ignore actual ones which were covered with leaves),  some species do -- and they're so reliable at sniffing that natural gas companies use them to locate pipeline leaks.    Vultures are surprisingly picky about the animals they clean up, with a marked preference for herbivores;   they're also reluctant to eat anything that's been decaying for more than three days.    Less on the stinky side is the appraisal of how starlings can conduct such massive, coordinated 'dances' in the skies;  emergent order never fails to fascinate me,  so I was intrigued to learn that the pattern  appears so long as the birds follow three tendencies (separation, cohesion, and alignment);   at least, those are the rules employed by swarm models that replicate the behavior of starlings and similar birds.If you have any interest in birds at all, by all means give The Thing with Feathers a looking-over; it explores a variety of bird behaviors and is an entertaining read all around."
59,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3605888-michelle,3,"Strycker's book is an entertaining introduction to some fascinating research on bird behavior with some parallels drawn to human behaviors, as the subtitle promises. It largely left me wanting more (and left me with a pile of unanswered questions), but now I know where to go to find it (besides my own backyard!), thanks to his comprehensive source list in the back of the book. Each chapter presents a particular behavior especially observed in a particular bird species: the homing ability in pigeons, fear in penguins, the artfulness/craftiness/forced perception in bowerbirds, self-recognition (and so much more) in magpies, long-lasting love in the albatross, the extraordinary memory of nutcrackers, and a half-dozen others. He summarizes some of the earliest (and not always very humane) ""research"" as well as some of the newest, including his own, both as a scientist on several field studies and as a budding teenage birder who once loaded a roadkill deer carcass into the back trunk of his parents' car and unloaded it into his backyard to test the olfactory capabilities of turkey vultures. Strycker gave much credit to his parents for supporting (with their noses plugged) his experiment!Overall, the book deepened my interest in stopping, watching and listening to the birds on my increasingly longer neighborhood walks in this COVID era. I recommend it to any beginning birder or anyone who observes and wants to better understand animal behavior."

This passion has taken him to some of the remotest parts of the world, Antartica and the Falklands, to the Galápagos, one of the richest for all sorts of wildlife. His travels mean that he has seen a vast number of species from the ubiquitous pigeon that can travel vast distances to the same place each time, huge murmurations of starlings, magpies that can recognise themselves and bower birds that construct the most amazing structures to procreate. His studies and thoughts show that we have as many similarities as we do differences. Strycker has drawn together a lot of interesting analogies and observations of our feathered friends. There is a lot of recent cutting-edge science in here too and subjects as varied as game theory and intelligence. He has made it easy to read as he peppers the text with lots of personal anecdotes and humorous stories about some of the mad things he has done in the name of research. Quite impressed by this and will definitely be reading his latest when it is out on breaking the record of spotting the most number of species in a year. 3.5 stars."

Noah Strycker's passion shines through, and I loved the blend of scientific fact and personal memoir throughout, which helped this be a fairly brisk read.The chapters on homing pigeons, albatrosses (which I did not know actually existed out of Famous Literary Endeavors), and magpies were particularly amazing.

But do we really want to become hummingbirds?""The avian content itself  has much to offer. There's been considered debate and many experiments done to see if vultures could smell, for instance;  although the first round of testing indicated that they can't (vultures would pitifully try to pick at drawings of dead animals and ignore actual ones which were covered with leaves),  some species do -- and they're so reliable at sniffing that natural gas companies use them to locate pipeline leaks.    Vultures are surprisingly picky about the animals they clean up, with a marked preference for herbivores;   they're also reluctant to eat anything that's been decaying for more than three days.    Less on the stinky side is the appraisal of how starlings can conduct such massive, coordinated 'dances' in the skies;  emergent order never fails to fascinate me,  so I was intrigued to learn that the pattern  appears so long as the birds follow three tendencies (separation, cohesion, and alignment);   at least, those are the rules employed by swarm models that replicate the behavior of starlings and similar birds.If you have any interest in birds at all, by all means give The Thing with Feathers a looking-over; it explores a variety of bird behaviors and is an entertaining read all around."
89,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3605888-michelle,3,"Strycker's book is an entertaining introduction to some fascinating research on bird behavior with some parallels drawn to human behaviors, as the subtitle promises. It largely left me wanting more (and left me with a pile of unanswered questions), but now I know where to go to find it (besides my own backyard!), thanks to his comprehensive source list in the back of the book. Each chapter presents a particular behavior especially observed in a particular bird species: the homing ability in pigeons, fear in penguins, the artfulness/craftiness/forced perception in bowerbirds, self-recognition (and so much more) in magpies, long-lasting love in the albatross, the extraordinary memory of nutcrackers, and a half-dozen others. He summarizes some of the earliest (and not always very humane) ""research"" as well as some of the newest, including his own, both as a scientist on several field studies and as a budding teenage birder who once loaded a roadkill deer carcass into the back trunk of his parents' car and unloaded it into his backyard to test the olfactory capabilities of turkey vultures. Strycker gave much credit to his parents for supporting (with their noses plugged) his experiment!Overall, the book deepened my interest in stopping, watching and listening to the birds on my increasingly longer neighborhood walks in this COVID era. I recommend it to any beginning birder or anyone who observes and wants to better understand animal behavior."

This passion has taken him to some of the remotest parts of the world, Antartica and the Falklands, to the Galápagos, one of the richest for all sorts of wildlife. His travels mean that he has seen a vast number of species from the ubiquitous pigeon that can travel vast distances to the same place each time, huge murmurations of starlings, magpies that can recognise themselves and bower birds that construct the most amazing structures to procreate. His studies and thoughts show that we have as many similarities as we do differences. Strycker has drawn together a lot of interesting analogies and observations of our feathered friends. There is a lot of recent cutting-edge science in here too and subjects as varied as game theory and intelligence. He has made it easy to read as he peppers the text with lots of personal anecdotes and humorous stories about some of the mad things he has done in the name of research.

111,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5374827-hazel-bright,4,"I quite enjoyed this book, being a bird owner, but also as a bird owner, I was left with some unanswered questions. The differences between bird species and their vastly varying behaviors is primary among these. Why, when pigeons can find their way home across hundreds of miles, do my cockatiels get lost if they accidentally fly into the bathroom? It was an interesting collection of anecdotal observations, but I would have enjoyed a more structured look at differences in behavior from one bird species to another, how these differences arose, and whether or not these variations translate at all to differences in human behavior. For example, why are some 30% of people authoritarian in nature? Are these people the starlings of humanity, so attuned to in-group behavior that their aerial choreography is a visual representation of the otherwise incomprehensible socio-political en masse human behaviors so recently shown in American politics? What about psychopaths, are they performing a scavenger role in human society, gorging on the spoils gained by manipulating people who are doomed to helplessly engage in regimented authoritarian follower behavior? The information in this book is all relatively common: bower bird behavior, flocking logistics, etc., which was interesting, but the deeper, more interesting revelations that could have been derived by comparing human and bird behavior were never made. "
112,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,2,"Admitting up front that the subject--the endlessly engrossing world of birds, of course--got this to two stars. This should be an easy favorite but I had several problems with it.1) The structure of each chapter was disjointed. Information that could have flowed from one paragraph to the next (or even the same one) often didn't appear until a few paragraphs later, after some digression that illuminated nothing.2) The subtitle is ambitious and unfulfilled. The comparisons are weak and, when they do tell us something about being human, it is often our crueler aspects that our illustrated.3) He writes that the Passenger Pigeon went extinct. Not that humans hunted it into extinction--these immense flocks of billions of birds that were murdered into extinction. This is key--by saying ""went"" instead of ""driven to"" the author is eliding human culpability. If he's willing to ignore a basic fact it made me wonder what else he decided to leave out that might prove germane.Stay away."
113,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,4,"I love birds, so this book was right up my alley, so to speak. There’s lots of interesting incredible stuff about birds, much of it unknown to me. Interspersed with the bird stories, and sometimes more lengthy, the author gets into human psychology (which is fair, given the subtitle). I’m not saying the science was suspicious, just that comparing birds to people was my least favorite part of the book. The extreme case is when he concludes that albatrosses experience deeper love than humans because they are so affectionate after years of living apart. I have never even seen an albatross, but my guess is that it’s a little more complicate than that. One other problem I have is the author takes sides in some unsettled disputes between scientists. For example, he concludes that vultures do not find food with their sense of smell. So, we were amused and surprised to find a museum wildlife exhibit describing vultures “keen sense of smell.” Who is right?"
114,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168368-lukie,5,"A really great read about bird behavior and parallels in human behavior. Amazing that Strycker was able to identify over a hundred individual fairy wrens in their natural habitat and observe them for hours in 110 degree heat! I like to imagine that I might have become a biologist of some kind but I dunno....there's a lot of physical discomfort and challenges that go along with cataloging animal behavior. So thanks for doing it for us, Strycker. I couldn't read the last chapter on albatrosses without images of dead chicks with stomachs full of plastic waste from the ocean hovering in my mind and kept expecting him to mention it. He didn't. But the fact that albatrosses only raise one chick every couple of years, makes the tragedy all the more poignant. I finished the book with a heavy heart as a result, but also filled with new-found awe for these immense and magnificent birds. "
115,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,4,"An enjoyable and interesting read about bird behavior and its relationship to human behavior, this book has a lot of interesting and fun stories that question the lines we draw between ourselves and other animals. It's also pretty interesting the way that contrasting our own ways with that of birds (or animals in general) can help us define what we mean by things. The last third of the book, particularly the parts about bowerbirds and albatrosses, was particularly great."
116,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342448-brenda,2,"Interesting as far as birds go, but does not live up to its title.

Styrker  wraps up with the following reflection:""Hummingbirds are slaves to speed, desperately fighting for control of calories, so single-minded that they don’t even partner up to raise a family. They apparently have an unusually high rate of heart attacks and ruptures, which is hardly surprising. Hummers blast through their billion heartbeats in one brilliantly intense rush, and when the engine shorts out, they fade just as quickly into aether, hardly leaving any trace to show that they ever existed at all.

There’s lots of interesting incredible stuff about birds, much of it unknown to me. Interspersed with the bird stories, and sometimes more lengthy, the author gets into human psychology (which is fair, given the subtitle). I’m not saying the science was suspicious, just that comparing birds to people was my least favorite part of the book. The extreme case is when he concludes that albatrosses experience deeper love than humans because they are so affectionate after years of living apart. I have never even seen an albatross, but my guess is that it’s a little more complicate than that. One other problem I have is the author takes sides in some unsettled disputes between scientists. For example, he concludes that vultures do not find food with their sense of smell. So, we were amused and surprised to find a museum wildlife exhibit describing vultures “keen sense of smell.” Who is right?"

So thanks for doing it for us, Strycker.

It largely left me wanting more (and left me with a pile of unanswered questions), but now I know where to go to find it (besides my own backyard!), thanks to his comprehensive source list in the back of the book. Each chapter presents a particular behavior especially observed in a particular bird species: the homing ability in pigeons, fear in penguins, the artfulness/craftiness/forced perception in bowerbirds, self-recognition (and so much more) in magpies, long-lasting love in the albatross, the extraordinary memory of nutcrackers, and a half-dozen others. He summarizes some of the earliest (and not always very humane) ""research"" as well as some of the newest, including his own, both as a scientist on several field studies and as a budding teenage birder who once loaded a roadkill deer carcass into the back trunk of his parents' car and unloaded it into his backyard to test the olfactory capabilities of turkey vultures. Strycker gave much credit to his parents for supporting (with their noses plugged) his experiment!Overall, the book deepened my interest in stopping, watching and listening to the birds on my increasingly longer neighborhood walks in this COVID era.

It was an interesting collection of anecdotal observations, but I would have enjoyed a more structured look at differences in behavior from one bird species to another, how these differences arose, and whether or not these variations translate at all to differences in human behavior. For example, why are some 30% of people authoritarian in nature? Are these people the starlings of humanity, so attuned to in-group behavior that their aerial choreography is a visual representation of the otherwise incomprehensible socio-political en masse human behaviors so recently shown in American politics?

The bowerbird section (on art and creativity) was particularly interesting, as I could visualize it having seen Netflix's Dancing with the Birds, which had a segment on MacGregor's Bowerbird. Fascinating! The section on pigeons and their homing abilities was more meaningful to me because way back in the early '70s at my very first job, I had proofread a book on pigeons, mostly tables of data on their flights. Birds really are surprising."

The differences between bird species and their vastly varying behaviors is primary among these. Why, when pigeons can find their way home across hundreds of miles, do my cockatiels get lost if they accidentally fly into the bathroom? It was an interesting collection of anecdotal observations, but I would have enjoyed a more structured look at differences in behavior from one bird species to another, how these differences arose, and whether or not these variations translate at all to differences in human behavior. For example, why are some 30% of people authoritarian in nature? Are these people the starlings of humanity, so attuned to in-group behavior that their aerial choreography is a visual representation of the otherwise incomprehensible socio-political en masse human behaviors so recently shown in American politics? What about psychopaths, are they performing a scavenger role in human society, gorging on the spoils gained by manipulating people who are doomed to helplessly engage in regimented authoritarian follower behavior? The information in this book is all relatively common: bower bird behavior, flocking logistics, etc., which was interesting, but the deeper, more interesting revelations that could have been derived by comparing human and bird behavior were never made.

Not that humans hunted it into extinction--these immense flocks of billions of birds that were murdered into extinction.

There’s lots of interesting incredible stuff about birds, much of it unknown to me. Interspersed with the bird stories, and sometimes more lengthy, the author gets into human psychology (which is fair, given the subtitle). I’m not saying the science was suspicious, just that comparing birds to people was my least favorite part of the book. The extreme case is when he concludes that albatrosses experience deeper love than humans because they are so affectionate after years of living apart. I have never even seen an albatross, but my guess is that it’s a little more complicate than that. One other problem I have is the author takes sides in some unsettled disputes between scientists. For example, he concludes that vultures do not find food with their sense of smell. So, we were amused and surprised to find a museum wildlife exhibit describing vultures “keen sense of smell.” Who is right?"

I like to imagine that I might have become a biologist of some kind but I dunno....there's a lot of physical discomfort and challenges that go along with cataloging animal behavior. So thanks for doing it for us, Strycker. I couldn't read the last chapter on albatrosses without images of dead chicks with stomachs full of plastic waste from the ocean hovering in my mind and kept expecting him to mention it. He didn't. But the fact that albatrosses only raise one chick every couple of years, makes the tragedy all the more poignant. I finished the book with a heavy heart as a result, but also filled with new-found awe for these immense and magnificent birds. "

208,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"One of the blessings of living in a semi-rural area like myself is the daily sightings of birds -- and not just the neighborhood regulars like robins, sparrows, and cardinals, but sights as grand as great egrets and red-tailed hawks.   But birds aren't just beautiful,  argues ornithologist and avid birder Noah Styrcker:     studying them can inform our appreciation on emergent order,  altrusim, and consciousness.   The Thing With Feathers  documents exceptional  behavior in a variety of species (the nest-making of bowerbirds, say,   or the apparent dread penguins have of the sort) and then lightly explore that topic, usually with an eye to connecting it to the human experience.   The book combines nature writing and science,  though it's light-ish fare, and the human connections are sometimes a bit of a stretch, as in the chapter on hummingbirds. Styrker  wraps up with the following reflection:""Hummingbirds are slaves to speed, desperately fighting for control of calories, so single-minded that they don’t even partner up to raise a family. They apparently have an unusually high rate of heart attacks and ruptures, which is hardly surprising. Hummers blast through their billion heartbeats in one brilliantly intense rush, and when the engine shorts out, they fade just as quickly into aether, hardly leaving any trace to show that they ever existed at all. It seems like humans are speeding up—we strive for more gratification with fewer delays. Our fast-food culture isn’t a cliché; it’s a fact. And things are only accelerating. But do we really want to become hummingbirds?""The avian content itself  has much to offer. There's been considered debate and many experiments done to see if vultures could smell, for instance;  although the first round of testing indicated that they can't (vultures would pitifully try to pick at drawings of dead animals and ignore actual ones which were covered with leaves),  some species do -- and they're so reliable at sniffing that natural gas companies use them to locate pipeline leaks.    Vultures are surprisingly picky about the animals they clean up, with a marked preference for herbivores;   they're also reluctant to eat anything that's been decaying for more than three days.    Less on the stinky side is the appraisal of how starlings can conduct such massive, coordinated 'dances' in the skies;  emergent order never fails to fascinate me,  so I was intrigued to learn that the pattern  appears so long as the birds follow three tendencies (separation, cohesion, and alignment);   at least, those are the rules employed by swarm models that replicate the behavior of starlings and similar birds.If you have any interest in birds at all, by all means give The Thing with Feathers a looking-over; it explores a variety of bird behaviors and is an entertaining read all around."
209,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3605888-michelle,3,"Strycker's book is an entertaining introduction to some fascinating research on bird behavior with some parallels drawn to human behaviors, as the subtitle promises. It largely left me wanting more (and left me with a pile of unanswered questions), but now I know where to go to find it (besides my own backyard!), thanks to his comprehensive source list in the back of the book. Each chapter presents a particular behavior especially observed in a particular bird species: the homing ability in pigeons, fear in penguins, the artfulness/craftiness/forced perception in bowerbirds, self-recognition (and so much more) in magpies, long-lasting love in the albatross, the extraordinary memory of nutcrackers, and a half-dozen others. He summarizes some of the earliest (and not always very humane) ""research"" as well as some of the newest, including his own, both as a scientist on several field studies and as a budding teenage birder who once loaded a roadkill deer carcass into the back trunk of his parents' car and unloaded it into his backyard to test the olfactory capabilities of turkey vultures. Strycker gave much credit to his parents for supporting (with their noses plugged) his experiment!Overall, the book deepened my interest in stopping, watching and listening to the birds on my increasingly longer neighborhood walks in this COVID era. I recommend it to any beginning birder or anyone who observes and wants to better understand animal behavior."

This passion has taken him to some of the remotest parts of the world, Antartica and the Falklands, to the Galápagos, one of the richest for all sorts of wildlife. His travels mean that he has seen a vast number of species from the ubiquitous pigeon that can travel vast distances to the same place each time, huge murmurations of starlings, magpies that can recognise themselves and bower birds that construct the most amazing structures to procreate. His studies and thoughts show that we have as many similarities as we do differences. Strycker has drawn together a lot of interesting analogies and observations of our feathered friends. There is a lot of recent cutting-edge science in here too and subjects as varied as game theory and intelligence. He has made it easy to read as he peppers the text with lots of personal anecdotes and humorous stories about some of the mad things he has done in the name of research. Quite impressed by this and will definitely be reading his latest when it is out on breaking the record of spotting the most number of species in a year. 3.5 stars."

Yes, yes I did. And though my initial motivation for reading was a humorous whim, I found The Thing with Feathers thoroughly completely engrossing and entertaining. Noah Strycker's passion shines through, and I loved the blend of scientific fact and personal memoir throughout, which helped this be a fairly brisk read.The chapters on homing pigeons, albatrosses (which I did not know actually existed out of Famous Literary Endeavors), and magpies were particularly amazing.

When he does that, he falls into evo-psy Malcolm Gladwell prate that tries to make our wacky and outlandish cultural status quo into biological inevitability. Not only is it stupid and regressive -- it's also the same tired rehashed factoids you can find in any pop-anthropology book written by a preening, self-important non-anthropologist. I guess he's thinking he'll sell more books if he makes humans his focus? Whatever the motive, I hope young Noah Stryker just writes about birds in the future. Magpies! Fairy Wrens! Albatrosses!

239,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3605888-michelle,3,"Strycker's book is an entertaining introduction to some fascinating research on bird behavior with some parallels drawn to human behaviors, as the subtitle promises. It largely left me wanting more (and left me with a pile of unanswered questions), but now I know where to go to find it (besides my own backyard!), thanks to his comprehensive source list in the back of the book. Each chapter presents a particular behavior especially observed in a particular bird species: the homing ability in pigeons, fear in penguins, the artfulness/craftiness/forced perception in bowerbirds, self-recognition (and so much more) in magpies, long-lasting love in the albatross, the extraordinary memory of nutcrackers, and a half-dozen others. He summarizes some of the earliest (and not always very humane) ""research"" as well as some of the newest, including his own, both as a scientist on several field studies and as a budding teenage birder who once loaded a roadkill deer carcass into the back trunk of his parents' car and unloaded it into his backyard to test the olfactory capabilities of turkey vultures. Strycker gave much credit to his parents for supporting (with their noses plugged) his experiment!Overall, the book deepened my interest in stopping, watching and listening to the birds on my increasingly longer neighborhood walks in this COVID era. I recommend it to any beginning birder or anyone who observes and wants to better understand animal behavior."

The differences between bird species and their vastly varying behaviors is primary among these. Why, when pigeons can find their way home across hundreds of miles, do my cockatiels get lost if they accidentally fly into the bathroom? It was an interesting collection of anecdotal observations, but I would have enjoyed a more structured look at differences in behavior from one bird species to another, how these differences arose, and whether or not these variations translate at all to differences in human behavior. For example, why are some 30% of people authoritarian in nature? Are these people the starlings of humanity, so attuned to in-group behavior that their aerial choreography is a visual representation of the otherwise incomprehensible socio-political en masse human behaviors so recently shown in American politics? What about psychopaths, are they performing a scavenger role in human society, gorging on the spoils gained by manipulating people who are doomed to helplessly engage in regimented authoritarian follower behavior? The information in this book is all relatively common: bower bird behavior, flocking logistics, etc., which was interesting, but the deeper, more interesting revelations that could have been derived by comparing human and bird behavior were never made. "
262,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,2,"Admitting up front that the subject--the endlessly engrossing world of birds, of course--got this to two stars. This should be an easy favorite but I had several problems with it.1) The structure of each chapter was disjointed. Information that could have flowed from one paragraph to the next (or even the same one) often didn't appear until a few paragraphs later, after some digression that illuminated nothing.2) The subtitle is ambitious and unfulfilled. The comparisons are weak and, when they do tell us something about being human, it is often our crueler aspects that our illustrated.3) He writes that the Passenger Pigeon went extinct. Not that humans hunted it into extinction--these immense flocks of billions of birds that were murdered into extinction. This is key--by saying ""went"" instead of ""driven to"" the author is eliding human culpability. If he's willing to ignore a basic fact it made me wonder what else he decided to leave out that might prove germane.Stay away."
263,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,4,"I love birds, so this book was right up my alley, so to speak. There’s lots of interesting incredible stuff about birds, much of it unknown to me. Interspersed with the bird stories, and sometimes more lengthy, the author gets into human psychology (which is fair, given the subtitle). I’m not saying the science was suspicious, just that comparing birds to people was my least favorite part of the book. The extreme case is when he concludes that albatrosses experience deeper love than humans because they are so affectionate after years of living apart. I have never even seen an albatross, but my guess is that it’s a little more complicate than that. One other problem I have is the author takes sides in some unsettled disputes between scientists. For example, he concludes that vultures do not find food with their sense of smell. So, we were amused and surprised to find a museum wildlife exhibit describing vultures “keen sense of smell.” Who is right?"
264,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6168368-lukie,5,"A really great read about bird behavior and parallels in human behavior. Amazing that Strycker was able to identify over a hundred individual fairy wrens in their natural habitat and observe them for hours in 110 degree heat! I like to imagine that I might have become a biologist of some kind but I dunno....there's a lot of physical discomfort and challenges that go along with cataloging animal behavior. So thanks for doing it for us, Strycker. I couldn't read the last chapter on albatrosses without images of dead chicks with stomachs full of plastic waste from the ocean hovering in my mind and kept expecting him to mention it. He didn't. But the fact that albatrosses only raise one chick every couple of years, makes the tragedy all the more poignant. I finished the book with a heavy heart as a result, but also filled with new-found awe for these immense and magnificent birds. "
265,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,4,"An enjoyable and interesting read about bird behavior and its relationship to human behavior, this book has a lot of interesting and fun stories that question the lines we draw between ourselves and other animals. It's also pretty interesting the way that contrasting our own ways with that of birds (or animals in general) can help us define what we mean by things. The last third of the book, particularly the parts about bowerbirds and albatrosses, was particularly great."

Styrker  wraps up with the following reflection:""Hummingbirds are slaves to speed, desperately fighting for control of calories, so single-minded that they don’t even partner up to raise a family. They apparently have an unusually high rate of heart attacks and ruptures, which is hardly surprising. Hummers blast through their billion heartbeats in one brilliantly intense rush, and when the engine shorts out, they fade just as quickly into aether, hardly leaving any trace to show that they ever existed at all. It seems like humans are speeding up—we strive for more gratification with fewer delays. Our fast-food culture isn’t a cliché; it’s a fact. And things are only accelerating.

This should be an easy favorite but I had several problems with it.1) The structure of each chapter was disjointed. Information that could have flowed from one paragraph to the next (or even the same one) often didn't appear until a few paragraphs later, after some digression that illuminated nothing.2) The subtitle is ambitious and unfulfilled. The comparisons are weak and, when they do tell us something about being human, it is often our crueler aspects that our illustrated.3) He writes that the Passenger Pigeon went extinct. Not that humans hunted it into extinction--these immense flocks of billions of birds that were murdered into extinction. This is key--by saying ""went"" instead of ""driven to"" the author is eliding human culpability. If he's willing to ignore a basic fact it made me wonder what else he decided to leave out that might prove germane.Stay away."

There’s lots of interesting incredible stuff about birds, much of it unknown to me. Interspersed with the bird stories, and sometimes more lengthy, the author gets into human psychology (which is fair, given the subtitle). I’m not saying the science was suspicious, just that comparing birds to people was my least favorite part of the book. The extreme case is when he concludes that albatrosses experience deeper love than humans because they are so affectionate after years of living apart. I have never even seen an albatross, but my guess is that it’s a little more complicate than that. One other problem I have is the author takes sides in some unsettled disputes between scientists. For example, he concludes that vultures do not find food with their sense of smell. So, we were amused and surprised to find a museum wildlife exhibit describing vultures “keen sense of smell.” Who is right?"

Amazing that Strycker was able to identify over a hundred individual fairy wrens in their natural habitat and observe them for hours in 110 degree heat! I like to imagine that I might have become a biologist of some kind but I dunno....there's a lot of physical discomfort and challenges that go along with cataloging animal behavior. So thanks for doing it for us, Strycker. I couldn't read the last chapter on albatrosses without images of dead chicks with stomachs full of plastic waste from the ocean hovering in my mind and kept expecting him to mention it. He didn't. But the fact that albatrosses only raise one chick every couple of years, makes the tragedy all the more poignant. I finished the book with a heavy heart as a result, but also filled with new-found awe for these immense and magnificent birds. "
295,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,4,"An enjoyable and interesting read about bird behavior and its relationship to human behavior, this book has a lot of interesting and fun stories that question the lines we draw between ourselves and other animals. It's also pretty interesting the way that contrasting our own ways with that of birds (or animals in general) can help us define what we mean by things. The last third of the book, particularly the parts about bowerbirds and albatrosses, was particularly great."
296,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4342448-brenda,2,"Interesting as far as birds go, but does not live up to its title. There are little to no observations on what the lives of birds reveal about being human. This book has a high rating because of the interesting investigation of the lives of birds, but I didn't buy the book for that component alone. Kind of a let down. "
297,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8927706-lauren,3,"This was a really fun essay collection. It's a light read and very fast. Might be more fun for someone who hasn't watched all David Attenborough's specials on birds though, as some species are well covered territory. Overall it was a delight and I'd read more by this author."
298,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"One of the blessings of living in a semi-rural area like myself is the daily sightings of birds -- and not just the neighborhood regulars like robins, sparrows, and cardinals, but sights as grand as great egrets and red-tailed hawks.   But birds aren't just beautiful,  argues ornithologist and avid birder Noah Styrcker:     studying them can inform our appreciation on emergent order,  altrusim, and consciousness.   The Thing With Feathers  documents exceptional  behavior in a variety of species (the nest-making of bowerbirds, say,   or the apparent dread penguins have of the sort) and then lightly explore that topic, usually with an eye to connecting it to the human experience.   The book combines nature writing and science,  though it's light-ish fare, and the human connections are sometimes a bit of a stretch, as in the chapter on hummingbirds. Styrker  wraps up with the following reflection:""Hummingbirds are slaves to speed, desperately fighting for control of calories, so single-minded that they don’t even partner up to raise a family. They apparently have an unusually high rate of heart attacks and ruptures, which is hardly surprising. Hummers blast through their billion heartbeats in one brilliantly intense rush, and when the engine shorts out, they fade just as quickly into aether, hardly leaving any trace to show that they ever existed at all. It seems like humans are speeding up—we strive for more gratification with fewer delays. Our fast-food culture isn’t a cliché; it’s a fact. And things are only accelerating. But do we really want to become hummingbirds?""The avian content itself  has much to offer. There's been considered debate and many experiments done to see if vultures could smell, for instance;  although the first round of testing indicated that they can't (vultures would pitifully try to pick at drawings of dead animals and ignore actual ones which were covered with leaves),  some species do -- and they're so reliable at sniffing that natural gas companies use them to locate pipeline leaks.    Vultures are surprisingly picky about the animals they clean up, with a marked preference for herbivores;   they're also reluctant to eat anything that's been decaying for more than three days.    Less on the stinky side is the appraisal of how starlings can conduct such massive, coordinated 'dances' in the skies;  emergent order never fails to fascinate me,  so I was intrigued to learn that the pattern  appears so long as the birds follow three tendencies (separation, cohesion, and alignment);   at least, those are the rules employed by swarm models that replicate the behavior of starlings and similar birds.If you have any interest in birds at all, by all means give The Thing with Feathers a looking-over; it explores a variety of bird behaviors and is an entertaining read all around."
299,1594486352,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3605888-michelle,3,"Strycker's book is an entertaining introduction to some fascinating research on bird behavior with some parallels drawn to human behaviors, as the subtitle promises. It largely left me wanting more (and left me with a pile of unanswered questions), but now I know where to go to find it (besides my own backyard!), thanks to his comprehensive source list in the back of the book. Each chapter presents a particular behavior especially observed in a particular bird species: the homing ability in pigeons, fear in penguins, the artfulness/craftiness/forced perception in bowerbirds, self-recognition (and so much more) in magpies, long-lasting love in the albatross, the extraordinary memory of nutcrackers, and a half-dozen others. He summarizes some of the earliest (and not always very humane) ""research"" as well as some of the newest, including his own, both as a scientist on several field studies and as a budding teenage birder who once loaded a roadkill deer carcass into the back trunk of his parents' car and unloaded it into his backyard to test the olfactory capabilities of turkey vultures. Strycker gave much credit to his parents for supporting (with their noses plugged) his experiment!Overall, the book deepened my interest in stopping, watching and listening to the birds on my increasingly longer neighborhood walks in this COVID era. I recommend it to any beginning birder or anyone who observes and wants to better understand animal behavior."
