It´s economical logic that no company is interested in fruitless research about what would be possible in collaborations with other fields of science one has no made investments in and so it simply isn´t done. The state could stand in by subsidizing much more research that isn´t focused on marketable products, but on what synergies could emerge when the advantages are mixed together.  Kelly is big in nostredameian style of predicting many developments that are already there and will come, and looking back at 1995, 25 years ago, it seems even more amazing that he managed to extrapolate developments that were deemed fringe science, impossible, not profitable, or were simply disliked by the leading scientists of some fields because they preferred their own yada thesis. He predicted nanotech, internet, computers, he talks about so many interconnected topics, making the work a mixture of technology, biology, many social sciences, and philosophy, giving so many inspirations one could bath in for months. A bit too much techno optimism lead to some forecasts that were just unrealistic, but especially the comparison of natural and human made systems is ingenious, as it doesn´t only embrace the importance of nature conservation, but leads to more focus on interdisciplinarity and learning from models that are functioning for eons. The idea of this book should be reinterpreted with all the modern science and extrapolated to different distances of the future in a mixture of Michio Kaku and John Brockmans´ Edge question books, just a bit more coherent than in this case, where the chapters stand isolated from each other without much metacontext. Quite an irony for a book about that everything is connected.  Many mainstream thinkers will, even today, definitively find the ideas impossible to implement for laughable reasons, looking at you, economics and political sciences, but keep on playing around with stupid ideas, it´s so cute.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergin...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of..."
1,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1352651-andreas,4,"This is a fascinating book full of fascinating ideas reaching across the board from artificial intelligence, evolution, biology, ecology, robotics and more to explore complexity, cybernetics and self-organising systems in an accessible and engaging way.But despite the fascinating topic matter, ""Out of Control"" has a number of frustrating flaws: - It is way too long-winded. - It is full of weird conjecture and meta-philosophising, which may have inspired the creators of the Matrix trilogy, but which I find unconvincing.- It almost completely void of meta-text to help the reader understand what Kelly is trying to do with his book (having read the book, I'm still wondering).Indeed, reading the book I got the feeling that Kelly was trying to combine several different books into one: There is a fascinating study of self-sustaining systems. But there is also a sort of business-book take on network economy. And an extended meditation on evolution and postdarwinism.I'm sure that to Kelly, all of these things are tightly interconnected. But he doesn't explain that very well to the reader. His central argument is that as technology becomes ever more complex, it becomes more akin to biological systems (eco-systems, vivisystems, interdependent and co-evolving organisms). But because the individual chapters are set up as essays on their own, there is often little to tie these wildly different ideas together.I would have preferred a much shorter book, more narrowly focused on the idea of self-organising systems. A good editor would have helped produce that.UPDATE: I took upon my self to attempt to edit the book into the version that I would have preferred to read: http://andreaslloyd.dk/outofcontrol/"
2,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549089-michael-nielsen,5,"I first read this book more than a decade ago.I enjoyed it as I read it, but frankly didn't think it was all that notable. But in the years since it has come up in my thinking again and again and again, changing the way I see and experience the world. That's about the best recommendation I can give a book!"
3,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5085729-feliks,4,"Disturbing and reassuring at the same time. One of those books which approach the current state of world chaos from a unique angle and helps one try to make sense of what's going on.Reassuring in that Kelly gives us something of a method to dissect current technological trends. He offers a quirky kind of philosophical outlook towards the alarming aspects of modernism which says, ""relax, just trust in science"" (because, and I paraphrase) 'science is ultimately displaying an organic style of development'. Its a neat way to analyze progress, I guess. For about five minutes. The analogies between science and nature are cleverly drawn; and since nature is usually reassuring--seeing how science matches her so concretely nowadays--is by extension, reassuring. Can science really be so frightening if its simply following natural patterns we already know about? But is it? Kelly seems to be missing something. Our world is now not one where computers are just an ornament, or a toy. They're running the world. How well does that match with nature? Not much; it seems to me. His examples and anecdotes just don't go far enough.This book has past its prime; its relevancy--in just ten years. Written shortly before the cell-phone boom--it has a somewhat more optimistic outlook on burgeoning technology than I think we would now generally embrace. In light of recent events--a personal electronics technology BOOM exploding at a pace no one foresaw--can we really just click our heels 3x as Kelly suggests, and trust that the whirlwind will see us safely home? I think not. I think he's far too comfortably wrapped in his positivist viewpoint. Kelly focuses more on 'means' rather than 'ends' and doesn't pay enough attention to 'fallout', 'byproducts', or 'risks'. He allocates no effort to the notion of simply preserving existing values; traditions; customs; upholding existing quality-of-life. His message seems to simply be: 'get with the program'. Its probably wise to pair this title with other more recent works which describe brain function; language; learning; vs the effects of social media. You can see that things simply haven't gone the way he predicted. "
4,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294085-david,4,"Don't let the fact that it took me 10 months to finish this book impact your decision to read it; Out of Control was a well-worthy, remarkable effort, which should be given a careful and thorough read.So, why 10 months? Kevin Kelly is very wordy. Yes, Kelly provides fascinating insights and revelations about machine biology, ""hive mind"" theory, co-evolution, the evolution of computers, and the future of planet Earth. But he does all of this with about 200 pages more than are actually necessary to make his point. Kelly is a great writer, no doubt, but he tends to wander aimlessly, which makes these difficult topics challenging to understand. A good editor would have helped immensely.Out of control also suffers from a lack of cohesion, and would be better served as a collection of separate essays about each topic, rather than a book that strives to espouse one overarching theme. As I was reading, I kept wondering where Kelly was going with all of his ideas, as a lack of drive seemed evident.Lest you think I have nothing but ill contempt for this book, there is a payoff: Kelly is a brilliant soothsayer, of sorts. This book was written 16 years ago, so hindsight can readily be applied, and Kelly's predictions about where science would be with relation to computers, nanotechnology, pharmaceuticals, this crazy thing called the ""Internet"" he kept mentioning, have nearly all come to fruition. Does this mean machines and computers develop their own biology, and begin truly thinking for themselves, as Kelly suggests? Time will only tell."

8,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112166097-barack-liu,5,"057-Out of Control-Kevin Kelly-Technology-1994Barack--""Balance is death. Flow is normal.""The first edition of ""Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, & the Economic World"" was published in 1994, a book on nature. It explores topics such as the relationship between life and machines, and the principles behind nature.Kevin Kelly was born in Pennsylvania in 1952. He studied at the University of Rhode Island. In 1970, he traveled to Asia and the Middle East as a photographer. In 1979, he rode a bicycle through parts of the United States. In 1993, he published Wired magazine. Representative works: ""Out of Control"", ""Necessity"", ""What Science and Technology Want"", etc.Many seemingly bland phenomena, when you think about it, you will find that there are some amazing laws hidden in it. We can even understand them as natural secrets. Perhaps this is the fascinating thinking process itself. Given a phenomenon, you can lead to countless possibilities.The book written by Kevin Kelly in the 1990s is still exciting even if it is read today, and some of these ideas may still be at the forefront of our times.At first, he deeply considered the relationship between machines and living things. Copernicus ruled out the gap between the earth and the rest of the physical universe. Then, Darwin ruled out the gap between humans and the rest of the organic world. Finally, Freud ruled out the gap between the rational world of the self and the unconscious irrational world.But we still face the fourth discontinuity, the discontinuity between humans and machines. Natural evolution emphasizes that we are apes; while artificial evolution may suggest that we are mental machines.Brainstorming is also a very interesting phenomenon. When the number of animals living together in a camp reaches a certain threshold, this group will have some new characteristics that cannot be reflected in the individual anyway. Some people may be fortunate to have seen the action of the bee colony. Of course, in most cases, this feeling comes from the ""animal world"" of childhood memories. But have you ever thought about the wisdom shown by tens of thousands of bees? Where did it come from?We may be deeply influenced by our feelings about the rigorous contingent of the human army and think that this is logical, but don’t forget the fact that these negligible brain bugs are not self-conscious. None of them can draw the whole picture of this great system that a human can have now in his mind. Moreover, each of them doesn't know what role each move will play on the whole.Humans have a commander who can control the entire army from the top, but even for the supercomputer with the most computing power in the world, a single circuit cannot imagine the amazing ability of the whole it belongs to. So naturally, people are suspicious. Where does the thinking of this giant beast hidden in the whole of groups of bees come from? Does it have a clear understanding of its overall picture?Distributed, my first impression of this concept came from learning about computer networks, but naturally, it is the energetic engineers who use this important concept of distribution to become fascinating. Incremental construction, the tight coupling of sensors and actuators, hierarchies independent of modules, decentralized control, and sparse communication, if you think carefully, they will not only exist in the textbooks that put you at risk.To a certain extent, human beings make laws and rules for all behaviors to put the entire material world in a balanced or orderly state. But is our nature so steady? Or is there another solution? Compared with other things in the universe, intelligence, consciousness, and even life are in a stable and unstable state.Life will never fall, and she will never get rid of the falling trend. She is always in a state of shaky. The uncertainty of life has created the driving force for evolution. New species form rapidly in a jumping manner. Once a new species is formed, it is in a conservative or evolutionary stagnation state, and there will be no significant changes in phenotype until the next species formation event. Evolution is between jumping and stagnation.Shulman melon will eventually lead me to the hall of the ultimate problem. Where does the self-conscience come from? Cybernetics gives such a puzzling answer: it emerged from itself. Just like Ouroboros. This is reminiscent of ""human existence theory"".If the development of human historical civilization is a game, then for players who stand in the perspective of God, where has the current progress bar reached?If human beings are also made. So, does it mean that humanity has developed into a situation where the creator can no longer control it? Or maybe the creator who created humans disappeared into the torrent of history for some reason, and his creation, human, survived because of a certain characteristic.If one day some kind of disaster occurs on the earth, all humans will perish, and the robot can survive. Do they look at their history as humans look at their history today?From the example of a bee colony, we can see that the wisdom emerging from the colony is higher than that of the individual. ""The Crowd"" expresses the view that the wisdom of the group is not as good as the wisdom of the individual. I don't think these two theories are either one or the other, but they each have their scope of application. So, what is this qualification?It's like we can't infer the tissue's behavior pattern from a single cell, nor can we infer an organ from a single tissue, infer a system from an organ, and infer a complete organism from the system.Is the so-called retrospective review of the whole life before death, because the part of the brain that stores memory is stimulated one by one?The network connects individuals. A network composed of individuals will inevitably produce certain qualities that individuals do not possess.When a system gives up all redundancy in pursuit of efficiency, he also gives up the opportunity for evolution. An overly ordered and linear system may also be a rigid and stifling innovation system. This is like our schedule. If our schedule is too harsh, then it is easy to become rigid. But if we are too arbitrary about the schedule, it is easy to cause inefficiency.Mark Pollen made some robot monsters and let them fight each other. This reminds me of the animated short film series ""Love, Death, and Robots"" directed by Tim Miller.Joshi said that a large number of low-level wisdom forms high-level wisdom. The ""The Crowd"" said that when many high-level pearls of wisdom are gathered together, they show lower wisdom.For example, when we see a pixel, we may not have any ideas, but when we see thousands or even tens of thousands of pixels, we can recognize the picture composed of it. What exactly makes us understand the things above these pixels and understand it?For example, in a market, we do not need other players to tell me their willingness to buy or sell. We only need to observe the price to know the impact of other people's behavior on the price.The author of ""Out of Control"" clearly disagrees with this view. He believes that consciousness cannot exist independently of the body. When our body does not exist, so does consciousness.If a mixture of human consciousness and matter is created by some pure spiritual creator. Then humans may have some advantages over our creator. Because a pure spiritual body may be easier to self-destruct.Just like the geometric problems we did in high school. To get an answer, we must do many auxiliary lines. But these guidelines are just to help us find the answer better. When the final answer is revealed, these auxiliary lines are no longer needed.Personal growth is like this. If we want to get a spaceship at the age of 40. We are not making 1/4 of a spaceship when we are 10 years old, making another 1/4 when we are 20 years old, and making 1/4 when we are 30 years old. Instead, he got a bicycle at the age of 10, an airplane at the age of 20, and an aircraft carrier at the age of 30. The results of each stage are self-running, not part of a larger thing.A typical example of co-evolution is between husband and wife. After a long life, both people are more and more like each other or are affected by each other.Absolute order probably only exists in non-living organisms. One way for a living body to maintain vitality is to tolerate the existence of certain chaos.So, how did the first life emerge from the dead and stable physical and chemical state? Who in the end spreads the seeds of chaos on the earth? Where does this push from 0 to 1 come from?16/02/1320/05/21"

12,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69801085-lee-kuiper,5,"What a book! Kevin Kelly writes with his typical clarity of expression and deep insight on topics that aren’t always so easy to understand and, somehow seemingly effortlessly, makes them easy to understand. If you are looking for a simple book, however, it might be best to look elsewhere. The range on this book is wide and the material is complex. Yet within the 472 pages exists a world of exciting and relevant ideas to explore and piece together.Although this book is over 25 years old (at the time I read it), very little of it seems outdated. In fact, I found it to be a good introduction to a lot of ideas in the burgeoning field of Complexity Science. It avoids the pitfalls of predictions-that-never-happened by examining and discussing the big picture and underlying ideas/principles behind topics such as technology and progress.As Kelly states early in the book we can learn a lot by studying the systems of the living world —the logic of the bios (or bio-logic). The systems we are creating —what he calls “the made” (algorithms, neural networks, deep learning, AI, even market economics)— when successful, are mirroring patterns already exhibited in systems in the natural, living world —what he calls “the born.” Kelly argues that what exists between both the made and the born are guided by the exact same underlying rules and principles —they, in a sense, have a common soul. Rather than fall into mysticism or new age spirituality Kelly dives headlong into the diversity of scientific research to analyze this “common soul,” the underlying rules and principles guiding intelligence systems. He coins a term to unite both made and born systems of intelligence: “vivisystems.” The book’s title, Out of Control, is based on the fact that vivisystems are highly intelligent and highly adaptable (survivable) but only truly succeed when they exist outside of human control. Perhaps many are threatened by the fear of having to let go of control (while others are excited by the unbounded potential that can come from it) yet Kelly calmly and matter-of-factly explains how lack of central control has always been the case as seen in all large, intelligent (vivi)systems.The first part of the book goes in depth looking at the born: bee swarms and hives, ant colonies, school of fish, flocks of birds, whole ecosystems, symbiotic relationships in plants and animals and how, over time, coevolution can lead to bizarre, if not successful, strategies of survival as they become more codependent. Later Kelly synthesizes examples of how we are learning the reasons behind the functional success operating within and behind these phenomena in the natural world and how our research and development is (and has been) accelerating technological and societal progress by modeling these principles and methods in digital, computational, industrial, etc. realms.Without letting this review get lost in the immense depth and detail of this book, suffice it to say what I mentioned so far only scratches the surface of the first pages. Every chapter is overflowing with interesting thoughts, ideas, questions, imaginings, examples and stories from ecology, biology, symbiosis, natural selection, swarms, hive mind, (emergent) order, chaos, history and technological development, physics, chemistry, systems intelligence, the invisible hand, networks, economics and e-currency, collaboration, adaptation, robotics, video games, VR, linear computation and quantum computing, artificial evolution and genetic algorithms, evolution theory, Darwinian and Lamarckian evolution, memetics, the evolution of evolution, life, intelligence, and becoming.But listing all these things and expecting you to be convinced to read this book is akin to telling you 2+2=4. Fascinatingly, as Kelly explores, “Here 2 + 2 does not equal 4; it does not even surprise with 5. In the logic of emergence, 2 + 2 = apples… [a qualitative change in direction].” All of the topics in this book, when read together create something altogether different. It is more than surprising, it is paradigm changing.Kelly doesn’t explicitly pound his central thesis into your head so repeatedly as to be annoying and redundant but rather lays out examples from the widest range of topics, allowing the reader to fit all the pieces together. If you take the time to engage with this book an altogether new and unexpected way of understanding life will emerge. It is not a fast read but it is a very rewarding one."

But is the balloon really unpredictable? if you tried to solve the equations for the balloon’s crazy flitter, its path would be nonlinear, therefore almost unsolvable, and therefore unforeseeable. yet, a teenager reared on nintendo could learn how to catch the balloon. not infallibly, but better than chance. after a couple dozen tries, the teenage brain begins to mould a theory—an intuition, an induction—based on the data. after a thousand balloon take offs, his brain has modeled some aspect of the rubber’s flight. It cannot predict precisely where the balloon will land, but it detects a direction the missile favors, say, to the rear of the launch or following a certain pattern of loops. Perhaps overtime, the balloon-catcher hits 10 percent more than chance would dictate. For balloon catching, what more do you need? in some games, one doesn’t require much information to make a prediction that is useful. while running from lions, or investing in stocks, the tiniest edge over raw luck is significant.

By running those simulations in many directions the team quickly learned that airpower would be the decisive key in this war. Further refined iterations clearly showed the war gamers that if airpower was successful, the U.S. war would be successful.

This law says that the shape of the ending is symmetrical to the shape of the beginning - Cyclic Waves: The apparent complex behavior of a system is partly a reflection of the complex structure of the system’s environment. This was pointed out over 30 years ago by herbert simon, who used the journey of an ant over the ground as an illustration. The ant’s jig-jagging path across the soil reflected not the ant’s complex locomotion but the complex structure of its environment. according to Modis, cyclic phenomenon in nature can infuse a cyclic flavor to systems running within itTogether, these three modes of prediction suggest that at certain moments of heightened visibility, the invisible pattern of order becomes clear to those paying attention. Pockets of prediction won’t keep away big surprises. But an image of an approaching predator becomes information about the future now.

It's a tough and long read, but the author is so full of energy, curiosity and obsession with the topic, it is super entertaining to read.The ideas could have been distilled into a much shorter volume, of course, and some of the chapters felt a bit redundant to me, but overall I would say author really tried to shed light on a complicated topic from all possible angles.The amount of research that must have gone into this boggles my mind.This book asks big questions:1. What is life?2. What is intelligence/consciousness?3. What is evolution?I find it unbelievable that this was written some 20 years ago. If these people have thought so sharply at that time, now that most of their predictions have come true and are slowly drifting into mainstream consciousness, I must wonder what these people are theorising about TODAY.Overall, there is little actionable knowledge in this book, but it helped me to make A LOT MORE SENSE of this chaotic and hyper connected world we are living in today. Someone who is in their teens/twenties today and needs to decide how to align their life should devour this book.If you are on a quest, I'd recommend to read The Sovereign Individual, Sapiens, Homo Deus and then this.

Each chapter is rich in its content to be an independent book. Need constant break for digestion which makes it like reading a dictionary (in a respectful way!). So far, KK's many ""apocalypse"" of technology or society development has come true. He mentioned at the Q&A in the end that in the future (of a shared-hardware world), it's not the ownership of information, but the access to information, is key to power/success/everything that we define as most valuable. Curious to see when that will happen. "

29,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36852749-stone,4,"It took me almost an entire year to finally finish this voluminous big cover. During this time period, I've already read Mr.Kelly's What Technology Wants What Technology Wants, which seems to correspond a lot to the prophecies in this 1994 book. As a result, my assessment on this book is more or less influenced by my judgement on the other one.Undisputed, Kevin Kelly was a great prognosticator of literally everything that took place in the information age, probably the best of his kind in Silicon Valley. Most of the predictions he made in this book have not only become true but extend further into the horizon---simply take a quick look at all the wearable devices and neurosensational contraptions we start putting on our body and even inside of our intestines these days. What enables him to make such accurate predictions, in my view, is the ""ultra futuristic optimistic progressiveness"" denounced by some commentators. The view that the tomorrow will get better is in any time unheard of throughout the human history until the explosion of science and technologies in the last 300 years. Both the million-year-old genetical intuition engraved in our DNAs and the millennial-old traditional teachings and indoctrinations are trying to persuade us to believe that we're still living under the same circumstance when in reality we are on the verge of an unprecedented transitional period and everything tends to get better off day by day.Despite the criticism made for Mr.Kelly's over-exaggeration of the role of machines and the ""delusional optimism"" of a combined human-technology ecosystem, I highly praise his work for two main reasons:1) He clearly identified the trend of the integration of biology and genetics with information technology for both the industry and the society. I was personally inspired by this observation that I started devising my own blueprint of a future full of bionic structures, cyborgs, and organic machineries that act just like living organisms.2) He established a holistic view of the effects of the advancement of machines in our ages. His insight on this tendency was not limited only to tech field but rather extended it to all the aspects of our society. This may well be reflected his 1999 book New Rules for New Economy. New Rules for the New Economy"
30,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6782642-wil-michael,5,"Out of Control is one of the most different and interesting books I have read to date. Kelly beautifully describes the complex and simple structures we find throughout the networks in life. He describes things like hive behavior that make you rethink a beehive as rather then a bunch of dumb drones instead as a single super intelligent being. He delves into human psychology and the interworking of a human mob and its ability to function even without direct communication between those in the network. His story is read like poetry at times, which is surprising considering how much of it is about super complex systems of life. This book has certainly gotten me interested in chaos theory as it is quite interesting and mysterious. Before reading this book I looked at the world around me as simple and straightforward, now I see it as thousands of interconnected networks trying to survive together in a brutal world. This book is a bit old so it is amazing to see some of Kelley's theories proven and put into practice. However this was quite a hard book for me to read as it is not like a novel where you find yourself lost in the content of the pages. Constantly I found myself looking up things like collective unconsciousness and hive behaviour on google. The book itself is separated by its main points so it could have been written as a series of books. Overall I would totally recommend this book to anyone, and dont worry if it takes you a year of reading little chunks to finish it."
31,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"In this well researched book, Kevin Kelly explores how agency emerges out of organization -- that the casual chain of ""where decisions are made"" isn't always locatable as a property of supervenience. Though a series of explorations (biospheres, cybernetics, group actions through crowd-feedback, evolutionary emergent behaviors, and so on), Kelly suggests that various causal chains can be complexified and managed but are often reliant on technocractic algorithms rather than human understanding. We reach our limit in grasping agency when group coherency is built out of several hundred+ factors but the suggestion that understanding is possible seems to be the undercurrent of Kelly's very interesting exploration.Towards the end, Kelly suggests an aesthetic list, one which if followed is meant to outline the possibility for extending understanding to the next level, to grasp emergent agencies. This is a bucketlist that treats the entire idea that things are ""out of control"" as being possibly ""in control"". He could have explored more in the direction of consciousness, but I suspect that Kelly shied away from this in order to maintain an organic but ""machinic"" (in the Deleuzian sense) view of agency.Some of the examples today may be somewhat outdated, but this was a fascinating book to read. Well worth the effort."
32,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158289-scott-neal-reilly,5,"This is a great book. It covers a huge amount of material on complex systems, from robotics to economics to human psychology to ecology and more. Kevin Kelley is able to present relatively complex ideas like a well-versed scientist, but do it with the simple, engaging clarity of an excellent writer. There were a couple of pages that related to a project that I worked on back in grad school and where I know that he didn't get the material quite right, so I suspect that he was not perfectly true to all of the material/people/projects that he covered, but I've also seen the same work butchered a lot worse than he did, and, in the end, I still mostly agreed with his main points.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in complex systems. It's also the kind of book that I would even consider reading again (if I had time for that kind of thing)."
33,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931699-jeremy,5,"What a book! I will be thinking about the concepts and ideas presented in this book for a long, long time. Kelly is a little more at home writing magazine articles, and sometimes the book lacks a coherent thesis, but that is more than made up for with wonderful prose, and an unbridled excitement for his subject.This book attempts to dissect the study of the unpredictable. From biological evolution to artificial intelligence to economies, it examines how and why complex, unpredictable systems form, and how they can be managed and created.This book was written in 1994, but it very rarely feels dated. The problems and concepts that technology was dealing with have become, if anything, more embedded and more interesting now. This book is a wonderful guide to anyone trying to navigate today's networked world."
34,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12705473-william-crosby,4,"Extensive discussion of the development of neo-biological systems and the melding of biology and technology.

Still, the often metaphorical and lyrical style of writing was a nice change from a dry textbook.One of the main points: that which we create can become autonomous, adaptable and out of our complete control.A few of the many concepts discussed: autonomous distributed systems, AI, hive mind, supermind, moreness, swarm model, coevolution, prairies, stable instability, game theory, variant disequilibrium, closed vs open systems, carbon, biosphere, smart eco-houses, ecological technology, neobiology, networks, sims, artificial evolution, genetic algorithms, connectionism, parallel processing, virtual ants, CAD, post-darwinism, symbiosis, saltation, spontaneous order, net math, crystallization, autocatalysts."
35,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175986-jennifer,4,"I didn't read the whole thing, but just the first few chapters. I think it was sufficient for my purposes, but also very relevant. I love it when descriptions of natural systems match what you note about your own life or about God's purposes. It was somehow comforting to read the way biological systems organize (bottom-up, diversified, disorganized, and uncontrolled) and find that this way has advantages over our own way of organization (top-down, goal-oriented, organized, controlled). I'll have to come back to finish it in the future."

37,0201483408,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31104786-dave-peticolas,3,"This is an extended meditation on the idea that the worlds of biology and technology are converging, with consequences for both. Along the way we meet lots of interesting thinkers and doers and see what sort of crazy things some of them have been up to (Biosphere 2 anyone?).Kelley's a pretty good writer and, while all of his theses don't ultimately mesh together, I can't recall reading another book with as many densely packed ideas as this one.
