2,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2020377-peter-lobell,5,"Paul Davies is a working physicist who believes that the universe is not an accident, that the laws science has discovered have a special form that links the human mind with the physical world. You may agree or disagree, but this book will make you think. Recommended to anyone who thinks about science and religion, either together or separately."
3,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2475981-christopher-sutch,3,"This book is a great argument for the contention that physicists should not write books concerned with metaphysics. Davies, like others in his profession, normally follows empirical reasoning and evidence...EXCEPT in his thinking about ""religion,"" ""god,"" and the destiny of humanity. In those instances, his reasoning becomes trite and circular. Just because some scientists wish that humanity was not just a random event in the universe doesn't mean that there must be a grand destiny for us; that merely replicates, on a large scale, the logical shortcomings the anthropic principle. Still, there are some very interesting ideas to play with here, so long as one avoids the easy temptation toward positivism (another logical error exhibited by physicists with a metaphysical bent)."
4,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3667979-stephanie-h,2,"Once upon a time, I thought Paul Davies was awesome. I read ""About Time"" for a Physics for Poets and Philosophers class and it was so accessible and fantastic. I thought all his books would be fantastic, but this was lackluster.Paul Davies makes it perfectly clear that he's a deist -- a believer in God the watchmaker or God the ultimate architect. He's not as pushy about his beliefs like Dawkins is in his books, but he is very very redundant. 200 pages later, we've covered the randomness of quarks, the beauty of pi, the idea of parallel universes and the necessity of the universe being just right for life. Yet this is a book that could have been written in a lot fewer pages. He doesn't try to introduce any universal theory, of everything, but states purely that the existence of everything is too complex for the mere random arrangement of quarks. It was a good idea, but poorly executed. "
5,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"A very enjoyable, interesting and rewarding book. The author is not afraid to tackle the most fundamental questions about the Universe, science/mathematics, consciousness and their fascinating mutual inter-relationships. And he does it in a deep but accessible way, combining a scientific approach/overview with interesting philosophical insights. He is one of the few scientists who are not afraid to be politically incorrect in his positions, and who honestly explores the deep ontological and epistemological questions that have confronted humankind since the ancient Greeks - and he does it approaching the issues from several perspectives, coming to conclusions/insights with which I mostly strongly agree. Excellent book. "

7,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,5,"	I just finished a book that required my full attention and challenged many of the assumptions I had about a divide between god and science. This book I would say is one of the most challenging science slash philosophy book I have completed, but one of the most rewarding. What this book proposes is that science is a limited tool but one that can allow us to gather evidence of god. This is suggested by the mysteries that lie outside the scientific realm (mainly the existence of the laws of physics and consciousness) and the limitations of science and mathematical reasoning. Even though these are two of the chief ways of discovering the truth, they have their limitations, which before reading this book I did not fully understand. This book also proposes a kind of reverential or mystical awe of the world that is furthered through an understanding in science. Therefore it avoids many of the pitfalls of conventional religion and instead simply revers god, the absolute, the infinite, call it what you well. That this book is able to combine science and mysticism though a detailed and concise review of contemporary physics sets it apart as something special.	Science, though beautiful, is limited. It is limited primarily because it uses inductive reasoning, which at best can say something is very likely to happen but never certain. It is further limited because it assumes the world is rational, when there very well may certain questions that lie outside the scope of its reach or do not conform with our assumption of rationality. Mathematics faces similar problems. Both are invaluable, but I did not understand their limitations or the leaps of faith required in following either field.	Another strong aspect of this book is that it does not cling to any one possible explanation or route of reasoning. Instead it proposes many different theories that support its hypothesis of an ordered yet potentially evolving universe. It leaves room for indeterminism and becoming at the individual and even universal scale. In order to support these claims, the author uses many arguments. The bulk of them are from science, explaining the laws of physics, the connection between matter and energy, singularity at the moment of the big bang, quantum mechanics, the elegance of mathematical formulas, the existence of consciousness and others, but he also strays into other somewhat philosophical justifications including the existence of beauty, the potential power of mysticism, and a somewhat Platonic realm of existence. For me, the Platonic argument rang very hollow (as did his explanation of game theory or computer simulation universes), but because that was only one of many strands of evidence employed, I could easily disagree with him in that specific area but agree with him overall. This is a strength of the book, it presents many different options and leaves room for disagreement. It is not limited by a dogma it must defend, but rather open to many different ideas.	One of the most beautiful parts of the book involves a discussion of “existence is this paradoxical conjunction of begin and becoming.” While I usually think of this on a philosophical level and interpret it simply on the realm of people and other animate objects, Davies extends the idea of being and becoming to the universe itself. He calls this process theory, and he says that the universe may in fact be evolving and changing in an indeterministic way much like the individuals who inhabit and actively participate in this change. It “asserts the primacy of becoming over being” 184. That’s a mind blowing idea. Interestingly enough, the idea of a timeless god juxtaposed with a changing physical universe is full of ideological problems, which Acquinas and Augustine among others tried to reconcile. Davie’s theory of an evolving universe that is simply a part of god avoids these pitfalls.	It may also be helpful to describe the three basic notions of god that exist – deism, theism, and pantheism. Deism is “belief in a divine being who starts the universe off and then ‘sits back’ to watch event unfold, taking no direct part in subsequent affairs.” (all these quotes will be from page 43) Secondly comes theism “belief in a god is who creator of the universe, but who also remains directly involved in the day-to-day running of the world, between creator and creature.” Finally comes pantheism where “no such separation is made between god and the physical universe.” I feel myself most comfortably in the last camp, due to the presence of god that I see in others and the physical world. I think Davies is also in this camp, though he may attribute a bit of the watchmaker theist god in terms of the evolving universe. That I can’t quite pin down what he believes in points to the author’s fairness in presenting different ideas without advocating his own at the expense of another.	Perhaps the main argument Davies uses, and I would say rather brilliantly, is that he doesn’t use matter as his main piece of evidence, but rather the existence of overarching physical laws as evidence as to god’s hand in the universe. “[According to Stephen Hawking] The universe of space-time is internally consistent and self-contained. Its existence does not require anything outside of it; specifically, no prime mover is needed…Given the laws of physics, the universe can, so to speak, take care of itself, including its own creation. But where to do these laws come from? Must we, in turn, find an explanation for them?” 68. While most contemporary scientists are content to ignore wondering about the origins of these laws (one could say they make a leap of faith in this area), Davies explores this subject brilliantly. For Davies, these laws are godlike. They are universal, perfect, absolute, omnipotent, and eternal. Isn’t it funny that these are attributes religions often give to their gods? I think this is one of the strongest and most compelling points of the book, scientific laws are clues of god that we can glimpse and study as they are imbedded in the universe.	Equally fascinating is how Davies clearly values science and math and yet recognizes their limitations and ascribes them a level of uncertainty due to quantum mechanics. I had no idea that there are hosts of unsolvable problems and uncomputable numbers in mathematics, or the connection of uncertainty in quantum mechanics to both mathematics and science. “Underlying the complexity of nature is the simplicity of physics” 135, what a beautiful sentence, and what a deeper mystery it points to. Through science we discover the world is simultaneously algorithmically compressible and open to organized complexity, which allows us to be in deterministically open to creating our own path. So cool.	What is ultimately beautiful about this book is it admits that human reasoning and the scientific method may not be enough to answer all our questions, in particular the ultimate questions or metaphysical questions. However, it only arrives at this conclusion after a careful study of science, not just a casual dismissal. This is an author who thoroughly understands science, and does a good job of communicating that eloquence to the reader. This is also an author who understands the limitations of science and the leaps of faith one takes while being a follower of science. I guess I’m proud to consider myself in the same camp as Davies, a student of science and a happy participant in this cosmic mystery that is god’s dream. A damn good book.Quotes“There remains that odd problem about the end of the explanatory chain [achieved by reductionism]. However successful our scientific explanations may be, they always have certain starting assumptions built in…sooner or later we all have to accept something as given, whether it is god, or logic, or a set of laws, or some other foundation for existence. Thus ‘ultimate’ questions will always lie beyond the scope of empirical science as it is usually defined.” 15“Far from exposing human being as incidental products of blind physical forces, science suggests that the existence of conscious organisms is a fundamental feature of the universe. We have been written into the laws of nature in a deep and, I believe, meaningful way…Science is a noble and enriching quest that helps us to make sense of the world in an objective and methodical manner. It does not deny a meaning behind existence. On the contrary.” 21“This cosmic order is underpinned by definite mathematical laws that interweave each other to form a subtle and harmonious unity.” 21“Science is founded on the hope that the world is rational in all its observable aspects. It is possible that there may be some facets of reality which lie beyond the power of human reasoning.” 24“Thinking is a process. Being is a state. When I think, my mental state changes with time. But the ‘me’ to which the mental state refers remains the same. This is probably the oldest metaphysical problem in the book…Through our own selves constitute our primary experience, we also perceive an external world, and we project onto that world the same paradoxical conjunction of process and being, of the temporal and the atemporal. On the one hand, the world continues to exist; on the other hand, it changes...Superimposed on this backdrop of being in continual change. Things happen. The present fades into the past, and the future ‘comes into being’: the phenomenon of be-coming. What we call ‘existence’ is this paradoxical conjunction of begin and becoming.” 34“Heisenberg’s uncertainty principal…this unpredicatablitiy implies that the microworld is indeterministic: to use Einstein’s picturesque phraseology, god plays dice with the universe…by weakening the link between cause and effect, quantum mechanics provides a subtle way for us to circumvent the origin of the universe problem.” 61“The essence of the dispute is whether one is simply to accept the explosive appearance of the universe as a bald, unexplained fact – something belonging to the ‘that’s-that’ category – or to seek some more satisfying explanation.” 60“[According to Stephen Hawking] The universe of space-time is internally consistent and self-contained. Its existence does not require anything outside of it; specifically, no prime mover is needed…Given the laws of physics, the universe can, so to speak, take care of itself, including its own creation. But where to do these laws come from? Must we, in turn, find an explanation for them?” 68.“The existence of regularities in nature is an objective mathematical fact. On the other hand, the statements called laws that are found in textbooks clearly are human inventions, but inventions designed to reflect, albeit imperfectly, actually existing properties of nature. Without this assumption that the regularities are real, science is reduced to a meaningless charade.” 81“No one who is closed off from mathematics can ever grasp the full significance of the natural order that is woven so deeply into the fabric of physical reality.” 93“Is it not a miracle that the universe is so constructed that such a simple abstraction as number is possible?” 108It appears as if there is a kind of randomness or uncertainty (dare I call it ‘free will’) built into the Life universe, as indeed there is in the real universe, due to the restrictions of logic itself, as soon as systems become complex enough to engage in self-reference. 115The popular image of mathematics as a collection of precise facts, linked together by well-defined logical paths, is revealed to be false. There is randomness and hence uncertainty in mathematics, just as there is in physics. 133The world is ordered both in the sense of being algorithmically compressible, and in the sense of having depth. The order of the cosmos is more than mere regimented regularity, it is also organized complexity, and it is from the latter that the universe derives its openness and permits the existence of human beings with free will. 139‘The book of nature,’ opined Galileo, ‘is written in mathematical language.’ Why this should be so is one of the great mysteries of the universe…There are two broadly opposed schools of thought concerning its character. The first of these holds that mathematics is purely a human invention, the second is that it has an independent existence. 141If beauty is more than mere biology at work, if our aesthetic appreciation stems from contact with something firmer and more pervasive, then it is surely a fact of major significance that the fundamental laws of the universe seem to reflect this ‘something.’ 176Process though is an attempt to view the world not as a collection of objects, or even as a set of events, but as a process with a definitive directionality. The flux of time thus plays a key role in process philosophy, which asserts the primacy of becoming over being…process philosophy stresses the openness and indeterminism of nature. The future is not implicit in the present. 181Is this not to admit an element of irrationality into the world? Einstein thought so (“God does not play dice with the universe!”). This was why he could never accept that quantum mechanics is another complete description of reality. But one man’s irrationality is another person’s creativity. And there is a difference between stochasticity and anarchy. The development of new forms and systems is subject to general principles of organization that guide and encourage, rather than compel, matter and energy to develop along certain predetermined pathways of evolution…One might say there is order in disorder. Even chaos can possess statistical regularities. 192The world contains individual objects and systems, but they are structured such that, taken together, they form a unified and consistent whole…The life cycle of stars provide just one example of the ingenious and seemingly contrived way in which the large-scale and small-scale aspects of physics are closely intertwined to produce complex variety in nature. 197All three of the above arguments [regarding the existence of the universe] are founded on the assumption of human rationality: that it is legitimate to seek ‘explanations’ for things, and that we truly understand something only when it is ‘explained.’ Yet it has to be admitted that our concept of rational explanation probably derives from our observations of the world and our evolutionary inheritance. It is clear that this provides adequate guidance when we are tangling with ultimate questions? Might it not be the case that the reason for existence has no explanation in the usual sense? This does not mean that the universe is absurd and meaningless, only that an understanding of its existence and properties lies outside the usual categories of rational human thought. 225[Regarding mystical experiences] the language used to describe these experiences usually reflects the culture of the individual concerned. Western mystics tend to emphasize the personal quality of the presence, often describing themselves as being with someone, usually god, who is different from themselves but with whom a deep bond is felt…Eastern mystics emphasize the wholeness of existence and tend to identify themselves more closely with the presence. 227According to Rudy Rucker [apparently a guy who trips pretty often] ‘the central teaching of mysticism is this: reality is one. The practice of mysticism consists in finding ways to experience this unity directly. The One has variously been called the good, god, the cosmos, the mind, the void, or (perhaps most neutrally) the absolute. No door in the labyrinthine castle of science opens directly onto the absolute. But if one understands the maze well enough, it is possible to jump out of the system and experience the absolute for oneself. 228We, who are children of the universe – animated stardust – can nevertheless reflect on the nature of that same universe, even to the extent of glimpsing the rules on which it runs. How we have become linked into this cosmic dimension is a mystery. Yet the linkage cannot be denied. 232"
8,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james,2,"The Mind of God by Paul Davies is subtitled The Scientific Basis for a Rational World, it is both a tour and explanation of theories, physical and metaphysical, regarding ultimate causes. Its title comes from a quotation from Stephen Hawking: ""If we do discover a theory of everything...it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we would truly know the mind of God.""In the preface, Davies explains that he has been interested in ultimate causes since childhood, having annoyed his parents with unending ""why's"" about everything, with each answer demanding another ""why,"" and usually ending with the reply, ""Because God made it that way, and that's that!"" Davies' narrative explores: the nature of reason, belief, and metaphysics; theories of the origin of the universe; the laws of nature; the relationship of mathematics to physics; a few arguments for the existence of God; the possibility that the universe shows evidence of intelligent design; and his opinion of the implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorem, that ""the search for a closed logical scheme that provides a complete and self-consistent explanation is doomed to failure."""

10,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122610-jef-sneider,4,"Paul Davies is really smart. At least he is a lot smarter than I am, or he makes me feel that he is a lot smarter than I am. I am sure that he knows a lot about math and physics. Parts of this book are dense with explanations of mathematical theories and physics that can help us understand the complexity and beautiful simplicity of the universe. Is the universe describable in simple equations like E=((MC) squared) because we like to think in simple terms or because it was designed that way, or maybe because it had to be that way for us to exist to understand it in the first place. Why should the universe even be a place that we can understand at all? Is it because we ourselves are made of the same stuff as the universe and work in a way that gives us an innate ability to think in ways that make the world understandable? My mother-in-law gave me this book after she finished it. I don't know how she read it. She says she just skimmed over the parts she didn't understand. That could have been a lot of the book. In any event, I learned less about God and more about physics and math from Davies. My conclusion is that what we have discovered about quantum mechanics and the probabilities that govern subatomic activities contains the clues to all the answers to all our questions about existence. Life seems amazingly improbable, but we are here. Just like the survivor of a catastrophe, many coincidences and fortuitous events had to occur for life to happen. If we were to see it in a movie, we'd find it improbable. But it happens. Life happens, and happened. It almost seems like it had to happen, in retrospect.The universe is an amazing place and Paul Davies helps us see our improbable place in it. It was fun and challenging to read, and I'll keep looking for the answers to those questions."

Davies tackles the question of our universe in its evolution, its order and its destruction and the possibility of an intelligence behind it.

It wasn't always easy but I think I've lined up all the blocks now. Saying that, I may need to read it again a couple of times, just to be sure. I'll report back sometime around 2020.When I first read about the theories of an infinite number of parallel universes and the anthropic principle, I thought I had an answer to the god question. But then Davies blows it away with a reference to Occam's razor. In the last chapter. What a tease.Back to the drawing board."

The very fact that a very very fine tuning of the laws are needed even for the simplest life forms to develop, kinda provides prima facie evidence of 'supernatural' design or plan.Even Stephen Hawking, a self confirmed atheist and British astrophysicist could not resist comparing the precise and elegant laws of nature to peering into the mind of God. This is the famous quote. ""Then we shall… be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason - for then we would know the mind of God.""The Goldilocks enigma and the unanswered questions concerning on who or what caused the ""Big Bang"" kind of directly points towards intelligent design. No wonder multitudes of scientists are abandoning the ""Big Bang"" theory and openly embracing and promoting the alternate theory of the universe, namely, the ""multiverse theory"" to cut the ground from beneath intelligent design.I definitely recommend this book to anyone who has been amazed and fascinated by not only the existence of this universe we live in but our very own existence, and how this is made possible, seemingly by these fundamental but very elegant and precise laws of mathematics and physics.

15,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16304535-unni-krishnan,3,"A very good and comprehensive overview of almost all possible ideas about God. But keep in mind that his is a rational quest about the concept of God. So, the discussions are always about the philosophy of the religions, based on rationality rather than on any belief or dogma. So don't expect anything dramatic here.It starts with exploring the God concepts from the old theological scholars. Although he tries to cover the principles from many religions, often the discussions tend to give prominence to Christian God concept. Slowly the discussion moves to modern science and computation. Here we see how comprehensive is his approach. He takes each topic and covers it in all width. The modern scientific principles bring out lot of difficulties to the meta physics such as the existence of myriads of constants that are the prerequisites of the existence of life on earth. The compute-ability topics makes this discussion even harder.I found this book very useful since it gives me a basic education in the god concept that is evolved in the past couple of thousand years. So, when any idea about the God arises, I will know clearly whether this has been already put forward previously and if by whom and what are its merits and de-merits. I don't have to waste my mental space by clinging to ideas that are discarded long ago and can always concentrate on fresh thoughts. "
16,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Turtle trouble?Paul Davies is perhaps the most prominent of a nouveau species of scientist: the philosopher physicist. Here in The Mind of God he goes all out in an attempt to ""trace the logic of scientific rationality back as far as it will go in the search for ultimate answers to the mystery of existence."" (p. 223) And yes he runs into ""turtle trouble."" (You'll recall that the world is a flat plate resting on the back of a giant turtle… And what is the turtle resting on? Another turtle. And what is that turtle resting on? Uh…it's turtles all the way down.)I think it's fair to say--and this is my belief--that the human mind cannot fully grasp the whole of which it is a part, nor can it see beyond a certain distance, either out into the cosmos or into the very small, instead only to somewhere near the Big Bang, and only tentatively into the future, to the Planck limit perhaps. Clearly the mind of any God worthy of the appellation is far, far beyond our reach. And as for a theory of everything? Well, someday there may be a broken statue in the sand like that of Ozymandias, only this time it won't be that of an emperor drunk with self-importance, but of a humble physicist looking for a TOE.Davies is a recipient (1995) of the Templeton Prize which is given to people whom the judges think foster human understanding of divine creativity. Typically they like to give it to a scientist who believes in God, although the Rev. Billy Graham and the born-again Charles Colson of Watergate infamy have been recipients. After reading this book, and just from what is in this book, I believe that Davies does believe in God, but in a God that is a bit removed from the personal gods of the major Western religions. (But you might want to Google ""Paul Davies"" yourself and get a more definitive statement--or not, since what he writes in this book speaks for itself.) He clearly believes in free will (see page 139) and in a universe that could easily be designed. He also believes in ""the progressive nature of biological evolution"" (p. 183) which is a no-no for most evolutionary biologists, and in something he sometimes calls ""the good"" or simply ""good"" (e.g., p 183 and elsewhere). In short Davies is a man straddling two worlds, that of science and religion, who is finding a consilience in philosophy.Let's look at some of the ideas and discussions in the book, most of which are still viable and fascinating even though the book was first published in 1992.On the famous, often asked question, ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" the gist of an answer coming from much of what Davies writes is, ""it couldn't be otherwise."" From my point of view, the best way to say much the same thing is to recognize that nonbeing has no meaning without being. Of course this subjects the cosmos to the limitations of human logic! But that is what a lot of this book is about, the limits of human logic and human understanding.Another point nicely made by Davies is that the incompleteness theorems of Godel and the self-referential paradox from Russell strongly suggest that we cannot hope to understand the universe. Those are logical obstacles. A physical one is the problem of getting to the Big Bang as opposed to getting very, very, very close to the Big Bang, which is where we are now and where we are likely to stay. In fact, Davies argues somewhere here that even if we could get to the very instance of the Big Bang that would not explain everything.Davies is decidedly not a postmodernist. He believes that we discover the laws of the universe. He even sees mathematics as a discovery. However, I think some of the philosophical difficulties in this book would resolve a bit if Davies kept in mind that mathematics is a language, a very precise language with a great grasp but a language that so far as we know is only spoken by human beings. Davies is of the school that finds it surprising that mathematics should be so effective in describing and helping us to order the world. Personally, I am not so surprised since mathematics is part and parcel of the world, as inescapable as the law of gravity. The essence of mathematics is abstraction which is the talent that most clearly separates us from other animals. Mathematic abstraction comes from verbal abstraction, an evolutionary adaptation which allowed us to talk and think concretely about yesterday and tomorrow and things not in our immediate presence.It appears that Davies believes in God as ""a necessary being."" He argues that ""if""--Davies uses the conditional a lot, perhaps to avoid making the direct statement--""if the universe really has an explanation and it can't explain itself, then it must be explained by something outside itself--e.g., God. But what, then, explains God? This age-old…conundrum is in danger of pitching us into an infinite regress. The only escape, it would seem, is to assume that God can somehow 'explain himself,' which is to say that God is a necessary being…"" (p. 177) Personally, I am not so unenamored with the infinite regress. In fact my mind cannot avoid it, despite the ""turtles all the way down"" parody.As for marveling at the various ""lucky flukes"" (Fred Hoyle's term) of physics that allow us to exist in this universe (c.f., the anthropic principle), I want to say that had things been different, there would be no one around to do the marveling--no one around, no marveling--or those doing the marveling would be different from us in such a way as to be the recipients of some other lucky flukes of matter and energy, which they would marvel at.This is the kind of book--delightful as it is--that makes one understand the need for experimental proof! --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

19,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4226361-scott-smith,4,"Paul Davies is a professor at Arizona State that came into my class the other day to speak to us. He's a super cool guy, it was great to hear him. This book is just sort of a philosophical discussion of how science and religion coexist. I don't agree with a lot of it per se. But it is well done."

21,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46693885-lambda-moses,4,"Not 5 stars, since much of this book does not present coherent arguments and is too speculative, especially when it comes to likening the world to a computer. But not a worse rating since number one, it touches upon different views in some of the most interesting and important aspects of the science and religion dialogue, and number two, the speculations in this book are really interesting. From this book, I clearly see the author's deep understanding of physics, but also his lack of expertise in biology. Here I see that physicists are marveling about the elegance of natural laws. But biologists have a different perspective, as biologists see more of the chaotic side of the universe, such as why so much suffering and waste in evolution (problem of natural evil)? Do all biological features have purpose, such as the dark matter in the genome (what counts as function is already quite controversial)? What shall we say when some biological functions are inefficient, such as rubisco? Those pose theological questions, especially challenges to the argument from design, that should be discussed. So in sum, I recommend this book as an introduction to the field science and religion, as it touches upon many important aspects of that field, but this shouldn't be the only book you read in this field."
22,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17215856-syntaxxed,4,"I generally like the prose with which scientists (in the broader term) write. Never, anywhere in the book, does Davies put forward a wild assumption. Instead, he invites you on this sight-seeing journey with him, demonstrating what other influential philosophers, theologians and physicists have already said about the matter throughout the ages. Not only is this well-presented, a brief contextual framework is also given as to explain why these people came to their respective conclusions. I was thrilled to read the mention of David Bohm, a physicist of whom I’d already read a postulated theory for a holographic universe. Of course, this remains a theory and although a lot of research has been made in favor of it, the same can be said for different theories on the universe. (Still, it stuck with me, though this is just a matter of personal taste, I suppose. )The book doesn’t reach a definite conclusion, but rather something which the autor likes to believe, based on the evidence. He ends this predominantly scientific book on a mystical note, without throwing you off. If you ever needed a thorough examination of the metaphysical through the eyes of a physicist, this is definitely the book for you. "
23,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,4,"Makes an interesting for case for belief in God. I checked this out because the title brought to mind George Berkeley's philosophy that the universe is the mind of God. Though Davies doesn't really mention Berkeley, he does give an argument for the laws of the universe being synthetic (not formalistic due to Gödel's impossibility theorem of purely deducing true statements) and contingent on a process like a supercomputer outside of space and time which creates the regularities of physical laws through quantum processes for the ethical reason that an ordered universe is better than a disordered one, as the order of our universe is contingent not necessary and thereby suggests some intentional design. Davies' argument is strange, arguing for God's existence by the radical contingency of the universe rather than by logical necessity as with the popular cosmological, ontological, teleological arguments. Gives a unique perspective. Though Davies maintains that such arguments don't necessarily prove the existence of God or its nature, merely that it is reasonable as is our belief in other unobservables. I myself believe in some kind of creative force or will behind the universe that is like a God, even if not personal or even conscious but I'm not willing to go much further. Like Schopenhauer's will or Spinoza's pantheism or Berkeley's mind at most. ""The essential feature is that something of value emerges as the result of processing according to some ingenious pre-existing set of rules. These rules look as if they are the product of intelligent design. I do not see how that can be denied. Whether you wish to believe that they really have been so designed, and if so by what sort of being, must remain a matter of personal taste. My own inclination is to suppose that qualities such as ingenuity, economy, beauty, and so on have a genuine transcendental reality-they are not merely the product of human experience-and that these qualities are reflected in the structure of the natural world. Whether such qualities can themselves bring the universe into existence I don't know. If they could, one could conceive of God as merely a mythical personification if such creative qualities, rather than as an independent agent. This would, of course, be unlikely to satisfy anyone who feels he or she has a personal relationship with God."" "

30,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13296223-jacob,3,"English physicist Paul Davies takes his title from the concluding passage of Stephen Hawking's 1988 book, A Brief History of Time:If we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason--for then we would truly know the mind of God.Neither Hawking, an agnostic, or Davies, a Deist, are thinking of an interventionist, theistic God; they are pushing beyond experimental science to what philosophy and metaphysics tell us about the ultimate source of our orderly universe. As Davies writes, ""Personally, I feel more comfortable with a deeper level of explanation than the laws of physics. Whether the use of the term 'God' for that deeper level is appropriate is, of course, a matter of debate."" (189) He doesn't insist that he has proven more than he has and never panders to those of a more theistic bent, who can agree with most of his arguments, though may choose to use different terminology and to go further.The type of thinking Davies employs is, as he points out, in line with ancient philosophers,like Plato and Aristotle, and various thinkers of the middle ages, like Thomas Aquinas. He explores the boggling question ""why is there something, instead of nothing?"" and argues that positing something beyond the universe makes more sense than stopping at the universe as the brute fact. He answers some counterarguments often brought up. For instance,It is quite wrong to suppose that an infinite chain of explanation is satisfactory on the basis that every member of that chain is explained by the next member. One is still left with the mystery of why that particular chain is the one that exists, or why any chain exists at all. (171, emphasis original)Davies also discusses ways in which our universe appears optimized for the advent of life, the so-called ""fine tuning"", and different responses to that fact, such as the multiverse hypothesis.Not everybody is happy with the many-universes theory. To postulate an infinity of unseen and unseeable universes just to explain the one we do see seems like a case of excess baggage carried to the extreme. It is simpler to postulate one unseen God. (190)I also enjoyed the sections, after Davies introduces Conway's Game of Life, on whether it would be possible to simulate a universe with a computer, and whether our universe may be just such a simulation (there are many aspects of our universe consistent with the hypothesis).For those prepared to go along with the idea that a sufficiently powerful computer could be conscious, it is but a small step to accept that a computer could, in principle, generate an entire society of conscious beings. These individuals would presumably think, feel, live, and die in their simulated world entirely oblivious to of the fact that they exist by courtesy of some computer operator who could presumably pull the plug at any moment! ...But this whole discussion begs the obvious question: how do we know that we ourselves are ""real"", and not merely a simulation inside a gigantic computer? ""Obviously, we can't know,"" says [Frank] Tipler. But does it matter? Tipler argues that the actual existence of the computer, being unverifiable to the conscious being within it, is irrelevant. ... By the same token, the actual existence of a physical universe is irrelevant. (125-126)The book is not afraid to tackle big questions, even ones that are unlikely to have answers we can verify. I've read several more recent books dealing with these questions and topics (see below) and, perhaps as a result, this book wasn't anything special to me. It's a good introduction if you've never pondered the philosophical questions that cosmology and the laws of physics raise for us, but I feel that this field has, partly due to the contributions of this book, gotten better versions of both the arguments Davies uses and those arrayed against them. Overall, 3/5 stars.If you liked this, or are interested in the subject, I recommend a number of other works. For the ""fine tuning"" of the universe, see Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe by Martin J. Rees. For a more theistic take, see God, Chance and Necessity and Pascal's Fire by the philosopher-theologian Keith Ward. For speculations on the far future of the universe see Year Million edited by Damien Broderick. The thinking of the Catholic theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin may also be of interest, but I found both of his books which I read to be rather opaque."

32,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12966934-j-c,3,"Observation #1: It purports to be for the public, and true to tone the language is clear and devoid of jargon, but I'm starting to see why it's putting people off (besides its controversial underlying tenets); it's really fucking dense. Just drenched glutinously in prerequisite knowledge. Like every sentence so far has required my past year of grappling in KI to get through.----------------------------------------------------First Complete Reading: It started off pretty okay with the science, but after some major (but interesting) digressions into game theory (Life being the prime example), it starts to descend into highly speculative, redundant, and convoluted rambling. He seems to be chasing his own tail on this one. The argument also seems pretty weak to me. Davies needs to stop saturating his pages with dense and unnecessary philosophical asides that can be given few other names besides wanking.""If the reader is bewildered by this little tour of philosophy, so is the author."" I think it is fair to say that any author who can admit that is not only a poor one, but presumptuous; somehow this bit of honest self-deprecation can save him from responsibility for an utter lack of lucidity. Little things like this convinced me that my lack of understanding of many parts of the book came not from my ignorance or incompetence, but the author's. I increasingly got the sense that Davies was trying to squeeze everything he could into as short a space as possible so as to hide the fact that the arguments and conclusions he could fashion were still at a very primitive draft stage, even to himself. It is very poor prose, and very poor essaying; the type one writes when one is still fumbling around as a freshman.If one takes the measure of a good book to be how far it hinges on the effort a reader has to expend to unravel and interpret it, the mind of god might qualify thus. But it seems that it is only so because the book manages to cover wide and rich topics, and fails to do what a book of science or philosophy must: make clear. ----------------------------------------------Will give full evaluation after I lay bare its contents and arguments"
33,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51739980-nj-wong,3,"This book is just too wordy. It would have been a much better read if 50% of the words are cut. Perhaps this was okay back in 1991/2 when it was written. But in the 21st century, when time is a premium (due to the many distractions from internet, ebooks etc), such a book would be better off judiciously edited.I don't like Davies writing because he seems to be rambling on and on. And very disorganised. Each subsequent chapter doesn't seem to follow on from the previous.And, so, so, so many words... And they are dry and boring. Too many philosophical contemplation written out (a.k.a navel gazing) about science. Davies should have been teaching, but he comes out as droning.Interestingly, Davies would refer to some scientists as atheist scientist and agnostic scientist etc, and use that to give some perspective on those scientists thinking. However, Davies own belief system is never clarified. Even after reading the book, one will still not know where Davies is coming from. Is he atheistic, agnostic, pantheistic (I think he is not theistic in the traditional Judeo-Christian stance, but even that is never clearly specified). Even after reading the final chapter, we still don't know what kind of ""God"" Davies believes in. So why bother to write such a long book on this? He should have titled this book ""The Mind of the Universe"". He shouldn't use the word ""God"" if he needs to redefine its meaning.I am surprised this book was nominated for a prize (shortlisted for 1993 Science Book Prize). I am not surprised it didn't win."
34,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27353658-kym-robinson,3,"I found that this book was more an attempt to make an argument for deism as a philosophy than it was a general physics book. That being the case I do not mind reading how great minds come to the conclusions that they do or how that they see the World and attempt to impose or transplant a general theory of 'why we are here' onto it all.At times I found the audio book to be a little hard to stay focused on and while I did listen to it a few times I was more interested in the philosophy that Davies had embraced. I listened to this at a period in my life when I was leaving a devout belief in Catholicism and entering into my own non theology period so I found this to be an interesting bridge.Outside of that personal context this book is incomplete and really does not stand up, in my opinion, as a scientific book but in many ways a repackaged attempt to reinvigorate the 18th century Cosmic Watchmaker and attempt to find 'him' with our modern understanding of general physics.60 %"

Overall I loved this book however. He covers all the big questions and gives the alternate theories for each. My only problem with his argument is he admits to favoring the God argument which always seems to me to be tacking the name of God onto whatever theory scientists spent hundreds of years to come up with. It seems a mere semantic trick to say the initials conditions or the Big Bang or whatever is God. Nevertheless, an excellent read covering the big questions that most scientists refuse to address. "

Seems, if anything, to slant toward an interpretation of it being appropriate to hold a respect for the mystery of existence, but not to regard any form of organized religion as being true. The point is, I think, that we have far too much left to learn, and there is perhaps far too much that may forever be beyond our reach, to get too cocky about what we ""know"" and what we don't. IMHO anyway."

90,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13296223-jacob,3,"English physicist Paul Davies takes his title from the concluding passage of Stephen Hawking's 1988 book, A Brief History of Time:If we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason--for then we would truly know the mind of God.Neither Hawking, an agnostic, or Davies, a Deist, are thinking of an interventionist, theistic God; they are pushing beyond experimental science to what philosophy and metaphysics tell us about the ultimate source of our orderly universe. As Davies writes, ""Personally, I feel more comfortable with a deeper level of explanation than the laws of physics. Whether the use of the term 'God' for that deeper level is appropriate is, of course, a matter of debate."" (189) He doesn't insist that he has proven more than he has and never panders to those of a more theistic bent, who can agree with most of his arguments, though may choose to use different terminology and to go further.The type of thinking Davies employs is, as he points out, in line with ancient philosophers,like Plato and Aristotle, and various thinkers of the middle ages, like Thomas Aquinas. He explores the boggling question ""why is there something, instead of nothing?"" and argues that positing something beyond the universe makes more sense than stopping at the universe as the brute fact. He answers some counterarguments often brought up. For instance,It is quite wrong to suppose that an infinite chain of explanation is satisfactory on the basis that every member of that chain is explained by the next member. One is still left with the mystery of why that particular chain is the one that exists, or why any chain exists at all. (171, emphasis original)Davies also discusses ways in which our universe appears optimized for the advent of life, the so-called ""fine tuning"", and different responses to that fact, such as the multiverse hypothesis.Not everybody is happy with the many-universes theory. To postulate an infinity of unseen and unseeable universes just to explain the one we do see seems like a case of excess baggage carried to the extreme. It is simpler to postulate one unseen God. (190)I also enjoyed the sections, after Davies introduces Conway's Game of Life, on whether it would be possible to simulate a universe with a computer, and whether our universe may be just such a simulation (there are many aspects of our universe consistent with the hypothesis).For those prepared to go along with the idea that a sufficiently powerful computer could be conscious, it is but a small step to accept that a computer could, in principle, generate an entire society of conscious beings. These individuals would presumably think, feel, live, and die in their simulated world entirely oblivious to of the fact that they exist by courtesy of some computer operator who could presumably pull the plug at any moment! ...But this whole discussion begs the obvious question: how do we know that we ourselves are ""real"", and not merely a simulation inside a gigantic computer? ""Obviously, we can't know,"" says [Frank] Tipler. But does it matter? Tipler argues that the actual existence of the computer, being unverifiable to the conscious being within it, is irrelevant. ... By the same token, the actual existence of a physical universe is irrelevant. (125-126)The book is not afraid to tackle big questions, even ones that are unlikely to have answers we can verify. I've read several more recent books dealing with these questions and topics (see below) and, perhaps as a result, this book wasn't anything special to me. It's a good introduction if you've never pondered the philosophical questions that cosmology and the laws of physics raise for us, but I feel that this field has, partly due to the contributions of this book, gotten better versions of both the arguments Davies uses and those arrayed against them.

120,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13296223-jacob,3,"English physicist Paul Davies takes his title from the concluding passage of Stephen Hawking's 1988 book, A Brief History of Time:If we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason--for then we would truly know the mind of God.Neither Hawking, an agnostic, or Davies, a Deist, are thinking of an interventionist, theistic God; they are pushing beyond experimental science to what philosophy and metaphysics tell us about the ultimate source of our orderly universe. As Davies writes, ""Personally, I feel more comfortable with a deeper level of explanation than the laws of physics. Whether the use of the term 'God' for that deeper level is appropriate is, of course, a matter of debate."" (189) He doesn't insist that he has proven more than he has and never panders to those of a more theistic bent, who can agree with most of his arguments, though may choose to use different terminology and to go further.The type of thinking Davies employs is, as he points out, in line with ancient philosophers,like Plato and Aristotle, and various thinkers of the middle ages, like Thomas Aquinas. He explores the boggling question ""why is there something, instead of nothing?"" and argues that positing something beyond the universe makes more sense than stopping at the universe as the brute fact. He answers some counterarguments often brought up. For instance,It is quite wrong to suppose that an infinite chain of explanation is satisfactory on the basis that every member of that chain is explained by the next member. One is still left with the mystery of why that particular chain is the one that exists, or why any chain exists at all. (171, emphasis original)Davies also discusses ways in which our universe appears optimized for the advent of life, the so-called ""fine tuning"", and different responses to that fact, such as the multiverse hypothesis.Not everybody is happy with the many-universes theory. To postulate an infinity of unseen and unseeable universes just to explain the one we do see seems like a case of excess baggage carried to the extreme. It is simpler to postulate one unseen God. (190)I also enjoyed the sections, after Davies introduces Conway's Game of Life, on whether it would be possible to simulate a universe with a computer, and whether our universe may be just such a simulation (there are many aspects of our universe consistent with the hypothesis).For those prepared to go along with the idea that a sufficiently powerful computer could be conscious, it is but a small step to accept that a computer could, in principle, generate an entire society of conscious beings. These individuals would presumably think, feel, live, and die in their simulated world entirely oblivious to of the fact that they exist by courtesy of some computer operator who could presumably pull the plug at any moment! ...But this whole discussion begs the obvious question: how do we know that we ourselves are ""real"", and not merely a simulation inside a gigantic computer? ""Obviously, we can't know,"" says [Frank] Tipler. But does it matter? Tipler argues that the actual existence of the computer, being unverifiable to the conscious being within it, is irrelevant. ... By the same token, the actual existence of a physical universe is irrelevant. (125-126)The book is not afraid to tackle big questions, even ones that are unlikely to have answers we can verify. I've read several more recent books dealing with these questions and topics (see below) and, perhaps as a result, this book wasn't anything special to me. It's a good introduction if you've never pondered the philosophical questions that cosmology and the laws of physics raise for us, but I feel that this field has, partly due to the contributions of this book, gotten better versions of both the arguments Davies uses and those arrayed against them. Overall, 3/5 stars.If you liked this, or are interested in the subject, I recommend a number of other works. For the ""fine tuning"" of the universe, see Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe by Martin J. Rees. For a more theistic take, see God, Chance and Necessity and Pascal's Fire by the philosopher-theologian Keith Ward. For speculations on the far future of the universe see Year Million edited by Damien Broderick. The thinking of the Catholic theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin may also be of interest, but I found both of his books which I read to be rather opaque."

Davies needs to stop saturating his pages with dense and unnecessary philosophical asides that can be given few other names besides wanking.""If the reader is bewildered by this little tour of philosophy, so is the author."" I think it is fair to say that any author who can admit that is not only a poor one, but presumptuous; somehow this bit of honest self-deprecation can save him from responsibility for an utter lack of lucidity. Little things like this convinced me that my lack of understanding of many parts of the book came not from my ignorance or incompetence, but the author's. I increasingly got the sense that Davies was trying to squeeze everything he could into as short a space as possible so as to hide the fact that the arguments and conclusions he could fashion were still at a very primitive draft stage, even to himself. It is very poor prose, and very poor essaying; the type one writes when one is still fumbling around as a freshman.If one takes the measure of a good book to be how far it hinges on the effort a reader has to expend to unravel and interpret it, the mind of god might qualify thus. But it seems that it is only so because the book manages to cover wide and rich topics, and fails to do what a book of science or philosophy must: make clear. ----------------------------------------------Will give full evaluation after I lay bare its contents and arguments"
123,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51739980-nj-wong,3,"This book is just too wordy. It would have been a much better read if 50% of the words are cut. Perhaps this was okay back in 1991/2 when it was written. But in the 21st century, when time is a premium (due to the many distractions from internet, ebooks etc), such a book would be better off judiciously edited.I don't like Davies writing because he seems to be rambling on and on. And very disorganised. Each subsequent chapter doesn't seem to follow on from the previous.And, so, so, so many words... And they are dry and boring. Too many philosophical contemplation written out (a.k.a navel gazing) about science. Davies should have been teaching, but he comes out as droning.Interestingly, Davies would refer to some scientists as atheist scientist and agnostic scientist etc, and use that to give some perspective on those scientists thinking. However, Davies own belief system is never clarified. Even after reading the book, one will still not know where Davies is coming from. Is he atheistic, agnostic, pantheistic (I think he is not theistic in the traditional Judeo-Christian stance, but even that is never clearly specified). Even after reading the final chapter, we still don't know what kind of ""God"" Davies believes in. So why bother to write such a long book on this? He should have titled this book ""The Mind of the Universe"". He shouldn't use the word ""God"" if he needs to redefine its meaning.I am surprised this book was nominated for a prize (shortlisted for 1993 Science Book Prize). I am not surprised it didn't win."
124,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27353658-kym-robinson,3,"I found that this book was more an attempt to make an argument for deism as a philosophy than it was a general physics book. That being the case I do not mind reading how great minds come to the conclusions that they do or how that they see the World and attempt to impose or transplant a general theory of 'why we are here' onto it all.At times I found the audio book to be a little hard to stay focused on and while I did listen to it a few times I was more interested in the philosophy that Davies had embraced. I listened to this at a period in my life when I was leaving a devout belief in Catholicism and entering into my own non theology period so I found this to be an interesting bridge.Outside of that personal context this book is incomplete and really does not stand up, in my opinion, as a scientific book but in many ways a repackaged attempt to reinvigorate the 18th century Cosmic Watchmaker and attempt to find 'him' with our modern understanding of general physics.60 %"
125,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/843957-stuart,5,"I was a little skeptical of this author as I heard of his dust up with Dawkins and others over his comments on religion and faith. Overall I loved this book however. He covers all the big questions and gives the alternate theories for each. My only problem with his argument is he admits to favoring the God argument which always seems to me to be tacking the name of God onto whatever theory scientists spent hundreds of years to come up with. It seems a mere semantic trick to say the initials conditions or the Big Bang or whatever is God. Nevertheless, an excellent read covering the big questions that most scientists refuse to address. "
126,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/944431-deborah,5,"I learned that I should have studied PdD level physics before I started reading this book. It's very interesting...and very difficult in some areas because it speaks about theoretical math and other areas that twist your brain into knots until you want to knock yourself unconscious in an effort to unravel the mess.However, that being said, I walked away with a great appreciation for Paul Davies' brilliance, and with an ever-so-slight understanding of how scientists approach this difficult and complex subject.If you're into discussions of ontological and teleological discussions about God, you might want to read this.

I think it was Paul Davies who said "" I'm just a simple-minded astrophysicist...."", but whew, it's a tough slog thru this book. I remember The Fifth Miracle being an easier read, but it's been awhile. If you're inclined toward Math, you might enjoy...I get the abstractions he eludes, to, but his need/drive/imperative to present the logical argument that underpins the abstraction leads me adrift...slogging on, however..."
128,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32507760-starman,5,"Very interesting thoughts but as expected, no certainties. Seems, if anything, to slant toward an interpretation of it being appropriate to hold a respect for the mystery of existence, but not to regard any form of organized religion as being true. The point is, I think, that we have far too much left to learn, and there is perhaps far too much that may forever be beyond our reach, to get too cocky about what we ""know"" and what we don't. IMHO anyway."
129,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1060853-jef,4,"There is a great explanation of the terms Deist and Theist. Davies appears to lean toward the deist persuasion but the gist of the book is that we can explain the beginning of the Cosmos without recourse to God, but that doesn't mean that there isn't one. This is much the same as God and the New Physics, maybe a little more pedantic. But it is enjoyable."

It's not that I am a slow reader, it's just that this fascinating book is full of two challenging fields of study, philosophy and mathematics.I hope not to spend so much time on a book again, but it was well worth the embarrassment - and it's a banquet as far as food for thought goes. "
131,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4723937-j,4,"There's a LOT in this book to think about, both scientifically and philosophically. I took way too long to read it, so I don't think I can comment on it very cohesively. But note that it took forever to read because I had to keep stopping for long periods to ponder things, not because I wasn't enjoying it. This is certainly a book I'll revisit at some point."
132,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10718146-adam,4,"Not for philosophers, but an interesting read as an introduction to cosmology for the lay person.

180,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13296223-jacob,3,"English physicist Paul Davies takes his title from the concluding passage of Stephen Hawking's 1988 book, A Brief History of Time:If we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason--for then we would truly know the mind of God.Neither Hawking, an agnostic, or Davies, a Deist, are thinking of an interventionist, theistic God; they are pushing beyond experimental science to what philosophy and metaphysics tell us about the ultimate source of our orderly universe. As Davies writes, ""Personally, I feel more comfortable with a deeper level of explanation than the laws of physics. Whether the use of the term 'God' for that deeper level is appropriate is, of course, a matter of debate."" (189) He doesn't insist that he has proven more than he has and never panders to those of a more theistic bent, who can agree with most of his arguments, though may choose to use different terminology and to go further.The type of thinking Davies employs is, as he points out, in line with ancient philosophers,like Plato and Aristotle, and various thinkers of the middle ages, like Thomas Aquinas. He explores the boggling question ""why is there something, instead of nothing?"" and argues that positing something beyond the universe makes more sense than stopping at the universe as the brute fact. He answers some counterarguments often brought up. For instance,It is quite wrong to suppose that an infinite chain of explanation is satisfactory on the basis that every member of that chain is explained by the next member. One is still left with the mystery of why that particular chain is the one that exists, or why any chain exists at all. (171, emphasis original)Davies also discusses ways in which our universe appears optimized for the advent of life, the so-called ""fine tuning"", and different responses to that fact, such as the multiverse hypothesis.Not everybody is happy with the many-universes theory. To postulate an infinity of unseen and unseeable universes just to explain the one we do see seems like a case of excess baggage carried to the extreme. It is simpler to postulate one unseen God. (190)I also enjoyed the sections, after Davies introduces Conway's Game of Life, on whether it would be possible to simulate a universe with a computer, and whether our universe may be just such a simulation (there are many aspects of our universe consistent with the hypothesis).For those prepared to go along with the idea that a sufficiently powerful computer could be conscious, it is but a small step to accept that a computer could, in principle, generate an entire society of conscious beings. These individuals would presumably think, feel, live, and die in their simulated world entirely oblivious to of the fact that they exist by courtesy of some computer operator who could presumably pull the plug at any moment! ...But this whole discussion begs the obvious question: how do we know that we ourselves are ""real"", and not merely a simulation inside a gigantic computer? ""Obviously, we can't know,"" says [Frank] Tipler. But does it matter? Tipler argues that the actual existence of the computer, being unverifiable to the conscious being within it, is irrelevant. ... By the same token, the actual existence of a physical universe is irrelevant. (125-126)The book is not afraid to tackle big questions, even ones that are unlikely to have answers we can verify. I've read several more recent books dealing with these questions and topics (see below) and, perhaps as a result, this book wasn't anything special to me. It's a good introduction if you've never pondered the philosophical questions that cosmology and the laws of physics raise for us, but I feel that this field has, partly due to the contributions of this book, gotten better versions of both the arguments Davies uses and those arrayed against them. Overall, 3/5 stars.If you liked this, or are interested in the subject, I recommend a number of other works. For the ""fine tuning"" of the universe, see Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe by Martin J. Rees. For a more theistic take, see God, Chance and Necessity and Pascal's Fire by the philosopher-theologian Keith Ward. For speculations on the far future of the universe see Year Million edited by Damien Broderick. The thinking of the Catholic theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin may also be of interest, but I found both of his books which I read to be rather opaque."

210,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13296223-jacob,3,"English physicist Paul Davies takes his title from the concluding passage of Stephen Hawking's 1988 book, A Brief History of Time:If we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason--for then we would truly know the mind of God.Neither Hawking, an agnostic, or Davies, a Deist, are thinking of an interventionist, theistic God; they are pushing beyond experimental science to what philosophy and metaphysics tell us about the ultimate source of our orderly universe. As Davies writes, ""Personally, I feel more comfortable with a deeper level of explanation than the laws of physics. Whether the use of the term 'God' for that deeper level is appropriate is, of course, a matter of debate."" (189) He doesn't insist that he has proven more than he has and never panders to those of a more theistic bent, who can agree with most of his arguments, though may choose to use different terminology and to go further.The type of thinking Davies employs is, as he points out, in line with ancient philosophers,like Plato and Aristotle, and various thinkers of the middle ages, like Thomas Aquinas. He explores the boggling question ""why is there something, instead of nothing?"" and argues that positing something beyond the universe makes more sense than stopping at the universe as the brute fact. He answers some counterarguments often brought up. For instance,It is quite wrong to suppose that an infinite chain of explanation is satisfactory on the basis that every member of that chain is explained by the next member. One is still left with the mystery of why that particular chain is the one that exists, or why any chain exists at all. (171, emphasis original)Davies also discusses ways in which our universe appears optimized for the advent of life, the so-called ""fine tuning"", and different responses to that fact, such as the multiverse hypothesis.Not everybody is happy with the many-universes theory. To postulate an infinity of unseen and unseeable universes just to explain the one we do see seems like a case of excess baggage carried to the extreme. It is simpler to postulate one unseen God. (190)I also enjoyed the sections, after Davies introduces Conway's Game of Life, on whether it would be possible to simulate a universe with a computer, and whether our universe may be just such a simulation (there are many aspects of our universe consistent with the hypothesis).For those prepared to go along with the idea that a sufficiently powerful computer could be conscious, it is but a small step to accept that a computer could, in principle, generate an entire society of conscious beings. These individuals would presumably think, feel, live, and die in their simulated world entirely oblivious to of the fact that they exist by courtesy of some computer operator who could presumably pull the plug at any moment! ...But this whole discussion begs the obvious question: how do we know that we ourselves are ""real"", and not merely a simulation inside a gigantic computer? ""Obviously, we can't know,"" says [Frank] Tipler. But does it matter? Tipler argues that the actual existence of the computer, being unverifiable to the conscious being within it, is irrelevant. ... By the same token, the actual existence of a physical universe is irrelevant. (125-126)The book is not afraid to tackle big questions, even ones that are unlikely to have answers we can verify. I've read several more recent books dealing with these questions and topics (see below) and, perhaps as a result, this book wasn't anything special to me. It's a good introduction if you've never pondered the philosophical questions that cosmology and the laws of physics raise for us, but I feel that this field has, partly due to the contributions of this book, gotten better versions of both the arguments Davies uses and those arrayed against them. Overall, 3/5 stars.If you liked this, or are interested in the subject, I recommend a number of other works. For the ""fine tuning"" of the universe, see Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe by Martin J. Rees. For a more theistic take, see God, Chance and Necessity and Pascal's Fire by the philosopher-theologian Keith Ward. For speculations on the far future of the universe see Year Million edited by Damien Broderick. The thinking of the Catholic theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin may also be of interest, but I found both of his books which I read to be rather opaque."

213,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51739980-nj-wong,3,"This book is just too wordy. It would have been a much better read if 50% of the words are cut. Perhaps this was okay back in 1991/2 when it was written. But in the 21st century, when time is a premium (due to the many distractions from internet, ebooks etc), such a book would be better off judiciously edited.I don't like Davies writing because he seems to be rambling on and on. And very disorganised. Each subsequent chapter doesn't seem to follow on from the previous.And, so, so, so many words... And they are dry and boring. Too many philosophical contemplation written out (a.k.a navel gazing) about science. Davies should have been teaching, but he comes out as droning.Interestingly, Davies would refer to some scientists as atheist scientist and agnostic scientist etc, and use that to give some perspective on those scientists thinking. However, Davies own belief system is never clarified. Even after reading the book, one will still not know where Davies is coming from. Is he atheistic, agnostic, pantheistic (I think he is not theistic in the traditional Judeo-Christian stance, but even that is never clearly specified). Even after reading the final chapter, we still don't know what kind of ""God"" Davies believes in. So why bother to write such a long book on this? He should have titled this book ""The Mind of the Universe"". He shouldn't use the word ""God"" if he needs to redefine its meaning.I am surprised this book was nominated for a prize (shortlisted for 1993 Science Book Prize). I am not surprised it didn't win."
214,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27353658-kym-robinson,3,"I found that this book was more an attempt to make an argument for deism as a philosophy than it was a general physics book. That being the case I do not mind reading how great minds come to the conclusions that they do or how that they see the World and attempt to impose or transplant a general theory of 'why we are here' onto it all.At times I found the audio book to be a little hard to stay focused on and while I did listen to it a few times I was more interested in the philosophy that Davies had embraced. I listened to this at a period in my life when I was leaving a devout belief in Catholicism and entering into my own non theology period so I found this to be an interesting bridge.Outside of that personal context this book is incomplete and really does not stand up, in my opinion, as a scientific book but in many ways a repackaged attempt to reinvigorate the 18th century Cosmic Watchmaker and attempt to find 'him' with our modern understanding of general physics.60 %"
215,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/843957-stuart,5,"I was a little skeptical of this author as I heard of his dust up with Dawkins and others over his comments on religion and faith. Overall I loved this book however. He covers all the big questions and gives the alternate theories for each. My only problem with his argument is he admits to favoring the God argument which always seems to me to be tacking the name of God onto whatever theory scientists spent hundreds of years to come up with. It seems a mere semantic trick to say the initials conditions or the Big Bang or whatever is God. Nevertheless, an excellent read covering the big questions that most scientists refuse to address. "
216,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/944431-deborah,5,"I learned that I should have studied PdD level physics before I started reading this book. It's very interesting...and very difficult in some areas because it speaks about theoretical math and other areas that twist your brain into knots until you want to knock yourself unconscious in an effort to unravel the mess.However, that being said, I walked away with a great appreciation for Paul Davies' brilliance, and with an ever-so-slight understanding of how scientists approach this difficult and complex subject.If you're into discussions of ontological and teleological discussions about God, you might want to read this. "
217,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7321760-greg-houseal,0,"Bogging down, sloggin'.... I think it was Paul Davies who said "" I'm just a simple-minded astrophysicist...."", but whew, it's a tough slog thru this book. I remember The Fifth Miracle being an easier read, but it's been awhile. If you're inclined toward Math, you might enjoy...I get the abstractions he eludes, to, but his need/drive/imperative to present the logical argument that underpins the abstraction leads me adrift...slogging on, however..."
218,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32507760-starman,5,"Very interesting thoughts but as expected, no certainties. Seems, if anything, to slant toward an interpretation of it being appropriate to hold a respect for the mystery of existence, but not to regard any form of organized religion as being true. The point is, I think, that we have far too much left to learn, and there is perhaps far too much that may forever be beyond our reach, to get too cocky about what we ""know"" and what we don't. IMHO anyway."
219,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1060853-jef,4,"There is a great explanation of the terms Deist and Theist. Davies appears to lean toward the deist persuasion but the gist of the book is that we can explain the beginning of the Cosmos without recourse to God, but that doesn't mean that there isn't one. This is much the same as God and the New Physics, maybe a little more pedantic. But it is enjoyable."
220,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4389706-debby-kean,4,"Finally after all these years! It's not that I am a slow reader, it's just that this fascinating book is full of two challenging fields of study, philosophy and mathematics.I hope not to spend so much time on a book again, but it was well worth the embarrassment - and it's a banquet as far as food for thought goes. "
221,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4723937-j,4,"There's a LOT in this book to think about, both scientifically and philosophically. I took way too long to read it, so I don't think I can comment on it very cohesively. But note that it took forever to read because I had to keep stopping for long periods to ponder things, not because I wasn't enjoying it. This is certainly a book I'll revisit at some point."
222,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10718146-adam,4,"Not for philosophers, but an interesting read as an introduction to cosmology for the lay person. I can't say I ever agreed with Davies' arguments, but it was a lot of fun, and wonder-inspiring to a high school teenager. Also, this edition has pub date as 2001, but the first edition was published in 1993/4."
223,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5687721-cypress-butane,5,"Wowie Zowie! I read this for some background info for a novel I'm writing, little did I know it would actually live up to its title. I don't think they mentioned that quote by Einstein in the book, 'I want to know God's thoughts - the rest is just details', but it could just as easily served as the criteria for what gets discussed within this book's pages. Amazing stuff."
224,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15223188-charkna,3,"A great overview of philosophy, physics, religion and science. That being said it is a lot to breath in for its short length. Davies does a great job tackling complex topics but at times the flow gets bonked down by the amount of information he packs into each page. Nonetheless, a very interesting read indeed. "
225,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4236730-mayank,3,"A good enough read, but sometimes a little difficult to follow. Requires active reading, in my opinion. While there is nothing really new in the ideas presented, the arguments are structured around a very specific enquiry of the nature of God. This in itself makes this book valuable, in that it places into context several esoteric scientific and philosophical concepts. "
226,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50284728-ally,4,I found this book completely enthralling from the first chapter. It discusses theory after theory relating to cosmology and physics. Despite being slightly outdated (for example it mentions the search for the Higgs boson) most of the information and ideas in the book have stood the test of time. A book that would appeal to any inquisitive mind. I loved it. 
227,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22513296-mangoloverreads,4,"4.25/5 — It took me a long time to get through this book. It is somewhat technical and I needed to be in the mood to properly absorb it. It had good and interesting information and point of view. At some point, science will always get to the limit of what it knows at that time and then we are left with theory and faith. "

However, Davies own belief system is never clarified. Even after reading the book, one will still not know where Davies is coming from. Is he atheistic, agnostic, pantheistic (I think he is not theistic in the traditional Judeo-Christian stance, but even that is never clearly specified). Even after reading the final chapter, we still don't know what kind of ""God"" Davies believes in. So why bother to write such a long book on this? He should have titled this book ""The Mind of the Universe"". He shouldn't use the word ""God"" if he needs to redefine its meaning.I am surprised this book was nominated for a prize (shortlisted for 1993 Science Book Prize). I am not surprised it didn't win."

270,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13296223-jacob,3,"English physicist Paul Davies takes his title from the concluding passage of Stephen Hawking's 1988 book, A Brief History of Time:If we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason--for then we would truly know the mind of God.Neither Hawking, an agnostic, or Davies, a Deist, are thinking of an interventionist, theistic God; they are pushing beyond experimental science to what philosophy and metaphysics tell us about the ultimate source of our orderly universe. As Davies writes, ""Personally, I feel more comfortable with a deeper level of explanation than the laws of physics. Whether the use of the term 'God' for that deeper level is appropriate is, of course, a matter of debate."" (189) He doesn't insist that he has proven more than he has and never panders to those of a more theistic bent, who can agree with most of his arguments, though may choose to use different terminology and to go further.The type of thinking Davies employs is, as he points out, in line with ancient philosophers,like Plato and Aristotle, and various thinkers of the middle ages, like Thomas Aquinas. He explores the boggling question ""why is there something, instead of nothing?"" and argues that positing something beyond the universe makes more sense than stopping at the universe as the brute fact. He answers some counterarguments often brought up. For instance,It is quite wrong to suppose that an infinite chain of explanation is satisfactory on the basis that every member of that chain is explained by the next member. One is still left with the mystery of why that particular chain is the one that exists, or why any chain exists at all. (171, emphasis original)Davies also discusses ways in which our universe appears optimized for the advent of life, the so-called ""fine tuning"", and different responses to that fact, such as the multiverse hypothesis.Not everybody is happy with the many-universes theory. To postulate an infinity of unseen and unseeable universes just to explain the one we do see seems like a case of excess baggage carried to the extreme. It is simpler to postulate one unseen God. (190)I also enjoyed the sections, after Davies introduces Conway's Game of Life, on whether it would be possible to simulate a universe with a computer, and whether our universe may be just such a simulation (there are many aspects of our universe consistent with the hypothesis).For those prepared to go along with the idea that a sufficiently powerful computer could be conscious, it is but a small step to accept that a computer could, in principle, generate an entire society of conscious beings. These individuals would presumably think, feel, live, and die in their simulated world entirely oblivious to of the fact that they exist by courtesy of some computer operator who could presumably pull the plug at any moment! ...But this whole discussion begs the obvious question: how do we know that we ourselves are ""real"", and not merely a simulation inside a gigantic computer? ""Obviously, we can't know,"" says [Frank] Tipler. But does it matter? Tipler argues that the actual existence of the computer, being unverifiable to the conscious being within it, is irrelevant. ... By the same token, the actual existence of a physical universe is irrelevant. (125-126)The book is not afraid to tackle big questions, even ones that are unlikely to have answers we can verify. I've read several more recent books dealing with these questions and topics (see below) and, perhaps as a result, this book wasn't anything special to me. It's a good introduction if you've never pondered the philosophical questions that cosmology and the laws of physics raise for us, but I feel that this field has, partly due to the contributions of this book, gotten better versions of both the arguments Davies uses and those arrayed against them. Overall, 3/5 stars.If you liked this, or are interested in the subject, I recommend a number of other works. For the ""fine tuning"" of the universe, see Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe by Martin J. Rees. For a more theistic take, see God, Chance and Necessity and Pascal's Fire by the philosopher-theologian Keith Ward. For speculations on the far future of the universe see Year Million edited by Damien Broderick. The thinking of the Catholic theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin may also be of interest, but I found both of his books which I read to be rather opaque."

272,0671797182,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12966934-j-c,3,"Observation #1: It purports to be for the public, and true to tone the language is clear and devoid of jargon, but I'm starting to see why it's putting people off (besides its controversial underlying tenets); it's really fucking dense. Just drenched glutinously in prerequisite knowledge. Like every sentence so far has required my past year of grappling in KI to get through.----------------------------------------------------First Complete Reading: It started off pretty okay with the science, but after some major (but interesting) digressions into game theory (Life being the prime example), it starts to descend into highly speculative, redundant, and convoluted rambling. He seems to be chasing his own tail on this one. The argument also seems pretty weak to me. Davies needs to stop saturating his pages with dense and unnecessary philosophical asides that can be given few other names besides wanking.""If the reader is bewildered by this little tour of philosophy, so is the author."" I think it is fair to say that any author who can admit that is not only a poor one, but presumptuous; somehow this bit of honest self-deprecation can save him from responsibility for an utter lack of lucidity. Little things like this convinced me that my lack of understanding of many parts of the book came not from my ignorance or incompetence, but the author's. I increasingly got the sense that Davies was trying to squeeze everything he could into as short a space as possible so as to hide the fact that the arguments and conclusions he could fashion were still at a very primitive draft stage, even to himself. It is very poor prose, and very poor essaying; the type one writes when one is still fumbling around as a freshman.If one takes the measure of a good book to be how far it hinges on the effort a reader has to expend to unravel and interpret it, the mind of god might qualify thus. But it seems that it is only so because the book manages to cover wide and rich topics, and fails to do what a book of science or philosophy must: make clear. ----------------------------------------------Will give full evaluation after I lay bare its contents and arguments"
