0,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,3,This book attempts to answer the following questions. 1) Is mathematics a worthwhile career? 2) What being a mathematician is like. 3) What type of jobs/careers are available? The main strength of Ian Stewart’s book is the way he addresses these questions in an entertaining manner. He manages to keep his explicit advice witty and brief.Stewart reviews mathematics from high school to daily life to post docs. He also discusses the importance of mathematic teachers and the valuable role they play. Stewart encourages women to enter the field of math. Stewarts goal is opening the door into the world of mathematics and enticing the reader inside; he accomplishes this goal. I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. It is about five and half hours long. Jason Huggins does a good job narrating the book. Huggins is from Wales. He is an actor and audiobook narrator.

I basically devoured it. In fact, I believe anyone can devour it: there are no exotic symbols or scary formulas to put one off; the focus is on the humanistic side rather than the technical side; the book reads almost like a story as the imagined ""Meg"" (to which the book is supposed to be addressed) grows from a curious youngster to an established mathematician. On top of all that, Professor Ian Stewart (author) provides quite a bit of interesting inside information about the field, and doesn't forget to use humour to engage the reader. This little book really is a page turner."
2,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29745337-angelynn,5,"This book is amazing! Stewart did a great job in casually describing (to ""Meg"") what to expect in the life of a mathematician (in academia), as well as the splendor of mathematics. What I really REALLY liked was how the book described the beauty of mathematics in its own right, as well as the beauty of its applications in the real world. As a mathematics PhD candidate, I evidently am aware of the elegance of the subject, so a lot of the description was not new to me. Nevertheless, I ultimately favored how the book answered the common (naive) layperson question, ""What is all this math good for?"". Lots of people may not realize that math is EVERYWHERE (from the arrangements of an atom, to the biology of animals, to the automobiles we use, to the everyday electronics we cannot live without, etc.). Stewart truly depicted how remarkable the subject is, which was great reading in one paperback. I favored how this book is not written TO mathematicians, but to to ANYONE who is interested in mathematics altogether, and/or the life of a mathematician. Definitely recommended!"
3,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,4,"I assigned this book to my Trig class, and they responded mostly well to it. The funniest part is that they were surprised to find that Meg wasn't real. This worked well as a launching point into discovering math all around, and the students still mention how math is everywhere, much to their chagrin/surprise! Sometimes the author was a little long-winded or over their head, but the students sometimes considered actually looking into the strange things mentioned. I hope to adapt portions of this book for future classes, especially the sections on learning math and teaching math. The book is rife with stories and urban legends of mathematicians through history and really goes to show what a profession in mathematics can be like. Would that I could encourage students like Mr. Stewart has encouraged me!"

But in particular, in the first chapters, the book didn't seem that interesting to me, to get 4/5. It starts with typical mathematical concerns of a Bachelor student and then continues with PhD, post-doc and so on; and it is getting more interesting by the way! "
5,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21158516-ron-joniak,3,"Lovely read to prepare the early mathematician for the future. Unfortunately, this book suffers from lack of deep insight and is often very vague. Meg is indeed, not real. "

11,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15785230-paulo-glez-ogando,4,"This book offers an insight into academics, explaining culture and customs of the mathematical community. Stewart says «Letters to a Young Mathematician is my attempt to bring some parts of G.H. Hardy's A Mathematician's Apology up to date, namely, those parts taht might influence the decisions of a young person contemplating a degree in mathematics and a possible career in the subject».So, this is a must-read for those who are contemplating a career in maths or beginning it. It's not the case for me, being already a graduate for 15 years. I have enjoyed it even now, but I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more 20 years ago. The book is written in the form of letters addressed to ""Meg"", an imaginary correspondent, through her career in chronological order, from high school to a tenured position in a university.Stewart talks about philosophy, career decisions, the mathematical community, the job of a profesional mathematician (he asures a typical day is ten or twelve hours long, with teaching commitments, research grants to pursue, proper mathematical research and certain amount of bureaucracy), the subject itself, a bunch of problems, pure vs applied mathematics, teaching (at college level), proofs, use of computers in research, a bit of his own life or the more modern work style with collaborations, not alone as it used to be.I liked the metaphor he uses when saying a proof is a story. He says «it is a story told by mathematicians to mathematicians, expressed in their common language. It has a beginning (the hypotheses) and an end (the conclusion), and it falls apart instantly if there are any logical gaps». This has captivated me.The author also explores how do mathematicians think. He quotes Hadamard or Poincaré, and he agree more or less in the next scheme: 1. Conscious work on a problem. 2. Stop thinking about the problem and do something else: let the subconscious do its job, leading to the big ""aha!"" moment. 3. Another conscious stage of writing everything down formally."
12,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39211947-sarah,4,"I'm not quite sure when I picked up this book (or if it was possibly a gift at some point?), but it's definitely one that I would use quotations from if I ever went back to teaching in a math classroom. There are some very good lines about what math is and what it means to pursue it, as one would expect in a book based on the premise of giving advice to a mathematician just starting out. It was particularly neat to see the progression across time - how the advice changed as opportunities changed and to understand the growth and changing circumstances of the fictional Meg without ever actually hearing from her. Some parts of this book made me want to go back and take more math classes; others just made me want to be friends with Ian Stewart! In all reality, I'll never be a professional or academic mathematician (it occasionally sounds appealing in theory, but I really don't think I would enjoy it), but I very much appreciated the view of mathematics that is presented within this book and wish that others could learn to see the field in a similar light."
13,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54304445-baby-adam,4,"I found the beginning a little basic, but of course I'm not really the target audience, especially the first half or so of the book. I think this would've been really helpful to have as a companion for advice over the various stages of my education. The book is very good at giving an accurate account of what it's like on the road to becoming a mathematician. I enjoyed how everything was very relatable, but I do think Stewart was maybe a bit cynical about academia politics, which could be potentially off-putting for youngsters. Still, he clearly loves his work, and that comes across very well, even if he does complain about a few things. And I do have a grump about the book. I'm not really sure why the book was written in American English, and that was kind of annoying, especially knowing the author is English. "
14,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62798613-cynthia,4,"I liked this book, because it points out a lot of things people don't realize about math. At parts, it would be too complicated for a ""non math"" person to enjoy. It struck me about halfway through how privileged his whole experience has been. Toward the end he states that math is a talent that some people just don't have. That's where I stopped enjoying this book. It improved again at the end, but I lost a lost of love for this book. In general, he is very math-positive, suggests keeping an open mind, and touches on a lot of important ideas. I would love to see someone else attempt this style of book, with a slightly better lens. "
15,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18446231-xuan,5,"In the end of this book, I wish I would have known this book when I started college. But it's never too late to begin. The book is written in a nice polish style, with a lot of examples and precious personal experiences as well as good advices. It gives an insight of becoming and being mathematicians and it's inspiring. I recommend it to anyone who loves mathematics, who wants to become mathematicians, especially young people."
16,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75900292-emmanuel-barrag-n,4,"An excellent short introduction to what it means to be a mathematician, at least from the author's perspective. It certainly offered lots of insights for me, a prospective student of the subject. If you find yourself in a similar position, the book will no doubt be helpful. Apart from that, the way the author writes is surprisingly excellent, making for a great experience. The chapters are of good length, packed with humor and valuable information. A good read overall.

18,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4649875-emily,4,I quite liked this one.

34,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941467-zoe,3,"As the title suggests, this book is written in the form of letters to a ""young mathematician"", offering advice and generally discussing what mathematics is and what it means to be a mathematician. The back cover promises that it ""tells readers what world renowned mathematician Ian Stewart wishes he had known when he was a student"", and I was intrigued because I had a mixed experience with mathematics in university and always wondered what I could have done differently.I have to say, my experience with this book was also mixed. First of all, lest the title mislead, I think it's actually more suited for a general non-mathematical audience than for someone who's actually in the process of becoming a mathematician--which wasn't a problem for me, since I read it for general interest and not as an aspiring mathematician.Stewart raises a lot of interesting points here, but he often doesn't discuss them in as much detail as I would have liked. I think this is part of a series, and it was probably a requirement that the book be barely 200 pages long, but there are times when a bit more depth would have been nice. It was good in a way that the book left me wanting more, and it did include references to other interesting reading throughout, but it wasn't quite satisfying enough in itself. Many people will probably appreciate the brevity, though.A more serious concern for me was the fact that I just didn't agree with some of his more important points. I know, he's the mathematician and I'm not, but still. The book got off to a bad start, in my mind, with the initial chapter entitled ""Why Do Math?"". Stewart's reason, briefly, is that math is everywhere. There's a bit too much focus on the utility and not enough on the beauty of it. The same is true even in his chapter on proofs: ""it would be silly to suggest that this agreement [with experiment to an accuracy of nine decimal places:] is an accident, and that no physical principle is involved.... [but:] it is equally silly not to try to find out the deep logic that justifies the calculation. Such understanding... will surely advance mathematics."" So even proofs are presented not as necessary, but merely as useful (a view that he steps back from slightly in the following chapter, but to my mind, the damage was done).Another point that left me wondering is his claim that not everyone can be a mathematician, because ""originality is one of those things that you either have or you don't."" I really appreciate the fact that he expressly disagrees with the politically-correct view that everyone can be good at everything, but I think he simplifies the issue a bit too much. In particular, I'm just not convinced that originality is the key. He compares it to the attempt of a tone-deaf person to become a great musician, but there's nothing in there to make me think that creativity is the problem rather than some more basic musical/mathematical aptitude. His explanations about how he excelled at math without effort from the time he was 10 didn't convince me either; the mathematics that one does at age 10 is so different from ""real"" mathematics that it can barely be called the same subject. Creativity certainly isn't the main factor there. I wonder whether Stewart's various unconvincing arguments are a direct result of the book's extreme brevity; maybe I would have been more convinced if he had elaborated his position further.On the other hand, I think the fact that I have so much to say about this book speaks in its favour. Regardless of whether I agree with everything Stewart says, he makes plenty of interesting and provocative points in a short space. And there's a fair bit of humour, too, including a whole chapter on what not to do as a tenure-track professor that consists mainly of humorous anecdotes about various mishaps (""I was once abandoned inside a Dutch mathematics building when my hosts went off to the parking garage to go to a restaurant. I had to make my escape through a window, setting off a burglar alarm."") So in the end, I think I would cautiously recommend this book, as long as you don't take Stewart's views as the be-all-and-end-all when it comes to what mathematics is."
35,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17609442-blamp-head,4,"Dear Ian,I read your book Letters to a Young Mathematician and was very impressed. First and foremost, you talked about what it's like to be a mathematician, and talked at length about the practical considerations a mathematician must necessarily face.Your book didn't assume any technical knowledge of the subject, and indeed several Goodreads reviewers indicate that the book appeals (well, sometimes) even among those not inclined to study mathematics at all. Though some reviewers found your style to be condescending, I didn't.Your book would probably appeal to people curious about what mathematicians do or what it's like to be a mathematician; those interested in becoming mathematicians; and anyone who enjoyed A Mathematician's Apology (G.H. Hardy). I can only imagine that given the mentoring approach you took for Meg in this letter-per-chapter book, this would be useful for mathematics teachers or, indeed, anyone with an interest in mentoring in general.Throughout your book, you wrote to a girl, Meg, who started out as a merely curious student considering doing mathematics in university, and you tutored her throughout her journey from curious student (at the start of your book), answering questions like, ""Why would a person want to study mathematics?"", ""What is it good for?"", etc... right up to Meg becoming a fully fledged, established Assistant Professor. You talked about how pure and applied brands of mathematics are part of the same beast. Debates over whether one is superior to the other are handled with ease, empathy and insight.Getting a career, how to teach, fear of proofs, whether computing is making the whole enterprise irrelevant... all delved into headlong, without getting bogged down in nitty gritty mathematical details. Excellent advice throughout.""So: should you study pure math or applied math? Neither. You should use the tools at hand, adapt and modify them to suit your own projects, and make new ones as the need arises.""This was all very interesting to me personally, as I have a science degree with a mathematics major (not a professorship like you, running around writing popular books for science/mathematics education and promotion among the general population).Two bugbears. Your third chapter (""The Breadth of Mathematics"") again starts out excellently, much the same as the rest of the book, with accounts of all manner of applications or examples of abstract problems in the field. By the end of the chapter, I must say I was beginning to think you'd completely lost your mind. You began quoting one Reuben Hersh's What Is Mathematics Really?, prattling on about mathematics being a humanist endeavour, a social construct, blah blah. I was not inspired to read that book, despite good reviews on Goodreads.By the penultimate chapter I'd forgiven this minor indiscretion and was fully ready to award you 5 STARS on Goodreads... Unfortunately, then the last chapter happened. WHAM. The chapter: ""Is God a Mathematician"".""Only a mathematical universe can develop brains that do mathematics. Only a geometer God can create a mind that has the capacity to delude itself that a geometer God exists. In that sense, God is a mathematician; and She's a lot better at it than we are. Every so often, She lets us peek over her shoulder.""SERIOUSLY?! Really, Ian, really? Must we end a great book with this philosophical posturing?Otherwise, excellent.Cheers,Blamp"

He shares his wisdom and experience in a very entertaining and humble way. Definitely recommended to people who are curious about a mathematician's life."
37,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4258012-adam,5,"I've recently decided to go back to school for a degree in Applied Mathematics, so while my girlfriend was looking over the math section at a used book store she came upon this book. It is certainly a quick read as other reviewers have stated and I must say I found it an enjoyable one. I believe the intended audience of this book is for anyone in general. If you are interested in what mathematicians do, how they contribute to the world, or a glimpse into what they think about, then this is a good book to read through. I must emphasize that it is extremely general, which is what maintains its level of readership. ""Letters to a Young Mathematician"" is series of letters written to a fictitious niece interested in pursuing a career in mathematics. This book takes you from her childhood when she is first encountering the world of integers all the way up to getting a teaching position at a university. The book covers basic things, such as what mathematicians do and even covers elements of office politics. One of the points I found very interesting was the way Stewart differentiates (no pun intended) between the way mathematicians argue and how other disciplines argue (his example was Art professors). A major difference he points out is that the Art professors will argue till they are blue in the face with little conclusion, but the mathematicians will argue until one eventually figures something out and realizes the error they were making. I may have found this more amusing because my girlfriend is an Art major and she confirmed that those types of arguments between faculty do happen. This book serves as a bit of an advice for prospective students/workers in the field of math. It also serves as a sneak peak into the world of mathematicians, which I feel is a world not often publicized to the general public very much. From what I can tell a lot of people think we're off manipulating arcane equations in a back room or we're human calculators that solve incredible arithmetical problems. I don't think either is very true, well maybe the first one could have some element of truth... but I digress. I think this is a great book to read through and get a quick glimpse at some of the fields mathematicians actually have the options of working in. Becoming a teacher is not the only option as many seem to assume, as that is the most coming question I get asked when I tell others about my major. One of my favorite parts in this book is the advice for prospective math teachers/professors. You will get chalk all over the place. It brings me fond memories of my Linear Algebra teacher who really took this to heart, going to such lengths of erasing mistakes with his fist. The sheer volume of chalk this man went through and had on his hands, shirt, and face by the end of lecture was impressive."

If you have a budding mathematician or a stubborn student always asking will I use this, this book is the answer. I was engrossed in reading this book but was consistently sidetracked into researching many of the principles, theorems, and such mentioned. I acknowledge that I am no math genius but could still relate to the points. Bonus points for recipient being female.Definite recommendation for anyone, even if math is not your thing."
39,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"The hardest thing about describing this book is saying whether it's fiction or non-fiction. It's mostly a series of essays on math, mathematicians, and how the two affect each other. But, it's presented as a series of letters to a fictional young (in the beginning, aspiring) mathematician named Meg. But, the letters are written by the author, a bona fide mathematician, and not a fictional character at all. If he were just delusional, then this book would be solidly in the non-fictional camp. He isn't, though, so it occupies a sort of twilight realm between the two.The letter format is just a device for organizing the material, as they allegedly occur over the course of many years, as Meg goes from high school student to tenured math professor. Stewart's main topic, really, is to discuss what makes a person become a mathematician (and, in other cases, prevents it). What kind of teacher is required? What kind of politics can wreck a graduate math student's career?It is mostly related to an issue little-recognized in our (or perhaps any) society, which is that mathematicians require a particular set of circumstances to have a good chance of developing their talents. To make a comparison, there are far more places where one can develop good skills as a writer, and far more teachers who can help an aspiring writer learn the things they need to learn.Legendary talents like Ramanujan have encouraged the myth of the mathematician as a person who is born with an innate talent, and is more or less a freak of nature. The reality appears to be far more like music or writing talents, where a great creator needs to have not only talent but also relatively early contact with a good (or better yet great) teacher. Currently, that happens more or less only by chance. We cannot expect every school district to have a great math teacher, although if we (as a society) devoted as much attention to it as we did to having great coaches in every school district we might achieve great things.The early chapters are easier to relate to, as most of us studied math in high school and many of us studied it in college. Later chapters, in which Stewart describes things like how to recognize the difference between a genius and a crank (when picking a thesis adviser), are a little more exotic to most of us.Stewart's book is, on the whole, enjoyable. It's easily broken up into bite-sized chunks (I read it on the bus going to and from work), and it is not the sort of page-turner that you will accidentally stay up until 3 am reading. But it's a good way of humanizing a field that too often is portrayed as so rational and abstract that the people who practice in it don't see people any more."
40,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44228074-irene,3,"Writing this on March 14th - apparently today is Pi Day, very appropriate.As a mathematician myself I am biased on this one. Sadly, most undergraduate schools do not have such inspiring professors that care about nurturing the students' talent and love for their discipline. So it is a good thing that Letters To A Young Mathematician was written in the first place. But because of this afore mentioned lack of inspiring professors on an undergraduate level it can be pretty disappointing when compared to reality.In Letters To A Young Mathematician, Ian Stewart describes the bad, the good and the better in the career of a professional mathematician to a young Meg, a gifted student who is thinking about studying mathematics at university and throughout the book progresses to obtain a PhD and become a professional researcher. Some chapters are interesting, some not and some are totally pointless (like the chapter about the blunders one could make as a professor and professional researcher. Sorry, not funny at all). Also, the letter format is a bit chaotic. The letters serve the author their purpose for introducing the topics he wants to tackle in an ordered manner, but they do not stand out as proper letters. Except for the introduction, they don't stick to the letter format at all and he author usually digress and forgets to round his ideas in most essays/letters.There are some interesting ideas in the book, especially the chapters on the importance of mathematical proofs. There are also some nice words demystifying the work of mathematicians and their lives in an ivory tower. And some beautiful words on the inherent beauty of mathematics, which unfortunately goes unnoticed for 99% of the population (or more). One of the best things of the book is the constant reference to other books on similar topics - my reading list has grown considerably.Letters To A Young Mathematician is an enjoyable read. I read the Spanish translation, which I had at home and had never read (I became interested in it after buying another book from the same author and seeing this title in his bibliography. I thought 'oh, I have that one and I've never read it before. Anyway). I have the feeling that the original would be funnier than the Spanish translation, which is rather dull, and I also spot a couple of odd expression, which are probably bad translations (e.g. Page 27 mentions 'las gráficas del Señor de los Anillos, which is a bad translation of The Lord Of The Rings' graphics, referring to the visual effects)."
41,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,3,"Probably nothing drastically new here for many young mathematicians, but still includes some good stories and useful tips, and it's always interesting to hear how an established professional got into their field in the first place.Stewart makes an interesting point that, unlike many other fields, you don't just happen to fall into math - it has to be something you're really into (although it may take a lot of lucky coincidences to let you realize that you're good at math and into it as well).There's also a good illustrative story useful especially for mathematicians, about how committees work. The committee had to choose between 2 options, and the mathematician in the group realized at once that one of the choices was much much better, so immediately he explained why. His reasons were clear and logical and nobody disagreed. But since the other committee members hadn't had a chance to have their say yet, the discussion continued. He stayed out of it, knowing he'd already made the most important point... but when it came to the vote, everybody had forgotten his point in the face of all the other rambling, and they voted for the other (worse) option instead. So... Logic is crucial but timing is important too!I also liked some of the comments he made about teaching - I don't know if I'd agree with all of it but it'd be worth returning to if I have a teaching position in the future. I especially like where he talks about how important it is to internalize lower-level ideas in math, not just recall their definitions or simplest expressions. For example, multiplying 5x4 is like taking four sets of five items each: 5+5+5+5. But you have to have some practice with the concept and internalize it before you can multiply 555x444, because it's not really sensible to do 555+555+... that many times. And once you've internalized it and reached a higher-level understanding, there's much more you can do with it than when you were still thinking in concrete terms of adding small sets of items."
42,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558368-deana,5,"I have no idea how to explain the genre of this, but it is excellent and highly recommended to EVERYONE, regardless of your interest in math (or lack thereof). The book unfolds as a series of letters from the author to Meg, a fictional (as far as I know) female with an interest in mathematics. The author, in case you are unaware, is a famous mathematician in real life. He's done lots of great research in the field, but in recent years his work has mainly been in writing ""popular mathematics"" - that is, books that the rest of us can understand to explain complicated, but interesting apsects of math that we don't see in school. Meg is made to be the daughter of a family friend. At the start of the book, she's in high school and contemplating becoming a math major. By the end of the book, she's a tenured professor/researcher at some unnamed university.At the start of the book, she has questions about how much money she could make with a math degree, whether it will just be more of the same crap she learned in high school but with bigger numbers (as is the usual pattern before college), whether learning mathematics will change her view of the world and change her view of beauty, and so forth. As the book goes on, it changes to talk about different ways of teaching mathematics (bad vs. good teachers), what kind of research problems mathematicians tackle, what it takes to get tenure, conferences and travel around the world...Ok, I'm making this sound really boring. It's not, not at all. It's the ANSWERS that are amazing, not the questions. Give it a try. I think you'll be surprised. It's a really fast read, and worth the few hours you'll put into it."
43,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/261589-jeff,3,"Letters to a Young Mathematician is a short epistolary book with chronological letters addressed to ""Meg,"" what I assume is a fictional mathematician. The letters begin with ""Meg"" in high school and end with her tenured position at a university. Through the course of the letters, Stewart gives advice and ruminates on the nature of mathematics, learning, teaching, and mathematical research and work. While the ideas are often enlightening (I was particularly taken with ideas about how mathematician's think through a problem and the nature of mathematics), some are deeply connected to Stewart's own experience and thus potentially not as generalizable as he would make them. For example, in the sections on how to learn and teach mathematics, Stewart suggests that practice and experience won't be able to overcome innate talent when developing original mathematical thinkers. This argument's primary reasoning is based in Stewart's own experience in school in which he didn't need to practice all that much to be successful. While he may be right, I find this reasoning to be a bit dubious. Just because he didn't need practice to become a great mathematician shouldn't negate the idea that someone could become a great mathematician by having the right experiences and developing their mathematical muscles.In general, Stewart does give the general public a peek into the world of mathematics and what it is that professional mathematicians actually do. "
44,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53456292-cody,5,"Being in an undergraduate math degree, this book really answered many of the questions I had been wondering about: Why do math? Pure or applied? What's it like to do research in mathematics? What's graduate school like? What's it like to do a PhD in mathematics? What's it like to teach mathematics? What's it like to be a mathematician?Since the book is structured as letters directed to Meg, the ""young mathematician,"" and being in a similar situation, it made this book very readable and opened my eyes on to many aspects of mathematics and the mathematical community.On a side note, I some of the ideas found the chapter ""How To Learn Math"" to be very interesting: When mathematicians try very hard to solve a problem with no luck, and then take a break for a few days and have an epiphany and come back and write a proof for it. One way I like to study for a course is by previewing the whole course and trying to understand it as a whole and its parts, and by trying to digest a number of the concepts throughout the book. The material often just feels way over my head at the time, but then when we go through the material in class, the concepts come together much easier. The relation between the epiphany of the mathematician and my way of learning brought more credence to this style of learning which I will further research about.Overall, the book was readable, insightful, and answered many of my questions."
45,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2064318-shayla,2,"""Letters to a Young Mathematician"" was not written for me. It was probably not written for you either unless you are a 16 or 17 year old female high school student who is very good at math and planning on becoming a professional mathematician. Keeping in mind the fact that I am not the target audience here is my review...The book is at times very interesting and inspiring, with fascinating anecdotes and lots of recommendations for other texts, and at other times rather trite and overly specific. I loved the chapter about mathematical proofs, but completely skipped over the one about how to deliver a math lecture. At the very least it made me want to read more about math.The letter format comes across as silly and really distracted me from what I'm sure were some good points somewhere in there. Writing fake letters might work for a novel but in a non-fiction book it really flopped, especially when the author throws in bits like ""really enjoyed our lunch last week, hope your dad is feeling better"" - even if you WERE the target audience that seems like overkill. And the paragraph advising ""Meg"" not to sleep with her professors was... off-putting to say the least.Overall I'd say the first half is much better than the second, and while I didn't particularly enjoy it it was a good introduction (very very basic and broad introduction) to books about math."
46,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/656942-david,4,"Ian Stewart is one of the most recognizable math popularizers out there. He has written many popular books, as well as writing a regular math puzzles column for Scientific American for a while. I read some of Stewart's popular math books when I was a kid (a blessing on our local public library!). I also admire his work with Golubitsky on analysis of pattern formation and nonlinear dynamics in terms of symmetry and symmetry breaking (his nontechnical books on symmetry in nature are a treat for anybody).Letters to a Young Mathematician is a curious book. The format is a sequence of mentoring letters to an imaginary student of mathematics, starting in high school and proceeding through tenure. The format is somewhat contrived, not the least because if I start writing a letter that touches on a mathematical topic, I can rarely resist diving into at least a few details (assuming the recipient will read something other than ""blah blah blah,"" of course). This is a popular book rather than a technical one, and so there are no such details. But at the same time... some of those letters could have been written to me. And others sound much like I probably sound (or would sound if I were a little more polished) when I'm asked ""what exactly do you do?"""

How many chapters do you expect to contain extended apologies for being a mathematician? If you guessed ``several'', you must have read Stewart's books before.Letters to a Young Mathematician is written as a series of condescending letters to a girl named Meg, who is considering becoming (and over the course of the book does become) a mathematician—condescending to Meg, but even more so to you. It's apparently intended as an update of Hardy's 1940 essay A Mathematician's Apology, but I haven't read that and neither have you.As expected, most of it is about how mathematics is useful, no seriously, and a solid career choice, and of course you don't have to become a professional mathematician, and if you do, remember that's it's more about people than about mathematics in the end, or should be. He pays some lip service to the inherent beauty of mathematics qua mathematics, but on the whole is still profoundly embarrassed by the concept.It's the sort of awkward point-missing we've come to expect of Stewart, really, only turned up to 11, and it's about as inspiring as your average middle school maths teacher."

I became aware of Euclid's axioms as ""the rules of the game"" from my early college days and learned the main difference between mathematics and Chemistry, Physics and Engineering. The latter, all require real work. I switched my major to mathematics. It was simple: proofs follow the rules of logical inference. I took a Philosophy class in Logic and promptly lost my book on the second day. No matter. It was perhaps, my only easy A. Math pulls on us from all sides, demanding like a foreign language to be understood, to be lived, to be loved.Only recently, have I gone back to revisit these roots. To play with the Poincaré conjecture, to ponder the Riemann hypothesis, or to suppose that if Fermat’s handwriting was small enough to fit in the margins that the solution to his last theorem would not now be credited to Eric Wiles. But it is really inconceivable that this is the case as the mathematics hadn't been invented at that time to solve this intricate puzzle.Therein lies the mystery. Thereby hangs the tale."

280,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35918208-joanne-greene,4,Good book - not always easy to follow. It rambles. Dr. Stewart mixes reflections on his teaching experiences with anecdotes about the great mathematicians and some of the greatest problems and developments in the field. Looking forward to reading some of his other works.
281,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48066-chazzle,1,"Letters to a Young Mathematician, by Ian Stewart - 1-1/2 stars; it did contain a few pearls, which gave just enough incentive to read the whole book, but overall, pretty boring"

285,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1191068-bill,4,Slightly indulgent / ego centric but a useful successor got GH Hardy's apology. Could inspire a young mathematican - at least it would dispell some illusions.

298,0465082319,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4705597-maria,5,Really good introduction to mathematics. I added about ten books to my to-read list while reading this book. Reading this book basically felt like sitting down with a really nice advisor.
