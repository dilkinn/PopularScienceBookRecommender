0,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,1,"Last week, I read Nick Bostrom's groundbreaking 
Superintelligence
, an extremely serious, well thought out look at the dangers of creating real artificial intelligences. It left me feeling more than a little concerned: despite working in AI myself, I had not fully appreciated how scary it is. I've just finished this book, written about three years after Bostrom's, and now I'm even more concerned.Bostrom's book has the air of being primarily intended for senior policy-makers in industry and government. It's dry and formal in tone, relentlessly footnoted, full of difficult words, and seldom goes out its way to try and entertain you. It appears to be the product of a great deal of diligent work, and the dominant note is one of a dire, Cassandra-like warning. But despite the fact that it quotes Bostrom on every other page, Tegmark's book is pretty much the opposite: it's manic and chatty, dumbed down to one of the lower common denominators, poorly structured, and full of winsome autobiographical revelations and engaging little science-fiction stories. I could have taken all that - I've read Tegmark's previous book, and I'm familiar with his style - but what really worries me is that he's trying to make us feel optimistic and hopeful. It'll be okay! He's founded his Future of Life Institute, all sorts of prominent AI people have joined up, they're organising conferences on AI safety and an incredible ongoing web conversation which anybody can join, and pretty soon they'll have the answer!Well, if you believe that you'll believe anything. As Bostrom explains, the problems here are not technical issues that can be addressed by good engineering. They are foundational philosophical questions that have been discussed for thousands of years without a great deal of progress having been made. It's readily conceivable that there are no solutions to them, and there's nothing available right now which even looks vaguely like a possible road towards a solution. Anyone expecting a magic fix to turn up over the next couple of decades is probably also expecting it to be delivered in person by the Easter Bunny riding a pink fluffy unicorn. And yet Tegmark goes on and on about his preferred future, where we become spacefaring AIs who head out, à la Olaf Stapledon, to transform the universe into one huge superintelligence which, after several billion years of development, will be able to perform ten to some very big number of computations per second. He spends inordinately many pages explaining various tweaks, all of which will no doubt be invalidated by the next major discovery in physics, that mean that it will be ten to this big number rather than ten to some slightly smaller big number. Why we're supposed to do it is never once explained. Stapledon's Cosmic Mind gets to make contact with the Star Maker, which at least is a worthy goal, but what Tegmark is hoping for is beyond me. I guess it's just, you know, cool. But all the same, we're supposed to stake the whole future of humanity on this bizarre and geeky dream.If Tegmark were a moron, I would be slightly reassured. I figured out some time ago that many books are written by morons. But he's a very clever person, who, at least on his own account, has considerable influence over the Secret International Network of Very Clever People. I suppose he may be fronting the superintelligent AI who's currently taking over the world; I don't know if that would make it better or worse, but at least it would make it more comprehensible. Aaaargh!To conclude, I can't do better than to quote a couple of passages which frequently occurred to me while reading Life 3.0. The first, taken from the final section of Bostrom's book, is one conspicuously not cited by Tegmark:Before the prospect of an intelligence explosion, we humans are like small children playing with a bomb. Such is the mismatch between the power of our plaything and the immaturity of our conduct. Superintelligence is a challenge for which we are not ready now and will not be ready for a long time. We have little idea when the detonation will occur, though if we hold the device to our ear we can hear a faint ticking sound.For a child with an undetonated bomb in its hands, a sensible thing to do would be to put it down gently, quickly back out of the room, and contact the nearest adult. Yet what we have here is not one child but many, each with access to an independent trigger mechanism. The chances that we will all find the sense to put down the dangerous stuff seem almost negligable. Some little idiot is bound to press the ignite button just to see what happens.The second passage, which has been one of my favorites since I was a teen, is from another exceptionally clear-sighted book, Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle:And I remembered The Fourteenth Book of Bokonon, which I had read in its entirety the night before. The Fourteenth Book is entitled 'What Can a Thoughtful Man Hope for Mankind on Earth, Given the Experiences of the Past Million Years?'It doesn't take long to read The Fourteenth Book. It consists of one word and a period.This is it:'Nothing.'________________________[And on further consideration...]As you can see, I found Life 3.0 extremely annoying. But at the same time, I also appreciate the point Tegmark makes, that it doesn't help just to say that we're all going to die. Some more positive approach is required.It seems to me, given the analysis in Bostrom's very sensible book, that there is little chance of making superintelligence 'safe' in any normal sense of the word. If we create a superintelligence, it will almost certainly replace us before long. So it follows that we have two realistic choices: a) Do not create a superintelligence.b) Create a superintelligence that we could happily envisage replacing us.I think most people will go for (a). If we are even going to consider (b), I would say that the priority should be to develop AIs with qualities that people will value, and which they feel are characteristic of what it truly means to be human. Some obvious candidates include creativity, humour, curiosity, honesty, appreciation of beauty, empathy and love.Tegmark briefly mentions ""creativity"", though his analysis of the already renowned move 37 in the second AlphaGo-Lee Sedol game is as superficial as the rest of the book. I see no real discussion of the other qualities."
1,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"I have to confess that my first reaction to this book was not anything to do with the contents, but trying to work out if there was something really clever about the the way the book's title is printed on the spine in white on cream, so it's illegible - would it be, for example, a subtle test of human versus artificial intelligence (AI)? However, that was just a distraction.Max Tegmark is an interesting and provocative thinker in the physics arena, so I had high hopes for what he'd come up with exploring the future of AI and its relationship to human beings. It's worth explaining that the title of the book refers to three 'levels' of life where 1.0 is 'can survive and replicate' (e.g. bacteria), 2.0 is can design its own software (e.g. us - where 'software' refers to our concepts, ideas and extended abilities such as language) and 3.0 is can design its own hardware, enabling it to transform itself more directly and quickly than our creativity enables us to do.The book starts with a bit of fiction, which I'm usually nervous about, but it actually works very well, as it's presented more like a non-fiction description of a business development rather than attempting all the quirks of fiction. In it we have a semi-plausible description of how a company that succeeds in producing a self-enhancing AI could take over the world. And this is genuinely thought-provoking.So, early on, I was convinced I was going to love this book. But unfortunately there is an awful lot of futurology in here (aka guesswork) and like all futurology, Tegmark's can be frustratingly specific about things that we are highly unlikely to be able to predict - though at least he recognises this is the case and points it out. He covers the various ways a super-intelligent AI could develop, whether it would become a rogue, how we'd interact with it... and then plunges on into more and more dramatic speculation, including a chapter that looks forward 'the next billion years and more.' Forgive me for feeling a bit 'So what?' about this.There is no doubt the whole business of super-AIs is an issue that needs thinking about and discussing - and Tegmark does this in an approachable and engaging fashion. It probably needs reading alongside Nick Bostrom's Superintelligence to get a well-rounded picture, though. It would have helped if it had been significantly shorter - it came across as being long because it was the kind of 'big book' that has to be chunky, and I think it would have been a lot more effective at half its length. One particular section that was ripe for trimming had a long list of scenarios, each of which was then worked through - dull reading, I'm afraid. In the end futurology is a bit like being told about someone else's dream. It probably seems fascinating to them, but it's hard to get too excited about it as a reader. Life 3.0 is an interesting book, but feels rather like a pet project, rather than a strong popular science title."
2,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70989760-lor-el,2," Unlike the author, I will try to be concise and make my point clear:1) There is so much name-dropping (authors, books, theories, Ivy League Universities, tv shows, movies... you name it, it's gonna be there) and basically it seems like a secondary literature review rather than an original work. 2) Some chapters feels like fillers, put there just to make the book thicker, they add little to no useful information on Humans and AIs whatsoever. 3) The long awaited (like, 300+ pages awaited) chapters on all the ethical questions and consciousness, which would have made the book worth reading for me, are just a scratch on the surface and do not delve into the depth of these multilayered issues. A show like ""Person of Interest"" (which, although the Prometheus-AI takeover described in the book is uncannily similar to the one perpetrated by Samaritan, is not even once cited in the book) did a better job at dealing with both ethics, machine learning and how human deal with two sentient and very different ASI. And I know... I know, ""that's just sci-fi"" but ultimately, so is this book."

In other words, Life 3.0 is the master of its own destiny, finally fully free from its evolutionary shackles.” In “Life 3.0 - Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence” by Max Tegmark See how good your PC is as it ages or you want to install a better graphics card, does the driver play nice with everything? Are you competent enough to sort it out or are you the sort of person who offloads that to IT? The guys in IT are like ducks or swans, all seems serene on the surface but underneath they are paddling hard to stay afloat. They are one badly written security update away from disaster. Do they install the latest security patch or wait for others to see what happens? Also, the more complex a system becomes the more subject it is to critical failures from minor changes, the more they become like having 100 spinning plates on the go at once. If your bank's computer goes belly up just as the proceeds from your house sale are sailing through the system from one solicitor to another is there enough of a data trail to prove it existed? Do you feel lucky? In this day and age, when the state-of-affairs is like the one I’m describing above, can we still talk about AI?   If you're into Computer Science, read on."
4,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67326390-scienceofsuccess,5,"tl;dr My animated summary ofLife 3.0 is available here: https://youtube.com/watch?v=9XIcOo5mwQ4We are approaching times when machines start to understand our world. There is a possibility, that in the near future we will be working with Artificial Intelligence as equal partners. This idea divided people into two groups. Some people expect androids to be our slaves, and others think that people will be working for AI. How should we approach this new age? Should we destroy all electronics, or work harder to make AI more powerful as soon as possible?Max Tegmark talks about every possible argument and every point of view regarding AI. It’s hard to find the main conclusion, because we have only theories. I found that a lot of those possibilities made me think more about my future and life overall.The author did an amazing job explaining the most likely outcomes with comparisons so simple, that even grandmas lacking technology knowledge could understand it. I never enjoyed science fiction, but Max used popular stories to better show ways AI development could go and kept it simple, steered clear of exaggerations.This is a must-read, whether you are a supporter or an opponent of AI."
5,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,1,"Nothing in this book was original. All of the many topics covered in this book were covered in other books that I have read previously. There was definitely a tedious feel to each of the chapters. I think there is no more important or interesting topic then super AI and the author is right when he wants to highlight the topic, but, please tell me things I don’t already know. The author started each chapter by telling me something that I had already knew, then he would tell me almost nothing more than what I knew, then he would summarize what he had said as if I had not already had read it elsewhere or within the chapter. Overall, the lack of depth of each topic presented made for a tedious presentation.I’m not even bothered by the things I think he got wrong. He makes a categorical error on the nature of our feelings. He thinks of them as things or objects which give us our subjective reality (subjectivity is his standard for self awareness, consciousness). I don’t think our feeling are things. He also appealed to S1 (quick) verse S2 (reflective) memory states. He had brought that up right after mentioning Popper’s falsification criteria. I found that somewhat ironic because S1 S2 definitely fall into the pseudo-science realm because there is no experiment in principal that I could design that would refute that S1 S2 paradigmatic hypothesis. I had a lot of these kinds of problems with this book, but the book failed mostly because it was superficial and it did not give a compelling narrative to wow the reader. There is no more interesting topic than super AI. It gets at the heart of what it means to be human, what our purpose and meaning is, what is consciousness, is there other complex life in the universe (yes, super AI relates to the Fermi paradox with self replicating von Neumann machines), and even whether or not we are living within a simulation (by all means, check out Neil deGrasse Tyson’s ‘are we living in a simulation’ hosted debate. It is well worth the two hours), and there is a way to tie Martin Heidegger into the discussion because his ready-at-hand, present-at-hand, and dasein schema means that solipsism is nonsensical and conscious (self aware) machines are not possible (his opinion, not mine), or one could mention Hegel in detail on these topics because of his relating the in itself to the for itself to the other (or in other words the subjective to the objective to spirit, or self awareness) but this author definitely didn’t have much philosophy behind him and it showed by his lack of depth regarding philosophy or philosophy of science. I have a weakness for books about AI. There should be no way that they bore me, but this author did that by not being able to connect the dots and by only telling me things that were overly familiar and having no real philosophical background as a foundation. (Read Bostrom’s , or Kurzweil’s, or Pedro Domingos’ book, or either of Harari’s books. Each (except for Domingo) was mentioned in this book)."
6,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"Just finished listening to an audio version of ""Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,"" a new book by Max Tegmark. His ""My Mathematical Universe"" is one of my favorites, so I was really looking forward to his new book. And he didn't disappoint. This is a gripping text for anyone interested in AI and the future of life on our planet and beyond. Without a doubt, this is the most important conversation of our times. If you fail to see why it is so important, consider this. Most AI experts and industry insiders predict that artificial general intelligence (human-level and above) will become a reality either in a couple of decades or within this century. If someone told you that aliens are heading toward our planet and will land in some 20 years, I guess a lot of people, I mean really a lot of people, would start to freak out. Politicians, the academe, etc. would start thinking hard what to do about it. We are in a similar situation with AI research. Considering the incredible progress made in the field, it is time to think how to make sure AGI, if/when created, is beneficial to humanity. If you are wondering about the title of the book, Tegmark posits that Life 1.0 is life where both the hardware and software are evolved rather than designed (for example, bacteria). Humans, on the other hand, are examples of “Life 2.0”: life whose hardware is evolved, but whose software is largely designed. By software Tegmark means all the algorithms and knowledge that we use to process the information from our senses and decide what to do—everything from the ability to recognize your friends when you see them to your ability to walk, read, write, calculate, sing and tell jokes.Finally, Life 3.0 designs and upgrades both its software and hardware.In summary he divides the development of life into three stages, distinguished by life’s ability to design itself:• Life 1.0 (biological stage): evolves its hardware and software• Life 2.0 (cultural stage): evolves its hardware, designs much of its software• Life 3.0 (technological stage): designs its hardware and software.In fact, considering the current progress with prosthetics, cochlear devices, etc., he says, we are more like Life 2.1 already. But he thinks it is more likely that AGI will be created faster than any cyborg-style mind uploading becomes a reality (for description of that vision, see an interesting book ""The Age of Em"" by by Robin Hanson).Tegmark begins his book with a pretty realistic scenario of a superintelligence break-out. Reads like a sci-fi thriller but is in fact much better than what Hollywood has come up with so far on this subject.He then explores the current state of research into machine learning and some breakthroughs in the field. Then he tries to imagine the near and more distant future. It takes a physicist to write a compelling vision how far life can progress if limited only by the laws of physics. This part of the book is truly mind-boggling even if most of it can hardly be achievable due to various limitations and possible cosmocalypses (also described by the author). Then he explores the subject of consciousness. Many people view AGI as our descendants. Even if they choose to eliminate us, they will live on and continue the story of life in our part of the observable Universe. Well, what if what we create are zombies without any consciousness? Tegmark discusses what consciousness could be, briefly considers Integrated information theory as a viable explanation of the phenomenon, but also enumerates the most common criticisms of the theory. ""Consciousness is the way information feels when being processed in certain ways,"" he summarizes his own view of consciousness and speculates that it must be substrate-independent, similarly to remembering, computing and learning. He finishes his book optimistically, describing the work he does at the Future of Life Institute he has founded. Just like his previous book, ""Life 3.0"" is a brilliant example of existential hope, something humanity really needs. If you want to read an enthrolling, captivating book on AI, choose this one. Not that it needs any promotion after it was praised by Elon Musk :). Follow it up by Nick Bostrom's voluminous ""Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies,"" another great text on the subject."
7,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Probably the best book so far on the possibilities and dangers of artificial intelligence. The grown-up boy genius, Max Tegmark, is ebullient, full of energy, and very charming. What might be considered name dropping in another author is readily forgiven, as he pulls us into the excitement of this rapidly developing field, and his cofounding of The Future Life Institute to ensure that safety measures are adopted to stop AI from dispensing with its dumb old human forebears.The prelude contains a very plausible but imaginative fictional account of the Omega Team and Prometheus, its powerful AI. Storytelling brings the technology and its human implications vividly to life.Some chapters are intensely exciting, opening new intellectual vistas with the turn of every page. Others, including Our Cosmic Endowment: The Next Billion Years and Beyond and Consciousness are a touch turgid and tedious, but I never found the journey less than worthwhile."
8,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195330-tomq,3,"Life 3.0 is in turns enlightening and infuriating. It is worth reading for the many enlightening bits. 
We are likely to invent A.I. soon. (1) What could happen next, and (2) what should happen next?
To tackle this subject satisfyingly would require somebody who is an unbiased AI researcher, a psychologist, a neuroscientist, a moral philosopher, a metaphysician, a philosopher of mind, an economist, a political scientist, a poet, and perhaps more. Since that person doesn't exist, we're stuck with Tegmark, who is none of the above. He is a physicist and a cosmologist. As a result, Tegmark often tries to forcefully shove physics-shaped answers into AI/economics/philosophy/whatever-shaped problems: when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.However, Tegmark is smart, curious, and open-minded, and has an impressive talent for networking, helped in part by his credentials as a physicist. He has privileged access to a broad range of top thinkers from various disciplines, including much of the top brass of AI research. In Life 3.0, Tegmark is at his best when he acts as a curator and interpreter, explaining a broad range of ideas in a simple, accessible fashion. There's a lot of exciting things to learn from in this book, on domains as varied as game theory (applied to hierarchical organization), teleological interpretations of physical laws, and the scope of potential futures resulting from the irruption of human-level AI. They're often covered at a rather superficial level, but you've got to start somewhere.So there are a lot of good ideas. But the distribution of ideas that Tegmark is drawing from is heavily skewed towards the ""hard sciences"". Often the humanities (incl. philosophy, economics...) are not given a say, even when their contribution is not just relevant, but indispensable. For instance, when Tegmark discusses the origin of the values that govern human behavior, he concludes that it does not fit our ""genes"", but our ""feelings""... Bizarrely forgetting about culture! At another point, we spend considerable time discussing how much intelligent life the universe can harbor, with barely a word on why that's a good thing. Yet another omission concerns the medium term consequences of sub-human AI in terms of employment, political manipulation, and so on; these very urgent issues are quickly dismissed in a few superficial pages.Overall, then, Life 3.0 is a good book that suffers from massive blind spots. Think of it as a four or five-stars book from which half the pages have been torn away.PS: in a hilariously groveling sentence, Tegmark describes his benefactor Elon Musk as ""tall, handsome, eloquent and incredibly knowledgeable"". Much of Tegmark's interesting work is funded, rather generously, by Elon Musk. One wonders how Musks' ongoing ""RUD"" (rapid unscheduled disassembly) is going to affect the project."
9,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16831198-wendy,5,"“Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence” which I won through Goodreads Giveaways is a fascinating subject that seems like the stuff of a science-fiction novel. It begins with an imaginative “what-if” premise with the tale of the Omega Team who, with a strong commitment to helping humanity secretly build an AI called Prometheus. With security measures in place, this ultra-intelligent machine not only makes millions for its parent organization but transforms the world positively and negatively.With the creation of Artificial Intelligence closer than we can imagine, Max Tegman enables a layperson like myself to look its possibility, form (i.e. machine, cyborg), pros and cons, as well as impact on humanity (i.e. jobs, laws, weapons) with a perspective of its future potential. A uniquely interesting topic especially one which would affect mankind on a global scale, he deals with it honestly pointing to the most controversial issues near the end of the book.“Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence” is a book that I intend to read again as Max Tegman’s discussion of Artificial Intelligence is very pertinent and a loaded topic not only for our generation but as we look ahead to the future."
10,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12889617-anne,4,"An excellent look at how AI is shaping our world, illuminating both the infinite potential AND inherent risks of AI systems building smarter versions of themselves until their intelligence surpasses humans. You can feel the author's passion and desire to bring awareness to the philosophical discussion surrounding AI's. I appreciated how he avoided making judgments on what humanity should/shouldn't do, but instead presented an array of fascinating possible futures, and asks the reader to think about what future they would want.There's a lot of high level thinking here, but the author did a great job presenting this with the average reader in mind, so that I could grasp (most of) the concepts. One of my favorite parts of this book the prologue! It's the author's fictional tale about a team that developed an AI and used it in a myriad of ways, and you see all the impacts rippling out throughout the world. It was crazy to even imagine it happening that way and yet sounded totally plausible at the same time! It's a great illustration of just how terrifying and exciting the whole idea of AI is. If you want to check out this tale, you can actually read it online here: http://nautil.us/issue/53/monsters/th..."
11,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4934590-david-yoon,3,"Tegmark is an exuberant AI cheerleader awash in the unbridled nerdy enthusiasm of an inevitable post-human future. To his credit the book, a reflection of the work he's doing out in the world, attempts to broaden the discussion around AI to something more than wondering if sentient robots will kill us all. His prelude on a plausible AI trajectory is compelling and thoughtful stuff and I loved how it expanded the way I think of AI's progress. The exploration into considering whether super intelligent AI become zookeepers or benevolent dictators or enslaved gods is great too. But thinking about the philosophical considerations of consciousness, intelligence and evolution left me cold and the name dropping, back slapping historical narrative added yet another element to this unbalanced read. In here is a fascinating exploration of what AI could mean for the world, it's just buried under a lot of wonky, wordy stuff that obscured the picture I was trying to form. Maybe I've been spoiled by more narrative, bite-sized, non-fiction - I want the abridged version of this book. "
12,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65390806-niklas-laninge,5,"By far the best book i have read on the topic. To approach life and AI from a physicists perspective really sets this book apart from say Superintelligence, 2nd Machineage and Humans need not apply. Also, the fictional aspects really makes this book a bit of a page-turner. "
13,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,4,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), in many different forms, has been around for a while now. Most of us, surely, have noticed that this buzzword now frequents many fields of modern human (still) activity. From small things, like my friend recently letting AI to clip and edit his GoPro movie to IBM Watson with deep thinking capabilities, AI is here to permanently alter our lives.According to Marshall Brain, humans will become as irrelevant as cockroaches. Indeed, if humans create something more intelligent than themselves to improve their lives, why this intelligence should care about us in the end. There is an excellent analogy in the book illustrating this point: a colony of ants creating a human to improve the life of the ant colony. How long this human would be interested to take care of those ants? Wouldn’t there be some more inspiring endeavors to undertake by having this huge advantage of intelligence? This is one of the many thought provoking goodies the reader can find in Max Tegmark’s book.At this stage, AI has so many unproved areas, unanswered questions, contradicting views on dangers and opportunities. The author tries to address a very broad spectrum of those issues. There are many speculative thesis in the book, as it should be in the field with so many ground-breaking activities. The focus of the book is rather fundamental and philosophical, as opposed to more practical and technological showing tangible applications of AI. Max Tegmark analyses essential concepts for AI to appear and evolve. These include goals, consciousness, learning, memory, computation, etc. Those fundamental concepts are backed up with physics, philosophy, and social aspects of artificial intelligence. The author provides a very broad spectrum of possible scenarios of the AI future.The book is interesting and important. Besides many theoretical aspects of AI, it analyses very central questions like ethics and safety of humanity in the light of advancing AI. It is hard to disagree with Max Tegmark that this topics should be one of the most important conversations of our times."
14,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"68th book for 2017.This book is somewhere between a 2-and-3 stars for me.The book focuses on the long-term dangers of General Artificial Intelligence. The sort of problems that might occur with the great-grandson of HAL3000 in the distant future. There is no discussion of short-to-medium-term dangers from AI destroying millions of jobs. This book is firmly focussed on the danger of the coming age of superminds. One of the perceived dangers mentioned multiple times is of the form ""how do I keep on living when I am no longer the smartest person in room?"" the sort of issue I guess most non-tenured MIT professors don't worry about. The constant name dropping/adulation of various researchers was irritating/distracting (e.g., my wife and I had a delightful dinner with Elon Musk where we discussed etc etc). His description of Tononi in the consciousness chapter was so over the top it had me spitting out my coffee in laughter. I wouldn't have minded the deep future speculation if it just felt richer. There are no intellectual fireworks here. This is a pretty pedestrian plod through territory that has been better covered in many scifi works. The topic I know best, consciousness, was covered in a superficial and quite biased fashion, which makes me worry that areas I don't know so well were similarly short-changed. I suspect Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom would offer a far better read."
15,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7331806-rob-adey,1,"I was wary of this book when I saw an Elon Musk blurb on the cover. But I enjoyed Tegmark's last book so I gave it a go and... I'm sorry to say he's having dinner with Elon Musk in the first chapter, and if you have dinner with Elon Musk and don't mention some pretty straightforward and low-tech ways he might actually help humanity, and instead indulge him in some hackneyed sci-fi wank fantasies about corporations creating AI and secretly taking over the world, then, well, you're just enabling a leech. I tried to put that aside, I carried on, but it shows that Tegmark's primarily a cosmologist. The book is basically a bunch of magazine-depth summaries of various aspects of AI; most of it I've seen done better in various other books (books not chiefly about AI, in the main). And to top it all there's some terrible graphics, e.g. a greyscale pie chart with about 60 roughly equally sized segments. Minimum Tegmarks."
16,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6078052-tashfin-awal,5,"I received this book for free through Goodreads Giveaways and have chosen to give my honest opinion about it.This book was a phenomenal read! It opened my mind up to so many new things, it was truly very insightful! The arguments and ideas presented in this book develop some current well-known facts as well as some new theories, all of which are incredibly interesting! The lengths to which arguments are presented and the details greatly help develop the book. "
17,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5995202-isil-arican,2,"This one was the most disappointing book I read this year. I started it with optimism: after all the writer is a very intelligent man, it is a very interesting topic, and a particular area I am interested in. Maybe I had too high expectations, but it was an utter disappointment and a waste of time for me.I should admit, the writer has a clear language, he describes his thoughts well and book is well written. However, my issue is with content more than the style.I wanted to read this book to understand the legitimate issues and ethical concerns with AI, and how,  we, as an advancing technological civilization can take appropriate precautions to ensure it happens the right way. Based on the credentials of the writer, I was anticipating a balanced, clear and thoughtful approach, sound pros and cons arguments and some realistic suggestions. Instead, I ended up reading a book that is shallow and filled with incredulous speculations.The writer took the easy way. Instead of diving deep into ethical issues and valid concerns around AI he speculates on different scenarios in great details. So much that I thought it would be more fun and more realistic to read a science fiction novel, because it would be more plausible in many ways, and fun too. He goes into endless speculations of how AI might go wrong in multiple ways and takes an obvious joy of making those as detailed and long ( gosh, they are long) as they can be. Then instead of going into details of some precautions of his disaster scenario, he goes onto another alternative doomsday scenario. He jumps from one extreme possibility to other, humans being a slave to AI to a total annihilation of the human race. As he entertains himself with various far-fetched AI scenarios, he conveniently avoids the harder to discuss subjects, like ethics and social dilemmas around AIs.To give an example of how preposterous his scenarios are: He claims the advanced AI will need lot of energy that would be hard to fulfill. But he also claims once we are able to build mega architectural structures that can tap into the energy of a black hole, we won't have that problem anymore. (Yes, you read it correctly.)After reading a couple of these far-fetched ideas with no real current concerns, I lost all my interest in this book and read it just to finish it. The rest did not change my mind either. Shallow arguments continued as the writer's rich imagination soared.This is the AI version of Hariri's books. Lots of speculation, false analogies, and it appeals to those who claim they are smarter than the average folk. While feeding the subtle conspiracy theory mindset to those who like to call themselves intellectuals, it makes them feel better and feel up to date. After all, they already figured out everything on sociopolitical sciences with Hariri, and now they can claim expertise in computer sciences and artificial intelligence as well. Now I need to read an actual and a good science fiction book to clear my brain cells and readjust them to the boundary between reality and fiction."
18,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,A basic book on Artificial intelligence and the future of life in the universe. This book touches on the major issues with Artificial intelligence including the prospects and dangers but it doesn't go very deep into the issue. I think Nick Bostrom goes deeper but this book makes a nice introduction to the general topic.
19,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,2,"Ask people to describe what they imagine artificial intelligence and a number of their reference points would no doubt be rooted in film and literature. There is the brutal robot from the Terminator films, the benign but deadly HAL9000 from 2001 A Space Odyssey, and the contemplative Deep Thought that Douglas Adams gave us. AI has a long way to go, but it is becoming something that people are beginning to use on a daily basis when they talk to Siri or Alexa. The potential benefits of AI for humanity could be enormous, it could be used to run all sorts of systems, search for crimes and maybe be part of the justice process, monitor our health, assist with our jobs, and have the potential to actually do some of the most menial. People are considering using them for warfare too, one step on from what the drone does under human control at the moment. Whilst AI excites some people who can only see the positives, after all the potential of it is huge; there are others who are very concerned that about the downsides so much so that there are AI systems that are not connected to the world wide web. Using AI for war could backfire spectacularly, bye bye human race; and what happens if the AI managing your house is hacked? Or the one in your car fails at speed. Images of those pods in the matrix come to mind…The subjects Tegmark covers In Life 3.0 goes some way to addressing these and a lot more issues that are concerning people about the implications of AI. Some of the subjects he writes about were what you'd expect in a book like this, consciousness, intelligence, life and the implications of an AI totalitarian state, would it be a utopia or worse. There were some chapters that I didn't think were totally relevant to the subject; for example, he wanders off into the realms of space-time and goals. Was a little disappointing overall as this is a subject that needs urgent discussion right now. "
20,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,1,"I got this book based on a review that stated the book was about artificial intelligence (AI) and was extremely disappointed to find there was almost zero technical coverage of AI.The author mentions several of the well known AI applications such as games, language, etc., but nothing about how these apps are built.The book is about the future of life with AI becoming the life of the future as super intelligent computers. It is based on the saying ""it will be a long time before machines are more intelligent than humans, it may take a hundred years."" He discusses who believes this, but no discussion of the technical aspects that could lead to this result.He spends a lot of time talking about millions of years in the future and nonsense like computers as large as a galaxy. The author thinks Earth is the only life in the universe which is also nonsense. I skimmed most of the book. "

It ends with a solid philosophical exploration of what intelligence and consciousness are. "
22,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,2,"Kind of a disappointing book. Physicist Max Tegmark tries to explain the current status of artificial intelligence research to a broad public in order to invite all of us to start sharing our ideas and wishes for the future. Both goals are commendable - one wishes more scientists would adopt this approach - and I am fully convinced of the need for this public debate.But Tegmark waters down all the technicalities to explain the main concepts and (his) definitions of life, intelligence, consciousness, etc. in a mere two chapters. The rest of the book consists of future scenario's and speculations about dangers, costs and benefits. Intelligence consists of remembering, calculating and learning; all three components are substrate independent, meaning they can use whatever matter is available to operate; which means that artificial intelligence is only limited by natural laws of physics, not human ingenuity. Currently, scientists are trying to build a human-level artificial general intelligence, and the question is whether the most effective and efficient means is to model this to human brain processes or to adopt a non-human approach. In short, artificial intelligence, due to its substrate independence, is not tied to biological limits like us - it can develop both its hardware and its software. Hardware restraints are economic profitability (i.e. compared to human labour) and material availiability (i.e. the current technological status). Software is, at least theoreticially, unlimited, and proceeds in an exponential fashion.This last point is the most important lesson I take from Life 3.0. AI has recursive function, meaning its algorithms loop back onto itself, in effect improving its own thought processes. This means that AI can develop itself into ever more effective intelligence, possibly far surpassing human intelligence in the near future. The debate is out whether such a superintelligence is possible and if so, how close we are. Again, there is absolutely no consensus among experts on this question.AI can be applied to almost all fields of human societies: transport, communications, health care, law, warfare, economics, jobs, etc. As a matter of fact, we already are witnessing the transformation of society, and things will only change faster in the near future. Tegmark distinguishes between the near future and the far future. In the near future, we have to deal with an ever-chaning world and we can use these changes for better or for worse. The near-future is mostly unpredictable and heavily ethical - moral choices dictate the way AI will shape our world. This requires the public to get engaged - and quickly - with these subjectsThe more far off future is, paradoxically, much more predictable. Laws of physics dictate that AI can develop to heights which surpass human imagination, making human-AI-integration, an AI-explosion throughout space, etc. possible scenario's. The only limits here are, again, human choices. What role do we choose for AI: a superintelligence? A human-level intelligence? No AI? And should this intelligence have its own goal-setting opportunities? These and a myriad other choices require the engagement of the public, Tegmark convinces us - and I think he is right.The book itself is a heroic attempt to inform the public. The only downside is the superficiality when it comes to technicalities (understandable), turning the book into a speculative essay - Tegmark tries to inform us about all the possible scenario's and developments, but is not able to point us to the likely ones. I think the book should be seen as a discussion starter: Tegmark throws up the ball, it is up to us to catch it and run with it. In this, the book succeeds - it's just I had rather seen some more technical information."

24,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1510665-steven-peck,3,"Don't let this 3 star review keep you from reading this book. It is well worth engaging with. Tegmark has done a great service in getting people thinking about these issues. It's just his view is too seeped in our current situations and imagines future AI as being rather mundane extensions our current concerns. Much of this is long expositions of trivialities of imagined futures. I think Tegmark needs to read more science fiction to get a better sense of the breadth of possible futures. Still, a nice starting place to get conversation rolling."

26,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80375046-shnila-parveen,3,"  “After 13.8 billion years of cosmic evolution, development has accelerated dramatically here on Earth: Life 1.0 arrived about 4 billion years ago, Life 2.0 (we humans) arrived about a hundred millennia ago, and many AI researchers think that Life 3.0 may arrive during the coming century, perhaps even during our lifetime, spawned by progress in AI. What will happen, and what will this mean for us? That’s the topic of this book.”  The book does not stop at the possibilities for Life 3.0, it goes much further into future 10000 years from now and then still further into next billion years beyond, with or without us humans. What will significantly distinguish future is where we only have the ability to design only our software and very limited control over our hardware, Life 3.0 it will be able to design both its software as well as hardware. Although the timelines must be are controversial, it is not completely impossible that a superhuman AI will appear within few decades. Artificial intelligence has been with us for years, being improved to achieve more complex goals over time but we continue to move the goal post to define Artificial Intelligence. Today’s artificial intelligence has the capability to achieve specific goals very well whereas humans are capable to achieve more broad goals. The complexity differs from humans to machines, since what may seem simple for humans is very complex to be achieved by machines. For example, something seemingly as simple as recognizing a friend in a picture, could be achieved by machines only very recently. This has been nicely explained by Hans Moravec’s landscape of human competence.We have had many breakthroughs with AI in past decades with foray into space exploration, finance, manufacturing, transportation, energy, healthcare, communication and automated weapons. With multiple benefits, the risks are also multi-fold. Instead of being scared away with the dreadful picture of future painted by popular media, the need of the hour is to determine what kind of future do we want with AI and work towards that goal. Hence the need for beneficial AI. Once we achieve the Artificial General Intelligence, the intelligence explosion or singularity becomes highly plausible. There is vast spectrum of possibilities ranging from Totalitarianism to Libertarian Utopia, depending on the kind of Superintelligence that comes into being. Contrary to what maybe perceived through frequent anthropomorphism in Hollywood movies, brain emulation might not be quickest route to artificial general intelligence since why would technology take the same path as evolution did.   ""In contrast, our most common ways of generating energy today are woefully inefficient. Digesting a candy bar is merely 0.00000001% efficient, in the sense that it releases a mere ten-trillionth of the energy mc2 that it contains. If your stomach were even 0.001% efficient, then you’d only need to eat a single meal for the rest of your life.""  The energy needs of the advanced life and information processing require us to think about better ways of generating energy. Some of the theoretical models towards this end include Dyson Sphere, Sphalerizer and Black hole evaporation. Advanced technology will be capable to change one substance into another by rearrangement of atoms or its constituents. In such a future, the only worthwhile commodity will be Information.   “To wisely decide what to do about AI development, we humans need to confront not only traditional computational challenges, but also some of the most obdurate questions in philosophy. To program a self-driving car, we need to solve the trolley problem of whom to hit during an accident. To program a friendly AI, we need to capture the meaning of life. What’s “meaning”? What’s “life”? What’s the ultimate ethical imperative? In other words, how should we strive to shape the future of our Universe? If we cede control to a superintelligence before answering these questions rigorously, the answer it comes up with is unlikely to involve us.”  Our purpose in this universe is not just to survive and replicate, if we do not improve our technology, the question is not whether humanity will go extinct but instead how. With so much conversation happening around us regarding Artificial Intelligence and its future, it is important to have a perspective grounded on facts and to dispel myths. This is a fascinating book which has not just raised some very profound questions regarding our future with AI but has also provided an evaluation of possible options for us. Max Tegmark has founded a non-profit research institute called Future of Life, to bring together all the eminent AI researchers to think about the course where we want the humanity to steer in a future of Artificial Intelligence. Readers would like Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies by Nick Bostrom as a follow up read, which is a more academically inclined book on the same subject.  "
27,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28532028-kair-k-sper,5,"Unless God is finally bothered enough to take the elevator down to earth and ban all further technological research, we will eventually give birth to AI. That AI will then be capable of developing a far better AI than the one we, smartish ape cousins, mashed together. This book does a wonderful job of laying out the context and some possible scenarios of what will happen next. Unfortunately it also excels at describing the microscopic chance we have of getting it right. It is like building the next version of Microsoft Windows with the slight difference that even the smallest bug or error will wipe humans out of existence.I have to give credit to the author who keeps a positive attitude (much like Stephen Hawking) while staring deep into the abyss. Thinking back on Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage, it will indeed require hope, unprecedented leadership and some dumb luck to pull it all off. The rewards and the risk have never been greater. And will likely never be greater.If you’re an analytical realist, chances are you’ll live longer if you don’t read this book. On the flip side, if enough people read this book, maybe the human race will live longer."
28,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"If you are confused by the title of the book, let me have a moment to explain. The author divides stages of life into three: 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. Life 1.0, or biological revolution, consists of bacteria and single-celled organisms. Both hardware, the body, and software, the algorithms used to process our thoughts and emotions, are evolved; the hardware and software can be changed, but the process cannot happen in a single organism's lifetime—it has to gradually evolve over many generations. Life 2.0, cultural revolution, is human whose hardware is evolved, but the software is designed, in this case by studying, in a single person's lifetime like reading, thinking, writing, joking, or inventing new technologies. Life 3.0, the technological revolution, is Artificial Intelligence whose hardware and software can be designed: it can replicate itself from scratch and build new bodies relatively quickly from raw materials, plus, it can also learn about the surroundings, gather the information, and avoid mistakes, enabling it to advance enormously.For a mouse, it's between 1.0 and 2.0. We may think that its software is also designed. Although it can learn some tricks or be able to learn something, it couldn't develop a proper language to communicate or other methods that can efficiently help them transfer the knowledge they gather to the next generations. So when their newborn starts his life, he has to learn from scratch by watching the elders.For human in the 21st century, it's between 2.0 and 3.0. We can re-attach new hip joints, amend bones, make ourselves stronger than usual by medications, and cure many diseases, but we cannot design our body to be immensely different like having two brains, being 5 meters tall or run 100 meters per second.About the book, Max Tegmark starts with a fictional, but possible, scénario that a team of scientists and engineers called Omega secretly build an AI machine called Prometheus. The AI not only makes billions of dollars for its creators, but also transforms our world both positively and negatively. As the book progresses, the author occasionally includes fictional scenarios that fit the description he has presented. These may discredit or downgrade the seriousness of his ideas, but to me, they illustrate the situations more vividly, enabling me to grasp the views better.For the rise of Artificial Intelligence, it is not a matter of if, but when and how. When the technology of a more sophisticated Artificial Intelligence arrives, what will be our future be like? Will we need to work anymore? Will we totally rely on the AI to do our daily job? Will human being with flesh and bone be needed anymore if we can transform our consciousness into computers? What about the future of our space exploration? The author carefully answers these questions by using the information he has learnt from many scientists and engineers who are in the frontier of this technology.AI is still controversial because people are afraid that it will outsmart us all and exterminate our species once it finds us unnecessary. Hollywood movies usually give AI a disastrous reputation as being cruel and dangerous, but we have to equally consider its usefulness for our civilization. We have to be optimistic about the future along with tentative steps by considering the consequences, and this is why AI safety research are needed because rather than worrying, we should be working to find a plan to prevent the unforseen tragedy.With today's limited technology, humans have been killed by robots in factories because of the mistakes or carelessness made by the humans, resulting in their being crushed by the robots since they are unaware that humans are in harm ways. If we design a robot that is smarter and able to recognize humans when they are in danger, we will be able to save human lives because the robot will stop what it is doing since their movement is about to harm a human.Recently, the president of Russia Vladimir Putin said, as I paraphrased here, any country controls AI controls the world. This view resonates with many scientists and engineers, which is why we repeatedly demand the world to discuss this issue more widely and intellectually as we all will be responsible for the future of the next generation.""Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence"" teaches me more than I wanted to know, and this is marvelous because one needs sufficient knowledge on this issue in order to have a proper conversation as totally positive or negative views alone would not give justice to the topic.This book will comfortably be in top three I've read this year.More book reviews at https://menglongstarstuff.wordpress.com"
29,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12287031-kiwi-begs2differ,4,"An excellent read, thought provoking and insightful, a must read for anyone interested in the challenges that scientists face in shaping the behaviour of new technology. It often strays on the realm of speculative fiction but in doing so, it forces the reader into answering important questions. What future do we want?How will Artificial Intelligence affect crime, war, justice, jobs, society and our very sense of being human?Might a superintelligent friendly AI (AI whose goals are aligned with ours) find our current human goals as uninspiring and vapid as you find those of the ants, and evolve new goals different from those it learned and adopted from us?By their nature, books on the future of AI are highly speculative and this one is no different, it poses many confronting “what if” questions. At some stage, it felt like reading science fiction (in fact the book opens with a plausible future “Omega” scenario where superintellingence takes over). However, the supporting arguments are well grounded in latest research and the presented scientific theories are validated with observations (even if their value in practical applications is optimistic, for example in the chapter dedicated to the energy sources). This book is well articulated. There is an evident effort on the author’s part to make the arguments understood, in layperson terms, with technospeak reduced to a minimum. Generally speaking, I found myself in agreement with the author’s premise; my main objection is with his definition of intelligence, stated as “the ability to accomplish complex tasks”. For me this definition is way too loose. The logical consequences of Tegmark’s broad definition brings to extreme statements, e.g. non living matter (like cement and steel) having goals (or purpose). While today we may call artefacts “intelligent”, for exaple appliances, like TVs, phones, and even software like Deep Blue, in my view, true intelligence is not limited to problem solving but involves a level of consciousness, i.e. subjective experience (e.g. an entity that can suffer or feel joy), ability to learn, and/or free will. I believe we have the potential one day to develop intelligent machines, i.e. true AI. I particularly liked the chapter on the challenges of controlling the behaviour of future AI and the question of whether it would be even meaningful to attempt to do so. All the possible scenarios presented were interesting, spanning the full spectrum from high-tech to low-tech to no-tech, with included cost benefit analysis. Although I couldn’t decide on a definitive winner, (both Egalitarian Utopia and Descents appeal to me), acceptance of their risks and potential pitfalls is crucial. Particularly disturbing is the idea of the AI breakout and how easy it looks like in Tegmark’s scenarios. Another concern is the AI potentially choosing “wrong” option, especially taking into consideration close calls from our past (e.g. a couple of instances when nuclear catastrophe was thwarted by humans, AI’s logical decisions in these cases would probably have ended in disaster).Another discussion I enjoyed was in the chapter of ethics, regarding the values we want our future society to satisfy. Although humanity today is nowhere near an ethical consensus, there are many basic principles around which there is broad agreement. Their implementation in a world that includes superintelligent beings has implications in many fields e.g. privacy, economy, law.A great read that I’d recommend to anyone interested in the topic of Artificial Intelligence, the long-term effects of future technology and its ramifications on all aspects of mankind. 4.5 stars.Fav. Quotes:Intelligence enables control: humans control tigers not because we’re stronger, but because we’re smarter. This means that if we cede our position as smartest on our planet, it’s possible that we might also cede control.Your synapses store all your knowledge and skills as roughly 100 terabytes’ worth of information, while your DNA stores merely about a gigabyte, barely enough to store a single movie download. So it’s physically impossible for an infant to be born speaking perfect English and ready to ace her college entrance exams: there’s no way the information could have been preloaded into her brain, since the main information module she got from her parents (her DNA) lacks sufficient information-storage capacity.Perhaps there’s a way of designing a self-improving AI that’s guaranteed to retain human-friendly goals forever, but I think it’s fair to say that we don’t yet know how to build one—or even whether it’s possible. In conclusion, the AI goal-alignment problem has three parts, none of which is solved and all of which are now the subject of active research. Since they’re so hard, it’s safest to start devoting our best efforts to them now, long before any superintelligence is developed, to ensure that we’ll have the answers when we need them.The real risk with AGI isn’t malice but competence. A superintelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours, we’re in trouble. As I mentioned in chapter 1, people don’t think twice about flooding anthills to build hydroelectric dams, so let’s not place humanity in the position of those ants.The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.

But it’s still a really good book. Allow me to explain.The problem wasn’t the arguments or the writing.It was the editing. No, not the copy editing. Because hew cares about typos? Not me. Rather, it was the content editing that lagged. On Sam Harris’s Waking Up podcast, Life 3.0 author Max Tegmark praised the editor (no need to name names) of the book as a personal friend. This dual relationship may have inhibited the (often difficult and awkward) editorial process, as evidenced by numerous repetitions of the exact same examples, metaphors and phrasings found throughout the text. After the 4th or 5th utilization of the identical passage, I became confused, and honestly wondered if I had lost my place in the text, and was re-reading the same page. In fact, I was re-reading the same (or similar) passage, just recycled, over and over.Bad form. But don’t hate. It’s still a really good book that covers heady topics such as; life, intelligence and consciousness from the perspectives of physics (yes), design (double yes) and ethics (yasss queen!!!). Tegmark’s proposition is:Life 1.0 (e.g. bacteria and such) is essentially bio-automata, and only changes behavior and form via the process of evolution. Life 2.0 (e.g. mammals, particularly people) can learn and change behavior based on learning processes. In other words, we can program our own software. Life 3.0 (e.g. some type of silicon-based autonomous, artificial intelligence) will be able to design it’s own hardware (form) and software (content).According to Tegmark, we’re on the verge of birthing life 3.0French pomo theorist Paul Vililo posited that with every invention, we concurrently invent a disaster, e.g. the invention of the train also marked the invention of the train wreck. What potential catastrophe will be co-invented when we create legitimate ‘super-intelligent’ machines?Tegmark systematically examines some good candidates. I won’t spoil it. But suffice it to say, even if you’re adventurous and optimistic about advanced technology and artificial super intelligence (as am I), you can’t help but be concerned (as I am now) after reading these arguments.Life 3.0 is totally worth reading, despite the flawed editing, even if you’re unmoved by theses issues, or unaware of their implications.And by the way, the literal only way you could remain unmoved by these issues is if you’re unaware of their ethical implications. Sooooo. Get the book, jump in, and feel the inevitable fear and loathing that being on the greased bobsled run to technogeddon engenders."

This book has opened my eyes and allowed me to see the breadth and depth of this debate and how we should be preparing proactively for this revolutionary change taking place.
36,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"While talking about this book, physicist Stephen Hawking said ""This is the most important conversation of our time, and Tegmark's thought-provoking book will help you join it."" I would strongly urge everyone not to ignore this conversation, as this could very well be the most consequential topic we have today that involves the entire human kind. At least read this book and then decide for yourself if you agree.Most of us are concerned about Global Warming. We are concerned about the use of nuclear and biological weapons. We worry about genetic engineering. But discussions about future of Artificial Intelligence, and especially the eventual emergence of Super-intelligence are rare and generally get mixed up with science fiction scenarios and cheap movie plots. Yet, there is a finite probability that this can cause devastation to humanity in a time frame that is nearer than any other known risks, and far deeper than any other factor we can imagine. On the other hand, if used properly, AI can be the ultimate future of all living intelligence, and our only hope to persist in this universe in the long run.Personally, this topic is very close to me. I did my Ph.D. in Machine Learning, but I didn't academically pursue that path for too long, however I tried to stay in touch with the major advances in AI. During the last 10 years I took a deep interest in Consciousness research and the possibility of Super-Intelligence. In my life as an artist I created a series a couple of years ago which, incidentally, was named ""life 2.0"", and dealt with the same topic.There have been many books written on this subject, and major academic research is happening, but Tegmark's book is unique because instead of just raising alarms, it is trying to do something about it. It is an optimistic book that tries to show that we can hope be on the driver's seat and guide this towards something wonderful, but only if we all try to first understand the nature of the problem, and then try to find solutions that can guide us to evolve AI in a responsible way. Just wishing the harms away cannot work unless we know how to avoid it, and that is the focus of this remarkable book.His approach is that of a physicist -- rational, measured, cautious, and mostly unbiased. Unlike other books in this genre, he did not put his money on a particular scenario. Instead, he tried to explore all the proposed alternatives and evaluate them for their plausibility and consistency. Even when tackling explosive topics such as consciousness or free-will, he does an excellent job of laying down all the various alternative opinions, and then gradually analyze them in terms of fundamental physical laws.This is the first time I have seen someone is talking about this enormous issue not just as a threat, but rather as a solvable problem, and he approaches it as an activist -- full of passion and conviction. He has used his persuasive logic and passion to form a formidable scientific organization, and have also managed to create a substantial research fund, through funding from major sources.The only thing that I didn't appreciate are the fictional segments he often used to illustrate various scenarios. I have nothing against the use of fictional illustrations, as they can often allow one to reach a wider audience. However, his skills as a story teller is far weaker than his ability to reason.In conclusion, it is a remarkably well written book, and an extremely important one. I strongly believe every intelligent and responsible human being should join this conversation now, and this is perhaps the best stepping stool to get into this topic."
37,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77401565-anne-sophie-kleczewski,4,"The book is great and fascinating but way too complex and long (at least for me). It's a shame. Also, reading about ""what if AI take over the world"" isn't what I need during a pandemic, haha."
38,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44793822-tuti,5,"interesting, important & fun to read! highly recommended to everybody, because learning to think about what it will be like to be a biological-based intelligence in a world dominated by artificial (i.e.) non-biological based and higher intelligence. i found especially the chapter about goals very interesting, also philosophically - what are goals for life? what goals to define for AI? and will it be possible to keep a superior intelligence “obeying” goals given by humans? the author is rather optimistic about all this, underlining the opportunities and how AI can improve human life in almost every respect, from communications to finance to medicine etc. I am not (only) optimistic, after reading the chapter on goals i think it is rather improbable that a superior non-biological intelligence will have any interest at all to “serve” humanity, this is not how things go, is it? do read it, it does put things into perspective and makes you start thinking about these questions now, and the time has definitely come to think about them! "
39,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25564451-lisa-ebert,5,One of the best books I read this year.
40,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,4,"I skipped most of the first two hundred pages because it was unnecessarily technical, but the rest of the book is very informative in terms of both artifical intelligence, the scenarios that might occur in the future between humans and machines, the nature of consciousness, and the types of civilisations. Mind-boggling, but in a good way. "
41,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7531999-vagabond-of-letters-dlitt,2,"4/10Tegmark covers less ground than Bostrom in more space, in a more popular style and with a more narrative and very fourth-wall-breaking voice which I actually like. However, even though he constantly references Bostrom, he obviously does not understand him, and still thinks like a technocrat - the very problem at the heart of Bostrom's multifarious critique, the very problem Bostrom predicts will cause AI to be 'not so friendly' if ever achieved -- this self-same technocratic mindset which believes it can engineer away (with enough ghandwavium and unobtaintium) civilizations-old philosophical problems that we can't even formally express, whether regarding the question or the answer. For a condensed form of Bostrom, see the chapter he contributed to 'Global Catastrophic Risks' (Himself, ed.): it replicates the main lines of argument from 'Superintelligence' in 25% of the space. Tl;dr Life 3.0 has some interesting musings in the first 50 pages (on genes and memes, biological, cultural, and self environments: the eponymous 'Life 1.0, 2.0, 3.0' and the 'Omega Team' of hypothetical recursively improving strong AI developers who have somehow solved all the control problems mooted by Bostrom) before degenerating in to a pop-science schlock of self-congratulatory mimesis for the next 300pp, reaching its apotheosis in the last chapter: essentially a family photo album of the second international AI safety and friendliness conferences. A bit too self-promoting and -congratulatory.Tl;dr;dr: Tegmark begins the entire book with a quote from the 'Future of Life Institute' as if to establish the legitimacy and importance of his project by means of peer approbation. We later learn that for all intents and purposes Tegmark is the FoLI. So the book is dedicated by him, to him, through him. That starts to sound a bit like God."
42,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53505357-sarahbeth-chargois,2,"The structure/level of depth and understanding of this book makes it difficult for a non-tech/science person to absorb, and that was its intended audience. That said, there were some interesting scenarios, and Tegmark is obviously a bright guy and knows a lot about AI. Mostly, I blame whoever was his editor for not making this readable for the masses. "
43,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,5,"I have enjoyed reading Life 3.0 where Max Tegmark has described the full potential and drawbacks of Artificial Intelligence. Along with important ideas and views, I have drawn from this book a bunch of motivation to make my own research in AI field. Furthermore, author did not focus only on AI but also examined entire future of humanity with interesting numerical estimates and a summary of ideas in single tables. I agree almost for every topic that are discussed in the book."
44,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25532637-julia,5,"This is such a great book; this is exactly the type of book we need - we need to think about A.I. and all of it's implications, before (not after!) the reality of A.I. Technology is moving so fast, and I don't think we're prepared for it and all of it's far-reaching implications in our lives. What this book did was made me aware of how fast the techology is moving, what it's already done; it also made me ponder my place in its' future. Another good thing about this book was that it was written so that the average person can understand it....sometimes books like this seem written only for people who are professionals in that area. I liked that it was written so that the average person could understand it."
45,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14875421-anna,5,It was great to fresh up my knowledge of certain areas. Some ideas were redundant after reading Superintelligence by Bostrom.Grateful to read so many names of people I had the honor to meet in real life.
46,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1957201-katrisa,5,"Absolutely fascinating - and at times terrifying - but that's what makes this book great. It is neither overly optimistic about the future of AI nor overly apocalyptic, but presents both sides along with science to raise questions rather than feed you answers."
47,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"Very interesting tech read about the past, present, and future of AI. Tegmark addresses some thorny issues. Like would it be moral for us to ""kill"" a sentient AI by pulling the plug? And would keeping an AI too boxed-in, making it a smart slave, be any less immoral than keeping humans in bondage? With these questions in mind, he proceeds to lay out what researchers, companies and governments must to to ensure that AI's operate for the good of man. Sort of like Asimov's Laws of Robotics, but updated and made real. Since due to the rapid expansion of computing technology, The book's biggest weakness is that Tegmark assumes that Utilitarian ethics are the only game in town and that making an ethical decision is a matter of weighing costs versus benefits. So anything that increases the happiness of the majority is good, while anything that decreases net happiness is bad. This is a typical engineer's/ scientist's approach, and it is useful. But it does have errors. For instance, I had a philosophy professor drive Utilitarian ideals to an immoral extreme. He pointed out that German Christians outnumbered German Jews in the 1930's Employing cold-blooded Utilitarian calculus, one could support Hitler's Final solution since it would increase the happiness of the Christian populationIt was scary how something that seemed so reasonable at first could be so chilling. Sort of how some right-wing Christians seem down-right mean, claiming they're mean in Jesus's name. Jesus, who seems to be a left-leaning hippy-type to me, wandering homeless, befriending the powerless, and giving away fish and bread (not to mention wine and medical care) to the unwashed masses free of charge. So when Tegmark relied on Mill and Bentham's Utilitarian ideas to determine the right way to prepare for the probable arrival of AI, I rolled my eyes. There were other weaknessess too. While I loved many of the near-future speculations, there were times when Tegmark waxes sci-fi. After noting that there is NO way that we can know what the far-future of AI will look like, spends hundreds of pages telling us what it will look like. Intersteller travel, harnessing the energy of black holes, etc. All told, an necessary book flawed by an over-simplistic view of ethics and morality, and too much gee-whiz futurism. Four stars. "
48,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48922229-cheryl,4,"An interesting book about our life (past present and potential) as well as that of AI, a little complicated at times but stick with it as there are some really interesting ideas and facts, at times quite shocking in some aspects of the paths we may be taking blindly without thought. This book provides numerous points of view and consequences I hadn’t considered before, it really made me think. What do we want from AI and how do we get there? There are almost endless possibilities, this book covers such a wide expanse of theories, ideas, thoughts and lots of questions!It is an insightful book, full of intelligent arguments , however not with all the answers, the author is asking you to think for yourself. In a way we should all read this or at least all be asked these fundamental questions as they will undoubtedly affect us all eventually and we should be part of that conversation.I feel I should give an advance warning for anyone thinking of reading this as it does go off path a bit, we covered a lot about the universe, black holes and power sources of the future (among other subjects) which to me is, not technically just AI. I think to really get the best from this book you do need to have some knowledge already of mathematics, physics/astrophysics, not to a really high level but if you don’t have any at all then some of this book will be lost on you, it is quite complicated and in depth, and brings together work from the fields of Philosophy, Psychology, computer science, neuroscience, mathematics and astrophysics and therefore not necessarily for beginners. Overall I think this is a great book, a little lecturey at times and although he provides many different points of view he does lead you back to to his way of thinking, I felt he was trying to convince us he is right and you know what he makes a compelling argument for the most part. I am giving this book 4.5*/5, rounded down."
49,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3168778-marc,4,"“Read” as an audiobook and am not convinced that that is the best format for this book. There are structures to the organization of the book that would make more sense in print and occasional references to graphics. Having said that, Tegmark’s goal with the book is to get folks thinking optimistically but with warranted caution about the future of artificial intelligence. In this, the book is entirely successful. I found myself regularly surprised by the result of a simple path of logic that had me thinking more carefully about consequences of certain developments in AI. He does not view AI as a bad thing, but cautions that we need to be very clear about what kind of a world we want to live in as we continue down the path of AI research. "
50,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866236-patrik-hallberg,5,"One of the most interesting books that I've read in a very long time. The first chapters really drew me in. I talked about nothing else with my friends and family. At my son's graduation, I talked about it. It has had a profound impact on me and will be with me forever. Some of the later chapters are not as spellbinding, but overall this is still a solid 5 stars. Next book I will read on this subject is Nick Bostrom - Superintelligence. For current news on AI, the foundation that Max is part of is a great place to start https://futureoflife.org/. He is one of the five founders. This should be mandatory reading for everybody in school or at least the first chapters."
51,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68373123-martin-matak,4,"A book discusses not only near-, and long-term implications of AI, but also questions that are relevant to it. How to make AI beneficial for humans? What is consciousness? What career advice to give to the next generation? How is our universe related to the AI? I think most of the book is based on our current understanding of AI, and I enjoyed the questions raised in chapter 3, the short-term (~10 years) implication of AI. As an AI researcher, I am mostly aware of these, but some of them slip my mind sometimes.Yet, I rate the book 4/5 because of the following:  1) I felt like some parts of the book are pure speculations 2) The writing style is such that sometimes the same concept is explained more than onceTo conclude, the book is an interesting read if you are into science, technology, engineering, math, or philosophy."
52,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"A balanced book on an important subject with a plethora of good information, innovative categorisations to explain the issues at hand and many rational discussions even if without strong conclusions. Certainly, a must-read for anyone thinking about what potentially lies ahead.The author experiments boldly, particularly with the fictitious scenario of an all-dominating AI, to describe the issues at hand. The explanation helps set up the rest of the discussion, unlike in many other books, where AI scare-mongering is often without sufficient context. With the help of the main examples, the author is able to discuss the nuances of possible future courses in detail and without burdening the reader with technical jargons.Just like the AI example, the Life 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 categorisation appears tacky at the start. Yet, once again, the concoction helps in shaping some excellent discussions on various evolutions and what the arrow of life is possibly pointing to now with the AI. These sections are dotted with amazing facts (for example, our DNA stores 1.6GB worth of data roughly while the brain capacity is around 100TB - to highlight the difference between life 1.0 and life 2.0 or the biomass of bacteria is about 400bn tonnes, same as plants with humans at 0.4bn while the material rearrangement by humans is approaching the same scale as planetary biomass) and concepts (e.g. substrate independence or efficiency gains possible in energy, memory or processing with AI compared to the tiny point at which we are currently).The book is one of the rare balanced ones on the topic, which will also prove useful to most who want to understand all sides. The author is not only honest in his admission about why so much is unknowable but thorough in explaining different sides, their main points, inherent assumptions, where they could be right/wrong and contrasting against others. The equivocation in conclusions is rather refreshing as a result.The end sections on his own research foundation and some of its high profile sponsors are certainly jarring. However, it should not take away much from the excellent discussion that is almost whole of the book."
53,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12232212-rajesh-kandaswamy,4,"This is a useful book to think about the long-term implications of AI on humankind. One of the author's key point is that AI will threaten our way of life not because they evil, but because they will be significantly more competent. The author cautions against misguided flights of fancy in thinking about AI, but many of his examples seem to take be extrapolated from narrow ideas as well. But, overall a good book to read. "

55,0451485076,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4837365-jonathan-maas,5,"The best future history roadmap since Homo Deus: A Brief History of TomorrowI normally compare every future history, or big picture non-fiction book like this to Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and his equally good follow up Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow.I consider Harari the best of the best, equivalent to Lebron James, Citizen Kane, Isaac Newton and the like. His books are beyond compare, aside from Cosmos, which acts as the Michael Jordan to Harari's Lebron James. Both are the best of the best.So I don't look to expect books to be better than Harari's, I just see how close they get to his pinnacle of clarity, importance and ideas.Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence by Max Tegmark is not Homo Deus, but it is in the ballpark.It's James Harden to Harari's Lebron James. You'd rather have Lebron James, but whoo - James Harden can be good at times.Analogies over - how is Life 3.0?Tegmark, like most future historians, knows his and humanity's limits. In short:* He knows what we know - our processing speed is getting faster, and has a lot of room to grow* He is aware of what we don't know - What will happen with AI? Will it be good? Will it be bad? Will it be something in between? Will AI develop sentience?* He is good at laying out the options for all that we don't know - He splits the options into camps, and gives all sides a say. AI will be great! AI will be bad! True AI won't happen! And most importantly -* He holds the humility that there is always the option that something else will happen - He likes to base the future on a probability of options, and saves 50% for an idea that it will be something we haven't thought of yetWhat are some of his theses?He doesn't have too many theses - Tegmark likes to present all theses and give them equal voice. He'll talk about today - Today’s artificial intelligence tends to be narrow, with each system able to accomplish only very specific goals, while human intelligence is remarkably broad.But the future? He talks about possibilities - robojudges that could be extraordinarily fair, or perhaps might be flawed. A world with better jobs due to technology, or a world with no jobs, which will cause problems. Or a world with no jobs where such things are unnecessary, and allows humanity to pursue their own goals - which is good. His meta-thesis can best be summarized here -The short answer is obviously that we have no idea what will happen if humanity succeeds in building human-level AGI. For this reason, we’ve spent this chapter exploring a broad spectrum of scenarios.He shows the broad spectrum - and occasionally gives his opinion. But he's more likely to show as many viewpoints as he can, and then mention that something else could happen as well.One of my favorite quotes he pulls is from a techno-skeptic - I think of this as the techno-skeptic position, eloquently articulated by Andrew Ng: “Fearing a rise of killer robots is like worrying about overpopulation on Mars.”Techno-optimists, don't worry - he shows your point as well.And oh wow does he map out the futureJust as James Harden can be better than Lebron James at points, Tegmark finds a way to show more than Harari, particularly when it comes to the future.Harari excels at giving insight and clarity, Tegmark excels at presenting multiple options.* How could Space Travel work? (many options)* How could we travel the galaxy and colonize? (he provides many options)* How can we get more energy? (from Dyson Spheres to turning matter into energy, he shows it all)And one more thing - he gives summary at the end of the chapter Tegmark ends each chapter with a Bottom Line section, where he summarizes everything into little paragraphs.So you can read one chapter intensely, and then skim the next and get to the bottom line.In conclusion - want something big picture? Read thisIt's worth it, and is the latest non-fiction chart topper for a reason. Great book - I'd advise reading a chapter at least - you might end up reading the whole thing, and expanding your world view because of it!"
