0,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128722-rachel,1,"My biggest problem with the book is that it is extremely sexist. The book continually explains that this is just how men are, and then goes on to explain how women can learn to deal with that. Biggest load of crap ever. While some people will certainly fall into these stereotypes, I believe this book may cause more harm than good. Some of the sexist highlights:-a woman should go shopping when her man decides that he needs alone time (this is how she can show him her love and trust) {apparently women were able to spend more time shopping when they lived on Venus, because the planet was “covered in shopping malls.”)-a man can leave anytime he wants – in fact, he cannot even control when it is that he may need to leave-a woman is unfairly punishing a man if he leaves even when she really needs him and she then acts upset or hurt in the slightest upon his return Gray thinks that only women are needy, and that only men need to be alone. Not so. Apparently, Gray thinks that women only ever want to be with their men, and nothing more. Well, that is simply not true for most independent, capable, and informed women. But that is beside the point. Let’s assume that it is true. What bothers me even more is that Gray identifies the different needs of men and women (men need space; women need someone to listen to them/emotional attachment), but he then goes on to explain that when both men and women are experiencing their needs at the same time, the woman simply must concede to the man’s needs. Gray explains that *whenever* men need to be alone, that is just the way it is. There are no compromises. In his book, a woman, Cathy, asks the question: “If he gets to be in his cave then what about me? I give him space, but what do I get?” And here is the answer: “What Cathy gets is the best her partner can give at the time. By not demanding that he listen to her when she wants to talk, she can avoid making the problem much worse by having a huge argument. Second, she gets his support when he comes back – when he is truly capable of supporting here.” That is simply ridiculous. What a woman gets is *whatever* her partner can give at the time. A woman just must let the man have what it is he needs, regardless of her needs at the time. I’m sorry, but being in a relationship requires selflessness, and that means that both men and women have to give more than what our selfish natures think we can handle. While I’ll admit that some of Gray’s advice is helpful (insofar as the individuals in a given relationship fall into Gray’s stereotypes), they simply are just not that profound. Essentially, “if you listen to women and try not to take them for granted, your relationship will be better.” Well, no kidding. The book just seemed full of perplexing thoughts. For example: “Men rarely say ‘I’m sorry’ because on Mars it means you have done something wrong and you are apologizing.” Well, even on earth, I was under the impression that when you are apologizing, you say sorry. I don’t know why the definition of sorry would somehow explain why men would be less able than women to say it. In the chapter about how to score points with the opposite sex, there is a list of 101 things a man can do such as bringing her flowers, listening to her, complimenting her, calling her, etc. Most of them are good, even if obvious suggestions; nonetheless, Gray’s view of women as subordinate still creeps in. My favorite thing a man can do to score points with a woman is #67: “read out loud or cut out sections of the newspaper that would interest her.” Good idea. Because I can’t read, and even if I could, women don’t read newspapers. Come on! Even more upsetting is that the corresponding list of 26 things that a woman can do to “score big with men” involves NOT doing things. For example, he makes mistakes, and she doesn’t say anything; “he disappoints her, and she does not punish him.” There are only a few things that a woman can affirmatively do to score points, one of which is “she really enjoys having sex with him.” Again, women are largely the passive actors. I’ve wasted far too much energy and time already on this book. It is now dead to me. "
1,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1178739-mephistia,1,"There are some books that you hear about and you hear about and you hear about, and eventually you think, ""Hmmm, maybe I ought to read that. It's had a huge cultural impact on our society, it might be a good idea to be in on that.""Kind of like seeing Stars Wars, E.T. and the Godfather Trilogy (I still haven't seen E.T. or the Godfather Trilogy, but I hear they're both great). It's just a big cultural thing, you know?With books, there are a few that everyone needs to know. There are the obvious ones -- classics written by the likes of Dickens, Austen, and Hawthorne. There are those timeless works that were never meant to be popularly read, but rather popularly seen (Shakespeare, Euripides, Sophocles, Malowe), yet have somehow become English High School standard fare. And then there are the books that ripple through our space and time. Oprah said this, or my friend said that, or a church is protesting against this. The books that capture the public attention for longer than the space of a breath and manage to hold it. Sometimes these books have actually earned that attention. In most cases, not so much.This book? It really didn't. It said nothing that we haven't heard before. It actually reinforced a lot of offensive stereotypes. As a woman, one I personally took offense to was in the introduction. John Gray's telling the story of how, after his wife (Bonnie) had torn while giving birth to their first child, she'd been put on pain killers. After he took 5 days off from work to help her with taking care of the newborn, he returned to work. That day she apparently ran out of sick pills and asked his visiting brother to pick up a refill. For some reason, the brother didn't return with the pills. When the author/husband returned that evening, his in-pain wife starts crying to him about her day, he takes offense and they get in a fight.All perfectly reasonable and normal. Newborn baby, stressful times, blah, blah, blah. The reason this is important is because this is the authors so-called ""Ah-ha!"" moment. He apparently, at this point, turns to storm out, and his wife says, ""John Gray, stop! You're a fair weather friend! You love me when I'm smiley and happy, but you don't like me when I'm frowny and down!""Or something to that effect. I've made it even cheesier than it was in the book, but let me assure you: it was pretty cheesy in the book. I am willing to bet it was not that cheesy in real life.Anyway, long story short, the author says that he realized his wife was right, all she needed was a hug, he'd been a taker and not a giver, blah blah blah. Then he said what pissed me off and made me throw the book across the room with a growl (don't worry, it was an old, beat-up copy that I obtained second-hand from a free bin). And I quote, ""Another woman would have instinctively known what Bonnie needed. But as a man, I didn't know that touching, holding, and listening were so important to her.""I hate those kind of blanket statements, and I have to admit I'm prone to dismissing any advice that comes from someone who makes those types of statements. Do you know what I, a born and raised female, do when someone cries? I pat them awkwardly on the shoulder and ask if there's someone I can call.People come in all flavors, and a blanket, generic statement isn't going to capture them. Neither is a condescending attitude of, ""Remember back when you lived on Venus and I lived on Mars? Remember what that was like? Now we live on mean old Earth that has made us forget all those Venusian and Marsian traits!""My gosh, it's like a Scientology manual gone mad. I wonder if it is."
2,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/281525-benjamin-crawford,1,"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, and John Gray is from far, far further out in the solar system...My broad-stroke perspective on this book is that I am inherently skeptical when someone purports to reduce human behavior to simplistic, read-about-it-on-the-subway categories, gender-specific behavior in particular. Resorting to simple explanations for that which is scary -- and I think it's safe to say that romantic partnerships can be scary, because vulnerability is involved, after all -- is tempting, but doesn't necessarily make you a better partner, or person. In fact, it can achieve the opposite.As for Mr. Gray, my take is that he is one of many who has found that he can profit from the human inclination toward over-simplifying the dynamic, hence his series of tripe-laden tomes."

Men and women are actually from different planets! We're alien species! Sure we can have babies together, but we are totally different. Women like to shop because they come from a planet full of shopping centers.Men like to fix things and play sports because that's all they did on their planet.Now if we would just remember that we are two different alien species, we can get along! Women must accept that men need to hide in their caves. Men need to accept that women need to talk about everything and don't actually want solutions. Women must accept that men will not ask for directions and not make them feel less manly. Men need to accept that women want to buy a lot of shoes.I hate these sort of books. Does it occure to people to actually TALK to their mate? To get to know them as an individual and not a series of stereotypes? Notice that most of these sort of books state that men are the way they are and you just have to deal with it. Men can't change, women! Their penises and testosterone prevent that! It's ridiculous! People are all DIFFERENT!Some women don't like buying shoes that bend their feet in weird ways! Some men *Gasp* hate sports!Also, I think this writer was divorced several times and doesn't have a real PhD, so why LISTEN TO HIM?!Also, as an introvert I NEED A CAVE! I need somewhere where I can relax, recharge and have peace and quiet after dealing with... SOCIETY.Why do just men get to have caves?"
6,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1817719-eddie-black,1,"This is not psychology. This is not even close to be science. I had to read this horrible book in the past (my partner liked it) and I kept thinking to myself that a lot of the stuff in the book was just too convenient, too stereotypical, to easy. Doing a little research found that the school that gave th author his Ph.D. was done away with and that several states (California, Oregon...) will not recognize the titles that the ""school"" gave out. I don't like bashing people on ideas, but I hate to see people write as though they are scientists or psychologists when they are not. It does harm to the fiel of psychology and breeds distrust for the field among the general public. This book does more harm than good. There are ample books out there based on mountains of research about the real and not real differences (and amazing similarities) between men and women, as well as those who are in different gender categories than the binary system perpetuated by poorly written material such as this.Terrible book and dishonest in its approach to try to come across as psychology. If I could give negative stars I would."

Then, talking wouldn't make sense would it?Like men hate being told how to fix the fuacet, or how to find the way...This book has OUT-Dated views. I regreted reading it!"

10,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/734055-katie,1,"This book was insulting and biased. Written from an unapologetically male perspective, it attempts to lump men and women into desired roles. The man can leave anytime he wants, and the woman, to show her love and trust (read: naivety), should go shopping. Yes, that's what his argument boils down to. I am all for acceptance, but when there are real issues that need to be dealt with, they are not fixed by saying, ""Oh, that's just what men do."" The ""wave"" section was particularly enraging as an attempt to explain away arguments and legitimate emotions through that-time-of-the-month moodiness. And the gender bias leaves no room for the non-traditional, i.e. homosexual, relationship. All a man needs is a woman, and all a woman needs is a man, right? I have news for you, John Gray: EVERYONE needs alone time, and EVERYONE should feel comfortable talking with their parter, and EVERYONE gets moody...including my father, my brother, and my man."
11,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,4,"I picked up this book on a whim because years ago the title had caught my attention. Well, it wasn’t a terrible book as I had expected. There were certain things I didn’t agree with, but overall, it's an excellent starting point for understanding the opposite sex.By distinguishing men and women, the author attempts to explain certain ways and behavior inherent to the two sexes. By understanding them and learning how to deal with them, men and women can strike a balance and have a healthy relationship.Not all men and women have 100% masculine or feminine qualities, so it would be wrong to put them in a box and assume certain things about them. So, it’s better to have honest and open communication instead of guessing at the patterns of their behavior.However, I could relate to a lot of situations mentioned in the book and it’s crazy, but I kind of became comfortable with my feminine side, especially the emotion part. I get high and low on emotions and I beat myself up for being irrational sometimes, but I guess it’s not a bad thing.Overall, it’s a good book but gets boring towards the ends because of unnecessary and repetitive content. "
12,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1239652-jennifer,2,"I decided to read this book because I'm a Dave Ramsey fan and it was one of the books on his recommended reading. I've been married for 10 years, but I figured it couldn't hurt to learn to communicate a little better. I'm not sure this book helped any. It's written with the assumption that all men are alike and all women are alike and that most of them have a ""traditional"" marriage or relationship. There is something sexist in the author's tone. He paints the women as the homemakers with a love of shopping and nurturing. He paints the men as the breadwinners who want to come home from work and watch sports on TV until you bring them their dinner.The only insight I gained from the book was the different ways that men and women react to and deal with stress. The book was boring, very repetitive and seemed to drag on and on for much longer than needed to convey it's message."
13,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2055646-g-l-morrison,1,"This book is such crap -it includes justifications for date rape and recommends that the woman just ""let her husband do it"" even when she's not into it. His argument being how long is a quickie anyway. Put out to get along is this marriage counselor's advice. Without the slightest concern to the impact this may have on her libido, boundaries, or esteem for the man who doesn't care if she's into it as long as he gets some.FUCK are you serious? The layers of hostility that John Gray has to women are out-fucking-rageous and the not so thinly veiled criticism of his own past relationships and ""marriages"" that he thinks might have been salvaged if the bitches er venusians had been more sexually generous.This is right up there in the list of crap sex/relationship books whom I condemn the authors to be beaten to death with every copy they ever sold. As bad as ""everything you wanted to know about sex but were afraid to ask"" author (rubens?) who said ""one vagina plus one vagina equals nothing"". Clearly both these men need to rent a porn video and buy a clue. Women do enjoy sex. Just probably not with you, dude. Go figure."
14,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2725982-esmoi,1,"Utterly unhelpful for those of us who do not fit the stereotypical personalities associated with our genders. I'm a Myers-Briggs INTJ. I like to retreat to my cave. Maybe, according to Gray's beliefs, this means I must also have a deeply hidden penis? Don't get me wrong. I'm not some old-school feminist believer in the blank slate brain. This book is just arrogant and sloppy in its long-shot generalizations. In summary: Grok like boink woman, watch football, make fire. No talky-feewings. Grokina like talk friends on phone, put on face paints then cry off face paints, withhold sex from Grok. Neither of Gray's alien races enjoy receiving unsolicited advice, but the author doesn't seem to recognize this as a shared trait. A man's irritation with his wife's advice is framed as the natural result of excessive feminine nagging. (Grok no listen to dumb-dumb woman who hurt manly pride with suggestions!) Unsolicited advice from a man, on the other hand, is referred to as an old Martian honor that feelings-oriented Venusians fail to appreciate. Y'know. 'cause men like to FIX things and women like to whine, remember?If there really are any people who fit Gray's ""Martian"" and ""Venusian"" profiles, I sincerely hope those individuals are pursuing each other. Neither of these sexist caricatures would make a decent mate for a real, three-dimensional human being. "
15,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37094857-nissy,1,am i the only one who found this book extremely sexist ?! why would a woman find this book helpful ?!
16,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,1,"Wow, this one was rough. I had to borrow the audiobook version from my library/Hoopla because that was the only format available, and it is the abridged audio edition. I normally avoid abridged editions. What’s the point in missing out on a bunch of the book? In the case of Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus, however, I think I’ll make an exception. This is just a terrible, even actively harmful book, and judging from the Banging Book Club video where they talk about things that weren’t present in the abridgement, I’m very, very lucky.Yes, this is the October pick for the Banging Book Club, a monthly club that reads books about sex, sexuality, and gender. This month’s pick is a doozy. Apparently this was an influential book in the 1990s and started the eponymous saying, so I get the reasons for wanting to read it. But it is just so bad.As you can guess from the title, John Gray thinks men and women are very different creatures. But it gets worse. He frames the book in an extended metaphor, setting for us a scenario in which men came from Mars, women from Venus, and started living together here on Earth until they forgot their origins. It’s tortured and overwrought and would be the first thing on the cutting room floor if a half-decent editor had their way.It probably goes without saying, but this book is incredibly cis/heteronormative. Not once does Gray entertain the idea that you're in a relationship with anyone who is of the same sex as you; not once does he entertain the notion that there might be more to the performance of gender than “man” and “woman”. So though there is advice in here that makes sense (I mean, “listen to your partner” is always good advice), it is so wrapped up in harmful assumptions that it becomes useless.The idea that men and women are somehow fundamentally different, especially when it comes to something like romance, is hard for us to shake. Even feminists often have trouble with this notion, especially at first. And observationally, yeah, men and women often do act differently or in stereotypical ways—but it is very difficult to pinpoint whether those observed differences are biological or cultural in origin. Very often, sex-linked or gender-linked differences turn out to have both biological and cultural elements to them (e.g., hormonal and social cues influencing when we feel ready to pursue a new romantic relationship). Like most science, this type of science is hard. So I don’t need Not-a-Real-Doctor Dr. John Gray to tell me it’s so simple he can teach me in an hour and a half. (Wikipedia tells me he isn’t a real doctor, making Gray about as reliable as Wikipedia.)So Gray pretty much ignores anyone in the LGBTQIA+ constellation of gender and sexual identity. And this, in a book written in the early nineties! It sounds to me like something rooted more in the 1960s or 1970s—I was picturing the Jetsons for all his examples. His assumption that a romantic relationship is monogamous and heterosexual and that both parties are cisgender erases anyone who is different. Plus, it’s boring.Beyond this, so much of Gray’s advice is just so facile. It’s either so simple as to be obvious—communicate better—or it’s stereotypical and peculiarly specific. In addition to the Martian/Venusian metaphor, Gray decides to talk about women being like waves and men being like rubber bands. Sure, I guess? Can I be like a disco ball with a bow-tie? Do we get to pick our similes, or are they all assigned at birth?Look, if you read this book and it helped me, I’m not saying that’s not real. But I think it’s important that we differentiate between pop psychology and actual science, and that when we make decisions, we base them on the latter. And we need to call out bullshit when we see it, particularly when it makes restrictive assumptions about the type of people living our society. Men aren’t from Mars and women aren’t from Venus, and attempting to reinforce the gender binary and gender norms does no one any favours.

Love: User's Manual
Do you remember the bunch of books Bridget Jones used to carry about in order to make sense of her weird and chaotic life? One of them was just this one, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, and because of its longish and kinda stupidish, funnyish title, I assumed, when I saw the movie, it was merely an amusing invention to go with the giddy thirtish female character (as you see I’ve just discovered magic of the “-ish” suffix in the economy of the text). So imagine my surprise when I found the book was real (hey, in my defense what I recall happened some eight years ago!) and very famous (according to Wikipedia it sold millions of copies). Meanwhile I’ve heard and read a lot of allusions at this book but although I bought it by mild curiosity from an antique book store several years ago, I’ve let it collect dust on my to-read shelf, for it was always another book more inciting to choose. Until now, that is.I have to confess that, since I am not a great believer in such magic recipes, I’ve never come round reading this kind of relationship guides until now – they seem to me a little fraudulent in their pretense that they can solve major problems of the human soul and/ or behaviour by providing some general advice similar to those that help you understand how to make work a certain device. Consequently, my motivation for reading has been right from the beginning mere curiosity and a suspicion that, with such a title, I would have fun. Which indeed I’ve had, but when all was laughed and done, I found it, unexpectedly, quite sad. What a difference between this book, with its pitiful pretense of psychological study and great books on the same subject (although not “practical guides”) like Denis de Rougemont’s Love in the Western World for example. And if you think I am unjust by comparing grapes and tomatoes so to say (for everybody takes care not to compare apples and oranges) I will tell you that this is the very core of the problem: for such a book to gain an almost religious halo, it needs readers without much psychological depth, who think of themselves only as machines waiting to be fixed, should the right tool be found.My daughter has been playing for many years now a computer game called Sims. If you are not familiar with it, I can tell you it is about a virtual family you grow up, build a home for, send to work and so on. Some time ago she told me, amused, that once she forgot to send one of them to pee and although he had become increasingly uncomfortable he couldn’t go to the bathroom by himself, he had to wait (and grimace, and dance, and lose self-esteem points) until she saw him and directed him to the toilet. Doesn’t it seem to you lately that we live in a Sims society, waiting to be told when, how and what to do? Helpless when let alone, unable to understand the others, unable to understand ourselves anymore without a self-help at hand. In aching need of statements like “A man sense of self is defined through his ability to achieve results” or “A woman’s sense of self is defined through her feelings and the quality of her relationships” which we don’t bother even to verify, so they seem the answer to all the problems.And the sadness of all this it is that nobody thinks it demeaning to find oneself reduced to a mere stereotype: man is action, woman is feeling, man is silence, woman is talk, man is a rubber band, woman is a wave, etc., etc., etc., on the contrary feeling strangely comforted to be offered universal solutions like Love Letter techniques (oh, yes!), scoring boards, emotional tables and even a “Venusian/ Martian phrase dictionary” which teaches you how to speak your man/ woman language:“We never go out” translated into Martian means “I feel like going out and doing something together. We always have such a fun time, and I love being with you. What do you think? Would you take me out to dinner? It has been a few days since we went out.”I won’t bother to talk about the platitude of the above-quoted “translation”, but I cannot help expressing my dismay that millions (millions!) found it useful in improving their relationships, as though otherwise they could not understand a hyperbola or a hint or whatever. Besides, the book is full of such pearls of wisdom, many beautifully framed to easier be found in the rush of a matrimonial crisis:When our partner resists us it is probably because we have made a mistake in our timing or approach.Or:Not to be needed is a slow death for a man.Or:Never go into a man cave or you will be burned by the dragon!Nor will I talk about the kind of ridiculously mixed metaphors the book is full of (I’ve just given you an example); I will only jump to the final chapter with its involuntary humour, chapter that pretends that this is the one and only way to keep alive the magic of love. What magic? Love is not, to use a Stendhalian appellation, passion or vanity, it is not mannered or physical. Not anymore. Love is a tank of gas which any Venusian expects to be filled by her Martian. Correctly, I mean. Whence the utility of this book. To whom it may concern."

Must get a Vietnamese-translated version for my parents as well.Takeaways:- Men want appreciation, admiration, trust and acceptance.- When your man turns away, just do something you like (reading, exercising, etc.) and let him be alone.- Don't ask rhetoric questions. Try to be more supportive, eg. ""I do not like your coming home late without calling me. Next time when you hang out with your colleagues, call me in advance"".- Set clear personal boundaries.- When you are resentful, ask your man to support.- Stop always saying yes to his requests. Instead, gracefully ask what you want to do.- Do not give your man advice or support unless he asks you.- Sometimes there is a difficult situation, it is better to write a letter to him. (This is not common in Vietnamese culture but you can try).- Do not ask your man to support when he is obviously planning to do it.- Ask a man directly for his support 'Would you/ Would you please ...?'. Do not present a list of reasons why he should support you. Do not question his ability to help.- If you want him to give more, show him your appreciation.- Men are more willing to say yes if they have a freedom to say no. When your man rejects helping you, just say 'OK. No problem'. Next time he will be more willing to help you.- Grumbling is his way to start saying yes. When he grumbles, just keep silence.- Never argue. Instead, discuss pros and cons of things."

B ut I was not all that impressed.When I was younger, I read this types of books way more then I do now. I did a reread of this one not that long ago and did not like it near as much.Some things maybe true in here..I liked the rubber band analogy..but some things were sexist seeming and seemed to put all the responsibility for everything on the woman. I have noticed that with these types of books.Don't get me wrong. This book is nowhere as bad as ""The Rules"". (I read that as a joke). But I did not agree with much of it and thought that many assumptions were made.I appreciated the use of real human examples but the book seems to generalize alot and all these do's and don'ts and letting the guy feel like the pursuer..it bothers me.I feel that is buying into stereotype in many ways and also making the female be something that she may not actually be. Isn't being an imposter or lying or down playing who you are worse then letting your best self shine through? And is the woman really going to want to be with a guy who will not let her ever take the lead? I feel as if once again the female is pushed into this space of being somewhere between a pretty sweet young thing and a Stepford wife.I do not think that is the author's intention. He comes across as sincere. But I feel he makes to many allowances for the male. I do not get why the female has to let herself be ""conquered"". I have also found that most of these types of relationships..where each party is playing a role..do not last anyway. I feel a strong and confident male would not NEED to always have to take the lead. I do not feel in this age and time, where women have come so far, that there really needs to be a playing into a fantasy of what men want versus who we actually are. I am aware this book is older and sure, some things have changed but books like this bother me greatly.OK..I will stop rambling now. I still give it a two because it keeps you involved. But I disagree with much of it."

Anyway in a nutshell he told us that women thought about the world in a subjective manner and men thouhgt about the world in an objective manner. He said if you ask a man what he's thinking and he says, ""nothing"" he really is thinking about nothing, which is incomprehensible to women who are thinking about everything. At 20 years old this was mind-blowing stuff. Then along came John Gray and in a comic book sort of way said basically the same thing. It was cute, but the priest had already told me all this stuff. If you can find a thrift store copy it's an entertaining refresher course about how to communicate with those of the opposite gender."

I think a lot of the other reviewers would probably have enjoyed it more if they hadn't felt ""I can't believe the author thinks all women/men are like X, I'm not like that at all!"" There's no reason to feel that way (sorry if you're a woman, btw, since men aren't supposed to say why you shouldn't feel a certain way), because the author mentions several times that the things he say about one sex can just as easily apply to the other sex, or that it might not apply to you at all, regardless of your gender. For example, unlike the Martians of this book I'm able to understand that ""Could you take out the trash?"" is a request to take out the trash instead of a literal question about my ability to do so, but I didn't need to feel offended since that part didn't apply to me, it wasn't about *me*. If shopping isn't something you want to do to give your boyfriend/girlfriend some alone time, don't get upset, because it's not about *shopping*, it's about doing something by yourself and trusting your significant other. It's obviously written from a perspective of traditional relationships with stereotypical men and women in them to more easily make the points he wants, and that's fine. Anyway, the book is very easy, light reading, and it has some good things to say. It's more than 20 years old by now though, so you're probably better off getting a more recent book which would have refined the advice given here."

My mother in law gave me this book years ago, when I'd been married about five or six years. I wasn't totally surprised - she's old fashioned Irish, woman's place is in the home etc. And I admit that having been raised by atheist hippies to believe that as a woman of my generation I never had to do anything I didn't want to, there was probably a culture clash there to start with. However, I've never read such utter and total BS. This book made me so mad that I literally couldn't read more than a couple of chapters. The general overtone of this book, as it came across to me, was do whatever you can to ensure you man is happy, no matter what. Apparently, we women should subjugate our every thought and desire in an effort to better understand how our feelings may upset or hurt our fragile male partners. But let's not forget that we, apparently, also want a man who can protect us and be a good provider. And since we patently can't survive on our own, and would die without a big strong man, we need to view our every action in terms of making sure our man feels loved and appreciated. The implicit lesson of 'do whatever makes your man happy, and enjoy it while you do it or you may detract from his happiness' made me want to burn this book - and I think book burning is abhorrent. This book was unabashed trash, and no thinking, independent, intelligent woman should take one shred of its preaching with anything less than a veritable gallon of salt. "

42,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43429701-dan-lawton,3,"Six months ago my wife sat me down with tears in her eyes and told me she wasn't sure she was in love with me anymore. We've been together since we were 16. It was devastating. I spent the next couple of days moping around and feeling sorry for myself, and I took some time to reflect. I thought I found out what the issue was. We had fallen into a trap of feeling so comfortable with one another that I stopped doing the little things to show her I care. I'd help around the house and pay the bills and all that, but I let the romance fall off a cliff. While your spouse telling you she may not love you anymore is just about the worst thing someone can say to you, it woke me up. In a matter of weeks we rekindled our passion and love and got back to feeling good again. She was diagnosed with depression and given medication and it helped. Everything was fine for 6 months, better than ever, even. We both agreed it may have been the best thing that's ever happened to us - it helped me understand what she'd been trying to tell me for so long that I so stupidly didn't take seriously enough. It was as if we'd dodged a bullet.Then it happened again. And it was worse. She was angry, empty, ""done"" with the relationship. So you know what I did? I blamed the depression. The next two weeks were hell - arguments that we never had in 11 years together, accusations and harsh words, serious talk of divorce and how custody would work with our daughter. Unquestionably the worst two weeks of my life. We slept separately. Tension was high. I thought my marriage was over, and I was in shock. I love the woman to death, no exaggeration.I went looking for help elsewhere, looking for a book that might offer me some insight on what I'VE been doing wrong (not her) and thought John Gray's bestseller was worth a shot. Did it work? Too early to say. While I found much of the information to be repetitive and too generalized, there were a few key sections that I found particularly helpful. These are a few things I learned:1) Me going to work, providing, paying bills, cleaning the house, mowing the lawn, etc. and expecting that to be enough was wrong. I thought that by doing these things I was showing her I loved her, but that's not what she wants, that's not what women want. While we've always talked, I was a poor listener. I would be distracted by my phone or by a ball game or by whatever else it was I was doing. She, in turn, probably resented me for it. I would offer suggestions on how to make ""problems"" better instead of just listening and offering sympathy. I've made a concentrated effort to really try to listen and not give suggestions since I started reading this book, and it seems to have helped. While she still doesn't feel the love (her own), I can tell she's softening.2) I spent YEARS being selfish. I wrote books, watched every game always, ignored my beautiful wife's needs and wants. I would resent her for not giving back when I did try to show her appreciation, and I became closed off and distant when that happened. In turn, she likely pulled further away from me too, so we were left spinning our wheels. 3) It's going to take time for her to trust that I'm a different guy. It's a daily struggle when she won't tell me she loves me or give me affection or ask how my day was, but I'm learning to deal with it. She suffered for so long from my [unintentional] cold and distant behavior, and it's going to take some time for her to heal. I realize much of this commentary has little to do with the book, yet it really does. While I've learned so much of this content from other sources and through some of the mistakes I've made as a husband, for those people who haven't read stuff about relationships, please read this. Not all of it is relevant to my life - and surely won't be to yours, either - but the concepts are important. Husbands: Please, for the love of God, don't ignore your wives. Make her #1 all the time, and if you're anything like me, you'll get more satisfaction out of having her happy than doing things to make yourself happy. Make her happy and your own happiness will come. I'm a firm believer of that now. Be romantic - not just on special occasions. Don't wait for her to tell you what she needs (that's what I did, and it led to resentment because she was expecting me to just know) and be proactive. Surprise her. Remember what it was like when you first fell in love? Do that again. Do it often. Kiss her. Give to her and don't expect her to give back. Bite your tongue when you disagree over insignificant things. Be a man. Don't be like me. Hopefully you're reading this before it's too late, because I fear I'm already there. While I'm back sleeping in the bed with my wife (it's so great, by the way, after having slept alone for two weeks) I would do anything for her to give me a hug or a kiss or to tell me she loves me. I'd do anything for her to smile at me or tell me she misses me. I'd do anything for her to love me again. [Christ, now I'm crying.] And maybe she will, maybe it's not too late, but husbands - please, please don't ignore what I'm saying to you - read this book or something like it before it's too late. Don't be complacent that everything is okay, even if you can sense that everything is going fine. Change YOU, improve YOURSELF, then she'll follow (I hope). Don't try to change her. You're the problem, not her (it's always both people, obviously, but you can only control yourself - don't forget). You can be better. She deserves better.And wives: Do you. Be wonderful and understanding and accepting, and realize that us men are sensitive too and are only trying to do the right thing. I've told my wife this many times in the last 6 months: I've learned how much smarter women really are than men. Women are so much more tolerant and forgiving, while men hold grudges and become defensive. Give your man time, keep on him (we're not as smart as you, remember, so we need constant reminders if we're failing or trailing off), and love him. Because I'm telling you from experience, when a man feels like he's let his wife down and she no longer feels the love for him anymore, it's the worst feeling in the world. A man is truly nothing without a good woman, and it's not a cliche - I've learned it's entirely true.As for me, I still have hope that I haven't driven my wife too far away and that she may spring back like a rubber band (one of the good concepts from this book), and I'm not going to give up until I get her back fully. And if that happens, I am going to be such a better husband. I'm already trying to be (am being), even without her fully in it with me right now. That woman - my wife, my best friend, my everything - deserves everything I can give and more. Damn, I hope I'm not too late to finally figure that out.Here's to hope. Here's to love. Here's to becoming a better man and a better husband. "

If you or your partner are amongst a stereotype gender, then this book is a treasure for you. It has some good points worth a fast read. Written in a boring way, most examples don't add additional information but show more how successful the author's similars are. In the past, John Gray attended a Transcendental Meditation lecture (why are always people with that type of background so pupular?) and received an unaccredited PhD degree by correspondence (Wikipedia). To compare it with Why men don't listen and women can't read maps, the second one is not only entertainful but also scientific! So it's possible to search for information which is far more important than the beautiful inside look of a book. Humans are not mathematic numbers to say - for example: If a women needs 6 things in a relationship then a man needs 6 things too. I am excited to read a contrary opinion  The Myth of Mars and Venus by Cameron' and add to this review after comparing."
44,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3921294-cheryl,1,"Well, I wasn't at the book club meeting where they decided on this book. Now I know not to let that happen again ;)I've never felt a desire to pick this one up and consider it. But I gave it a whirl and didn't like it at all. I hated the whole Mars/Venus thing. Very sappy, IMHO. And, to make matters worse, the author kept flipping back & forth nearly every paragraph from relatively useful information written for adults to the darn M/V thing. So very annoying. It could have worked better had he kept the analogy to the first chapter or maybe a small section at the end of each chapter. But no, it was everywhere and I think it really watered down his useful ideas.Also, I know this book isn't meant to be couples' therapy or anything, but the examples throughout are rather lightweight. After being married for 31 years, I can honestly say you have to learn to overlook petty things like taking the garbage out. My husband would laugh his ass off if I wrote him a ""love letter"" detailing why doing/not doing some minor thing makes me feel fragile and alone. If the garbage needs taking out, and I want it done now, I just take it out. Even the section on ""heavier"" topics was mostly silly, I think.The author could have salvaged it a bit at the end if he had acknowledged that many many couples have HUGE issues like severe financial crisis, infidelity, addiction, etc. I wish he could have encouraged couples in these kinds of situations to seek professional help. The tone of the book seems to imply that if we all just learn a bit about each other and make subtle changes in how we ask for help, or time alone, etc., then all will be well. I'm here to tell you, it doesn't matter how you ask an addict or compulsive spender or cheater to change their ways (male or female), it won't happen successfully without guidance by someone(s) knowledgeable outside the immediate situation. I just wish he would have touched on resources for those couples in serious trouble. 1 star, and I think I'm being generous.Cheryl "

Without taking a position on the ultimate value of the book i can tell you what I thought and what I got from it. The book or Dr. Gray does try to look at the reality of things in accepting that men and women are physically different and usually different in the way they think. It fails I believe to recognize that there may be a somewhat more fluid swing among people, that genetically there may be a somewhat more mid-ground at times. I found that in my experience, (marriage, courtship...life) there are certain insights here. Men and women both would do well to at least consider what Dr. Gray has to say. It could and can reduce friction. On the other hand it wouldn't do well to assume that he's always right or has anything like ""all the answers"". He makes statements that are at times rather thick and tells stories of things that I think show he failed to apply simple common sense.So, an interesting book, some value, not a hard book to read...but I wouldn't look to it for all the answers to interpersonal relationships.

54,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3680008-michael,1,"My main problem with this book is that it is based on assumptions and not facts. Men are not all the same, women are not all the same. This is a false narrative that is driven by presumptions on how a Man or a woman supposed to act. We are living in the 21st century for crying out loud, how are these 'hints' even relevant? There should be NO book that addresses tips on how to understand men or woman why you ask? THEY ARE ALL PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES! The only thing you can study are the ""GENERAL"" assumptions or what TYPICALLY happens in DIFFERENT circumstances.Men do this because they are strong. Men are not weak. Men cannot get emotional. Women are the only emotional ones. Men wants a woman who knows how to cook. Woman wishes that a man will understand her more and not prejudge based on assumptions. The reason why a man does not call you back right away is because he is not interested. You should only date six months before you are ready for marriage. THIS IS A LOAD OF BULLSHI..SHUT YOUR MOUTH! I don't care how educated you are or how well renowned you are, Men and woman are not all the same. How in the blue hell was this even published? Sometimes I wonder if these books are even given a second glance when you study the people around them.Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus? B.S! How about Men are from Earth and Woman are from Earth... WE ARE TWO DIFFERENT SEXES living in the same planet! There is no ""golden rule"" on how a woman or men act in relationships cause they are all wired differently!  *soap box over* sorry this type of content annoys the hell out of me. I don't even know I wasted time reading this.* ."
55,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8861289-cham-cuartero,3,"I bought this book months ago, in my quest to be a better girlfriend...I finished reading it, exactly nine months after I became a wife...It was well worth it, because I wasn't the only one who read it. S read it too. This book was written for a couple's mutual understanding. Otherwise, it should have been published in two different books - Men Are From Mars: Getting to Know Them & Women Are From Venus: How to Understand Them.It had been a light read, nothing really fancy, does not bombard you with tons of scientific research outcomes and nauseating data. It contains real-life anecdotes not only from the author's clients but also from Mr. and Mrs. John & Bonnie Gray themselves.Here are some bits and pieces of learnings that I got from the book which are worth noting:* If you are a wife or a girlfriend, remember that you are not your partner's mother, hence, spare him (and yourself!) the nagging, lecturing, and the sometimes-suffocating sweetness.* Men and women have different ways of coping with problems. Men want to deal with their problems, alone and on their own. Women seek for other people's support in order to cope. We should learn to respect these differences.* Men, Women, Relationships - all these have good days and bad days. It's best to learn the natural cycle and flow of things so you can ride these out gracefully (specially the bad days).* Consciously and unconsciously, both men and women keep scorecards of their partners. We just have a different grading system. Don't bully your partner into adapting into yours.* Ask and you shall receive.* For Men: When a woman opens up about her problems, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to produce a solution. Sometimes yes. But usually, we just need someone who will listen to us.* For Women: When you share your problems with a man, clarify whether you are requesting for a solution, or you just need a listening ear. Otherwise, both of you will end up confused and frustrated.* A man will always want to be his woman's hero. Give him a chance to be, from time to time.* Arguments are normal. If you don't argue, then you don't have a relationship at all.* It's perfectly OK to change for your partner. Just know when enough is enough.* Don't over-complicate things. It doesn't help a bit. Analyze but never overdo.* Talk. Nothing should be an excuse not to.And so much more to learn!Over-all, I give this book a rating of 8 (out of 10). Although I learned a lot, towards the last third of the book, I felt the male bias of its teachings. It started to put more emphasis on the need for women to understand the nature of men and it made me feel that since they're ""born"" that way, it's the women who should adjust around the male psyche. Also, the title is pretty much appropriate in a figurative language but I don't think the author should keep on mentioning it repeatedly, like it's a scientific fact... That men and women came from different planets. Discussing this metaphors tricks you into thinking that it's real, and it is what caused and brought about the differences in men and women and our respective ""natures"". Nevertheless, I would still recommend this book to everyone who aims to understand the opposite sex, whatever relationship they may be in at the moment."
56,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2326163-dr-ruth-neustifter,1,"Men are from Mars offers a devious set of suggestions that work on the surface while refusing to address the actual relational issues at hand. After years of training and supervised practice as a family therapist, I came to quickly despise cheaply made books such as this. Unfortunately, this one has gained a great deal of popularity, due in large part to how many people found that it works in the short term by reducing day to day arguments and lowering expectations. With little grounding in solid research-supported relational or family development theory, this book encourages people to take up stereotypical gendered roles to reduce tension. Sure, it works on a topical level, while inequality and resentment bubble. Besides, as stress reducing as it may be to claim this tissue-thick archetypes for ourselves, who really wants to that are truly a hapless nag or a caveman? Sounds like a recipe for becoming and unfortunately real life version of The Simpsons or The Barones (Raymond), two families we laugh at to feel better ourselves. As a parting shot, I suggest that readers carefully look at the background of the self help authors before trusting them. If they have not studied and learned how to help themselves and establish success, after trauma or not, then try someone else."

Basically, it talks about a man and his need for a ""cave"" and how when the man is in his cave (cave is figurative as well as literal, where it could mean the man basically checks out from his family, doesn't speak to anyone, is in a bad mood, etc and everyone just has to ""deal with it""), he should not be bothered at all or put on a time limit to come out of it, he will come out of it on his own time, etc. Can you imagine if a woman did this??? If a woman decided to shirk her family responsibilities, treat everyone like they dislike them, and go into a shell for days on end, they would be labeled as a psycho and a lazy wench, and be totally crucified----there would be no ""she just needs her cave"" philosophy/attitude towards her. I am all for relationships be give and take, but this book made it sound like the woman should always give and just let the man take, ""and that's how a relationship ends up working"". Total garbage."

It taught me lots of new things I had never known before, simple little things about the opposite sex, and about myself. I found answers about myself in this book, answers about how I feel, behave, and react at certain times. This is a book everyone should read, especially people that are or are planning to be in heterosexual relationships. The only thing I would change would be the number of pages. I believe the message could have been delivered in a less words. Many things were mentioned several times and mentioned in details for much more than once (men's cave for example.) This made the first chapters repetitive and a little boring. The last 6 chapters were very practically explained and I wish the first chapters were written the same way. "
59,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11662595-rajan,3,"THIS is a pop psychology book which generalizes psychological findings. It is very humorous and the authors have done a lot of assumptions and used hearsay and tried to support them with evolutionary theory also. But I find it only a good time pass and nothing serious. In fact when I read psychology I found out how dull it is. They have intentionally made it funny and it is not psychology. In fact as a men I don’t agree with their generalizations as I hope as a women u will also disagree. R u frm venus? ;)P.S. Don't try it at home, office, with GF/ BF and Hubby/ wife.

When i was reading the book, i felt that i was going to learn a lot of new facts about the opposite sex; men, but i ended up learning more about my own sex, women! And this made me like the book even more. The whole process of reading this book felt like being in seminar which is a good thing, i guess. I also recommend this book for all the married couple or the ones who are about to marry, because the book discusses mainly how couples can succeed in a relationship. "

65,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116681380-comethruchapters,4," The rating for this book is 4/5 I enjoyed reading this book throughout. This typical genre is not something I usually read. This book is well explained in balanced structures and forms.  the things I learnt from this book I've come to an understanding that  maintaining a relationship is difficult  with the amount of exposure available. The development of each individual takes place at their own pace. Love gets complicated with time while maintaining a good balance between the relationships that individuals possess. Day to day the communication becomes difficult due to the rise of pressure from the external environment. Communication appears to be an easy task with a stranger. The moment of connection with the individual there is a rise of expectation that always contains ups and downs in the relationship. Uniquely, Men and women are from two different planets as they work differently. The importance of acceptance plays an important role as it involves being patient, loving, and learning. With these factors. Humans learn to accept each other. There are differences in the needs and wants that make the opposite sex work towards the satisfaction of their relationship leading to a happier outcome. 
 The power of listening and talking 
 is one of the best part i have read in this book. I've come to an understanding that the need for others to be heard and not wanting to get interrupted. The problem fixers or giving any advice may be a form of perceived love but, all they are looking forward to us release their tensions by communicating. The very moment I completed this book. The first thing that occurred in my mind was: the term Evolution. We, humans, have evolved over thousands of years yet, the evolution seems to appear in this current time in a different form that is the method of love and communication that brings a big change in life matters. It is very steady with development as humans take forms into. Martian and Venusian belonging to different worlds share a complex relationship. image:  The communication differences that occur between Men and Women are:- 1. Think2. Feel3. Perceive4. React5. Respond6. Love7. Need8. Appreciate.In this book, I felt that John Gray has made most of the explanations just from a Men's point of view. He has portrayed the situation where women are expected to deal with the circumstances while applying the formulas to form better communication between the two. The women in this book appear to be needy compared to men while the fact that it is a book to maintain a good relationship understanding the differences that part them. Most of the parts teach women how to deal with the situations rather than explaining to both the genders. There is something tricky about the three-step method for seeking help from the partner. It involves a few mind games which have been encouraged in this book. He goes into a cave... She waitsShe goes into her wave..... He has difficulties to deal withHe wants to get close but, she isn't in the right space. So, he pushes her awayShe wants to get close, He holds resentment and pushes her further away. She puts her emotions away while trying to make her partner happier.She has to open up to make him understand how she feels so avoid getting in heat,He won't open up to her as he chooses to deal with the problems alone.  This gave me a weird insight. Why are only men portrayed in this way? I am sure the readers right now must know the women who can battle the world.  The writing style is well understood which makes this book read easily. It is a quick read and well-defined book. I will suggest this book as it helps to develop communication not only for the couples but, it will surely help in the coming future."
66,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! Women are not nags constantly whinging for shsh, but, use talk to share their emotions; and men are not useless jerks, but, are emotionally more introverted and dislike being controlled. That's it. There: I have just done you a favour, I summed this all up so you don't have to go through its 300+ pages. Addressing a wide audience, I could have forgiven John Gray for his simplicities; especially since, it's true, many will recognise themselves in some of the situations he describes. But considering it's a book the author himself, in a massive display of amazing humility and modesty, claims to be 'revolutionary for couples' (nothing less!) all this useless chit chat (and irritating narcissism) ends up by being frankly annoying. There's a few pearls of wisdom here and there (eg. guys, when your wife complains about anything and everything TO you it doesn't mean she is complaining ABOUT you...) but, all in all, it's below basic. Coming from a therapist with more than twenty years of experience, this is highly disappointing. Don't believe the hype on that one. Stay clear. "

The book is inherently sexist: both towards men and women. A detailed list of all the possible stereotypes of the genders, Gray paints women as demanding, illogical little housewives who seek nothing more than to be cherished by their men and their girlfriends, and men as unemotional, mechanic creatures who struggle to display their emotions for fear they should be considered as incapable to their mates.The main moral of the book seems to be that there is no such thing as human, because of course we aren't individuals who all differ from eachother regardless of our gender, we are in fact neatly divided into ""Martians"" and ""Venusians"", and we all behave in this way! And if we don't? Gray helpfully tells us that it's normal for there to be a role reversal, and that's just us denying our true genders!Unfortunately it was difficult for me to continue reading after the first few chapters and I decided to stop for fear of exploding with rage, but here's a choice quote to give you an idea of the book's contents:""It is a mistake to expect a man to always be in touch with his loving feelings just as it is a mistake to expect a woman's feelings to always be rational and logical."""
70,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048714-i-n,1,"If I could give this book negative stars I would. I do not care for pop psychology. I do not care for gender roles and stereotypes. This books talks about ignorant and prejudiced human creations advertised as biological truths by many ridiculous societies. These ideas have NO real solid basis and would not even exist if (highly challenged)societies (that tolerate books like this one!) did not keep NURTURING, brainwashing and programming their men and women to assume these dumb positions (again with books like this one!). Human beings are WAY more complex than this book attempts to imply. We each have different temperaments, different experiences, different ways we are apt to react, understand and behave in various situations. As individual PEOPLE! Not as women or men. I did not like this book at all! Yes, there may be a few biological differences between men and women. But we are spiritual beings FIRST before physical beings-and even at that-only to an extent. A soul is a soul-there is no male or female on a spiritual plane. No to this book. No. No. NO!"

This book does the exact opposite of what it set out to do more than anything.Here, I'll give some practical advice; you don't need a psychologist for this. Talk to your significant other. Learn about them through that method. You can learn a lot about someone through that method.Another piece of practical advice: stop treating relationships as if they're games. the less straightforward you are, the more you unnecessarily complicate a relationship. If you're straight to the point, there's no bumbling around trying to figure anything out, at least not nearly as much as before.These are just a couple of basics. Books like these only seek to further diminish the intellect of the populace and, sometimes inadvertently, gain control of society, directing the courses of people's lives regardless of whether it benefits them or not; it sure benefits the author of the book. Once we rise above the kind of thinking exhibited in books like this, we can break the shackles holding gender inequality in place and live with each other in harmony."

While I agree that stereotypes exist for a reason, they don't exist forever and what was applicable for the majority of population in the past may or may not be now. I know this book still might be useful to few young people (I also read it when I was younger and naive), however, I strongly believe such compromising relationships are toxic and immature; & should be done away with. There is only one secret to get into and continue through a successful relationship and that is - to talk; the ability to communicate one's desires and perils to the partner.

If she washes your socks, turn your socks right side out so she doesn't have to (how sweet; a lot of the things on the list assumed the woman does all the housework)40.

I picked this one up one time out of curiosity, and to my surprise a lot of the chapters bring up excellent points. A bit of it is hit and miss and based on your perspective and to be taken with a grain of salt. Still, the chapters telling the differences between men and their silent phases, women needing to talk a lot on an emotional level, and arguments that arise and reasons behind them make a lot of sense.

So what defines men or women is but what they become/told to be (De Bouvoire). Men, as he assumes, are ”instinctively” lazy ungrateful and bossy creatures, while women are hard-worker weak and follower creatures. However, both of them are justifiably extremely insecure, which is the second assumption.

95,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116681380-comethruchapters,4," The rating for this book is 4/5 I enjoyed reading this book throughout. This typical genre is not something I usually read. This book is well explained in balanced structures and forms.  the things I learnt from this book I've come to an understanding that  maintaining a relationship is difficult  with the amount of exposure available. The development of each individual takes place at their own pace. Love gets complicated with time while maintaining a good balance between the relationships that individuals possess. Day to day the communication becomes difficult due to the rise of pressure from the external environment. Communication appears to be an easy task with a stranger. The moment of connection with the individual there is a rise of expectation that always contains ups and downs in the relationship. Uniquely, Men and women are from two different planets as they work differently. The importance of acceptance plays an important role as it involves being patient, loving, and learning. With these factors. Humans learn to accept each other. There are differences in the needs and wants that make the opposite sex work towards the satisfaction of their relationship leading to a happier outcome. 
 The power of listening and talking 
 is one of the best part i have read in this book. I've come to an understanding that the need for others to be heard and not wanting to get interrupted. The problem fixers or giving any advice may be a form of perceived love but, all they are looking forward to us release their tensions by communicating. The very moment I completed this book. The first thing that occurred in my mind was: the term Evolution. We, humans, have evolved over thousands of years yet, the evolution seems to appear in this current time in a different form that is the method of love and communication that brings a big change in life matters. It is very steady with development as humans take forms into. Martian and Venusian belonging to different worlds share a complex relationship. image:  The communication differences that occur between Men and Women are:- 1. Think2. Feel3. Perceive4. React5. Respond6. Love7. Need8. Appreciate.In this book, I felt that John Gray has made most of the explanations just from a Men's point of view. He has portrayed the situation where women are expected to deal with the circumstances while applying the formulas to form better communication between the two. The women in this book appear to be needy compared to men while the fact that it is a book to maintain a good relationship understanding the differences that part them. Most of the parts teach women how to deal with the situations rather than explaining to both the genders. There is something tricky about the three-step method for seeking help from the partner. It involves a few mind games which have been encouraged in this book. He goes into a cave... She waitsShe goes into her wave..... He has difficulties to deal withHe wants to get close but, she isn't in the right space. So, he pushes her awayShe wants to get close, He holds resentment and pushes her further away. She puts her emotions away while trying to make her partner happier.She has to open up to make him understand how she feels so avoid getting in heat,He won't open up to her as he chooses to deal with the problems alone.  This gave me a weird insight. Why are only men portrayed in this way? I am sure the readers right now must know the women who can battle the world.  The writing style is well understood which makes this book read easily. It is a quick read and well-defined book. I will suggest this book as it helps to develop communication not only for the couples but, it will surely help in the coming future."
96,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! Women are not nags constantly whinging for shsh, but, use talk to share their emotions; and men are not useless jerks, but, are emotionally more introverted and dislike being controlled. That's it. There: I have just done you a favour, I summed this all up so you don't have to go through its 300+ pages. Addressing a wide audience, I could have forgiven John Gray for his simplicities; especially since, it's true, many will recognise themselves in some of the situations he describes. But considering it's a book the author himself, in a massive display of amazing humility and modesty, claims to be 'revolutionary for couples' (nothing less!) all this useless chit chat (and irritating narcissism) ends up by being frankly annoying. There's a few pearls of wisdom here and there (eg. guys, when your wife complains about anything and everything TO you it doesn't mean she is complaining ABOUT you...) but, all in all, it's below basic. Coming from a therapist with more than twenty years of experience, this is highly disappointing. Don't believe the hype on that one. Stay clear. "

99,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3262810-anya,1,"Utter tripe! That anyone could rate this book higher than a 1-star is beyond me: if I could give it less I gladly would! The book is inherently sexist: both towards men and women. A detailed list of all the possible stereotypes of the genders, Gray paints women as demanding, illogical little housewives who seek nothing more than to be cherished by their men and their girlfriends, and men as unemotional, mechanic creatures who struggle to display their emotions for fear they should be considered as incapable to their mates.The main moral of the book seems to be that there is no such thing as human, because of course we aren't individuals who all differ from eachother regardless of our gender, we are in fact neatly divided into ""Martians"" and ""Venusians"", and we all behave in this way! And if we don't? Gray helpfully tells us that it's normal for there to be a role reversal, and that's just us denying our true genders!Unfortunately it was difficult for me to continue reading after the first few chapters and I decided to stop for fear of exploding with rage, but here's a choice quote to give you an idea of the book's contents:""It is a mistake to expect a man to always be in touch with his loving feelings just as it is a mistake to expect a woman's feelings to always be rational and logical."""
100,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048714-i-n,1,"If I could give this book negative stars I would. I do not care for pop psychology. I do not care for gender roles and stereotypes. This books talks about ignorant and prejudiced human creations advertised as biological truths by many ridiculous societies. These ideas have NO real solid basis and would not even exist if (highly challenged)societies (that tolerate books like this one!) did not keep NURTURING, brainwashing and programming their men and women to assume these dumb positions (again with books like this one!). Human beings are WAY more complex than this book attempts to imply. We each have different temperaments, different experiences, different ways we are apt to react, understand and behave in various situations. As individual PEOPLE! Not as women or men. I did not like this book at all! Yes, there may be a few biological differences between men and women. But we are spiritual beings FIRST before physical beings-and even at that-only to an extent. A soul is a soul-there is no male or female on a spiritual plane. No to this book. No. No. NO!"
101,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18268555-awesomov,1,"Talk about something counterproductive. This book does the exact opposite of what it set out to do more than anything.Here, I'll give some practical advice; you don't need a psychologist for this. Talk to your significant other. Learn about them through that method. You can learn a lot about someone through that method.Another piece of practical advice: stop treating relationships as if they're games. the less straightforward you are, the more you unnecessarily complicate a relationship. If you're straight to the point, there's no bumbling around trying to figure anything out, at least not nearly as much as before.These are just a couple of basics. Books like these only seek to further diminish the intellect of the populace and, sometimes inadvertently, gain control of society, directing the courses of people's lives regardless of whether it benefits them or not; it sure benefits the author of the book. Once we rise above the kind of thinking exhibited in books like this, we can break the shackles holding gender inequality in place and live with each other in harmony."

A woman's role is to be respectful and deferential to her man. Yeah. sure.Men just need to be appreciated and trusted. Ok. Whatever.And he definitely enjoys repetition. Especially of the points above.But wait... there's a but.If you read this book expecting the above, then you can take away the real message. It's all about communications. Verbal and otherwise. I'm reading this book as a guide for introspection. Especially at this point in time.... Had I read this book a while ago, would things have been different? Had my partner read it? Reading the book definitely makes me ask those questions, but not with an expectation of changing the past, but rather in order to extrapolate on the future.""Donkey's are so much smarter than humans - they never fall in the same ditch twice..."" - I'm trying to learn from the donkeys."

But there are few exceptions and definitely, this book is one of them.The title of the book itself is a stereotypical, wrong assumption which serves as a provenance for a great deal of relationship issues. While I agree that stereotypes exist for a reason, they don't exist forever and what was applicable for the majority of population in the past may or may not be now. I know this book still might be useful to few young people (I also read it when I was younger and naive), however, I strongly believe such compromising relationships are toxic and immature; & should be done away with. There is only one secret to get into and continue through a successful relationship and that is - to talk; the ability to communicate one's desires and perils to the partner. Or maybe read Franklin Veaux. He is a great guy.You can just skip reading this book."

Offer to build a fire in the wintertime (because we all have fireplaces)24. Give her four hugs a day (no more, no less)28. If she washes your socks, turn your socks right side out so she doesn't have to (how sweet; a lot of the things on the list assumed the woman does all the housework)40. When holding hands don't let your hand go limp (I make fun of this but perhaps a limp hand is better than recent ex-boyfriend who would just let go of my hand saying he didn't like PDA)63. Offer to sharpen her knives in the kitchen (pretty sure this is why all my past relationships have failed; no one has ever offered to sharpen my knives)64.

I picked this one up one time out of curiosity, and to my surprise a lot of the chapters bring up excellent points. A bit of it is hit and miss and based on your perspective and to be taken with a grain of salt. Still, the chapters telling the differences between men and their silent phases, women needing to talk a lot on an emotional level, and arguments that arise and reasons behind them make a lot of sense. I saw signs of this in every relationship I've been in, and continue to see it when friends come to me with relationship troubles. Worth a read for sure."

I have two personal takeaways from this: 1. I'm normal and not batshit crazy. 2. ""Drama/Insecurity"" is normal especially when the relationship is new. All our hurts and suppressed feelings come up not because we're haunted, but we trust out partner to help us heal from it. Sure some might find this cheesy/corny, but it's a good listen/resource.

This typical genre is not something I usually read. This book is well explained in balanced structures and forms.  the things I learnt from this book I've come to an understanding that  maintaining a relationship is difficult  with the amount of exposure available. The development of each individual takes place at their own pace. Love gets complicated with time while maintaining a good balance between the relationships that individuals possess. Day to day the communication becomes difficult due to the rise of pressure from the external environment. Communication appears to be an easy task with a stranger. The moment of connection with the individual there is a rise of expectation that always contains ups and downs in the relationship. Uniquely, Men and women are from two different planets as they work differently. The importance of acceptance plays an important role as it involves being patient, loving, and learning. With these factors. Humans learn to accept each other. There are differences in the needs and wants that make the opposite sex work towards the satisfaction of their relationship leading to a happier outcome. 
 The power of listening and talking 
 is one of the best part i have read in this book. I've come to an understanding that the need for others to be heard and not wanting to get interrupted. The problem fixers or giving any advice may be a form of perceived love but, all they are looking forward to us release their tensions by communicating. The very moment I completed this book. The first thing that occurred in my mind was: the term Evolution. We, humans, have evolved over thousands of years yet, the evolution seems to appear in this current time in a different form that is the method of love and communication that brings a big change in life matters. It is very steady with development as humans take forms into. Martian and Venusian belonging to different worlds share a complex relationship. image:  The communication differences that occur between Men and Women are:- 1. Think2. Feel3. Perceive4. React5. Respond6. Love7. Need8. Appreciate.In this book, I felt that John Gray has made most of the explanations just from a Men's point of view. He has portrayed the situation where women are expected to deal with the circumstances while applying the formulas to form better communication between the two. The women in this book appear to be needy compared to men while the fact that it is a book to maintain a good relationship understanding the differences that part them. Most of the parts teach women how to deal with the situations rather than explaining to both the genders. There is something tricky about the three-step method for seeking help from the partner. It involves a few mind games which have been encouraged in this book. He goes into a cave... She waitsShe goes into her wave..... He has difficulties to deal withHe wants to get close but, she isn't in the right space. So, he pushes her awayShe wants to get close, He holds resentment and pushes her further away. She puts her emotions away while trying to make her partner happier.She has to open up to make him understand how she feels so avoid getting in heat,He won't open up to her as he chooses to deal with the problems alone.  This gave me a weird insight. Why are only men portrayed in this way? I am sure the readers right now must know the women who can battle the world.  The writing style is well understood which makes this book read easily. It is a quick read and well-defined book. I will suggest this book as it helps to develop communication not only for the couples but, it will surely help in the coming future."

There: I have just done you a favour, I summed this all up so you don't have to go through its 300+ pages. Addressing a wide audience, I could have forgiven John Gray for his simplicities; especially since, it's true, many will recognise themselves in some of the situations he describes. But considering it's a book the author himself, in a massive display of amazing humility and modesty, claims to be 'revolutionary for couples' (nothing less!) all this useless chit chat (and irritating narcissism) ends up by being frankly annoying. There's a few pearls of wisdom here and there (eg. guys, when your wife complains about anything and everything TO you it doesn't mean she is complaining ABOUT you...) but, all in all, it's below basic.

The book is inherently sexist: both towards men and women. A detailed list of all the possible stereotypes of the genders, Gray paints women as demanding, illogical little housewives who seek nothing more than to be cherished by their men and their girlfriends, and men as unemotional, mechanic creatures who struggle to display their emotions for fear they should be considered as incapable to their mates.The main moral of the book seems to be that there is no such thing as human, because of course we aren't individuals who all differ from eachother regardless of our gender, we are in fact neatly divided into ""Martians"" and ""Venusians"", and we all behave in this way! And if we don't? Gray helpfully tells us that it's normal for there to be a role reversal, and that's just us denying our true genders!Unfortunately it was difficult for me to continue reading after the first few chapters and I decided to stop for fear of exploding with rage, but here's a choice quote to give you an idea of the book's contents:""It is a mistake to expect a man to always be in touch with his loving feelings just as it is a mistake to expect a woman's feelings to always be rational and logical."""
130,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048714-i-n,1,"If I could give this book negative stars I would. I do not care for pop psychology. I do not care for gender roles and stereotypes. This books talks about ignorant and prejudiced human creations advertised as biological truths by many ridiculous societies. These ideas have NO real solid basis and would not even exist if (highly challenged)societies (that tolerate books like this one!) did not keep NURTURING, brainwashing and programming their men and women to assume these dumb positions (again with books like this one!). Human beings are WAY more complex than this book attempts to imply. We each have different temperaments, different experiences, different ways we are apt to react, understand and behave in various situations. As individual PEOPLE! Not as women or men. I did not like this book at all! Yes, there may be a few biological differences between men and women. But we are spiritual beings FIRST before physical beings-and even at that-only to an extent. A soul is a soul-there is no male or female on a spiritual plane. No to this book. No. No. NO!"
131,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18268555-awesomov,1,"Talk about something counterproductive. This book does the exact opposite of what it set out to do more than anything.Here, I'll give some practical advice; you don't need a psychologist for this. Talk to your significant other. Learn about them through that method. You can learn a lot about someone through that method.Another piece of practical advice: stop treating relationships as if they're games. the less straightforward you are, the more you unnecessarily complicate a relationship. If you're straight to the point, there's no bumbling around trying to figure anything out, at least not nearly as much as before.These are just a couple of basics. Books like these only seek to further diminish the intellect of the populace and, sometimes inadvertently, gain control of society, directing the courses of people's lives regardless of whether it benefits them or not; it sure benefits the author of the book. Once we rise above the kind of thinking exhibited in books like this, we can break the shackles holding gender inequality in place and live with each other in harmony."

A woman's role is to be respectful and deferential to her man. Yeah. sure.Men just need to be appreciated and trusted. Ok. Whatever.And he definitely enjoys repetition. Especially of the points above.But wait... there's a but.If you read this book expecting the above, then you can take away the real message. It's all about communications. Verbal and otherwise. I'm reading this book as a guide for introspection. Especially at this point in time.... Had I read this book a while ago, would things have been different? Had my partner read it? Reading the book definitely makes me ask those questions, but not with an expectation of changing the past, but rather in order to extrapolate on the future.""Donkey's are so much smarter than humans - they never fall in the same ditch twice..."" - I'm trying to learn from the donkeys."

But there are few exceptions and definitely, this book is one of them.The title of the book itself is a stereotypical, wrong assumption which serves as a provenance for a great deal of relationship issues. While I agree that stereotypes exist for a reason, they don't exist forever and what was applicable for the majority of population in the past may or may not be now. I know this book still might be useful to few young people (I also read it when I was younger and naive), however, I strongly believe such compromising relationships are toxic and immature; & should be done away with. There is only one secret to get into and continue through a successful relationship and that is - to talk; the ability to communicate one's desires and perils to the partner. Or maybe read Franklin Veaux. He is a great guy.You can just skip reading this book."

Offer to build a fire in the wintertime (because we all have fireplaces)24. Give her four hugs a day (no more, no less)28. If she washes your socks, turn your socks right side out so she doesn't have to (how sweet; a lot of the things on the list assumed the woman does all the housework)40. When holding hands don't let your hand go limp (I make fun of this but perhaps a limp hand is better than recent ex-boyfriend who would just let go of my hand saying he didn't like PDA)63. Offer to sharpen her knives in the kitchen (pretty sure this is why all my past relationships have failed; no one has ever offered to sharpen my knives)64.

I picked this one up one time out of curiosity, and to my surprise a lot of the chapters bring up excellent points. A bit of it is hit and miss and based on your perspective and to be taken with a grain of salt. Still, the chapters telling the differences between men and their silent phases, women needing to talk a lot on an emotional level, and arguments that arise and reasons behind them make a lot of sense. I saw signs of this in every relationship I've been in, and continue to see it when friends come to me with relationship troubles. Worth a read for sure."

I have two personal takeaways from this: 1. I'm normal and not batshit crazy. 2. ""Drama/Insecurity"" is normal especially when the relationship is new. All our hurts and suppressed feelings come up not because we're haunted, but we trust out partner to help us heal from it. Sure some might find this cheesy/corny, but it's a good listen/resource.

148,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26810469-sanaa-hyder,1,"I read a small percentage of this book but it was enough to help me form my opinion.According to Gray, men go into their caves and women want to talk when problems arise. Umm, what about women who prefer going to their “caves” or “wells” or whatever? Or men who want to talk? Oh yes, in that case a woman must perhaps reconsider her feminine qualities and tone down her masculine side and vice versa in case of a man.Excuse me while I scream for a second, not a second long lest it comes across that I have fallen down my womanly well. Perhaps I have, so this means I will come out of the well eventually, much like a man from his cave...I thought men and women were supposed to be different? Sounds like they’re actually similar?Women also apparently don’t like it when they’re offered solutions. As a hijab-wearing Muslim woman of almost three decades, I don’t know if my opinion matters over Gray’s (a much older and perhaps wiser? white male) when I say that women all around me offer solutions to my “problems” and I am filled with love towards them — 99 out of a 100 times. Yes, we are the “home improvement committee”, but what of my uncle (a much older, Pakistani man) who offers me with glee the different ways I can “improve” the decor or ambience or broken-ness of my room. Individual human differences exist and they are crucial to not discount when it comes to painting an entire sex with the same brush stroke — more so in 2020 than ever before.I am filled with rage when I think of how many men and women perhaps use the “differences” discussed in this book as an excuse to not work on themselves, to be the best version of themselves. I will speak only for women when I say, it is not okay for you to displace your anxieties and worries and problems and expect your “partner” to make you feel whole when you place all of your burdens on this one person’s shoulder and expect them to be your hero. Only you can rescue yourself. Learn to emotionally regulate yourself. Self-soothing is a thing. Apparently as women from Venus, we are also by default experts in psychology according to Gray, so let’s really practice what we apparently preach as “unsolicited advice and criticism”.If you’re a man who is looking for the “wisdom” offered in this book, I would highly recommend you take it with a pinch...no, a giant heapful of salt, and learn to trust and build better communication skills with the woman you’re interested in. We are all different, and we need to talk to each other instead of bringing out the worst in each other, and expecting the other to just “understand” our differences."
149,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57524832-nora-berzawy,1,"This book fails to guide through relationships because of numerous assumptions that the whole book was based on. First of all, this book assumes, literally, an out-of-planet nature of the opposite sexes, which I don't agree with since there are no inherited behavioral patterns that define sexes but rather a societal stereotypes that this book reinforce producing under the so-called ”instinct”. So what defines men or women is but what they become/told to be (De Bouvoire). Men, as he assumes, are ”instinctively” lazy ungrateful and bossy creatures, while women are hard-worker weak and follower creatures. However, both of them are justifiably extremely insecure, which is the second assumption. The third assumption is what he proposes as the default dynamic of the relationship; the I-don’t-work-I’m-a-princess kind of a woman under the custody of the changing temper of the ”knight in shining armor” kind of a man. Although I found a few relatable situations (that’s why the one-star), his advice on how to react is trivially ineffective. His solutions offer a short term bandage to the long-lived wounds and distorted identities. He barely touched on a great practice--for past wounds that emerge from contacting ”other” people be this a lover or a friend-- loving one’s self. Lastly, this book is unnecessarily lengthy; all notions can perfectly be summarized in a few pages. I don't recommend it."

I picked this one up one time out of curiosity, and to my surprise a lot of the chapters bring up excellent points. A bit of it is hit and miss and based on your perspective and to be taken with a grain of salt. Still, the chapters telling the differences between men and their silent phases, women needing to talk a lot on an emotional level, and arguments that arise and reasons behind them make a lot of sense. I saw signs of this in every relationship I've been in, and continue to see it when friends come to me with relationship troubles. Worth a read for sure."

178,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26810469-sanaa-hyder,1,"I read a small percentage of this book but it was enough to help me form my opinion.According to Gray, men go into their caves and women want to talk when problems arise. Umm, what about women who prefer going to their “caves” or “wells” or whatever? Or men who want to talk? Oh yes, in that case a woman must perhaps reconsider her feminine qualities and tone down her masculine side and vice versa in case of a man.Excuse me while I scream for a second, not a second long lest it comes across that I have fallen down my womanly well. Perhaps I have, so this means I will come out of the well eventually, much like a man from his cave...I thought men and women were supposed to be different? Sounds like they’re actually similar?Women also apparently don’t like it when they’re offered solutions. As a hijab-wearing Muslim woman of almost three decades, I don’t know if my opinion matters over Gray’s (a much older and perhaps wiser? white male) when I say that women all around me offer solutions to my “problems” and I am filled with love towards them — 99 out of a 100 times. Yes, we are the “home improvement committee”, but what of my uncle (a much older, Pakistani man) who offers me with glee the different ways I can “improve” the decor or ambience or broken-ness of my room. Individual human differences exist and they are crucial to not discount when it comes to painting an entire sex with the same brush stroke — more so in 2020 than ever before.I am filled with rage when I think of how many men and women perhaps use the “differences” discussed in this book as an excuse to not work on themselves, to be the best version of themselves. I will speak only for women when I say, it is not okay for you to displace your anxieties and worries and problems and expect your “partner” to make you feel whole when you place all of your burdens on this one person’s shoulder and expect them to be your hero. Only you can rescue yourself. Learn to emotionally regulate yourself. Self-soothing is a thing. Apparently as women from Venus, we are also by default experts in psychology according to Gray, so let’s really practice what we apparently preach as “unsolicited advice and criticism”.If you’re a man who is looking for the “wisdom” offered in this book, I would highly recommend you take it with a pinch...no, a giant heapful of salt, and learn to trust and build better communication skills with the woman you’re interested in. We are all different, and we need to talk to each other instead of bringing out the worst in each other, and expecting the other to just “understand” our differences."
179,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57524832-nora-berzawy,1,"This book fails to guide through relationships because of numerous assumptions that the whole book was based on. First of all, this book assumes, literally, an out-of-planet nature of the opposite sexes, which I don't agree with since there are no inherited behavioral patterns that define sexes but rather a societal stereotypes that this book reinforce producing under the so-called ”instinct”. So what defines men or women is but what they become/told to be (De Bouvoire). Men, as he assumes, are ”instinctively” lazy ungrateful and bossy creatures, while women are hard-worker weak and follower creatures. However, both of them are justifiably extremely insecure, which is the second assumption. The third assumption is what he proposes as the default dynamic of the relationship; the I-don’t-work-I’m-a-princess kind of a woman under the custody of the changing temper of the ”knight in shining armor” kind of a man. Although I found a few relatable situations (that’s why the one-star), his advice on how to react is trivially ineffective. His solutions offer a short term bandage to the long-lived wounds and distorted identities. He barely touched on a great practice--for past wounds that emerge from contacting ”other” people be this a lover or a friend-- loving one’s self. Lastly, this book is unnecessarily lengthy; all notions can perfectly be summarized in a few pages. I don't recommend it."

When i was reading the book, i felt that i was going to learn a lot of new facts about the opposite sex; men, but i ended up learning more about my own sex, women! And this made me like the book even more. The whole process of reading this book felt like being in seminar which is a good thing, i guess. I also recommend this book for all the married couple or the ones who are about to marry, because the book discusses mainly how couples can succeed in a relationship. "

185,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116681380-comethruchapters,4," The rating for this book is 4/5 I enjoyed reading this book throughout. This typical genre is not something I usually read. This book is well explained in balanced structures and forms.  the things I learnt from this book I've come to an understanding that  maintaining a relationship is difficult  with the amount of exposure available. The development of each individual takes place at their own pace. Love gets complicated with time while maintaining a good balance between the relationships that individuals possess. Day to day the communication becomes difficult due to the rise of pressure from the external environment. Communication appears to be an easy task with a stranger. The moment of connection with the individual there is a rise of expectation that always contains ups and downs in the relationship. Uniquely, Men and women are from two different planets as they work differently. The importance of acceptance plays an important role as it involves being patient, loving, and learning. With these factors. Humans learn to accept each other. There are differences in the needs and wants that make the opposite sex work towards the satisfaction of their relationship leading to a happier outcome. 
 The power of listening and talking 
 is one of the best part i have read in this book. I've come to an understanding that the need for others to be heard and not wanting to get interrupted. The problem fixers or giving any advice may be a form of perceived love but, all they are looking forward to us release their tensions by communicating. The very moment I completed this book. The first thing that occurred in my mind was: the term Evolution. We, humans, have evolved over thousands of years yet, the evolution seems to appear in this current time in a different form that is the method of love and communication that brings a big change in life matters. It is very steady with development as humans take forms into. Martian and Venusian belonging to different worlds share a complex relationship. image:  The communication differences that occur between Men and Women are:- 1. Think2. Feel3. Perceive4. React5. Respond6. Love7. Need8. Appreciate.In this book, I felt that John Gray has made most of the explanations just from a Men's point of view. He has portrayed the situation where women are expected to deal with the circumstances while applying the formulas to form better communication between the two. The women in this book appear to be needy compared to men while the fact that it is a book to maintain a good relationship understanding the differences that part them. Most of the parts teach women how to deal with the situations rather than explaining to both the genders. There is something tricky about the three-step method for seeking help from the partner. It involves a few mind games which have been encouraged in this book. He goes into a cave... She waitsShe goes into her wave..... He has difficulties to deal withHe wants to get close but, she isn't in the right space. So, he pushes her awayShe wants to get close, He holds resentment and pushes her further away. She puts her emotions away while trying to make her partner happier.She has to open up to make him understand how she feels so avoid getting in heat,He won't open up to her as he chooses to deal with the problems alone.  This gave me a weird insight. Why are only men portrayed in this way? I am sure the readers right now must know the women who can battle the world.  The writing style is well understood which makes this book read easily. It is a quick read and well-defined book. I will suggest this book as it helps to develop communication not only for the couples but, it will surely help in the coming future."
186,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! Women are not nags constantly whinging for shsh, but, use talk to share their emotions; and men are not useless jerks, but, are emotionally more introverted and dislike being controlled. That's it. There: I have just done you a favour, I summed this all up so you don't have to go through its 300+ pages. Addressing a wide audience, I could have forgiven John Gray for his simplicities; especially since, it's true, many will recognise themselves in some of the situations he describes. But considering it's a book the author himself, in a massive display of amazing humility and modesty, claims to be 'revolutionary for couples' (nothing less!) all this useless chit chat (and irritating narcissism) ends up by being frankly annoying. There's a few pearls of wisdom here and there (eg. guys, when your wife complains about anything and everything TO you it doesn't mean she is complaining ABOUT you...) but, all in all, it's below basic. Coming from a therapist with more than twenty years of experience, this is highly disappointing. Don't believe the hype on that one. Stay clear. "

208,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26810469-sanaa-hyder,1,"I read a small percentage of this book but it was enough to help me form my opinion.According to Gray, men go into their caves and women want to talk when problems arise. Umm, what about women who prefer going to their “caves” or “wells” or whatever? Or men who want to talk? Oh yes, in that case a woman must perhaps reconsider her feminine qualities and tone down her masculine side and vice versa in case of a man.Excuse me while I scream for a second, not a second long lest it comes across that I have fallen down my womanly well. Perhaps I have, so this means I will come out of the well eventually, much like a man from his cave...I thought men and women were supposed to be different? Sounds like they’re actually similar?Women also apparently don’t like it when they’re offered solutions. As a hijab-wearing Muslim woman of almost three decades, I don’t know if my opinion matters over Gray’s (a much older and perhaps wiser? white male) when I say that women all around me offer solutions to my “problems” and I am filled with love towards them — 99 out of a 100 times. Yes, we are the “home improvement committee”, but what of my uncle (a much older, Pakistani man) who offers me with glee the different ways I can “improve” the decor or ambience or broken-ness of my room. Individual human differences exist and they are crucial to not discount when it comes to painting an entire sex with the same brush stroke — more so in 2020 than ever before.I am filled with rage when I think of how many men and women perhaps use the “differences” discussed in this book as an excuse to not work on themselves, to be the best version of themselves. I will speak only for women when I say, it is not okay for you to displace your anxieties and worries and problems and expect your “partner” to make you feel whole when you place all of your burdens on this one person’s shoulder and expect them to be your hero. Only you can rescue yourself. Learn to emotionally regulate yourself. Self-soothing is a thing. Apparently as women from Venus, we are also by default experts in psychology according to Gray, so let’s really practice what we apparently preach as “unsolicited advice and criticism”.If you’re a man who is looking for the “wisdom” offered in this book, I would highly recommend you take it with a pinch...no, a giant heapful of salt, and learn to trust and build better communication skills with the woman you’re interested in. We are all different, and we need to talk to each other instead of bringing out the worst in each other, and expecting the other to just “understand” our differences."
209,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57524832-nora-berzawy,1,"This book fails to guide through relationships because of numerous assumptions that the whole book was based on. First of all, this book assumes, literally, an out-of-planet nature of the opposite sexes, which I don't agree with since there are no inherited behavioral patterns that define sexes but rather a societal stereotypes that this book reinforce producing under the so-called ”instinct”. So what defines men or women is but what they become/told to be (De Bouvoire). Men, as he assumes, are ”instinctively” lazy ungrateful and bossy creatures, while women are hard-worker weak and follower creatures. However, both of them are justifiably extremely insecure, which is the second assumption. The third assumption is what he proposes as the default dynamic of the relationship; the I-don’t-work-I’m-a-princess kind of a woman under the custody of the changing temper of the ”knight in shining armor” kind of a man. Although I found a few relatable situations (that’s why the one-star), his advice on how to react is trivially ineffective. His solutions offer a short term bandage to the long-lived wounds and distorted identities. He barely touched on a great practice--for past wounds that emerge from contacting ”other” people be this a lover or a friend-- loving one’s self. Lastly, this book is unnecessarily lengthy; all notions can perfectly be summarized in a few pages. I don't recommend it."

Now that i've read it, i'm glad i did, because it contains a lot of interesting informations; i found some very useful and others i couldn't quite relate to. When i was reading the book, i felt that i was going to learn a lot of new facts about the opposite sex; men, but i ended up learning more about my own sex, women! And this made me like the book even more. The whole process of reading this book felt like being in seminar which is a good thing, i guess. I also recommend this book for all the married couple or the ones who are about to marry, because the book discusses mainly how couples can succeed in a relationship. "

215,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116681380-comethruchapters,4," The rating for this book is 4/5 I enjoyed reading this book throughout. This typical genre is not something I usually read. This book is well explained in balanced structures and forms.  the things I learnt from this book I've come to an understanding that  maintaining a relationship is difficult  with the amount of exposure available. The development of each individual takes place at their own pace. Love gets complicated with time while maintaining a good balance between the relationships that individuals possess. Day to day the communication becomes difficult due to the rise of pressure from the external environment. Communication appears to be an easy task with a stranger. The moment of connection with the individual there is a rise of expectation that always contains ups and downs in the relationship. Uniquely, Men and women are from two different planets as they work differently. The importance of acceptance plays an important role as it involves being patient, loving, and learning. With these factors. Humans learn to accept each other. There are differences in the needs and wants that make the opposite sex work towards the satisfaction of their relationship leading to a happier outcome. 
 The power of listening and talking 
 is one of the best part i have read in this book. I've come to an understanding that the need for others to be heard and not wanting to get interrupted. The problem fixers or giving any advice may be a form of perceived love but, all they are looking forward to us release their tensions by communicating. The very moment I completed this book. The first thing that occurred in my mind was: the term Evolution. We, humans, have evolved over thousands of years yet, the evolution seems to appear in this current time in a different form that is the method of love and communication that brings a big change in life matters. It is very steady with development as humans take forms into. Martian and Venusian belonging to different worlds share a complex relationship. image:  The communication differences that occur between Men and Women are:- 1. Think2. Feel3. Perceive4. React5. Respond6. Love7. Need8. Appreciate.In this book, I felt that John Gray has made most of the explanations just from a Men's point of view. He has portrayed the situation where women are expected to deal with the circumstances while applying the formulas to form better communication between the two. The women in this book appear to be needy compared to men while the fact that it is a book to maintain a good relationship understanding the differences that part them. Most of the parts teach women how to deal with the situations rather than explaining to both the genders. There is something tricky about the three-step method for seeking help from the partner. It involves a few mind games which have been encouraged in this book. He goes into a cave... She waitsShe goes into her wave..... He has difficulties to deal withHe wants to get close but, she isn't in the right space. So, he pushes her awayShe wants to get close, He holds resentment and pushes her further away. She puts her emotions away while trying to make her partner happier.She has to open up to make him understand how she feels so avoid getting in heat,He won't open up to her as he chooses to deal with the problems alone.  This gave me a weird insight. Why are only men portrayed in this way? I am sure the readers right now must know the women who can battle the world.  The writing style is well understood which makes this book read easily. It is a quick read and well-defined book. I will suggest this book as it helps to develop communication not only for the couples but, it will surely help in the coming future."
216,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! Women are not nags constantly whinging for shsh, but, use talk to share their emotions; and men are not useless jerks, but, are emotionally more introverted and dislike being controlled. That's it. There: I have just done you a favour, I summed this all up so you don't have to go through its 300+ pages. Addressing a wide audience, I could have forgiven John Gray for his simplicities; especially since, it's true, many will recognise themselves in some of the situations he describes. But considering it's a book the author himself, in a massive display of amazing humility and modesty, claims to be 'revolutionary for couples' (nothing less!) all this useless chit chat (and irritating narcissism) ends up by being frankly annoying. There's a few pearls of wisdom here and there (eg. guys, when your wife complains about anything and everything TO you it doesn't mean she is complaining ABOUT you...) but, all in all, it's below basic. Coming from a therapist with more than twenty years of experience, this is highly disappointing. Don't believe the hype on that one. Stay clear. "

219,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3262810-anya,1,"Utter tripe! That anyone could rate this book higher than a 1-star is beyond me: if I could give it less I gladly would! The book is inherently sexist: both towards men and women. A detailed list of all the possible stereotypes of the genders, Gray paints women as demanding, illogical little housewives who seek nothing more than to be cherished by their men and their girlfriends, and men as unemotional, mechanic creatures who struggle to display their emotions for fear they should be considered as incapable to their mates.The main moral of the book seems to be that there is no such thing as human, because of course we aren't individuals who all differ from eachother regardless of our gender, we are in fact neatly divided into ""Martians"" and ""Venusians"", and we all behave in this way! And if we don't? Gray helpfully tells us that it's normal for there to be a role reversal, and that's just us denying our true genders!Unfortunately it was difficult for me to continue reading after the first few chapters and I decided to stop for fear of exploding with rage, but here's a choice quote to give you an idea of the book's contents:""It is a mistake to expect a man to always be in touch with his loving feelings just as it is a mistake to expect a woman's feelings to always be rational and logical."""
220,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048714-i-n,1,"If I could give this book negative stars I would. I do not care for pop psychology. I do not care for gender roles and stereotypes. This books talks about ignorant and prejudiced human creations advertised as biological truths by many ridiculous societies. These ideas have NO real solid basis and would not even exist if (highly challenged)societies (that tolerate books like this one!) did not keep NURTURING, brainwashing and programming their men and women to assume these dumb positions (again with books like this one!). Human beings are WAY more complex than this book attempts to imply. We each have different temperaments, different experiences, different ways we are apt to react, understand and behave in various situations. As individual PEOPLE! Not as women or men. I did not like this book at all! Yes, there may be a few biological differences between men and women. But we are spiritual beings FIRST before physical beings-and even at that-only to an extent. A soul is a soul-there is no male or female on a spiritual plane. No to this book. No. No. NO!"
221,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18268555-awesomov,1,"Talk about something counterproductive. This book does the exact opposite of what it set out to do more than anything.Here, I'll give some practical advice; you don't need a psychologist for this. Talk to your significant other. Learn about them through that method. You can learn a lot about someone through that method.Another piece of practical advice: stop treating relationships as if they're games. the less straightforward you are, the more you unnecessarily complicate a relationship. If you're straight to the point, there's no bumbling around trying to figure anything out, at least not nearly as much as before.These are just a couple of basics. Books like these only seek to further diminish the intellect of the populace and, sometimes inadvertently, gain control of society, directing the courses of people's lives regardless of whether it benefits them or not; it sure benefits the author of the book. Once we rise above the kind of thinking exhibited in books like this, we can break the shackles holding gender inequality in place and live with each other in harmony."

Umm, what about women who prefer going to their “caves” or “wells” or whatever? Or men who want to talk? Oh yes, in that case a woman must perhaps reconsider her feminine qualities and tone down her masculine side and vice versa in case of a man.Excuse me while I scream for a second, not a second long lest it comes across that I have fallen down my womanly well. Perhaps I have, so this means I will come out of the well eventually, much like a man from his cave...I thought men and women were supposed to be different? Sounds like they’re actually similar?Women also apparently don’t like it when they’re offered solutions. As a hijab-wearing Muslim woman of almost three decades, I don’t know if my opinion matters over Gray’s (a much older and perhaps wiser? white male) when I say that women all around me offer solutions to my “problems” and I am filled with love towards them — 99 out of a 100 times. Yes, we are the “home improvement committee”, but what of my uncle (a much older, Pakistani man) who offers me with glee the different ways I can “improve” the decor or ambience or broken-ness of my room. Individual human differences exist and they are crucial to not discount when it comes to painting an entire sex with the same brush stroke — more so in 2020 than ever before.I am filled with rage when I think of how many men and women perhaps use the “differences” discussed in this book as an excuse to not work on themselves, to be the best version of themselves. I will speak only for women when I say, it is not okay for you to displace your anxieties and worries and problems and expect your “partner” to make you feel whole when you place all of your burdens on this one person’s shoulder and expect them to be your hero. Only you can rescue yourself. Learn to emotionally regulate yourself. Self-soothing is a thing. Apparently as women from Venus, we are also by default experts in psychology according to Gray, so let’s really practice what we apparently preach as “unsolicited advice and criticism”.If you’re a man who is looking for the “wisdom” offered in this book, I would highly recommend you take it with a pinch...no, a giant heapful of salt, and learn to trust and build better communication skills with the woman you’re interested in.

239,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57524832-nora-berzawy,1,"This book fails to guide through relationships because of numerous assumptions that the whole book was based on. First of all, this book assumes, literally, an out-of-planet nature of the opposite sexes, which I don't agree with since there are no inherited behavioral patterns that define sexes but rather a societal stereotypes that this book reinforce producing under the so-called ”instinct”. So what defines men or women is but what they become/told to be (De Bouvoire). Men, as he assumes, are ”instinctively” lazy ungrateful and bossy creatures, while women are hard-worker weak and follower creatures. However, both of them are justifiably extremely insecure, which is the second assumption. The third assumption is what he proposes as the default dynamic of the relationship; the I-don’t-work-I’m-a-princess kind of a woman under the custody of the changing temper of the ”knight in shining armor” kind of a man. Although I found a few relatable situations (that’s why the one-star), his advice on how to react is trivially ineffective. His solutions offer a short term bandage to the long-lived wounds and distorted identities. He barely touched on a great practice--for past wounds that emerge from contacting ”other” people be this a lover or a friend-- loving one’s self.

And this made me like the book even more. The whole process of reading this book felt like being in seminar which is a good thing, i guess.

245,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116681380-comethruchapters,4," The rating for this book is 4/5 I enjoyed reading this book throughout. This typical genre is not something I usually read. This book is well explained in balanced structures and forms.  the things I learnt from this book I've come to an understanding that  maintaining a relationship is difficult  with the amount of exposure available. The development of each individual takes place at their own pace. Love gets complicated with time while maintaining a good balance between the relationships that individuals possess. Day to day the communication becomes difficult due to the rise of pressure from the external environment. Communication appears to be an easy task with a stranger. The moment of connection with the individual there is a rise of expectation that always contains ups and downs in the relationship. Uniquely, Men and women are from two different planets as they work differently. The importance of acceptance plays an important role as it involves being patient, loving, and learning. With these factors. Humans learn to accept each other. There are differences in the needs and wants that make the opposite sex work towards the satisfaction of their relationship leading to a happier outcome. 
 The power of listening and talking 
 is one of the best part i have read in this book. I've come to an understanding that the need for others to be heard and not wanting to get interrupted. The problem fixers or giving any advice may be a form of perceived love but, all they are looking forward to us release their tensions by communicating. The very moment I completed this book. The first thing that occurred in my mind was: the term Evolution. We, humans, have evolved over thousands of years yet, the evolution seems to appear in this current time in a different form that is the method of love and communication that brings a big change in life matters. It is very steady with development as humans take forms into. Martian and Venusian belonging to different worlds share a complex relationship. image:  The communication differences that occur between Men and Women are:- 1. Think2. Feel3. Perceive4. React5. Respond6. Love7. Need8. Appreciate.In this book, I felt that John Gray has made most of the explanations just from a Men's point of view. He has portrayed the situation where women are expected to deal with the circumstances while applying the formulas to form better communication between the two. The women in this book appear to be needy compared to men while the fact that it is a book to maintain a good relationship understanding the differences that part them. Most of the parts teach women how to deal with the situations rather than explaining to both the genders. There is something tricky about the three-step method for seeking help from the partner. It involves a few mind games which have been encouraged in this book. He goes into a cave... She waitsShe goes into her wave..... He has difficulties to deal withHe wants to get close but, she isn't in the right space. So, he pushes her awayShe wants to get close, He holds resentment and pushes her further away. She puts her emotions away while trying to make her partner happier.She has to open up to make him understand how she feels so avoid getting in heat,He won't open up to her as he chooses to deal with the problems alone.  This gave me a weird insight. Why are only men portrayed in this way? I am sure the readers right now must know the women who can battle the world.  The writing style is well understood which makes this book read easily. It is a quick read and well-defined book. I will suggest this book as it helps to develop communication not only for the couples but, it will surely help in the coming future."
246,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! Women are not nags constantly whinging for shsh, but, use talk to share their emotions; and men are not useless jerks, but, are emotionally more introverted and dislike being controlled. That's it. There: I have just done you a favour, I summed this all up so you don't have to go through its 300+ pages. Addressing a wide audience, I could have forgiven John Gray for his simplicities; especially since, it's true, many will recognise themselves in some of the situations he describes. But considering it's a book the author himself, in a massive display of amazing humility and modesty, claims to be 'revolutionary for couples' (nothing less!) all this useless chit chat (and irritating narcissism) ends up by being frankly annoying. There's a few pearls of wisdom here and there (eg. guys, when your wife complains about anything and everything TO you it doesn't mean she is complaining ABOUT you...) but, all in all, it's below basic. Coming from a therapist with more than twenty years of experience, this is highly disappointing. Don't believe the hype on that one. Stay clear. "

249,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3262810-anya,1,"Utter tripe! That anyone could rate this book higher than a 1-star is beyond me: if I could give it less I gladly would! The book is inherently sexist: both towards men and women. A detailed list of all the possible stereotypes of the genders, Gray paints women as demanding, illogical little housewives who seek nothing more than to be cherished by their men and their girlfriends, and men as unemotional, mechanic creatures who struggle to display their emotions for fear they should be considered as incapable to their mates.The main moral of the book seems to be that there is no such thing as human, because of course we aren't individuals who all differ from eachother regardless of our gender, we are in fact neatly divided into ""Martians"" and ""Venusians"", and we all behave in this way! And if we don't? Gray helpfully tells us that it's normal for there to be a role reversal, and that's just us denying our true genders!Unfortunately it was difficult for me to continue reading after the first few chapters and I decided to stop for fear of exploding with rage, but here's a choice quote to give you an idea of the book's contents:""It is a mistake to expect a man to always be in touch with his loving feelings just as it is a mistake to expect a woman's feelings to always be rational and logical."""
250,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048714-i-n,1,"If I could give this book negative stars I would. I do not care for pop psychology. I do not care for gender roles and stereotypes. This books talks about ignorant and prejudiced human creations advertised as biological truths by many ridiculous societies. These ideas have NO real solid basis and would not even exist if (highly challenged)societies (that tolerate books like this one!) did not keep NURTURING, brainwashing and programming their men and women to assume these dumb positions (again with books like this one!). Human beings are WAY more complex than this book attempts to imply. We each have different temperaments, different experiences, different ways we are apt to react, understand and behave in various situations. As individual PEOPLE! Not as women or men. I did not like this book at all! Yes, there may be a few biological differences between men and women. But we are spiritual beings FIRST before physical beings-and even at that-only to an extent. A soul is a soul-there is no male or female on a spiritual plane. No to this book. No. No. NO!"
251,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18268555-awesomov,1,"Talk about something counterproductive. This book does the exact opposite of what it set out to do more than anything.Here, I'll give some practical advice; you don't need a psychologist for this. Talk to your significant other. Learn about them through that method. You can learn a lot about someone through that method.Another piece of practical advice: stop treating relationships as if they're games. the less straightforward you are, the more you unnecessarily complicate a relationship. If you're straight to the point, there's no bumbling around trying to figure anything out, at least not nearly as much as before.These are just a couple of basics. Books like these only seek to further diminish the intellect of the populace and, sometimes inadvertently, gain control of society, directing the courses of people's lives regardless of whether it benefits them or not; it sure benefits the author of the book. Once we rise above the kind of thinking exhibited in books like this, we can break the shackles holding gender inequality in place and live with each other in harmony."

A woman's role is to be respectful and deferential to her man. Yeah. sure.Men just need to be appreciated and trusted. Ok. Whatever.And he definitely enjoys repetition. Especially of the points above.But wait... there's a but.If you read this book expecting the above, then you can take away the real message. It's all about communications. Verbal and otherwise. I'm reading this book as a guide for introspection. Especially at this point in time.... Had I read this book a while ago, would things have been different? Had my partner read it? Reading the book definitely makes me ask those questions, but not with an expectation of changing the past, but rather in order to extrapolate on the future.""Donkey's are so much smarter than humans - they never fall in the same ditch twice..."" - I'm trying to learn from the donkeys."

But there are few exceptions and definitely, this book is one of them.The title of the book itself is a stereotypical, wrong assumption which serves as a provenance for a great deal of relationship issues. While I agree that stereotypes exist for a reason, they don't exist forever and what was applicable for the majority of population in the past may or may not be now. I know this book still might be useful to few young people (I also read it when I was younger and naive), however, I strongly believe such compromising relationships are toxic and immature; & should be done away with. There is only one secret to get into and continue through a successful relationship and that is - to talk; the ability to communicate one's desires and perils to the partner. Or maybe read Franklin Veaux. He is a great guy.You can just skip reading this book."

Offer to build a fire in the wintertime (because we all have fireplaces)24. Give her four hugs a day (no more, no less)28. If she washes your socks, turn your socks right side out so she doesn't have to (how sweet; a lot of the things on the list assumed the woman does all the housework)40. When holding hands don't let your hand go limp (I make fun of this but perhaps a limp hand is better than recent ex-boyfriend who would just let go of my hand saying he didn't like PDA)63. Offer to sharpen her knives in the kitchen (pretty sure this is why all my past relationships have failed; no one has ever offered to sharpen my knives)64.

I picked this one up one time out of curiosity, and to my surprise a lot of the chapters bring up excellent points. A bit of it is hit and miss and based on your perspective and to be taken with a grain of salt. Still, the chapters telling the differences between men and their silent phases, women needing to talk a lot on an emotional level, and arguments that arise and reasons behind them make a lot of sense. I saw signs of this in every relationship I've been in, and continue to see it when friends come to me with relationship troubles. Worth a read for sure."

I have two personal takeaways from this: 1. I'm normal and not batshit crazy. 2. ""Drama/Insecurity"" is normal especially when the relationship is new. All our hurts and suppressed feelings come up not because we're haunted, but we trust out partner to help us heal from it. Sure some might find this cheesy/corny, but it's a good listen/resource.

I also recommend this book for all the married couple or the ones who are about to marry, because the book discusses mainly how couples can succeed in a relationship. "

I knew I should've finished reading the title before buying the book. It's really just a very trite relationship that offers one bit of good advice: Quit being such a self absorbed jerkass and pay attention.Though this does offer a description of a female planet covered in malls. Seriously."
272,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13327543-doha-osman,3,"The book can be summed up into two main ideas: A man needs to feel accepted for the person he is, appreciated and needed. While a woman needs someone to listen attentively, to understand and to give the desired support. The book contains good ideas but they're so repetitve."
273,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1918270-dina,1,"Completely useless - at least, to me. Following the title's lead: not all men are from Mars and not all women are from Venus, and typecasting is dangerous and unproductive."

275,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116681380-comethruchapters,4," The rating for this book is 4/5 I enjoyed reading this book throughout. This typical genre is not something I usually read. This book is well explained in balanced structures and forms.  the things I learnt from this book I've come to an understanding that  maintaining a relationship is difficult  with the amount of exposure available. The development of each individual takes place at their own pace. Love gets complicated with time while maintaining a good balance between the relationships that individuals possess. Day to day the communication becomes difficult due to the rise of pressure from the external environment. Communication appears to be an easy task with a stranger. The moment of connection with the individual there is a rise of expectation that always contains ups and downs in the relationship. Uniquely, Men and women are from two different planets as they work differently. The importance of acceptance plays an important role as it involves being patient, loving, and learning. With these factors. Humans learn to accept each other. There are differences in the needs and wants that make the opposite sex work towards the satisfaction of their relationship leading to a happier outcome. 
 The power of listening and talking 
 is one of the best part i have read in this book. I've come to an understanding that the need for others to be heard and not wanting to get interrupted. The problem fixers or giving any advice may be a form of perceived love but, all they are looking forward to us release their tensions by communicating. The very moment I completed this book. The first thing that occurred in my mind was: the term Evolution. We, humans, have evolved over thousands of years yet, the evolution seems to appear in this current time in a different form that is the method of love and communication that brings a big change in life matters. It is very steady with development as humans take forms into. Martian and Venusian belonging to different worlds share a complex relationship. image:  The communication differences that occur between Men and Women are:- 1. Think2. Feel3. Perceive4. React5. Respond6. Love7. Need8. Appreciate.In this book, I felt that John Gray has made most of the explanations just from a Men's point of view. He has portrayed the situation where women are expected to deal with the circumstances while applying the formulas to form better communication between the two. The women in this book appear to be needy compared to men while the fact that it is a book to maintain a good relationship understanding the differences that part them. Most of the parts teach women how to deal with the situations rather than explaining to both the genders. There is something tricky about the three-step method for seeking help from the partner. It involves a few mind games which have been encouraged in this book. He goes into a cave... She waitsShe goes into her wave..... He has difficulties to deal withHe wants to get close but, she isn't in the right space. So, he pushes her awayShe wants to get close, He holds resentment and pushes her further away. She puts her emotions away while trying to make her partner happier.She has to open up to make him understand how she feels so avoid getting in heat,He won't open up to her as he chooses to deal with the problems alone.  This gave me a weird insight. Why are only men portrayed in this way? I am sure the readers right now must know the women who can battle the world.  The writing style is well understood which makes this book read easily. It is a quick read and well-defined book. I will suggest this book as it helps to develop communication not only for the couples but, it will surely help in the coming future."
276,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,1,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! Women are not nags constantly whinging for shsh, but, use talk to share their emotions; and men are not useless jerks, but, are emotionally more introverted and dislike being controlled. That's it. There: I have just done you a favour, I summed this all up so you don't have to go through its 300+ pages. Addressing a wide audience, I could have forgiven John Gray for his simplicities; especially since, it's true, many will recognise themselves in some of the situations he describes. But considering it's a book the author himself, in a massive display of amazing humility and modesty, claims to be 'revolutionary for couples' (nothing less!) all this useless chit chat (and irritating narcissism) ends up by being frankly annoying. There's a few pearls of wisdom here and there (eg. guys, when your wife complains about anything and everything TO you it doesn't mean she is complaining ABOUT you...) but, all in all, it's below basic. Coming from a therapist with more than twenty years of experience, this is highly disappointing. Don't believe the hype on that one. Stay clear. "

279,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3262810-anya,1,"Utter tripe! That anyone could rate this book higher than a 1-star is beyond me: if I could give it less I gladly would! The book is inherently sexist: both towards men and women. A detailed list of all the possible stereotypes of the genders, Gray paints women as demanding, illogical little housewives who seek nothing more than to be cherished by their men and their girlfriends, and men as unemotional, mechanic creatures who struggle to display their emotions for fear they should be considered as incapable to their mates.The main moral of the book seems to be that there is no such thing as human, because of course we aren't individuals who all differ from eachother regardless of our gender, we are in fact neatly divided into ""Martians"" and ""Venusians"", and we all behave in this way! And if we don't? Gray helpfully tells us that it's normal for there to be a role reversal, and that's just us denying our true genders!Unfortunately it was difficult for me to continue reading after the first few chapters and I decided to stop for fear of exploding with rage, but here's a choice quote to give you an idea of the book's contents:""It is a mistake to expect a man to always be in touch with his loving feelings just as it is a mistake to expect a woman's feelings to always be rational and logical."""
280,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048714-i-n,1,"If I could give this book negative stars I would. I do not care for pop psychology. I do not care for gender roles and stereotypes. This books talks about ignorant and prejudiced human creations advertised as biological truths by many ridiculous societies. These ideas have NO real solid basis and would not even exist if (highly challenged)societies (that tolerate books like this one!) did not keep NURTURING, brainwashing and programming their men and women to assume these dumb positions (again with books like this one!). Human beings are WAY more complex than this book attempts to imply. We each have different temperaments, different experiences, different ways we are apt to react, understand and behave in various situations. As individual PEOPLE! Not as women or men. I did not like this book at all! Yes, there may be a few biological differences between men and women. But we are spiritual beings FIRST before physical beings-and even at that-only to an extent. A soul is a soul-there is no male or female on a spiritual plane. No to this book. No. No. NO!"
281,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18268555-awesomov,1,"Talk about something counterproductive. This book does the exact opposite of what it set out to do more than anything.Here, I'll give some practical advice; you don't need a psychologist for this. Talk to your significant other. Learn about them through that method. You can learn a lot about someone through that method.Another piece of practical advice: stop treating relationships as if they're games. the less straightforward you are, the more you unnecessarily complicate a relationship. If you're straight to the point, there's no bumbling around trying to figure anything out, at least not nearly as much as before.These are just a couple of basics. Books like these only seek to further diminish the intellect of the populace and, sometimes inadvertently, gain control of society, directing the courses of people's lives regardless of whether it benefits them or not; it sure benefits the author of the book. Once we rise above the kind of thinking exhibited in books like this, we can break the shackles holding gender inequality in place and live with each other in harmony."

A woman's role is to be respectful and deferential to her man. Yeah. sure.Men just need to be appreciated and trusted. Ok. Whatever.And he definitely enjoys repetition. Especially of the points above.But wait... there's a but.If you read this book expecting the above, then you can take away the real message. It's all about communications. Verbal and otherwise. I'm reading this book as a guide for introspection. Especially at this point in time.... Had I read this book a while ago, would things have been different? Had my partner read it? Reading the book definitely makes me ask those questions, but not with an expectation of changing the past, but rather in order to extrapolate on the future.""Donkey's are so much smarter than humans - they never fall in the same ditch twice..."" - I'm trying to learn from the donkeys."

But there are few exceptions and definitely, this book is one of them.The title of the book itself is a stereotypical, wrong assumption which serves as a provenance for a great deal of relationship issues. While I agree that stereotypes exist for a reason, they don't exist forever and what was applicable for the majority of population in the past may or may not be now. I know this book still might be useful to few young people (I also read it when I was younger and naive), however, I strongly believe such compromising relationships are toxic and immature; & should be done away with. There is only one secret to get into and continue through a successful relationship and that is - to talk; the ability to communicate one's desires and perils to the partner. Or maybe read Franklin Veaux. He is a great guy.You can just skip reading this book."

Offer to build a fire in the wintertime (because we all have fireplaces)24. Give her four hugs a day (no more, no less)28. If she washes your socks, turn your socks right side out so she doesn't have to (how sweet; a lot of the things on the list assumed the woman does all the housework)40. When holding hands don't let your hand go limp (I make fun of this but perhaps a limp hand is better than recent ex-boyfriend who would just let go of my hand saying he didn't like PDA)63. Offer to sharpen her knives in the kitchen (pretty sure this is why all my past relationships have failed; no one has ever offered to sharpen my knives)64.

I picked this one up one time out of curiosity, and to my surprise a lot of the chapters bring up excellent points. A bit of it is hit and miss and based on your perspective and to be taken with a grain of salt. Still, the chapters telling the differences between men and their silent phases, women needing to talk a lot on an emotional level, and arguments that arise and reasons behind them make a lot of sense. I saw signs of this in every relationship I've been in, and continue to see it when friends come to me with relationship troubles. Worth a read for sure."

After watching his Ted Talks I got curious enough to check it out.Like most self-help guides a lot of these are common sense. It's a matter of application and putting things in perspective. I have two personal takeaways from this: 1. I'm normal and not batshit crazy. 2. ""Drama/Insecurity"" is normal especially when the relationship is new. All our hurts and suppressed feelings come up not because we're haunted, but we trust out partner to help us heal from it. Sure some might find this cheesy/corny, but it's a good listen/resource. Not sorry I gave this a shot."

The ""men"" in this book are absolute douche bags and I, thankfully, did not recognize my husband one bit. John Gray obviously thinks men should be allowed to do what they wish and women should be subservient and passive. Fuck that shit. If you are a man or woman that truly sees themselves in the stereotypes detailed here, seriously consider your own behaviors as you might be an asshole or doormat."

Sure, in the confignments of gender streotypes, this CAN be good advice, but it is also inherently sexist to think that ""this is how men just ARE and this is how women can learn how to deal with it"". Lets try to think outside of the box of gender stereotypes... Take this book with a grain of salt. "

This book helps us understand our differences and guide us by showing the way to handle it. It is easy to read it but it takes a lot of effort from both end to bring this to reality.

298,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26810469-sanaa-hyder,1,"I read a small percentage of this book but it was enough to help me form my opinion.According to Gray, men go into their caves and women want to talk when problems arise. Umm, what about women who prefer going to their “caves” or “wells” or whatever? Or men who want to talk? Oh yes, in that case a woman must perhaps reconsider her feminine qualities and tone down her masculine side and vice versa in case of a man.Excuse me while I scream for a second, not a second long lest it comes across that I have fallen down my womanly well. Perhaps I have, so this means I will come out of the well eventually, much like a man from his cave...I thought men and women were supposed to be different? Sounds like they’re actually similar?Women also apparently don’t like it when they’re offered solutions. As a hijab-wearing Muslim woman of almost three decades, I don’t know if my opinion matters over Gray’s (a much older and perhaps wiser? white male) when I say that women all around me offer solutions to my “problems” and I am filled with love towards them — 99 out of a 100 times. Yes, we are the “home improvement committee”, but what of my uncle (a much older, Pakistani man) who offers me with glee the different ways I can “improve” the decor or ambience or broken-ness of my room. Individual human differences exist and they are crucial to not discount when it comes to painting an entire sex with the same brush stroke — more so in 2020 than ever before.I am filled with rage when I think of how many men and women perhaps use the “differences” discussed in this book as an excuse to not work on themselves, to be the best version of themselves. I will speak only for women when I say, it is not okay for you to displace your anxieties and worries and problems and expect your “partner” to make you feel whole when you place all of your burdens on this one person’s shoulder and expect them to be your hero. Only you can rescue yourself. Learn to emotionally regulate yourself. Self-soothing is a thing. Apparently as women from Venus, we are also by default experts in psychology according to Gray, so let’s really practice what we apparently preach as “unsolicited advice and criticism”.If you’re a man who is looking for the “wisdom” offered in this book, I would highly recommend you take it with a pinch...no, a giant heapful of salt, and learn to trust and build better communication skills with the woman you’re interested in. We are all different, and we need to talk to each other instead of bringing out the worst in each other, and expecting the other to just “understand” our differences."
299,0060574216,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57524832-nora-berzawy,1,"This book fails to guide through relationships because of numerous assumptions that the whole book was based on. First of all, this book assumes, literally, an out-of-planet nature of the opposite sexes, which I don't agree with since there are no inherited behavioral patterns that define sexes but rather a societal stereotypes that this book reinforce producing under the so-called ”instinct”. So what defines men or women is but what they become/told to be (De Bouvoire). Men, as he assumes, are ”instinctively” lazy ungrateful and bossy creatures, while women are hard-worker weak and follower creatures. However, both of them are justifiably extremely insecure, which is the second assumption. The third assumption is what he proposes as the default dynamic of the relationship; the I-don’t-work-I’m-a-princess kind of a woman under the custody of the changing temper of the ”knight in shining armor” kind of a man. Although I found a few relatable situations (that’s why the one-star), his advice on how to react is trivially ineffective. His solutions offer a short term bandage to the long-lived wounds and distorted identities. He barely touched on a great practice--for past wounds that emerge from contacting ”other” people be this a lover or a friend-- loving one’s self. Lastly, this book is unnecessarily lengthy; all notions can perfectly be summarized in a few pages. I don't recommend it."
