0,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,3,"I'm a fan of Dawkins' work both in biology and skepticism, so take my praise and criticism with that calibrating qualification. I've read, I think, five of his books. I did not like this one quite as much as The Ancestor's Tale. While I agreed with the premise and theory proposed, sometimes his style of writing got in the way. Normally, I like analogies and metaphors to help explain complex ideas, but in this case I think he went too far in that direction, at least in the first half of the book. Although he was careful to use quote marks when attributing 'feelings' to genes such as 'wanting' or 'trying' to do this or that, I still felt that it muddled the message. I think he could have found a better stylistic method to get his points across. I also felt he could have done a better job of explaining how genes, proteins and enzymes create different cell types. His description was a bit vague for my layman's ears, and other authors have done better.Although he appears to want to totally rule out the possibility of group selection, I think there is still room for that possibility in some circumstances, particularly in small, cohesive groups, bands or tribes of humans; i.e., hunter-gatherers. He suggests that free-loaders, cheaters and selfish individuals would eventually invade and take over altruistic groups. I don't think this is what actually happens. I think such individuals would be banished, ostracized and thus their survival and reproductive opportunities would be limited. Such groups use taboos and tribal religions to minimize free-loading. And although I can't lay my hands on it at the moment, there was a recent research paper about group selection in microorganisms. Given that this book is more than 30 years old, it's possible that Dawkins' own views may have changed ever so slightly.It is unfair to criticize a book of this age for ideas that have subsequently proven to be false, or most likely so. For example he describes surplus (junk) DNA as “a parasite, or at best a harmless but useless passenger...”. New research is suggesting that there may be no such thing as junk DNA, and it may have purposes we have yet to fully understand. Similarly, I wonder what changes he might make to a new edition in light of the recent “Epigenetics Revolution”. One of my favorite passages of the book is when he asks “...will there be any principle that is true of all life? Obviously I do not know but, if I had to bet, I would put my money on one fundamental principle. This is the law that all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities.” And I loved when he says that “...Darwinism is too big a theory to be confined to the narrow context of the gene.” And he shows how it applies in his new (at that time) concept of memes, that can be used to help explain the evolution of languages, religions and other facets of human culture.My criticisms should be taken in the context of 'friend' and admirer of Dawkins who wants him to keep on writing and making his ideas as clear as possible to people like me who aren't near as bright as he is. This was and still is an important, classic work."

Because really, that's why we're here. ;)Overall, I thought that this was really interesting. I like Dawkins already after listening to The God Delusion (although I liked that one much more than this one). I think The Selfish Gene is intriguing and plausible and actually makes a lot of sense. It was really interesting to learn about the different possibilities for design and evolution, and to see the cause and effect of different variations of a gene. I liked the risk and reward concept as well... It all makes a lot of sense to think of things in this kind of philosophical way -- Everything we are and will be is a carefully honed creation of time and trial and error and cause and effect. It kinda makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Where this one fell a little flat was in the reading and the very last quarter of the book. The reading was pretty good. I'd give it a B- overall. Lalla Ward and Richard Dawkins alternate reading this one, and mostly do a good job with the tone and pacing and all that. But there are times when it was just plain distracting, too. Lalla Ward speaks very proper British, e-nun-cee-a-ting her words and speaking very crisply and clearly, almost to the detriment of what she's actually saying, when all I can focus on is her pronunciation. Even when it's not WAY strange pronunciations like ""hah-reem"" instead of ""hare-em"" for ""harem"", her pronunciation just gets in the way, and at times just sounds a little school teacherish. Richard read all his own end notes immediately after the section in which they pertained, and sometimes he sounded almost bored and sad. And other times he sounded very pompous and critical of others. At one point in an end note, he went on a little tirade about computer programmers creating computer viruses, which has nothing at all to do with the point of this book. Which brings me to the last quarter of the book, in which he goes off on a statistical and odds game ramble for AGES. Explaining different types of betting and games of chance, and possible outcomes and options depending on whether one plays this way or that way... Sort of relevant to genes, but not really new, in that he'd already illustrated the odds and possible outcomes of genes ending up one way or another, and the cooperation of genes with another to improve odds or to effect a desired outcome, etc. Kinda glazed my eyes over a bit in this section because it was just a rehash of information already provided, and in a much less relevant and interesting (to me) way. Overall, I enjoyed this one. I feel like I learned something, and that's why I read it. Could have been a bit better in the execution department, but I can't complain too much. You may resume swooning now. :D"
2,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"The Selfish Gene was an interesting, informative, and thought-provoking read. I appreciated Dawkins’s organization and the logical flow of the book. At times, my admittedly overenthusiastic highlighting led to this manner of silliness:Also, the chapter on nice guys finishing first was definitely my favorite, and it has whet my appetite for exploring the fascinating realm of game theory. Overall, Dawkins generally strikes a decent balance between intelligent, thorough scientific analysis and accessibility. This is hard to do, and he does err on the side of caution/accessibility rather more than I’d prefer. This strategy is of course good for reaching a larger reading audience, but it is also a limiting factor on amount of detail/complexity/rigor that can be presented. That is the reason I don’t generally go in for “pop science” type books, but I knew what this was before I started reading it, and thus can’t fault Dawkins for it. Indeed he himself warns the reader about this tendency in ample detail in the introductory material.Bottom line: this is the best book by Dawkins I've read so far, and I highly recommend it!"
3,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"There's a point in this book where Dawkins tells the story of how, after publishing it, he received a letter from a man who said that this work has put him in depression. I can understand why. Although I see it as a brilliant work of science, I can't help but feel a little bit scared of the truth of it. Scared not in the sense of wishing it weren't true, but scared for understanding exactly how much of a nothing there exists before and after us, and how we are only vehicles for the tiny little replicators that form us head to toe. I am in awe at the writing, and in awe of science in general, be it that it's biology, physics, mathematics, astronomy, you name it, I am convinced that it and art are the only two beautiful truths that mankind will ever know. I can't wait to read some more on the subject, deepen my knowledge of genetics and its implications, and hopefully along the way read some more of Dawkins' works because they are crafted with the eye of a highly literate man."
4,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/605975-luke-baumgarten,5,"The book, ostensibly about how evolution acts primarily at the level of genes rather than organisms, is damn cool. Also, though, tacked into the back is the coining and brief explanation of the idea of memetics, applying a genetic evolutionary model to the way ideas disperse amongst cultural groups and become entrenched in the societal fabric. It's an utterly mindblowing epistemological theory that's totally changed the way I think about ... everything really ... and it's included almost as an afterthought. Shows you something of the fecundity of Dawkins' brain before he settled into his current dotardly atheistic obsession with faith-baiting. Ah well, got a couple good books out of him anyway."
5,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44824883-paul-e-morph,4,"Very interesting and very well written, this book kept me entirely engaged for about 90% of the time.This being the updated and extended anniversary edition, I have to say I could have done without all his snarky comments to people who have criticised the book in the intervening years. I’m sure it was very cathartic to write but to the reader it tends to come across as the academic equivalent of waggling your fingers in your ears and chanting ‘nur-nur-nee-nur-nur’."
6,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12369477-pratibha-suku,5,"Sheer Brilliance.Biology is a science which I consider keeps you in awe always and when one have someone explaining it in such a simple yet profound manner one can't help but fall in love with it, all over again and again.Like a Boss, Richard brings out the much evident yet largely ignored logic that leads to evolution over a course of time. He goes around in each life process to put froth the ""selfish"" nature of gene.  With a wonderful command on language he puts his idea, back them with suitable examples, analogies, do some maths and make you agree !!.Simple.eg-
""A gene that is ignored in this way is called recessive. The opposite of a recessive gene is a dominant gene"" ""rivals for the same slot on a chromosome, they are called alleles""

""Chromosomes too are shuffled into oblivion, like hands of cards soon after they are dealt. But the cards themselves survive the shuffling. The cards are the genes. The genes are not destroyed by crossing-over, they merely change partners and march on. Of course they march on. That is their business. They are the replicators and we are their survival machines. When we have served our purpose we are cast aside. But genes are denizens of geological time: genes are forever.""
A must read for anyone who wants to know/understand the biology of evolution without getting troubled by the technical jargon.Thanks Ganesh for recommending. :)"
7,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,1,"This damn book put me to sleep.Over-theorized. I am not in any way disputing the thesis; I find that which is stated so obvious and then he goes on and on and on theorizing it to pieces. The audiobook I read was an updated edition. It is narrated by the author and Laila Ward. Ward reads the original text of the book, and the author reads the copious notes modifying the original text. He further analyzes some points (into oblivion), disputes criticisms that have been made and makes corrections. When he disputes criticisms I was annoyed because it felt unfair that he continually got the last word. ..... I felt that he was full of himself.I am returning this book not yet having completed it. Half is enough to get the message."
8,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"A beautiful impressive masterwork!I love how it explains in simple terms, but built up to make complicated cases. I rather enjoyed endless ideas. Specially ""Meme"", which I was vaguely thinking before this book about similar idea, but it made it much much much more clear to me. I loved it and I even may spend my thesis on this idea if at all possible.I rather enjoyed the sidenotes on its 2nd edition. It was both informative and fun. I loved it and I strongly suggest it all strong minds."
9,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,1,"I have no choice but to update my review of this, once progressive, book. This was the 30th anniversary addition. Dawkins had a real chance here to help usher the theory of evolution into the 21st century but chose not to. There is no excuse for that. He is far more harmful to the progression of science now than he was every helpful in the past. He and all the other fossils need to have their theories in the rocks where they belong. Just this week, the Royal Society *finally* met to talk about updating the modern synthesis of evolution. Progress in this area has been so very slow, it's as if the neo-Darwinists are actually neo-creationists. They sound an awful lot like the creationists they fight against. Dawkins throws a tantrum anytime epigenetics is mentioned. It's not like we should let new evidence govern our decisions or anything..... Let's just stick with one book, no matter how old or outdated it might be. No I am not talking about the bible, I am talking about the Selfish Gene and the legacy of stubbornness and bullying it continues to leave in its wake. It's time to stop anchoring ourselves to such a narrow theory of evolution, and by extension evolutionary behavior, when myriad new and *solid* evidence keeps bombarding us. It's time to allow more progressive and more knowledgeable scientists to take the reigns. Instead, Dawkins spends his time bullying them, trying to ruin their careers by discrediting them, and continually seeking fame above truth. I have read every word of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species and autobiography. It seems very clear to me that Darwin would not simply dislike Dawkins, he would hold particular disdain for him. If Dawkins happened to be teaching a course Darwin was taking, Darwin would undoubtedly refuse to attend. He would protest Dawkins' outdated lectures and do everything he could to avoid such a dinosaur. He would instead sneak over to an epigenetics course, in which he was not enrolled, and take particular delight in the new ideas born out of the robust and exciting evidence that has been accumulated over the past 50 years. My original review:Dawkins is brilliant. No question. I would recommend this book, most because I think the theory is excellent and Dawkins explanation of so many things is spectacular. However, he is often far too self-congratulatory. Even worse, in the 30th anniversary edition he failed to take into account the new evidence from epigenetics (that actually does not necessarily have to destroy the selfish gene theory.) He is stuck in an outdated paradigm, which is a shame because he truly is a brilliant passionate, and insightful scientist. "
10,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"In my quest to read a bit more non-fiction, I think reading up on Dawkins is a wise choice. He claims to be aiming his books -- or at least this one -- at three audiences: the layman, the expert and the student. Well, I'm somewhere between layman and student, since I have a pretty good level of knowledge about the stuff, but I'm not formally learning it. The Selfish Gene was easy and even enjoyable to read, with things explained in as simple a way as possible, and sometimes formulated in a handful of ways or with several examples, to help expand on his point.The Selfish Gene has a lot of material in it that was already discussed in similar or identical terms in The Ancestor's Tale, but goes rather more into depth about it. The title is misleading, since Dawkins doesn't actually believe that genes are self-aware. His language isn't all that confusing, once you read past the title, though. He makes it fairly clear when his words should be taken as more metaphorical than accurate.I found his section on memes pretty interesting -- hadn't known that he'd coined the word. People misinterpret that section, too, suggesting that memes are self-aware and actually want to survive. He suggests something more along the lines of natural selection, making memes actually very similar to genes.I suppose I'd have to read around more in the field to know how much I agree with Dawkins. For someone with my level of knowledge, he gives a pretty clear and accurate argument -- but then, of course, I don't have the knowledge to dispute him."
11,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5565551-damien,4,"The Selfish Gene is certainly a fascinating book and I can understand why is it so widely regarded and discussed. I probably went into this book with slightly misjudged expectations, which is entirely my own fault, by expecting a study of the case for evolution - this I see Dawkins has more fully addressed in The Greatest Show on Earth. What we get in The Selfish Gene is a very focused discussion on why we, and indeed life in general, may act in altruistic ways. It's this single discussion that is so fully fleshed out in this book that gives birth to the theory of The Selfish Gene.Some have complained that The Selfish Gene theory de-humanises us and I can certainly see that point. In this theory, Dawkins proposes that the essential element of life - in fact the key metric for life - is the self-replicating gene. Once this is defined we then move on to the concept of replicators and vehicles. In this context humans, or any other complex life form, are not seen as the unit for propagation - instead we humans are merely vehicles for the ongoing propagation of the 'unit' of life, the gene. Based on the above context Dawkins then goes on, in considerable detail, to demonstrate that it is perfectly plausible for us as humans to act in an altruistic manner in the interest of maintaining the interest of the genes that we are mere vehicles for.The Selfish Gene is a thought provoking book that will leave you feeling a little more humble in the universe we inhabit."
12,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5813283-rohini,5,"Selfish gene is the story of evolution and animal behaviour written in an almost impeccable style by Dawkins through the language of genes. With advances in biology, we definitely need to employ this outlook towards understanding why and how does an organism evolve from a single celled free living entity to merged symbiotic establishments eventually giving rise to complex multicellular organisms. It is all the course of the 'selfish gene' trying to survive in this dynamic, highly selective world. In fact, every animal/plant behaviour can be reasoned out through their underlying genes. Dawkins' analogies are simply wonderful when he explains such a slow complex phenomenon of evolution. This book has definitely given me a different perspective in analysing and comprehending the link between species development and genes per se. A must-read for those who want to know the mystery of how and why many of us are here in this planet. All the world's a stage, And all the beings merely players- the story,however, is being directed and narrated by the Genes! "
13,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6787684-cory,1,"In the indispensable words of my university genetics professor, ""buy the book, read it, burn the book and then burn down the book story where you bought it. Dawkins write absolute rubbish that he uses neither for the betterment of science or humanity, but for his own personal vendetta against creationists and the church."" Great summary of the book. "
14,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12484910-charbel,4,"It's hard to argue with Dawkins especially since he has logic on his side. Evolution is one of my favourite subjects and so it's not a surprise that I enjoyed the chapters in this book. Some may argue that we, as a species, are not selfish. They may add that we build communities and societies thanks to our altruistic nature. The truth is, as Dwakins pointed out, that even our most selfless actions have selfish motives. We cooperate and live in communities because we figured out that living together is much more beneficial than living individually. If you want to follow more arguments and hear more examples like that one then this book is for you. Although not a new work of writing, as far as I'm concerned it is a wonderful piece theoretical argumentation. "
15,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2694023-giovanni-bianco,3,"The Selfish Gene has become a classic in scientific popular literature. It is the herald of a certain popular genetic reductionism that still pervades biology.Its merit is to make a competent presentation of evolution in a genetic perspective, using numerous examples and applications of neo-Darwinian logic. Additionally, there is a good selection of ""stories and tales"" of natural life, which color and elucidate the aridity of their arguments and make the book more interesting.Nevertheless, the book is the product of a brutally reductionist conception of life - a conception of living beings as ""gene machines"". This position is protected under the argument that it is only ""describing things as they are - not as we wish they were."" But this is not the point. Except for the views of ""the evolution of species,"" Dawkins fails to really discuss alternative hypotheses to his general framework.The book strengthens a dominant view, and makes no serious discussion of the main alternatives that emerged outside the dominant discourse. Although not compromise the clarity of his explanation, this attitude impoverishes the reader's understanding (which, as he says, is just a layman), giving a mistaken notion of a definitive explanation and consensus, when in fact, this is a field full of uncertainty and debate. Lacked respect for diversity of interpretations and the spirit of scientific debate. Thus the work becomes manifest only one of the voices of the debate - the predominant voice.He denies, therefore, important evidence of directional processes that complement the statistical randomness of mutations. With this, presents the reader a model excessively simplified of the dynamics genetic of organisms - conveniently not mentioning mechanisms that can by in check various points of his own perspective. It also hides important non-genic processes that participate in the formation of organisms and act as ""shock absorbers"" or ""normalizers"" of mutations, from holistic characteristics of the formation of tissues, organs and the organism as a whole, which directly influence the probabilities of survival.We found some of the best moments of the work when Dawkins makes your writing more essayistic, with greater freedom to develop hypotheses - as, for example, in the brief passage in which he speculates on the origin of self-consciousness, the cause of which is the development of a social mapping whose sophistication requires the inclusion of a model of yourself.In the last chapter, he presents the hypothesis Meme - perhaps the main reason for the popularity of the book. It is a thought provoking and should have their share of truth. However, suffers from the same crass reductionism of the central theory. In fact, it is even worse because memes are not even measurable phenomenon, and its definition in practical terms even more difficult than the genes themselves.- - - - O Gene Egoísta tornou-se um clássico científico contemporâneo. É o arauto popular de um certo reducionismo gênico que ainda impregna a biologia. Seu principal mérito é fazer uma apresentação competente da evolução em uma perspectiva genética, utilizando-se de inúmeros exemplos e aplicações da lógica neodarwinista. A isso se soma uma boa seleção de ""histórias e causos"" da vida natural, que colorem e elucidam a aridez de seus argumentos e tornam o livro mais leve e interessante. Não obstante, o livro é produto de uma concepção brutalmente reducionista da vida -- uma concepção dos seres vivos como ""máquinas gênicas"". Essa posição intransigente se protege sob o argumento de que está apenas ""descrevendo as coisas como elas são -- e não como nós gostaríamos que elas fossem"". Mas não é este o ponto. Exceto no caso das visões de ""evolução da espécie"", Dawkins falha por não discutir realmente as hipóteses alternativas ao seu quadro geral.O livro reafirma uma visão majoritária, e não tem espaço para discussão séria sequer as principais alternativas que emergiam na margem do discurso dominante. Embora não comprometa a clareza de sua explanação, empobrece o olhar do seu leitor (que, como ele mesmo diz, é apenas um leigo esclarecido), dando um noção equivocada de uma explicação definitiva e consensual, quando, na verdade, este é um campo bastante discutível. Faltou respeito à diversidade de interpretações e ao espírito do debate científico. Assim, a obra passa a ser apenas o manifesto de uma das vozes do debate -- a voz predominante. Nega, portanto, importantes evidências de processos direcionais que complementam a aleatoriedade estatística das mutações. Com isso, apresenta ao leitor um modelo excessivamente simplificado da dinâmica genética dos organismos -- convenientemente não mencionando mecanismos que podem por em cheque vários pontos de sua perspectiva. Também oculta importantes processos não-gênicos da formação dos organismos que atuam como ""amortecedores"" ou ""normalizadores"" de mutações, a partir de características holísticas da formação de tecidos, órgãos e do organismo como um todo, que influenciam diretamente as probabilidades de sobrevivência. Encontramos alguns dos melhores momentos da obra quando Dawkins torna sua escrita mais ensaística, com maior liberdade para elaborar hipóteses -- como, por exemplo, no breve trecho em que especula sobre a origem da autoconsciência, cuja causa ser a elaboração de um mapeamento social cuja sofisticação exige a inclusão de um modelo de si mesmo. No último capítulo, ele apresenta a hipótese do Meme -- talvez a principal razão para a popularidade do livro. É um pensamento instigante e deve ter sua parcela de verdade. Porém, sofre do mesmo reducionismo crasso da teoria central. Na verdade, é ainda pior, porque os memes sequer são um fenômeno mensurável, sendo sua definição em termos práticos ainda mais difícil que os próprios genes. "
16,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"This book is a science classic and deserves to be. It is concise and carefully constructed with clear reasoning displayed on each page.Concise. Dawkins never resorts to math, but he mentions from time to time that a particular case really needs to be explained with math rather than in words. I was always terrible at math. I'm still plugging away at it decades after high school just for the fun of challenging my math resistant brain, but I can see Dawkins' point. The symbols of math are strictly defined and a mathematical expression can convey meaning without the ambiguity of words. Math is wonderfully clean. That this book is only two hundred pages long without it is remarkable.There are points where, after an explanation that requires a paragraph or two, Dawkins will remark that his head is spinning, and so will be yours, but these dizzy spells don't occur frequently. The fact is when dealing with genetics, after a generation or two inheritance can become pretty confusing and genetic relationships are central to the book.The word ""selfish"" in the title is misleading because it indicates our genes are thinking and planning for the future. The author in his introduction makes clear that giving sentience to genes is merely a convenient way to describe the results of natural selection so that readers can more easily grasp the concepts. Of course a gene has no awareness, cannot plan for anything and is a pure result of history...a survivor.The standard story of the beginning of life is that billions of years ago there was a soup of chemicals and, with plenty of time to do so, and energy to power chemical interactions, chance combinations occurred that at some point were able to replicate. Some replicators were better replicators than others and won a place in the sun to continue reproducing. Mistakes in reproduction or mutation due to damage from the environment altered these reproducers and, yet again, one version of the reproducer would be better suited, even in a seemingly insignificant way, to survive than another and, to make a very very long time short, here we are!Important to remember is that all of this is done blindly, replicators simply replicate as best they can in the environment in which they find themselves. It is the grim reaper, death, that makes the selection of what replicators will survive to reproduce. It can't be stressed too much that the environment is key to natural selection. We and all other life, are survivors of the historical environments that have, through relentless culling of those less able to survive, shaped life into a myriad of forms that exist today. The fact that all life shares DNA is the clue to the whole process. Variation meets with suitable environments for survival - fish in the sea, birds in the air, bacteria in the soil.Dawkins refers to the bodies of living things as ""survival machines"" and offers the insight that our bodies are carefully controlled environments whose sole purpose from an evolutionary standpoint, is to provide the replicators, the genes, with a sheltered place in which to carry on. Our bodies replace that harsh primordial soup that was so dangerous to the first life.Isn't it easy to see how thinkers in history were so distracted from the real reason for an insect being perfectly matched to the flower it pollinates? It looks like the insect just HAS TO BE designed by an intelligent designer with a purpose in mind - to match it to the flower! It took Darwin and a few others to escape this appealing idea and see that it was the extinction of insects over countless generations, insects that were less suited to the flower, that resulting in an apparently ""perfect"" match for the flower! And don't forget that the generations of flower were being culled to be more suitable to the insect too.Far from intelligent design, our glorious world of living variety came from blind, purposeless, innumerable, random contests between life and the environment. Some live (success), some die (failure), the living reproduce with some tiny modifications, then it's a new contest. Reiterate for billions of years.Though there are points in The Selfish Gene were you might scratch your head, by careful re-reading of a short section you can follow the logic. You won't get lost in jargon because Dawkins is at pains to write for any reader, being nothing if not careful with his prose. Like any good scientist, he never makes blind assertions, always advises caution on points that are not proven and even asks people to dive in and investigate where some concept is not completely proven.My edition is the original from 1976 with a wacky cover design. I've kept it over all these years because I knew I'd want to read it again. As expected it was a great pleasure to do so.Oh, by the way, to give you an idea of just how difficult an idea long time periods are, take a look at this webpage (click on the image if it is too small, to enlarge it):http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-conte..."
17,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/880125-dave,5,"I was led to read this book by way of one of those six-degrees-of-separation links that make the world the place that it is... I was watching the excellent documentary ""The Smartest Guys in the Room"" about my former employer, Enron, and it struck with me that the movie mentions ""The Selfish Gene"" as being one of Jeff Skilling's favorite books. A reader of Stephen Jay Gould's, I already had a bit of an interest in genetics and understood the book to expound upon one of my favorite subjects, Darwinism, so I though I'd check it out for myself.Richard Dawkins does a superb job of laying out his logic in a convincing and thorough manner, and there were a number of moments in reading the book that concepts long discarded to the periphery of my knowledge were brought into sharp focus. Some examples include the mechanisms of evolution during the days of the primordial soup, the workings of symbiosis and parasitism (and how and why they cross paths), and the concept of the game the ""Prisoner's Dilemma""(as well as its relation to genetics).I loved this book and would highly recommend to anyone with a slight interest in biology, evolution, or a curiosity for learning more about the fundamental forces at work in our world. I am somewhat amused that Dawkins' assertion, roughly and ineloquently summarized as organisms, including you and me, being the vehicle by which genes keep themselves immortal, is reminiscent of a Vonnegut book I read years ago called Hocus Pocus. More specifically, the similarities are to a book within the book Hocus Pocus, called the Elders of Tralfamadore, which contains one of my favorite sayings, that I say almost every day - ""What germ ever lived a life this full of challenges and opportunities?""Dawkins can be arrogant at times in a way that borders on hubris, but I find that this aspect of his writing is more a mechanism of his deep and considered thought and very quick intellect than of an overinflated ego. That said, it bears keeping in mind during this book that some critical thought and a questioning mind can be helpful in keeping Dawkins' assertions in perspective."

19,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,2,"A Classic Work, But Game Theory Really Just Wore Me DownI've read several books by Richard Dawkins, including  The God Delusion, The Blind Watchmaker, The Ancestor's Tale, and The Greatest Show on Earth. Strangely, I've only now gotten around to his first and most well-known book, The Selfish Gene, and listened to the 30th edition on audiobook as the original was written waaaayyy back in 1976, an eternity when it comes to books on science. To his credit, Dawkins has added numerous end notes for each chapter that amend or expand on the ideas to reflect newer research. The audiobook is also narrated by himself and his wife, which is a nice touch.Nonetheless this was my least favorite of his books, simply because it was impossible to maintain interest when it deep-dived into Game Theory in terms of gene survival strategies. I don't question his conclusions, as I have no expertise or knowledge in that area. It was just a painful slog to listen to the drawn-out and detailed discussions of cooperation, competition, percentages of survival, blah, blah, blah. Perhaps I've been fooling myself in thinking that I will find anything relating to evolutionary and genetic sciences interesting and mind-expanding. Or maybe I just felt cold listening to how clinical gene mechanisms are in the endless struggle for survival, replication, and mutation. I much prefer to hear about the evolutionary strategies of plants, animals, and humans, which I can relate to, rather than DNA and mitochondria, which aren't nearly as warm and fuzzy."
20,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"I loved this book! Informative, easy to read and surprisingly up-to-date and current despite having been written more than 30 years ago. The purpose and interest of a gene is to progress to the next generation. The genes that are succesfully passed on proliferate and the ones which do not disappear. This does influence animal and human instinct. Although the influence of genes on human nature isn't mentioned, it's in the message. This is not to say that human beings are without choice or free will, it just means that we are predisposed to react in certain ways. Anyway, this philosophical discussion is nothing Dawkins dwells on and anyone particularly interested should seek out Steven Pinker's ""the blank slate instead.The most fascinatin tidbit of facts is ants - belonging to a group called Hymenoptera which also includes bees and wasps - and their strange relationship to each other. The ""queen"" is an egglaying machine, distributing sperm she collected once to her eggs. The eggs that are not fertilized with sperm are born as males and contain only a single set of chromosomes and no father! Fascinating, I spent half an hour of bedtime gushing over this fact to my fiancé who did not really find this half as interesting as I did. At any rate, this means that the female descendants of one queen, all sisters, share not 1/5 of each other's genes but 3/4's as the male chromosome set is always the same. This also means that these sister workers are extremely interested in keeping the queen breeding more sisters which contain much of the same genes as they do - more genes in fact than offspring would share.So yes, although the general content of this book is now generally known, it is still extremely well worth reading to anyone with least bit of interest in evolution and biology. The beauty is in the details. A glorious achievement!"
21,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371252-louis,5,"Long or short evaluation?If everything remain the same, what would be the evolutionary advantage of a selfish reading gene promoting the writing of short book evaluation over an allele promoting the writing of long book evaluation? Producing a short evaluation would require less resource (time) to his vehicle allowing him more time to read more books. Vehicle may prefer to read many short evaluations in order to select a book to read, which would encourage the reproduction of selfish reading gene for short evaluation. A long evaluation requires more resource to produce, but there might be an advantage to it. A long evaluation requires more reading than a short evaluation and produce a transfer from book reading time to evaluation reading time, after all, reading is reading. Vehicles may decide that long evaluation provides enough summary and will not read entire book. Thus promoting the reading of more long evaluation and implicitly the reproduction of the selfish reading gene for long evaluation.This latest model will not be stable, because if vehicles read only long evaluation but not books, books will disappear and subsequently book evaluation. The stable model, or one of, is certainly a mixture of long, short and anything in between evaluation. OK, so now you have a sketch, which may or may not make sense, of what reading the selfish gene book is about. I really liked the book."

The author is humble throughout, not in the dubiously humble sense—but in the respectful-to-science way. It is filled with perspective on the biology that we encounter every day (such as suggesting organs may have evolved as beneficial parasites and eventually merged with the body). Having read a fair amount of Origin of Species (which is fascinating to read as a primary source), I'd say The Selfish Gene is where anyone should start enhancing their understanding of evolutionary biology. He uses all the tools Darwin didn't have at their disposal: game theory, genetics, modern medicine, and many others. It is not dense by any means and scattered throughout the book are stories of animals being dicks, such as a parasite that secretes a hormone to cause its larvae home to never turn butterfly and become abnormally large. Or cuckoos, that lay their eggs in other birds' nests and have some type of irresistibly cute gape that birds of other species will give them food before their own (?!). So many of these questions you've likely had your entire life since learning about evolution have a satisfying answer buried in the book: why did females and males evolve, how did cells start replicating, .."

One of the reasons as to why this book has continously remained a hotspot of scientific discussions and scholarship is because it raises more questions than it answers. This may sound paradoxical but it isn't because this very nature of a 'problem' keeps us yearning for even more and inculcates in us an ever-evolving scientific curiosity.  I have one problem with the book though. The arguments are quite simplistic on a number of occasions ( To cite one example, the conditional strategies of 'hawk', 'dove' and 'bully' in chapter 5 ""Aggression"" to arrive at ESS are too simplistic to occur in nature, where too many variables have to be accounted for). I guess the author is deliberate in this so as to avoid the complex maths that would otherwise have crept in, may be to render the book readable to a vast audience so as to effect scientific curiosity at a greater scale). Nevertheless, some important results do materialise from these simplistic scenarios assumed throughout the book."
27,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25582110-kate-savage,3,"First: I admit that I enjoyed reading this book. Maybe even a misogynist and islamophobe like Dicky Dawkins here can sometimes have good things to say about biology.And also I had one small breakthrough: obviously it makes no sense to think of myself and most of my favorite people as “survival machines for genes,” because we’re by and large miserable failures at reproducing, and are more inclined to support the offspring of another species than even our own kin. But Dawkins suggests: we could instead be survival machines for memes, ideas which infect our minds like viruses and use our voices and writings to disseminate themselves. Touche, Richard, Touche.But here's what bothered me:Dawkins’s masterwork rests on the tautological argument that what-persists is what persists. “Genes” stick around, so they’re the things that survive.This book was written forty years ago (which, we can hope, is why there’s so much talk of “Man”), and we still haven’t figured out what we mean by “gene.” Dawkins tried to decentralize our idea of “who” was in charge by demoting the individual in favor of the gene -- which is smart. But new recognition of how other components of cells function, organize, replicate themselves, as well as our newborn understanding of epigenetics and epistasis, makes me feel like he hasn’t gone far enough in his decentralization. We’re not minions of DNA strands -- the question of “who is in charge” is far more complex than that, and could be told from a variety of angles. (I’m personally hoping someone writes The Selfish Cytoplasm.) The “selfish gene” is actually a platonic idea of a gene. The “gene” is an idealization. Actual DNA is remade, recycled, reshuffled, sloughs itself off in dead cells -- if he’s looking for something constant, he can only rest with this gestalt of a system. The idea of self-replicating DNA. This is why it’s so easy for him to eventually cross over into the categories of “memes.” Like we can all be said to share some “thing” when we share a political leaning, or a religion, or a ditty in our heads. He can reify ""ideas"" because he's already forced to admit that ""gene"" itself is an idea.And about the pseudo-solidity of memes: I can’t help but assume that his willingness to reduce an idea or a belief to “a structure in the nervous system” -- which is shared by all infected persons -- feeds his dogmatic atheism and racist ethnocentrism. If you think, for example, that “Islam” is A Singular Thing, you’re more likely to either be a fundamentalist Muslim, or to call for it to be wiped out like ebola. A more nuanced, flexible, nebulous idea of what ""a"" religion means is, might be the only way humans can live with each other.But before Dawkins explicitly takes on human culture with the somewhat dodgy concept of memes, he does something much worse, which is to skip and blend from biology to anthropology. He puts forward zoological observations within metaphors that encourage us to see them in human culture, which naturalizes systems of oppression.Speaking of how selfish genes build group altruism, he says stupid things like “Money is the formal token of delayed reciprocal altruism,” suggesting that our economic system has primarily natural roots in an evolutionarily-stable genetic tendency. When he’s talking about evolutionarily fit strategies, he makes the disgusting jump to the welfare state, pointing out that people can continue to have babies they can’t afford because those babies won’t starve, in the efficient way that the natural world would take care of ‘the problem.’ 1) This labels money within capitalism as the same thing as biological resources, naturalizing a very unnatural thing. 2) It equates wealth with some kind of genetic fitness -- Dawkins says he supports the idea of a welfare state, but it follows from his argument that ending the welfare state would breed a society where there aren’t any poor people, because “rich guy” genes would take over the gene pool. It would make more sense to point out that our unnatural culture allows botanically illiterate CEOs to still have babies instead of starve as they would in the 'wild.' Dawkins graciously concludes that we shouldn’t blame these parents, since they’re surely too ignorant to know any better. Instead he blames religious leaders who preach against contraception. I am an exuberant fan of contraception -- but that has nothing to do with class. Wealthy babies slurp up far more resources than do the food stamps of the poor. Religion isn’t a phenomenon just of the working class -- and neither is ignorance. The welfare state exists because we recognize we have an extremely unfair (and, for what it’s worth, highly ‘unnatural’) way of dividing up socially-produced resources, and it makes us queasy to think people will have to die for a dumb system.He talks about gender-based strategies in a highly essentializing way. Which might work for other species -- but evolutionary psychologists like Stevey Pinker have picked him up and giddily trumpeted around the pseudoscience of how a population of “coy” females (rather than “fast”) encourages “faithful” males (rather than “philandering”). In the discussion on gender, I found it interesting that rape -- a fairly obvious strategy for 'selfish genes' to replicate themselves -- is never mentioned. This might just be because Dawkins doesn't believe it exists. He also suggests a biological grounding for racism, as an extension of the idea of kin-based altruism. All of this feels like really sloppy science -- a kind of men-are-from-mars pop-psychology that doesn't take into account that there is so much more going on in capitalism, misogyny, and racism than some kind of natural biological response.

30,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12567456-andrew-glynn,1,"Richard Dawkins is not a scientist, but a capitalist ideologue. His major work, The Selfish Gene, precisely embeds capitalism into biology. As science it's nonsense, because the implicit teleology (the goal is the replication of the gene, the organism merely the vehicle) would, in terms of the efficiency requirement in natural selection, create a situation where more complex organisms are inherently less efficient at the fundamental goal. So with that teleology there would be no increase in complexity through the natural selection Dawkins is at pains to protect as the driving force of evolution. in Dawkins' biologism, the more complex the organism, the less valuable. This is the same as the capitalist move from use-value to exchange-value as the goal. Rather than the goal being to produce useful products, the beginning of the process is money as capital, which is turned into products only in order to create more exchange-value, more capital. The capitalist fantasy of a ""frictionless"" economy, i.e. the creation and sale of products with no cost friction, is mirrored in the idea of a ""frictionless"" conversion from exchange-value (genes) to more exchange-value (genes) without the cost of an organism. This embedding of capitalist ideology into biology reduces the value of human beings and other complex organisms to nothing more than an unfortunate cost of exchange, which could ideally be done away with. As a result it also justifies the practical devaluing of human beings in a more fundamental way even than social darwinism. What's the issue with treating human beings as collateral damage in the quest for profit - they're nothing more than a vehicle for self-replicating molecules to achieve their goal of multiplying anyway."

Any intelligent species anywhere in future possessing such a technology would have placed this book where the bible was first found and the world would have been a lot less stupid. But alas, a piece of crap remains the best of the best sellers and 'The selfish gene' needs reviewers like me making such provocative statements to grab attention. 'The selfish gene' is basically science answering questions that were long considered to be at the realms of philosophers and theologians. It asks and anwers why we exist, how we began, what is our purpose, why we love, why we die, why we cheat and why we cannot get away with it and ultimately why human species are so special. The answer to each of these questions lies at the heart of the most revolutionary show on earth... Evolution. This work makes us wonder why we, the general public, know so little of the concept of natural selection. We could only but appreciate its power after this book equips us to understand life on earth from genesis to present just by pure thought. And at the end, Richard Dawkins becomes much like Christopher Nolan and gives us an intellectual orgasm by introducing us to Memes. That's right people... he coined the term much before it was cool. But to really understand memes is to know where natural selection began when it could no longer act on civilised homo sapiens."

Credit to the author for adding endnotes to clarify something or when he was flat-out wrong in the original version of the book, and for acknowledging that cultural evolution may in many cases outweigh (and outpace) genetic evolution.

35,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22306206-neil-r-coulter,4,"What is the fundamental, basic unit of life in our world? Is it each individual in a species? the species as a whole? groups of species that share real estate together? an entire continent, or even the planet itself? In The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins argues that the basic unit is the gene, and that natural selection has been ruled by the ways in which genes seek to perpetuate themselves, generation after generation (that’s the “selfish” aspect—not that there is a gene which causes selfishness in anyone; I would have preferred his other title option, The Immortal Gene). Dawkins applies logic to case study after case study from science, building his case that none of us is really an individual in any basic, meaningful sense; rather, each of us is a collection of genes that keep themselves (and in the process, us) going. We don’t need to be these individual collections of genes at all—it’s just the most efficient means natural selection arrived at for keeping the genes going. It sounds like an enormous topic, and it is. But watching Dawkins wrestle with question after question is very entertaining and illuminating.What makes Dawkins so readable here is the combination of his distinctive writing voice and his infectious enthusiasm and delight for learning about the natural world. Books like The Selfish Gene and Lewis Thomas’s The Lives of a Cell in the 1970s opened the way for so many other “science books for us non-scientists” that have come out since. They show that science is never merely a bunch of facts to memorize in class, but instead is always a story that’s unfolding day by day. The story that Dawkins constructs is extremely compelling—regarding everything in the world but humans. When it comes to applying the same principles and equations to humanity, the story is more complicated and less convincing. Dawkins sometimes suggests that there is no real distinction between humanity and any other species, yet he struggles to use the logic of natural selection to explain humans in the same way that it explains everything else. This difficulty is partly because we’re so close to the subject matter, and so it’s harder to see objectively. But it’s also largely because of the nagging fact of consciousness. We think, we analyze, we seem to know ourselves and our environment in ways that no other species does. We can sense the frustration of trying to include humans in the selfish gene discussion when Dawkins writes,Each one of us knows, from the evidence of our own introspection, that, at least in one modern survival machine [humans], this purposiveness has evolved the property we call “consciousness.” I am not philosopher enough to discuss what this means, but fortunately it does not matter for our present purposes because it is easy to talk about machines that behave as if motivated by a purpose, and to leave open the question whether they actually are conscious. (64)But then later: “Are there any good reasons for supposing our own species to be unique? I believe the answer is yes” (245).Though it ultimately doesn’t harm the general flow of The Selfish Gene , this issue of human consciousness, and the question of where exactly we fit into all this, is occasionally troubling. The wonder of Dawkins’s argument, really, is that he can bring us around to his point of view that what “matters” in natural selection is not an individual in a species but the genes within that individual. Still, though: we don’t ourselves intuitively feel that we are fundamentally our genes rather than our whole-person consciousness, do we? Within Dawkins’s very neat, tidy explanation of life on our world, this is the one tension that doesn’t quite go away. We are different: how and why and when did that happen?Whether or not humanity fits nicely into this explanation, most of The Selfish Gene is clearly more focused on other species. Dawkins clarifies this in what was originally the final chapter of the book, “Memes.” But until that clarification, the reader may be forgiven for making the easy leap from “other species” to “humanity,” and then from there to the possibility that Dawkins is approving of cold, horrifying eugenics. This passage, for example:As soon as a runt becomes so small and weak that his expectation of life is reduced to the point where benefit to him due to parental investment is less than half the benefit that the same investment could potentially confer on the other babies, the runt should die gracefully and willingly. He can benefit his genes most by doing so. . . . There should be a point of no return in the career of a runt. Before he reaches this point he should go on struggling. As soon as he reaches it he should give up and preferably let himself be eaten by his litter-mates or his parents. (168–9)Or again: “If a population arrives at an [evolutionarily stable strategy] that drives it extinct, then it goes extinct, and that is just too bad” (242). The middle chapters of the book are full of this kind of logical precision applied to “choices” genes make in the course of their quest for survival: “game theory” kinds of rules about how genetically closely related someone has to be for it to be worth your while to go out of your way to help them, and so forth (and woe to you if you zone out for a page or two in the midst of these chapters, because you will quickly lose track of what’s being argued and why; it’s not a hard book for the general reader, but Dawkins doesn’t let you sit in the back row and sleep through class). Being too ready to apply everything to humans is not going to meet with success, and it’s not what Dawkins intends. As he admits, “man’s way of life is largely determined by culture rather than by genes” (214). There is a lot to unpack in that simple statement, and this is not the book that will even begin to unpack it.In fact, it’s when Dawkins shifts from the central focus of The Selfish Gene to talking about culture and religion that he is at his weakest. If I were reading this book and knew nothing else about him, I would wish that he would keep writing about science but leave off writing about religion. What has actually transpired in his writing career thus makes me sad, and I almost don’t even want to say anything about his views on religion, as expressed in this, his first book. As good as he is at telling the story of science, his opinions about religion (and the related public persona that he has willingly cultivated) seem to have made it nearly impossible for people to calmly discuss what he says. Honestly, I picked up this book because I was interested in reading Dawkins for his reputation as a clear, engaging science writer, and because I believed that this first book didn’t contain the level of animosity toward religion that has become almost his trademark in the years since. That’s all true—religion doesn’t come up very often in the book, and it doesn’t seem very significant to Dawkins for his discussion. However, it does come up, and it is something that I care about, so with all this preamble out of the way, here are a few of my thoughts about it.Dawkins supposes that the only need for God is to help us out with things we don’t understand. In areas where we’re blind to the “real facts,” it’s (for some reason) natural for us to attribute it to God and assume that he knows what’s going on, which relaxes us and makes us more comfortable with the ambiguity and blindness. Thus, if we can figure out some of the ways the universe works, then it should be natural for us to say, “Oh well, now that we can explain it ourselves, what’s the need for God?” It’s an argument that’s a little circular, first assuming that if there’s a God, that God would be thus-and-such kind of a God—in this case, that a God who created the world in a certain way (using evolution, as Dawkins and I would agree) wouldn’t also intend that we gradually figure out that creation process and come to delight in the way the natural world works, also coming to know God better and better, not in spite of but because of the beauty of how the world works and what we learn about it.The fact that God created a world in which we have the creative and intellectual freedom to tell that world’s story in all kinds of ways doesn’t diminish my view of God at all. Dawkins tells a story of the world without God, but that doesn’t prove that there’s no God; it just proves that there are many ways to tell the story of the world. There are some such stories that are definitely wrong (that the world is flat, for example, or that the universe revolves around the earth), and others that seem to us definitely correct. But the existence of God is beyond the scope of the storytelling that Dawkins favors here. That logical approach doesn’t rule out God, but neither can it definitively prove God. There is mystery. It’s a different question, and just as fascinating. It may be possible for people to be “educated far beyond their capacity to undertake analytical thought” (372; quoting P. B. Medawar); it may also be possible for people to be educated far beyond their capacity to undertake spiritual thought.In considering people’s reliance on God, Dawkins says that “The ‘everlasting arms’ hold out a cushion against our own inadequacies which, like a doctor’s placebo, is none the less effective for being imaginary” (250). But if something is effective, why assume that it’s imaginary? Dawkins’s assumption is that only “small minded” people (129) follow religious rules, and then only blindly, even when they know better. And combining this with an idea of the Bible (and scriptures of other faith traditions) as merely a book of rules to be followed blindly, Dawkins easily dismisses religions as unnecessary nonsense. His misreading of the story of “Doubting Thomas,” from John 20, is a truly puzzling way of making the Bible fit his idea of it:Another member of the religious meme complex is called faith. It means blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence. The story of Doubting Thomas is told, not so that we shall admire Thomas, but so that we can admire the other apostles in comparison. Thomas demanded evidence. Nothing is more lethal for certain kinds of meme than a tendency to look for evidence. The other apostles, whose faith was so strong that they did not need evidence, are held up to us as worthy of imitation. The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry. (257)Dawkins has missed the important point that in that story: Thomas demands evidence because he’s the only one in the room who hasn’t already seen the evidence. Everyone else had already had their chance to examine the evidence and reach the conclusion they did (v. 24). Jesus’s line, “blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed,” is not about anyone in that room, all of whom were, of course, seeing right at that moment. It means the people who will come generations after the people in that room and will not see Jesus in the same way, so they will be believing based on the evidence that these people have seen and testified as correct. Scientists needn’t repeat every experiment that’s been done, just to verify that it’s still accurate. Rather, they trust that previous scientists were rigorous in their examination of the evidence, and so long as nothing has fundamentally changed to call the results into question, those results remain acceptable and evidence-based beyond the lives of the scientists who first carried it out.Faith is not, as Dawkins says, “a state of mind that leads people to believe something—it doesn’t matter what—in the total absence of supporting evidence” (432). Yes, faith may make intangible connections (the proverbial “leap of faith”), but the faithful person also relies on some evidence that is deemed compelling and supportive. I’m not arguing that nothing bad has ever been done in the name of a religion. But let’s be more nuanced than Dawkins, particularly when “blind faith” is so often the motivator for people demonstrating the “going against the genes” altruism that he hopes humanity will choose. Dawkins writes, “As for me, I am skeptical of all myths. If we want to know where the truth lies in particular cases, we have to look” (301). I agree, and I sense that he is holding himself back from really seeking the truth in this particular case.You see how hard it is not to talk about religion when discussing Dawkins? Anyway, as I said earlier, religion is not as significant a part of this book as my review comments might indicate. Near the end of The Selfish Gene, Dawkins writes, “Let me end with a brief manifesto, a summary of the entire selfish gene/extended phenotype view of life” (342), and nowhere in this summary does the topic of God or religion come up. As a follower of Jesus, I can read this book and thoroughly enjoy what’s to be enjoyed, while considering the author’s opinions on religion and then moving on. I wish more people could take Dawkins in this way, and that Dawkins could have held himself to this genre of writing, where has so much to offer everyone.More than forty years after its initial publication, The Selfish Gene is fascinating and enlightening. For anyone who wants to read it, I highly recommend the fortieth anniversary edition, which includes two additional chapters, a new epilogue, and many pages of notes in which present-Dawkins interacts with his younger self, candidly and graciously pointing out areas where he has been proven wrong (and yes, patting himself on the back for all the areas where he’s been proven right), and pointing toward related research that’s taken place over those forty years. Do not skip these endnotes! They are an amazing conversation, and integral to the book."

Of course, it was only a popular vote and there have been many books with a bigger influence than this one (for example, Darwin’s Origin of Species and Newton’s Principia Mathematica) but The Selfish Gene may have actually been the first really popular science book on biology and evolution that was accessible to the general public. Over 40 years have passed since it was first published in 1976. Nevertheless, this book remains relevant and a true classic among science books.Richard Dawkins explains throughout his book that we (and all life on earth) are just vehicles in the gene's strive for survival. Before, it had been widely considered that natural selection was related to behaviours and characteristics which would contribute to the survival of the individual organism, a species or a group of it through time. Dawkins arguments that in reality it is the gene that has a more predominant role in evolution by natural selection. Additionally, this view of the gene as having a more central role in evolution is also able to explain many of the weird behaviours life on Earth seems to have.Throughout his book Richard Dawkins makes reference and pays homage to the minds that inspired The Selfish Gene. As he says, their theories and ideas had been filled with academic language and mathematics. Dawkins was the one who transformed it into comprehensible text. His writing remains clear and engaging throughout the book, using technical terms and/or metaphors whenever necessary to illustrate his point.The last chapter of The Selfish Gene's first edition concerned ""memes"", a term initially introduced by Dawkins, which was surprising and captivating. This would still be a great last chapter for the book even today. I read the 40th anniversary edition, which has two additional chapters, inspired by The Evolution of Cooperation, by R. Axelrod, and The Extended Phenotype, written by Dawkins himself. Both chapters are great additions.This is an enthralling book that changed the way I view biology and evolution. Before, physics had always been my favorite field of science and I had never been very interested in biology but The Selfish Gene captivated my interest. I will definitely be reading more on evolutionary biology and more from Richard Dawkins in the future."
37,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7943826-moumeeta,5,"The God Delusion was a paradigm-shifting book for me. And The Selfish Gene did a bang up job of cementing my magical realism outlook. It is a tough book to navigate if, like me, you're no science whiz. It took me a while to finish. But I read it thoroughly well. While I marvelled at how much of evolution, biologists today understand, I was saddened by how my school science books had been such a yawn that the most fundamental viewpoints had completely escaped me. Dawkins has an enthusiastic style of writing. That is needed for a subject that can otherwise seem so unexciting. He lays out for the reader, ""the gene's eye-view of Darwinism"". ""And a new way of seeing,....can in its own right make an original contribution to science."" The first chapter, in the words of a curious child, asks ""Why are people?"" ""Living organisms had existed on earth without ever knowing why, for over three thousand million years before the truth finally dawned on one of them. His name was Charles Darwin."" Then he goes on to clarify - ""I am not advocating a morality based on evolution. I am saying how things have evolved. I am not saying how we humans morally ought to behave. I stress this...""However, the book has quite a few examples of how, foolishly, humans assume a zero sum game in situations in life when they could actually use them as win-win situations. Though there is no moral lesson here, there is, a Saganian outlook that says' ""wow. Isn't this just mind-blowing?"". The examples of organism behaviour are indeed fascinating. One key idea is the organism as a survival machine, used by the gene, which is the replicator. The gene is selfish but in its struggle to survive can create a whole system of genes which help each other as they depend on the same resources. We differentiate between the parasitic gene and the non-parasitic one. The idea that a human being could be a collection of hundreds of co-dependent organisms, that a virus could have evolved to help spread its genes by making humans sneeze....a lot of incredible information comes your way on reading this book. some excerpts:I suppose the scholars of the Septuagint could at least be said to have started something big when they mistranslated the Hebrew word for ""young woman"" into the Greek word for ""virgin"", coming up with the prophecy: ""Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son...."". Anyway, as we shall see, erratic copying in biological replicators can in a real sense give rise to improvement, and it was essential for the progressive evolution of life that some errors were made.No matter how much wisdom knowledge and wisdom you acquire during your life, not one jot will be passed on to your children by genetic means.The logical conclusion to this trend, not yet reached in any species, would be for the genes to give the survival machine a single overall policy instruction: do whatever you think best to keep us alive.Contraception is sometimes attacked as ""unnatural"". So it is, very unnatural. The trouble is, so is the welfare state. I think most of us believe the welfare state is highly desirable. But you cannot have an unnatural welfare state, unless you also have unnatural birth-control, otherwise the end result will be misery even greater that which obtains in nature. The welfare state is perhaps the greatest altruistic system the animal kingdom has ever known. But any altruistic system is inherently unstable, because it is open to abuse by selfish individuals, ready to exploit it.'A woman could not invest fully in her grandchildren if she went on having children of her own. Therefore genes for becoming reproductively infertile in middle age became more numerous, since they were carried in the bodies of grandchildren whose survival was assisted by grandmotherly altruism.The strategy of producing equal numbers of sons and daughters is an evolutionarily stable strategy in the sense that any gene departing from it makes a net loss.A long memory and a capacity for individual recognition are well developed in man. We might therefore expect reciprocal altruism to have played an important part in human evolution. Trivers goes so far as to suggest that many of our psychological characteristics - envy, guilt, gratitude, sympathy etc - have been shaped by natural selection for improved ability to cheat, to detect cheats, and to avoid being thought to be a cheat.if creatures are discovered that boil to death at -100 degrees centigrade, if a form of life is found that is not based on chemistry at all but on electronic reverberating circuits, will there still be any general principle that will be true of all life? Obviously, I do not know, but if I had to bet, I would put my money on one fundamental principle. This is the law that all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities. The gene, the DNA molecule, happens to be the replicating entity that prevails on our own planet. there may be others. If there are, provided certain other conditions are met, they will almost inevitable tend to become the basis for an evolutionary process.I think that a new kind of replicator has recently emerged on this very planet....it is achieving evolutionary change at a rate that leaves the old gene panting far behind......We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation.....I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like ""gene"".....Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or building arches.I conjecture that co-adapted meme-complexes evolve in the same kind of way as co-adapted gene-complexes. Selection favours memes that exploit their cultural environment to their own advantage.Elizabeth II is a direct descendant of William the Conqueror. Yet it is quite probable that she bears not a single one of the old king's genes......The meme-complexes of Socrates, Leornado, Copernicus and Marconi are still going strong."

The book explains, in an almost frightening manner, how you (and all life around you) is the product of a constant cycle of a bit of randomness (i.e. genetics) combined with millions of years of learning. Slowly but surely, you come to the realization that life, the very core flame that burns inside all of us, is not conscious of itself. We are but a byproduct of some chemicals that happened to come together. It rivals your thoughts on what you felt were decisions that were ""logical"", and breaks them down to reveal that what we see today is a huge survivorship bias; every living cell today exists because hundreds others were in bad situations or made bad decisions. Finally, it tells you why you're ultimately meaningless; the cells in your body do mean something, but you as a soul are not really much more than the combination of those cells.The book is a must-read. It makes you uncomfortable, and in that feeling do you realize how beautiful is the world around you."
39,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21843540-safat,5,"On selfish gene theory: A gene-centric view of evolution Today, it is a common knowledge to the students of life science that all species have evolved from a primordial life form and the course of evolution is shaped by ‘natural selection’. In his phenomenal book published in 1859, ‘On the origin of species’, Charles Darwin presented his idea of natural selection, in which he depicted how individual organisms are engaged in an eternal competition for the limited natural resources, and in the end only the fittest ones survive (More than 99 percent of all species are extinct now).An important fact that needs to be taken into account here is that Darwin had no knowledge of any genetic material transmitting an organism’s hereditary characteristics through its later generations. It is somewhat surprising that he could join the fragments of evidence to formulate his theory without being aware of any genetic material, as molecular evolution is the precursor of phenotypic evolution and precedes phenotypic evolution. Understanding of molecular evolution is quintessential to the understanding of how evolution really works on the level of individual organisms. But where does this selection takes place? In other words, what is the unit of natural selection? Charles Darwin essentially thought that natural selection takes place on the level of individual bodies of the organisms, for he could not see how it could be any other way.But this organism centric viewpoint poses certain problems before us. As for one, if survival of the individual is the sole driving force of evolution, why do we risk our life saving others? Why do we help others in times of grave danger, even at the cost of our own security? Why do we feed others in the time of great famine? Should we not hoard all the wealth and resources in the world to ensure our maximum safety? Why bother about anybody else? Why do we show altruism at all? Among many other questions, an organism-centered view of evolution cannot account for this dilemma.More than a hundred years have passed since Darwin, and now we know better. Let’s take an extended view on evolution. The selfish gene theory:The term ‘selfish gene’ was first coined by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his book ‘The selfish gene’ (1976), and the concept was later delineated in more depth in his book ‘The extended phenotype’ (1982). In contrast to the Darwinian view of the individual organism as unit of natural selection, the selfish gene theory essentially takes gene as the unit of natural selection (This view of gene as the unit of selection was first developed in the works of W. D. Hamilton, Colin Pittendrigh and George C. Williams.)Gene centric view of evolution essentially states that gene (or group of genes) competes with each other to generate the more competent phenotypic characters to promote its own propagation. And thus genes, not individual organisms, set the course of evolution. To put in an analogy, imagine a car race where individual bodies of organisms as racing cars and genes as the driver. Organism’s bodies are used as mere vehicles for the protection and transmission of genes, the ‘survival machines’ of genes. Survival of the individual is less important than the protection of the genes. So in conflict of interest between the individual and its genes, genes will be favored. The more apt an organism (the vehicle for genes) is to survive in a hostile condition, the more protection is exploited by its genes, and that genes are more likely to propagate in the next generation. So, genes in human bodies ensure their safety more firmly than genes in other lower organisms. Because as a whole, intelligent human beings are more capable of surviving in unfavorable conditions by virtue of their intelligence (Generally speaking, this is true. In some cases, cockroaches might have better chances for survival than human beings). It is notable here that a more prolonged life span in individual organisms does not necessarily attribute any great favor to the survival of genes. If you live for a thousand years and do not propagate your genes to the next generation, all your genes die with you. Survival of an individual is critical until it passes its genetic material to its offspring, and the genes are successfully transmitted to the next generation.Now, this gene centered view of evolution can explain many anomalies which previously seemed nonsensical when viewed from the ‘individual selection’ perspective. For example, why do we show altruism? This gene centered view postulates that even if you sacrifice your life for protecting your family in a war or a likewise situation, you might save more of your genes by giving up your life (Your family members share a large portions of your genes). Like I said, survivals of the genes are more vital than survival of an individual organism. Richard Dawkins states in book “The selfish gene”, ‘’Gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behavior. However, as we shall see, there are special circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of altruism at the level of individual animals’’Anomalies like the existence of intragenomic conflict, lethal gene(why do lethal gene exists, if it is bad for the ‘individual’?) can also be accounted for from this viewpoint. I hope you enjoy the book. "
40,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6597382-josip-brecak,5,"I have never read a book on biology or evolution so I can say this book is totally outside my comfort zone. So why did I pick it up? Well, my passion is to become the best version of myself, so I wanted a challenge and this book was definitely a challenge. At times I felt like I was reading a textbook, which is on me for my lack of knowledge on this subject. But most of the time I found myself enjoying it! Dawkin's strays away from the mathematics that is related to the subject and whenever he has a chance to be witty he takes it. At times I felt like it could make a good bed time story!I got a little frustrated. Not at that book, but at the people who can't sleep for nights from reading this peace of work. Dawkins does have some ""controversial"" topics which, maybe at times harsh, but throughout this book it is stated that it has not to do with ethics and morals! My dear friend Marcus Aurellius would be disappointed with those who choose not to use the divine seat within him… his rational mind. So when you read this book, remember not to get caught up in your feelings of what is good or bad or come from a place of religious belief. Remember this, Dawkins states that ""human suffering has been caused because to many of us cannot grasp that words are only tools for our use…"" Evolution can be a confusing subject especially for those who aren't familiar with it, but Dawkins simplified it as best as he could for the layman. Here are the main takeaways in my opinion. (I left out some ideas, like nature vs. nuture. )1)This is a book about evolution, but the best way to look at it is in terms not from the individual level, but at the lowest level possible, the gene. The most fundamental thing in order for life to exist is there has to be ""replicator"" (The gene). Life is for those who are able to replicate. If they cannot, they perish. This is a part of us that is immortal. The gene which, is named the ""Immortal Coil.""2)So why do other genes succeed and replicate more than others? Survival of the fittest. No. It is the survival of the most ""stable."" There are three trends nature favors. High longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity. These are the practical units for natural selection. Now for the replicators that began to increase in numbers, they're faced with other replicators. So they had to build survival machines. These survival machines our the case that keep these genes safe. So the harsh truth is that we are merely made to keep our genes safe and nothing more and our genes don't have a problem to dispose of us.3)Genes are the policy-makers, but our brain's are the executives, they make the decision. As brains evolve they're able to learn and make simulations. This is why humans compared to other survival machines have an advantage, because we are able to SIMULATE the future rather than go through trial-and-error. 4)The gene is the fundamental unit for ""self-interest,"" and Dawkins believes for a gene to be successful it has to have the quality of ruthless selfishness. So are we inherently selfish? Yes. But why do we help others if we are so inherently selfish? Because sometimes the selfish gene can receive the most selfish benefits through altruistic actions. In the end the nice guy can finish first. To support his hypothesis, Dawkins uses something called ESS. Evolutionary stable strategy, which is backed up by game theory and prisoners dilemma. 5)One of the most interesting subjects he talks about is the ""Memes: The New Replicators."" Here he talks more about what makes us unique and can we really call ourselves unique? The answer is, yes we can. The most unusual thing about man is what we call ""culture."" How does culture arise/transmit? It's similar to the way genes evolve. This ""new soup""; human culture has a new replicator which transmit culture through imitation. What imitation is to a meme, is what replication is to a gene. Examples of memes are tunes, fashion,ideas, catch-phrases, and ideas(,like god.) So he goes on to answer, how does this idea of God replicate. Well through word of mouth, books, music, etc. Remember from point 2 in order for genes to be successful and replicate they have to be stable. So if ideas/memes are like genes, they also have to have the factor of stability. So what makes the idea of God so stable? Well, its psychological appeal. When we die. Even though we are not immortal there are two things we will leave with us. Our genes and our memes. As generations pass our contribution of our genes will be halved and our grandchildren will barely resemble us, or if at all. So our genes maybe immortal in its sense, but we should not seek immortality through reproduction. If we want to ""live"" forever it should be focused on what we can contribute to the world's culture. As human beings we have conscious foresight and we even have the capacity of genuine, uninterested altruism. I'll like to end the summary/review with Dawkins words.""We are built as genes machines and cultured as meme machines. but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators."""
41,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"Dawkins is a powerful writer. For most, life is complex, full of detail, filled with the the unknown or uncertainties. Dawkins blows through all of this to get to his central point without qualification: Life forms are vehicles for genes to perpetuate themselves. In translation, this means life is ultimately, and solely, focused on its replication. Other life forms are either to be overpowered or to be used for self-interested purposes. All else is but a footnote.By ""life form"" Dawkins also means humans, but here he takes a left turn and goes down a different path by writing that ""We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth and, if necessary, the selfish memes of our indoctrination. We can even discuss ways of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism - something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world. We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators."" This perspective I suppose reflects a rational man theory that we, unlike other animals, are free to choose and can control our destiny. But the operative word in this Dawkins' quote is ""can"" as in ""can rebel."" If we are selfish in the way Dawkins describes, what's the motivation to be altruistic? In Dawkins, the basis for selfish gene decision making rests on three legs: We're out for ourselves and we will screw someone else if they are in the way or we will use them if we need to; we tend to our kin because we share the same genes; or we cooperate with others for mutual advantage. Given this Dawkins' perspective, why be altruistic? We know of course that many actually care about the welfare of others regardless of any kin or contractual relationship we have with them. If we start with this factual observation, there's a problem with Dawkins' theory. Taking a cue or two from Darwin, but without getting into the group selection debate, perhaps we are designed to promote the welfare of the whole (think conformity to the group) precisely because others and the group are central to our own individual self-interest. Here we have a selfish gene theory that goes beyond kin selection and reciprocal altruism because it promotes the welfare of others and the solidarity of the group. Perhaps this is the origin of sympathy, empathy, compassion, love, loyalty, respect, sharing, etc. We tend to each other. Even if we don't pick out bugs and such, there are many ways we groom each other. Despite the negative connotations associated with selfish gene theory, Dawkins articulates as well as anyone that our bodies are the very embodiment of cooperation. Selfish gene meets selfish gene and each knocks off the rough edges of the other and finds a way to work together because it's in their interest to do so. The end result is a fully grown body that we see in the mirror every day, pushed by self-interest and supported by an elaborate network of cooperative being. Now this is an interesting perspective. We have the self-oriented in one corner and the other-oriented (in the utilitarian, mutual advantage sort of way) in the other, and this reflects the age-old debate between egoism and cooperation. Dawkins relies on Hamilton's mathematical formulations (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc.) for the kin selection part of his theory but it's not clear how this relates to genetic variability that is the essence of Darwin's theory. What does it mean to say we are one-half of our mother and father? Could it be that we are more like our mother than our father in certain key traits? Could some of us be more prone to cheat while others are more prone to work for the good of the whole because our own good is tied up with the group's good? Dawkins writes that ""Darwinian selection has to have genetic variation to work on."" He seems to mean by this that natural selection then picks the traits that reflect an ""evolutionarily stable strategy"" so that in the end we all end up the same as a reflection of some universal human nature. Yet, when we look around, we are clearly not the same. We seem to fall somewhere between the twin poles of the self-oriented and other-oriented. Perhaps certain key traits, such as a focus on oneself without regard to the other or on others as well as oneself repeat themselves with each new generation and that such variability goes with the territory of being human. In other words, could there be two equally viable survival strategies for the selfish gene? Could the extremely self-oriented individual succeed by deception, manipulation, and overpowering? Could the other-oriented succeed because the promotion of the good of the whole in turn promotes the good of the self within the group? Dawkins' footnotes are excellent. His writing would benefit if he omitted his not so subtle digs at those who have a different perspective. "
42,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,5,"An immaculate masterpiece of Darwinian synthesis. Written just a couple of decades after the genetic revolution took off, the book combines old and new ideas in evolutionary theory. The majority of the book skilfully popularizes the ideas of Darwin, Mendel, Watson/Crick/Franklin/Wilkins, Robert Trivers, John Maynard Smith, W.B. Hamilton, Robert Axelrod and other pioneers of the modern evolutionary synthesis. But without the added spark of inspiration and insight that guides Dawkins's pen, the book would be only a backward-looking synthesis (although a very fine one at that). Instead, the book is full of original theories. It thus presents a thought-provoking journey that the author has penned down with unusual vigour and persuasiveness. The very idea of the Selfish Gene was obviously very influential for subsequent theory. It has been debated, vilified and adored. Even if some aspects of the theory have been questioned, e.g. its relegation of the individual members of the species to a subservient evolutionary role compared to the fundamental level of the genes, its importance and theoretical appeal cannot be disputed. Terms like ""gene vehicle"" are still in common use today. Let me just name three more contributions of the book to scientific debate: 1) The Universal Darwinism hypothesis, according to which all life in the universe must develop according to something akin to Darwinian natural selection based upon selfish replicators using ""survival machines"" (bodies and minds) to guide their own prospects. 2) The theory of ""memes"", which has obviously taken a life of its own both in popular culture and in science, according to which ideas and cultural trends operate according to laws of Darwinian survival. Although the memetic theory is rather crude and sketchy, and arguably doesn't add much to existing sociological and anthropological theories, it is a powerful metaphor that can be freely adopted to different contexts, and it can thus serve as fuel for further discoveries in the humanities and social sciences. 3) The hypothesis of the ""Extended Phenotype"", as briefly sketched at the end of the book (in later editions), and as extrapolated in the book by the same name, according to which the physical effect of the genes include their effect on the natural environment outside the narrowly conceived limits of the organism's body, e.g. in beaver dams and human urban development.The book's metaphors can be questioned for some of the shortcuts that they take with regard to the complexity of the issues at stake, and for some of the liberties that they take with regard to the best scientific evidence. The flat-out denial of group selection or of genuine altruism is probably misguided, and the alternative theories should be studied deeper. In a few other respects, the book has dated a little bit, but I was surprised at how little it has. The discussions on altruism and selfishness, on the gene/vehicle struggle for survival, on the parasitic and opportunistic nature of survival machines, and on the impact of genes on social cooperation (e.g. through the evolution of ""tit-for-tat"" reciprocity) still hold up as well as they did back then - mostly because 99% of the sciences and of the general public are still ignorant of the basic facts of the matter. Together with Edward O. Wilson and Stephen Jay Gould, Dawkins has helped popularize and develop Darwinian theory, with oratory splendour, but as this book shows, his contributions are equally immense in the field of original thought, especially with regard to the theoretical underpinnings of biology and the extended philosophy of Darwinism. Still better than almost any other book on the subject out there."
43,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8277957-conrad,1,"In the preface to the 1976 edition of The Selfish Gene Richard Dawkins tells us that ""[t]his book should be read almost as though it were science fiction. It is designed to appeal to the imagination."" In the first chapter of The Grammar of Science Karl Pearson, the father of modern statistics and the namesake of the Pearson correlation coefficient, gives the following maxim: ""Let me recommend the reader to apply this test to every work professing to give a popular account of any branch of science. If any such work gives a description of the phenomena that appeals to his imagination rather than his reason, then it is bad science."" (Karl Pearson, The Grammar of Science) It seems that at sometime during the previous century writers of popular science have taken to the road of appealing to imagination rather than reason. We are even told that they must do so in order to bolster sales of their popularization. Yet I still find myself agreeing with Karl Pearson, and for this I generally find myself not liking pop science. While I respect Dawkins generally, I find The Selfish Gene a bit too pop science for my taste.Something in particular nagged at me while I read this book, until it hit me around chapter 5. Dawkins' 'gene-centered' view is jargon in search of a deeper meaning. Dawkins states in his preface to the 1989 edition that the gene-centric view ""is a different way of seeing, not a different theory...[T]here are two ways of looking at natural selection, the gene's angle and that of the individual. If properly understood they are equivalent; two views of the same truth."" But why is the gene-centric view needed or helpful? Does it yield new predictions or insights? I remain unconvinced.Stephen J. Gould has warned us to be weary of just-so stories in science, and without enough of the math laden theory or any appeal to empirical evidence, I feel this book comes across as a compilation of just-so stories. The tendency towards too easily accepting just-so stories about how natural selection works, or has worked, is part of Gould's critique of 'adaptationism,' the idea that every aspect of an individual's phenotype can all too easily be explained as an adaptation without the evidence required by each particular case.If you really want to put forth the effort to learn about this type of evolutionary theorizing, let me make a suggestion. My suggestion may not be as easy as reading The Selfish Gene, but I think it is worth the extra effort. At least a few of the topics covered in The Selfish Gene are also covered by a different author without Dawkins' unnecessary gene-centric view. J. Maynard Smith's work Evolution and the Theory of Games covers Smith's own concept of an evolutionary stable state, and the Hawk-Dove-Retaliator type models of evolution with much more clarity. Smith's explanation of these topics is carefully mechanical unlike Dawkins' metaphorical ascription of personified 'selfishness' to inanimate genes. Yes, Evolution and the Theory of Games contains some mathematics, as the title suggests, but all those difficult proofs are relegated to an appendix. And really, how much do you expect to learn without a bit of effort? The mathematics is necessary to really understand the concepts."
44,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5719671-frank-peters,2,"The majority of this book was really quite excellent. Nevertheless, the other portions of the book succeeded in detracting from what was otherwise and very good book. The main point of the book was wrapped around game theory, and was a very well thought out description of why certain genetic strategies end up winning. In speaking of genetic strategies, I empathize with Dawkins how he had to continuously remind the reader that the personification of the gene was merely a convenient form of communication, and that the gene clearly has no actual thought. Similarly the author needed to keep reminding us that it is the gene that wants to replicate, not the organism (which is merely used by the gene). The best part of the book started in about Chapters 4-5, when game theory was introduced, and from then on the game theory discussion were interesting and valuable. The largest detractor for me in this book started in the very first paragraph where Dawkins demonstrated his excessive arrogance: he suggested that a sign of real modern advancement in a society is when it acknowledges evolution (by which Dawkins means everything from the beginning of life to the evolution that we see around us daily). Based on his rules, 1950s Soviet Union and China would be very modern, while 2010 USA would not be. I think Quantum Theory would be a much better measurement (here I am demonstrating my Physics arrogance). Dawkins also irritated me by claiming that he was only going to discuss real science (but without the maths), and then went on to discuss areas that are purely wishful thinking. His description of the beginning of life in the pre-biotic soup is entirely speculation, and is not based on any real science that I am aware of. Similarly his meme theory, while a creative proposal, was also not scientific. Thus, as the master of propaganda that Dawkins is, he creatively mixed a small minority of his wishful thinking in with a large amount of good science, while claiming that the entirety was proven and accepted science. Thus, the book ultimately reminds me of the movie Zeitgeist. "
45,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,2,"I almost gave this three stars and then thought... nah. 2.My issue with the book is that it presumes selfishness is something that exists outside of the human mind. The entire framework casts all of Darwinism's natural selection in terms of survival of the fittest. That existence is necessarily selfish because the act of self is selfish. This is so western. In contrast, a Daoist perspective might be more like... this is the environment that happened. You just happened. Therefore.... it just is. As a state of just being, this is what survived and did not. Then things changed, and it turned out this other thing is what became more abundance, but all of that just is what it is, not the animals were selfish.In short, I just feel he overstretched the word. Hence, his retelling of all the different selfish animals and their acts of selfishness, from bees to varieties of shellfish, just sounded depressingly sad to me. I think often, humanity forgets how impacted its philosophy is by scientific discoveries. To me science is a church... and sometimes science doesn't know where to chill out. I mean, I love a good scientific theory. But to think in terms of animals acting selfishly is to anthropomorphize the world to justify things that are just kind of ... not quite as self-evident in nature, let alone human nature. So... 2 stars for me, b/c so many people like this and believe this, I can't help but think of how sad it means their world is."

Which is cool and all, just not what I was expecting.Pretty fascinating shit, actually... Dawkins' revolutionary theory basically revealed that the meaning of life is defined by our genes' ""desire"" to replicate themselves. In other words, it's not that we, as individuals or ""vehicles"" are looking to duplicate ourselves, but the genes themselves are just using us as vehicles by which to spread themselves. He argues that altruism isn't natural urge--at least, not for its own sake. Creepy, eh?Whatever, obviously the book is more complex and interesting than this, but this is a GoodReads entry.

Only after the New York Review of Books compared the impact on the reviewer of my own book Beyond Words to The Selfish Gene did I get interested in actually visiting Dawkins' landmark book. I was not only disappointed; I was rather dismayed! The premise of this book is fundamentally flawed. Individual genes are in no position to act selfish, even metaphorically. The impression the book gives (despite various wiggle-statements by author Dawkins) is that ""selfishness is in our genes."" But real biology isn't so simple, nor as reducible to simple mathematical computer models, as Dawkins insists. Dawkins argues like a lawyer, rather than exploring like a scientist.

There was also considerable text devoted to arguing his case against a competing theory that would have been better argued in the scientific literature.

I feel that this book should be read by absolutely any literate person on the planet. My reasoning is fairly transparent. Arguably, The Selfish Gene presents Evolutionism in a fairly simple manner. Considering that it is not often enough taught well in schools or in some cases taught at all, this should be a go to book for any uninitiated person. The way it's written makes it accessible and pleasant enough to read. That said, there isn't a fixed page quota. It can be read in 2 or 3 sits, but it depends on who's reading it. "

54,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33334405-amun-mohamed-elbadwihi,4,"In 1859, Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published, forever changing our understanding of life. As revolutionary as it was, parts of it were wrong, and for a good reason. Darwin, 150 years ago, was ignorant of the existence of DNA, and of genes. Had he been alive today, his theory of Natural Selection—which took 20 years to develop!—might’ve looked very different. Darwin’s dead, though, so thank nature for Dawkins.The title of this book has caused Richard Dawkins a great deal of unwanted trouble. He has, on many occasions, expressed regret over not calling it by a different name, such as “The Immortal Gene”. If you haven’t read the book, I’d suggest that you avoid coming to conclusions based on the title alone.Dawkins postulates that the basic unit of selection in nature is the (immortal) gene, not the organism. Genes in your body need to survive and propagate themselves, for the benefit of themselves, not for the benefit of you. It doesn’t matter if you live or die; although it’s best if you die after you reproduce, so your genes get a chance to move along. In essence, we are all just disposable vehicles for gene survival. I’m OK with that. And also a little flabbergasted. Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, and I cannot speak enough about how much of an amazing writer he is. I owe much of my understanding of the world to this incredible scientist, and I’d recommend anything written by him in a heartbeat. Some tidbits:

“Let me begin with some second thoughts about the title.”“It was created inside one of your father’s testicles”“‘A chicken is the egg’s way of making another egg.’” – Peter Medawar, Review“Perhaps consciousness arises when the brain’s simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself.”“‘The rabbit runs faster than the fox, because the rabbit is running for his life while the fox is only running for his dinner.’ My colleague John Krebs and I have dubbed this the ‘life/dinner principle’.”“One of the dominant messages of The Selfish Gene (reinforced by the title essay of A Devil’s Chaplain) is that we should not derive our values from Darwinism, unless it is with a negative sign. Our brains have evolved to the point where we are capable of rebelling against our selfish genes. The fact that we can do so is made obvious by our use of contraceptives. The same principle can and should work on a wider scale.”“I am not advocating a morality based on evolution. I am saying how things have evolved. I am not saying how we humans morally ought to behave. I stress this, because I know I am in danger of being misunderstood by those people, all too numerous, who cannot distinguish a statement of belief in what is the case from an advocacy of what ought to be the case. […] Let us try to teach generosity and altruism […..] it is a fallacy—incidentally a very common one—to suppose that genetically inherited traits are by definition fixed and unmodifiable.”“The feeling that members of one’s own species deserve special moral consideration as compared with members of other species is old and deep. Killing people outside war is the most seriously-regarded crime ordinarily committed. The only thing more strongly forbidden by our culture is eating people (even if they are already dead). We enjoy eating members of other species, however. Many of us shrink from judicial execution of even the most horrible human criminals, while we cheerfully countenance the shooting without trial of fairly mild animal pests. Indeed we kill members of other harmless species as a means of recreation and amusement. A human foetus, with no more human feeling than an amoeba, enjoys a reverence and legal protection far in excess of those granted to an adult chimpanzee. Yet the chimp feels and thinks and—according to recent experimental evidence—may even be capable of learning a form of human language. The foetus belongs to our own species, and is instantly accorded special privileges and rights because of it.”“Genes do indirectly control the manufacture of bodies, and the influence is strictly one way: acquired characteristics are not inherited. No matter how much knowledge and wisdom you acquire during your life, not one jot will be passed on to your children by genetic means. Each new generation starts from scratch. A body is the genes’ way of preserving the genes unaltered.”“The gadget that animals evolved to achieve rapid movement was the muscle. Muscles are engines which, like the steam engine and the internal combustion engine, use energy stored in chemical fuel to generate mechanical movement.”  “Fireflies (which are really beetles) attract their mates by flashing lights at them. Each species has its own particular dot-dash flashing pattern, which prevents confusion between species, and consequent harmful hybridization. Just as sailors look out for the flash patterns of particular lighthouses, so fireflies seek the coded flash patterns of their own species. Females of the genus Photuris have ‘discovered’ that they can lure males of the genus Photinus if they imitate the flashing code of a Photinus female. This they do, and when a Photinus male is fooled by the lie into approaching, he is summarily eaten by the Photuris female.”“There are honeyguides who, like cuckoos, lay their eggs in the nests of other species. The baby honeyguide is equipped with a sharp, hooked beak. As soon as he hatches out, while he is still blind, naked, and otherwise helpless, he scythes and slashes his foster brothers and sisters to death: dead brothers do not compete for food! The familiar British cuckoo achieves the same result in a slightly different way.”“I have already suggested that a female might refuse to copulate with a male who has not already built her a nest, or at least helped her to build a nest. It is indeed the case that in many monogamous birds copulation does not take place until after the nest is built. The effect of this is that at the moment of conception the male has invested a good deal more in the child than just his cheap sperms.” “The new soup is the soup of human culture. We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. ‘Mimeme’ comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like ‘gene’. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme. If it is any consolation, it could alternatively be thought of as being related to ‘memory’, or to the French word même. It should be pronounced to rhyme with ‘cream’.”

56,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81791013-michael-kress,5,"Last night I went to hear Richard Dawkins and Carolyn Porco speak in Nashville, TN. There was a great turnout, and I waited in a long line to get both of them to sign my copy of The Selfish Gene, so I thought today would be a good day to write my review of this masterpiece. I have read this once and listened to the audio book once. The audio book was the 40th anniversary addition, which had lots of additional commentary. By visiting it a second time, I picked up on things that I missed out on or forgot about. This is my favorite book by Dawkins, the best science book I've ever read, and in my top 10 favorite books of all time. His books have made me obsessed with evolutionary biology. From Introduction to 30th Anniversary Edition - ""Audiences respond to the new book, whichever one it is, with gratifying enthusiasm, applaud politely and ask intelligent questions. Then they line up to buy and have me sign...The Selfish Gene.""The event played out exactly as he described it. The new book was Science in the Soul, which I had read, and thought was great. In fact, I read and loved every book they had on display. But The Selfish Gene was the obvious choice to buy and get signed. Another thing he talks about in the Introduction is that perhaps ""The Selfish Gene"" wasn't a great title. One of his colleagues mentioned that ""selfish"" was an unappealing word and that ""The Immortal Gene"" might have been a better title. I personally think ""The Selfish Gene"" is a perfect title because it accurately describes the content. Although individual organisms can act altruistically, genes act selfishly, caring only about perpetuating themselves through the eons. The book doesn't promote selfishness as a basis for morality. He's not Ayn Rand.From Chapter 1 - ""Intelligent life on a planet comes of age when it first works out the reason for its own existence. If superior creatures from space ever visit earth, the first question they will ask, in order to assess the level of our civilization, is: 'Have they discovered evolution yet?' Living organisms had existed on earth, without ever knowing why, for over three thousand million years before the truth finally dawned on one of them. His name was Charles Darwin."" I had to share this because it's just an awesome quote. Chapter 2 tries to answer a tough question: How did life come from non-life? Science can't fully explain this phenomenon, but Dawkins makes a bold attempt. At some point, units of matter started making copies, or replications, of themselves. The copies started making copies, and so forth. Mutations happened, causing the copies to become varied and more complex. They start to build containers around themselves for protection and to aid in their replication. These containers are now what we consider to be our bodies. If you don't read anything else in this book, I suggest you at least read this chapter.The book goes on to explain how genes manipulate organisms to do their will. An organism wants to reproduce so it can spread its own genes. It also will act altruistically towards other organisms who share its own genes. For instance, a parent will often sacrifice its own life for the benefit of a child who shares half its genes. Cousins share a smaller portion of genes, so individuals have less concern for those more distant relatives. But they will often make sacrifices for the good of a group that carries a large amount of the same genes. The book explains many situations like these in detail.The term ""meme"" is popular now among Facebook users, but Dawkins coined that term way back in 1976 when this book was written. Dawkins's ""meme"" is an idea that replicates itself in human brains. Before humans evolved, genes were the only things that could make copies of themselves, using bodies as vehicles. Because of human culture, memes can now make copies of themselves when one person puts their own thought into another's head, and so forth. Religion is the first meme that I usually think of, but political ideologies are strong memes as well.Dawkins is an outspoken atheist and has received more than his fair share of criticism for this stance, even here on Goodreads. But the vast majority of this book deals with biology, not religion. People who dislike his smug attitude towards religion should take their anger out on the man himself, not this book. Haven't you ever heard of separating the art from the artist? Another thing that I disagree with is the attitude that science is boring. Dawkins was the man who taught me that science can be interesting and exciting."

59,0199291152,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12174361-krishna,5,"Dawkins wrote this book ""to examine the biology of selfishness and altruism"" (p. 1). Despite the widespread acceptance of the theory of evolution, biology presents some difficult-to-explain paradoxes: if organisms succeed by ruthlessly exploiting all available resources to survive and reproduce, why do some animals display altruism, or self-sacrificing behaviors for the benefit of others? Why do animals cooperate? Why do some animals withdraw from conflict even if it means giving up opportunities to eat or mate? Why do organisms voluntarily limit the number of their offspring? The conventional explanation is group selection, the view that species in which altruism and cooperation evolved are able to survive and propagate better, which reinforces such behaviors. Dawkins firmly rejects that view. According to him, the unit of selection is the individual and not the species (only individuals reproduce, not the species). Even if a species is altruistic, individuals can improve their chances of survival and reproduction by cheating - by benefiting from the altruism of others while subtly withholding those benefits from others. As the cheater genes proliferate in the population, altruism eventually dies out. Thus we come to the idea of the ""selfish gene,"" the original replicator. More accurately, the replicator is the cistron, a group of genes that ""travel"" together and perform a specific behavior. To further their chances of survival, a collectivity of genes (the genotype) build bodies (""survival machines"" or the phenotypes) that are endowed with the behaviors that will enable them (and therefore their genes) to survive. The concept of a ""survival machine"" itself is highly interesting. Dawkins cites the plot of a British television serial, A for Andromeda, written by the cosmologist Fred Hoyle. In it, and extraterrestrial civilization is bent on galactic conquest but finds distances too big to bridge. It beams out the instructions for the construction of a gigantic computer to be built. Once built, the computer will take over the local civilization; it will also be intelligent enough to defeat all attempts to dismantle it, no longer needing instructions from its designers. Unwitting humans intercept the transmission and proceed to build the computer according to the instructions, and drama ensues. Dawkins argues that organisms are such ""survival machines."" The DNA is the ""program"" allowing a body to be built with physical endowments and behaviors that will enable it to survive, and therefore allow its genotype to survive and propagate as well. Our behaviors - competitiveness, avarice, greed, aggression, jealousy, deception, as well as cooperation and altruism - are intended to improve the chances of survival and reproduction of the genes. If a behavior or attribute did not contribute to reproductive fitness, it will be ruthlessly eliminated from the gene pool. Ironically, a selfish gene may not even be interested in the survival of the organism that houses it, as long as its own chances of reproduction are improved. In Chapter 13, Dawkins gives the example of the T gene in mice. Normally, in meiosis, each allele (alternate form of a gene) in a pair will have an equal chance of being present in a sperm or egg. But in male mice with a T gene present, 95 percent of sperm contain the T gene and only 5% the variant allele. The problem is that if a mouse ended up with two T genes, it is rendered sterile or dies young. The T gene's selfishness causes a high percent of individuals containing it to die, but the gene itself propagates through the population since it as a 95:5 advantage.To survive, an organism needs to do three things. First, it needs to survive. In the primordial soup of the early Earth, various molecules emerged but most were unstable and rapidly decomposed back into their constituents. Dawkins explains that the ""first form of natural selection was simply a selection of stable forms and a rejection of unstable forms"" (p. 13). Once established, the organism needs to reproduce -- i.e. make copies of itself. Fecundity, or frequency of reproduction becomes a factor here. And third, to be successful, the copying needs to be faithful. The offspring need to be as identical to the parent as possible, i.e. copy fidelity. The earliest ""life forms"" that emerged from the primordial soup were probably simple molecules that remained stable and grew by attaching stray molecules to itself. Eventually they began to replicate. Perhaps long strings broke in the middle, and both strings began attaching new material at their ends. But the primordial soup soon ran low on the raw materials. Mechanisms emerged that allowed strings to break up rival molecules and use the freed-up raw materials to build their own bodies (the first predators). But sometimes copying mistakes happened. If a mistake made the string better able to survive and replicate, it spread. If the mistake made the string worse off, it died out. Gradually, these life forms grew more complex -- acquiring defensive outer coatings, mechanisms to produce ""poisons"" to deter predators, other chemicals that can penetrate the defenses of predators and competitors, etc. And thus, step by step, life progressed up the chain of evolution.Subsequent chapters take up questions that have puzzled biologists for generations. If the strongest often win food and mating opportunities, why do some animals avoid conflict? Why do some of the most fierce predators such as lions never fight to the death, engaging in mock fights with a lot of snarling, and posturing and baring of claws but little physical contact? Dawkins utilizes game theory to examine this. The answer is that actual fighting with another animal as lethally armed as yourself can have debilitating consequences for oneself, injury or even death, which can really crimp your reproductive fitness. In a population of ""hawks,"" therefore, a ""dove"" that avoids conflict and bides its time might have a chance at survival and reproduction. So the population of doves keeps increasing - but not indefinitely, since as the number of doves increases, hawks increase their chances of victorious encounters and the balance shifts in favor of the hawks. Thus an equilibrium emerges in which both hawks and doves survive in a stable proportion in the population. This brings us to the concept of evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), defined as ""a strategy, which if most members of a population adopt it, cannot be bettered by an alternative strategy"" (p. 69). This is simply a strategy which is immune to deviations by some members - anyone deviating from the strategy is made worse off and the population reverts to its original configuration. Another chapters tackles the problem of altruism - why do some individuals sacrifice themselves for others in the group? Shouldn't such behaviors, that doom an individual's chances of propagating her genes, have evolved out of the population? Dawkins explains this with ""kin selection."" Since closely related individuals share a large proportion of their genes, someone who sacrifices themselves to aid the survival of closely related individuals can still propagate their genes into the next generation. For example, since siblings share 50 percent of their genes, a man who dies saving two of his brothers comes out even in evolutionary terms. There is a nifty equation to calculate the percentage of genes shared between two individuals: go up the family tree by generation until you hit a common ancestor, and the down to the other person. Count the number of steps up and down, this is n. Then if number of common ancestors is K, the fraction is K x (1/2)^n. For example, first cousins are separated by 4 generation steps -- two up to the grandparent, and then 2 down to the cousin. But there are 2 common ancestors, grandpa and grand ma. So the fraction will be 2 x (1/2)^4 = 1/8. Your grandpa and you share 1/4 (since the common ancestor is grandpa himself, n = 2, k = 1). The same logic explains why individuals forego reproductive opportunities, or refuse to breed or kill offspring in times of famine. The goal is not to maximize the number of offspring, but to maximize the number of *surviving* offspring. Other chapters examine the battle of the sexes or between generations -- in each case, the same argument prevails. Individuals behave in ways that maximize the chances of survival of their genes, either through improving the odds of survival of their offspring, or of themselves, or ideally of both. Another fascinating chapter examines social species in which most individuals forego their chances of breeding in order to support a highly related individual (the queen). But perhaps the most fascinating chapter is the last one, in which Dawkins introduces the concept of the ""extended phenotype."" The conventional understanding of the gene is that it is the design blueprint for the phenotype - the body of the organism. But the effect of the genes is not confined to the organism's body alone. What about biologically coded behaviors such as nest-building and the construction of tubular homes (the tiny caddis larva). These too are part of the gene's survival strategies. But even more interesting are an organism's effects on other species in its environment - such as unions symbiotic and parasitism. For example, a parasitic fungus makes a species of Amazonian ant climb underneath a leaf and attach itself, until it dies and its head explodes scattering the spores. In this case, the DNA of the fungus codes for this behavior not in its own body but that of another species. This is what Dawkins calls the extended phenotype. Another insight from this chapter is what Dawkins says about the means of reproduction and the symbiotic or parasitic relationship. If the means of reproduction of the parasite and the host coincide (for example, a bacterial parasite in the ambrosia beetle has learned how to hitch a ride in the beetle's reproductive cells and into the body of a new host), the two organisms cooperate to ensure the survival and reproductive success of the host. If the means of reproduction are different (as in the case of the Amazonian ant parasitic fungus), the parasite reproduces to the detriment of its host. Which brings up another fascinating insight - there is no real way of differentiating between ""our"" DNA and that of other species who have figured out how to reproduce themselves using our reproductive cells. In fact, a good portion of any creature's DNA might have been parasitic once, until they worked out a modus vivendi. This may also explain why long stretches of an organism's DNA do not appear to do anything specific - they are parasitic DNA that have worked out how to ensure their own survival. Dawkins's book points the way to profound philosophical, even spiritual truths. If individual phenotypic traits are the workings-out of genetic blueprints shared not only by a species but by all life, it brings into question fundamental ideas of self-hood and individualism. Jealousy, lust, greed, pride and discontent are only the ""survival machine's"" encoded behaviors to enable individuals to go out and perpetuate their genetic masters. Our genes literally make us unhappy and discontented in order to ensure their survival and perpetuation - since happy and self-satisfied individuals pursue no mates, steal no wealth and build no empires. Such a perspective is truly liberating, since it allows us to say ""no"" to the insistent cravings engendered by our gene's quest for survival. Ironically thus, a purely mechanistic view of nature allows us to realize true spiritual liberation."
