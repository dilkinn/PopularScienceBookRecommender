0,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This book is as much about discovery and good journalism as it is about science. The author, Bill Bryson, takes us through a history of science in the most personal way possible. Our starting point is his starting point: How exactly did we come to have the knowledge we have of the world around us?In addition to introducing us to the ideas that shape the way we see the world, the author also takes us into the adventure of science. He takes into the hardships and heartaches, the often petty, ego-driven personalities that move our knowledge forward. He takes us into the lives of great scientists both remembered and forgotten. He takes us into the messiness of the debates that have driven scientific conversations. He takes us out into the field where he interviews people working on scientific problems today. He takes us into the realm of the infinitely vast universe, into the infinitely small universe of atoms, into the ancient past, and gives us a sense of the science that may be yet to come. And in doing so, we get a sense of how precarious our own existence is and the miracle that we have become aware of so much of the universe around us. For this reason, I would recommend this book both to those who are looking for an interesting introduction to science and to those who are looking for a book that will help them marvel at their own existence.

An attempt to cram everything and the kitchen sink into a work intended for the general reader is surely a recipe for failure—or so one might think. Bryson marshals science, history and philosophy to present a big-picture understanding of our universe from past to present. Extraneous details are filtered out, and mysteries left unexamined, yet it somehow feels complete. Not unlike a film editor who can cut down 24 hours of production material into a feature-length film, he manages to pack a world of wonder and insight into an accessible and entertaining, though relatively lengthy (544-page) tome. Bryson's preoccupation is less with the rote repetition of facts (though there is that, too) than with conveying just how it is we know what we know. He takes us behind the curtain for a more intimate look at the process of discovery and the strokes of genius essential to that process.Lengthy and mildly scatterbrained it might be, ASHONE is a pure literary delight. The author's excitement and enthusiasm for the subject matter drip from every page. The sheer joy he receives from learning little gems he missed in high school or being reintroduced to information forgotten long ago is intoxicating. He meets with a wonderful cast of men and women to highlight the personalities behind the stories of discovery. Lone geniuses are a rarity in any field, and science is no exception. Bryson scratches below the surface to meet the individuals who played prominent roles yet went unrecognized.In taking the long view, Bryson engages some of science's toughest questions. Everything from the Big Bang to man's (relatively terse) evolutionary past is presented here, with a nod to some of the more eminent and intriguing figures from each field. I particularly appreciated that after a concept was explained, he immediately followed up with the most obvious question in response. It really helps the lay reader navigate these complex topics.Bryson spends a good amount of time on natural disasters, describing the many ways in which they shaped the history of our planet. His frequently humorous analogies help you understand their sheer scale and the havoc left in their wake. Ice ages, earthquakes, supervolcanoes and pandemics are each showcased in breathtaking detail in some of the most harrowing events on planetary record. Given all the chaos that has besieged our planet, it becomes soberingly clear by the book's end that we humans—or any life for that matter—are incredibly lucky to be here. In light of all that can go wrong and has gone wrong, it's remarkable there is any life left to comment on the tragedy and storied disarray. I commend Bryson for demonstrating how truly diminutive our time here on Earth is relative to the universe's imponderably vast history.Bryson should also be applauded for pointing out places where our inquiry has hit a brick wall or those areas that remain imperfectly understood. The fact that we have accumulated such vast storehouses of knowledge over the last few centuries does not mean there are no mysteries left to explore. Indeed, dozens of questions both big and small remain unanswered, and new discoveries have a tendency to open up several more. We can both be proud about what we have uncovered to date as well as humble about the many uncharted possibilities that surely await us.Fast and Loose with ScienceThere are a few caveats, however, with respect to some of the finer details. In one place he describes particles with ""spin"" as actually rotating about an axis (they are not). This erroneous conception of elementary particles dates back to the 1920s, when George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit interpreted the motion of electrons as self-rotation around their own axis. A few years later, Paul Dirac pointed out that electrons could not be spinning according to the rules of orbital angular momentum because the rate at which their surface would have to be spinning (to produce the magnitude of the magnetic moment) would have to exceed the speed of light, which would violate the special theory of relativity.In another place Bryson says that quantum entanglement is a violation of relativity (it is not). Relativity tells us that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, and this applies even to things with zero mass, such as information or other electromagnetic radiation. Entanglement says that measuring a particle in one place can instantly affect a particle somewhere else. However, this effect is constrained by the cosmic speed limit. On p. 42 of his book 
What Is Relativity?
, Jeffrey Bennett responds to this notion:""However, while laboratory experiments suggest that this instantaneous effect can really happen, current understanding of physics tells us that it cannot be used to transmit any useful information from one place to the other; indeed, if you were at the location of the first particle and wanted to confirm that the second had been affected, you'd need to receive a signal from its location, and that signal could not travel faster than light.""Bryson also claims that the production of black holes within particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider could destroy the world, when in fact, these microscopic black holes would disintegrate in a fraction of a nanosecond thanks to Hawking radiation. On p. 154 of the same book, Bennett also debunks this largely media-driven fear:""Some physicists have indeed proposed scenarios in which such micro black holes could be produced in the Large Hadron Collider, but even if they are right, there's nothing to worry about. The reason is that while the LHC can generate particles from greater concentrations of energy than any other machine that humans have ever built, nature routinely makes such particles. Some of those particles must occasionally rain down on Earth, so if they were dangerous, we would have suffered the consequences long ago.In case you are wondering how a micro black hole could be ""safe,"" the most likely answer has to do with a process called Hawking radiation...Hawking showed that the laws of quantum physics imply that black holes can gradually ""evaporate"" in the sense of having their masses decrease, even while nothing ever escapes from within their event horizons. The rate of evaporation depends on a black hole's mass, with lower-mass black holes evaporating much more rapidly. The result is that while the evaporation rate would be negligible for black holes with star-like masses or greater, micro black holes would evaporate in a fraction of a second, long before they could do any damage.""He may have consulted with experts, but the manuscript could have benefited from additional fact-checking. That said, although the book was published in 2003, there is little that is out of date. The confirmed interbreeding between Neanderthals and Denisovans being one notable discovery of late that adds greater texture to the stories recounted here. Additionally, I feel there could have been a greater emphasis on climate change; Bryson chose to skirt over it whenever a related topic arose, perhaps intentionally.Closing ThoughtsThe content in ASHONE is something I think everyone should know and be exposed to, and it's hard to imagine the material presented with greater alacrity than it is here. The passion and sheer enthusiasm on display frequently approaches Sagan-esque proportions, in a style redolent of the signature series Cosmos, which is about the highest praise a work in this genre could hope to achieve. Though I found a few errors—and suspect the average grad student in one of a number of the subjects covered could find a few more—the book is nevertheless a praiseworthy stab at science writing for the layperson. Bryson set an ambitious task for himself and ultimately delivered a lively, accessible and mostly scientifically faithful, albeit cursory and swift, proem to the history of the universe as we know it today.“Even now as a species, we are almost preposterously vulnerable in the wild. Nearly every large animal you can care to name is stronger, faster and toothier than us. Faced with attack, modern humans have only two advantages. We have a good brain, with which we can devise strategies, and we have hands with which we can fling or brandish hurtful objects. We are the only creature that can harm at a distance. We can thus afford to be physically vulnerable.” (p. 447)Note: This review is republished from my official website."

A Short History of Nearly Everything is one of those formative books that has stuck with me for a long, long time.I have little to add to this review. I thought I had lots to say, but re-reading my review from 2010 below … I already said it there. I was going to talk about Bryson’s repetitive phrasing, praise how he explains how much we don’t know, and remark on how good this book is at just … luxuriating in the knowledge we have.I will add that I think this book, by and large, holds up even 15 years on. Our scientific knowledge certainly has advanced since then. Some of the mysteries that Bryson mentions here have been solved—while others have deepened. Moreover, reading this now with a more critical eye than I did in 2010, I’ll acknowledge there’s a pinch of Western gaze going on here. At one point, in the last chapter, Bryson comments how it was such a shame that the Chinese were grinding up bones for medicines instead of studying the bones to learn more about our past. Hello, casual racism. It might seem like I’m nitpicking now, especially considering how Bryson wryly highlights the racism and sexism of our past, but that’s exactly why I don’t want to let him slide on something like that.That being said, for the most part this book remains just so damn energizing. It inspires me to think big, to think about and marvel at the incredible world we inhabit. I honestly haven’t craved any of Bryson’s other works—I liked one, didn’t like the other, and have a few more on my to-read list but can’t be bothered to jump on them. But there’s something about the way he writes about this stuff, about this history of science, that just works for me. If it doesn’t work for you, I get it, this book will be a bit plodding and boring. But if it works for you … oh, wow, will it ever work for you.Read Ben from 2010’s opinions to find out why!Second reading review, May 7, 2010.I cannot recommend this book enough. No word of hyperbole: this is a book that everyone should read. Bill Bryson takes the span of human existence and produced a popular history of science that's both accurate and moving. A Short History of Nearly Everything is a celebration of science, but it also evokes the sense of wonder about the universe that science makes available to us. And, almost inevitably, it underscores how much we still have yet to learn about our world.Throughout history, one of the common arguments against the expansion of science has been something to the effect of ""science removes the mystery"" of the universe. Well, yes, that's kind of the point. But what opponents to scientific investigation usually mean to say, explicitly or not, is that because we know more about the universe, somehow that makes the universe less wonderful. Somehow a universe of quarks and gluons is less romantic than a universe powered by God. Thus, the argument goes, we shouldn't get too serious about this science stuff—it's depressing.My response: Are you on crack?I have just as much trouble fathoming how opponents of science find science depressing and nihilistic as they have trouble fathoming how I find science awesome. It seems self-evident to me that science is wonderful, that it is truly the most appropriate vehicle we have for appreciating our existence. But maybe that's just me, and obviously it's not everyone. So what A Short History of Nearly Everything does is level the playing field, extend the olive branch, if you will. Just as this review isn't an anti-religion diatribe, A Short History barely mentions religion. It doesn't talk about Galileo's persecution by the Church or the rise of creationism and intelligent design in the United States. Bryson and his book are above that. They reaffirm a sentiment I already have, and one I hope you share, either prior to or after reading this book.Science is fucking awesome.Sure, one can't understand every scientific concept that one comes across. But that's to be expected. Wave-particle duality is tricky stuff. Just as anyone can become a good handyman with some common sense and little experience, anyone can learn a little bit about quantum mechanics—but if you want to build a quantum house, you'll need many years of experience under your belt.Even we amateurs, however, can appreciate how cool it is that, for example, our bodies are made of stardust. The heavier elements, of which we are mostly composed, were forged in the crucibles of supernovae light-years away. We're here because some star died for us, and all the atoms managed to travel to Planet Earth. We're here because the Sun pumps out photons that heat our atmosphere, so we don't freeze, and the ozone layer reflects some of the photons away, so we don't fry. Our existence is temporal and transitory and tentative. But we do exist. And regardless of one's stance toward religion, this simple fact is a miracle.So science can give us miracles too. What Bryson does is take bits and pieces of science, put them in a historical context, and show us the miracles they contain. The result is an appreciation and a better understanding of how the world works.This is a rather long book—my edition is over 400 pages—and I have to admit it took me a longer time to re-read it than I had anticipated. It's worth the time. Every section is informative and interesting. Although I have a soft spot for physics, the chapters on relativity and quantum mechanics aren't my favourite—perhaps because I've already learned about the concepts elsewhere, so it felt a little redundant. Instead, I really enjoyed reading about the rise of geology, chemistry, and taxonomy. From this book I've learned that fossilization is a risky business; there's way more species hiding everywhere on and underneath the planet than we'll probably ever find; and if I happen to still be alive in a few thousand years, I should probably get volcano insurance.Even while educating us, Bryson emphasizes how much we don't know. Sometimes the media likes to portray science or scientific theories as ""complete"" when they are anything but. Perhaps here is where that niggling nihilism starts to rear its head for some people, for Bryson makes it clear that with some things, we probably just can't know, at least not in a timely fashion. On the macroscopic level, once we get out to about the range of Pluto, the distances are so vast as to be almost insurmountable. On the microscopic level, Planck and Heisenberg ensured there would always be a little uncertainty. But I'm OK with that. Preserves the mystery, after all. And provides yet more challenges.Our ignorance also carries with it a sense of helplessness. We aren't very good at tracking near-Earth objects, for instance, which means if an asteroid does strike us sometime in the near future, we probably won't see it until it hits the atmosphere. Then it will be too late. And even if we did, we don't have the capability to destroy or divert it. Still, lifting the veil of ignorance on one's ignorance is essential to improving one's ability to think critically about science. Who knows: maybe A Short History will inspire some kid to go into astronomy or engineering and invent better asteroid detection equipment.The upshot of this—as Bryson likes to put it, because his writing style is peppered with repeated phrases like this—is that Bryson presents both the good and the bad of science. As much as science is wonderful, it's also a human enterprise, and we humans are notoriously fallible instruments. Scientists are not immune—indeed, practically prone—to taking credit for another person's work; Bryson is quick to interject anecdotes about the personalities, quirks, and flaws of the persons of interest in the book.On that note, I wish I kind of had some sort of fact-checking utility for this book. Of course there are references and a bibliography, and Bryson claims in the acknowledgements that various reputable experts have reviewed the material. As much as I love A Short History, however, it is popular science and prone to simplification. So take the anecdotal parts with a grain of salt—for example, contrary to what Bryson claims, NASA didn't destroy the plans for the Saturn V lander (the real problem is trying to find enough reliable vintage parts to construct the thing).Overall the quality of A Short History of Nearly Everything is just so brilliant that I can't condemn Bryson for his enthusiasm. And I still have several adjectives left, so I can also say that this book is fabulous and stupendous, and you should definitely buy a copy or hold up your local library until it produces one. And if you don't have a local library, you should construct a doomsday device and hold the Earth hostage until such an edifice is constructed in a town near you. Got it? Good.It's a book worth reading and a book worth remembering; A Short History of Nearly Everything is science and history wrapped in a nutshell of wonder.First review.I cannot recommend this book enough to people.Bill Bryson manages to convey a technically detailed history of the planet while maintaining a readable, comprehensible writing style. His tone is engaging, and his tales are captivating--I particularly enjoyed the discussions on physics and on the development of archaeology and the theory of evolution.A Short History of Nearly Everything is to books what Bill Nye the Science Guy is to television. This is a book for science lovers and a book for those who swore they'd never take a science class again. I'm a fairly intelligent person; I learned a lot from this book, but at the same time I was already at least acquainted with much of the material it presents. However, that did not stop me from having, ""whoa!"" moments throughout the book, moments of realization at how complex and wonderful our universe is--and how special it is that we, humans, can strive to understand such a phenomenon.

3,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,3,"Don’t let the 3 star rating mislead you. This was an awesome book and I’m certain others will think more highly of it. It is a great introduction for those not into the biography of the universe and the history of science. However, if you watch the Science Channel, History Channel, PBS, etc., then you’ll already know much of what’s covered. It is the true ""Once upon a time. . ."" story. As someone with an interest in all things science, I was still impressed with the witty style of the writing and use of analogies to drive home various points. It’s a very entertaining listen and the narrator does an excellent job in reading it.The most salient point of the book for me was the human paradox of how we are changing the world through our presence but at the same time how precarious our existence on it is. A favorite quote from the book for me is, “All life is one, is one of the most profound true statements there is.” Think about this, for you to get where you are today, all of your ancestors had to survive long enough to find someone willing to pair up. Not an easy task surviving disease, war, or just being eaten. One break in the chain, one moment sooner or later in the conception process anywhere along the line and you don’t exist. It’s a miracle you’re here. And yet you are despite the odds against it. Just when you think you were meant to be here, you have to remember we could all be wiped out by a meteor strike at any moment.Humans have been apart of only 0.0001% of Earth’s history and yet we have been chosen. As the author states, “We are the least there is. We may be all there is. We are the living universe’s supreme achievement and its worst nightmare simultaneously.” One last quote to end with comes from Edward O. Wilson in his book,  The Diversity of Live, “One planet, one experiment."""

The only weak point would be the prolonged, unnecessary details sometimes .."
5,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time,4,"*4.5 stars*Pretty brilliant, almost required reading. It took me over a month to listen, but the narrator is excellent and the content ranges from mildly engrossing to fascinating, depending on your areas of interest. I'd listen again and again. "
6,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"If instead of the eyelids down the corners, the mouth go up, the non-fiction book rocksPlease note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Being able to portray the most bone-drenched topics with so much humor, wit and charm is a masterpiece and testifies to the talent of the actual travel writer with satirical potential.As the title says, you get an excursion across world and science history delivered, which seeks in this form unparalleled and puts the emphasis on the scientific disciplines. One has heard everything before or even an approximate idea in the back of the head, only surprisingly by the well visualizable representations, in this case, much more aspects stick than with, decorated with epochs changing pictograms, timetable diagram from the school lessons. Much of the readability is based on Bryson's successful effort to portray, in any somewhat theoretical and difficult to understand the area, closeness to, in the broadest sense, protagonists that would have been expected in this form and quality instead in fiction. Moreover, this is his special secret ingredient, which unfortunately is so infinitely challenging to produce. Undoubtedly many ingenious, but literary average scientists and potential non-fiction authors shy away from creating their work for this reason. Even in still unearthly earthly epics or purely theoretical explanations, Bryson manages to fill the object of contemplation with such a life that the possibilities of association and vividness arouse sympathy for flagellates, quanta and primordial soup.Also, the fun increases along with the evolution to the preliminary result of the quirky scientist. What ingenious people have to offer in terms of creative behavioral potential in addition to their actual talent, drives on average talented and socially unobtrusive contemporaries double blush in the face. Ordinary in thought and behavior rather than eccentric and brilliant, what injustice.Be it particular preferences, social anxiety, misanthropic tendencies, peculiar experimental arrangements or neurotic inclinations, geniuses were at all times outlandish contemporaries. Thus, the already given entertainment value potentates with the talent of the author and lead by the way by the essential points of the history of science. Theorems, theories, doctrines, anachronisms and paradigm shifts take hold, and the highlights include the clash of two equal opponents, in this case, scientists.To what soap-naughty malice people of the mind can be capable of being astonished at given the stereotype of the laboratory-wearing loner. Moreover, with what arguments, tactics and gambles its theses underpinned and in return competing explanations of their right to exist are removed, belongs to the everlasting byproducts of research. Where the current state of affairs does not seem as entertaining as the debates of bygone days, as one imagines in modern times. However, the current state of knowledge and the concomitant, at all times rock-solid certainty about its correctness and existence, will in future provide similar cheerfulness as the view into the supposedly primitive past.Just the fact that so many profoundly changing inventions were made purely by chance due to unexpected results of unintentional experiments illustrates the pool of knowledge in the face of the water planet of ignorance.The only shortcoming is the occasional misstatement of numbers. However, because quite a few scientific points and periods have shifted, reduced or increased remarkably, one can confidently turn a blind eye to this.Wenn statt den Augenlidern nach unten die Mundwinkel nach oben gehen, rockt das SachbuchMit so viel Witz, Esprit und Charme die knochentrockensten Themen darstellen zu können stellt eine Meisterleistung dar und zeugt vom Talent des eigentlichen Reiseschriftsteller mit satirischem Potential.Wie der Titel sagt bekommt man eine Exkursion quer durch Welt- und Wissenschaftsgeschichte geliefert, die in dieser Form seinesgleichen sucht und den Schwerpunkt auf die naturwissenschaftlichen Disziplinen legt. Man hat alles schon einmal gehört oder noch eine ungefähre Vorstellung im Hinterkopf, nur erstaunlicherweise bleiben durch die gut visualisierbaren Darstellungen in diesem Fall wesentlich mehr Aspekte haften als beim, mit nach Epochen wechselnden Piktogrammen geschmückten, Zeittafeldiagramm aus dem Schulunterricht. Ein großer Teil der Lesbarkeit fußt auf der erfolgreichen Bemühung Brysons, in jedem eigentlich noch so theoretischen und schwer verständlichen Bereich eine Nähe zu den, im weitesten Sinne, Protagonisten herzustellen, die man in dieser Form und Qualität eher in der Belletristik erwartet hätte. Und das ist seine spezielle geheime Zutat, die leider so unendlich schwer herzustellen ist und sicher viele geniale, aber literarisch durchschnittliche Wissenschaftler und potentielle Sachbuchautoren davor zurückschrecken lässt, ein eigenes Werk zu kreieren.Selbst in noch menschenleeren Erdepochen oder rein theoretischen Ausführungen gelingt es Bryson, den Gegenstand der Betrachtung derart mit Leben zu füllen, dass die Assoziationsmöglichkeiten und Anschaulichkeit regelrecht Sympathie wecken für Geißeltierchen, Quanten und Ursuppe.Und der Spaß steigert sich mitsamt der Evolution bis zum vorläufigen Endresultat des schrulligen Wissenschaftlers. Was geniale Menschen an verhaltenskreativen Potential zusätzlich zu ihrer eigentlichen Begabung zu bieten haben, treibt durchschnittlich talentierten und sozial unauffälligen Zeitgenossen doppelte Schamesröte ins Gesicht. Normal im Denken und Verhalten statt exzentrisch und brillant, welch Ungerechtigkeit.Seien es besondere Vorlieben, Sozialängste, misanthropische Tendenzen, eigentümliche Versuchsanordnungen oder neurotische Neigungen, Genies waren zu allen Zeiten eigentümliche Zeitgenossen. So potenziert sich der schon vorgegebene Unterhaltungswert mit dem Talent des Autors und führt so nebenbei durch die wesentlichsten Punkte der Wissenschaftsgeschichte. Theorien, Lehrmeinungen, Anachronismen und Paradigmenwechsel geben sich die Klinke in die Hand und zu den Höhepunkten gehören die Aufeinandertreffen zweier ebenbürtiger Gegner, in diesem Fall Wissenschaftler. Zu welch seifenopernhafter Bosheit Menschen des Geistes fähig sein können verblüfft angesichts des Stereotypes vom laborkitteltragenden Einzelgänger. Und mit welch Argumenten, Taktiken und Winkelzügen die eigenen Thesen untermauert und im Gegenzug konkurrierende Erklärungsansätze ihrer Existenzberechtigung enthoben werden, gehört zu den immerwährenden Nebenerscheinungen der Forschung. Wobei der aktuelle Stand der Dinge nicht so unterhaltsam anmutet wie die Debatten vergangener Tage, da man sich in modernen Zeiten wähnt. Aber der aktuelle Wissensstand und die damit einhergehende, zu allen Zeiten felsenfeste Gewissheit über dessen Richtigkeit und Bestand, werden in Zukunft für ähnliche Heiterkeit sorgen, wie der Blick in die vermeintlich primitive Vergangenheit. Gerade dass so viele, tiefgreifende Veränderungen mit sich bringende, Erfindungen rein zufällig aufgrund unerwarteter Ergebnisse von unbeabsichtigten Experimenten gemacht wurden, veranschaulicht den Tümpel der Erkenntnis angesichts des Wasserplanetens des Unwissens.Als einzigen Mangel kann man gelegentlich falsche Zahlenangaben anführen. Aber unter dem Aspekt, dass sich schon etliche wissenschaftliche Sachverhalte und Zeiträume extrem verschoben, reduziert oder gesteigert haben, kann man hinsichtlich dessen getrost ein Auge zudrücken."

It certainly would have made things a lot less dreary. It's just one of those books where you know, upon reading the very first page, that you're getting into something incredible !I'm only 28 pages in and I'm already squirming in my seat with nerdy excitement. This won't be the last of Bryson's books that I pick up, either."
8,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78462164-serene-morticia,4,"This is a wonderful overview of, well, exactly what the title depicts!There is a degree of story-telling that Bryson utilises that makes the narrative smooth and easy to follow. In fact, the novel reminds me of those great teachers you may of had at school where they would be explaining the material they were supposed to be teaching you but would go off on a tangent about something else before looping back to the aforementioned topic. Bryson does this throughout the novel and combined with his narration and satire, it's all so entertaining!I love the primary conception of the novel: '...I was on a long flight across the Pacific, staring idly out the window at moonlit ocean, when it occurred to me with a certain uncomfortable forcefulness that I didn't know the first thing about the only planet I was ever going to live on.'If that statement hit you as hard as it hit me, I would strongly suggest reading this book. His own objective to write this book was to understand himself so do not fret if you are put off simply because you are not acquainted with scientific texts. At the end of the day, the prose considered in this book pretty much affects everyone. Just a basic understanding of atoms, weather, water dipolarity and glacier ice layers I think is a very minimal basis of scientific knowledge to be understood - and really, it's fascinating! I would definitely recommend this to someone who is studying or planning to study science at A Level/Level 3 to get a good basis for their further studies. I learnt while studying classics that authors (like Bronte and Austen) would utilise the tool of letters so that the reader could be exposed to another set of narrative for better plot development. Bryson is on the same journey as the reader - just a normal guy of next to no predisposition of scientific background simply enquiring about the basics. He uses small intervals where he repeats his inquisitive conversations with scientists and specialists in certain fields to explain certain matters that he would find too difficult. This just makes it feel you're on this big, long journey with Bryson and his guests as tour guides. I have a couple of criticisms though. At the beginning of the novel, there some beautiful drawings depicting a timeline of the Earth's history and even a little drawing of the Earth's layers in the introduction. However, there are plenty more verbal descriptions of pretty sublime and profound matters but no diagrams to aid them. Of course, you could just Google it and find something like what you're reading but a wider use of diagrams, pictures or drawings would supplement this novel perfectly and increase the understanding even further. Also, I found Bryson to be quite repetitive when there was no need which made it a little tiresome. However, this book is the best introduction to our planet that ever graced the modern book world (in my opinion and all those who recommended it to me). It's humorous, factually apt and fluent in its composure. Well done, Bryson, you have accomplished something just as great as those you wrote about. "

11,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"I almost wanted to smack myself for not reading this book earlier. Having said that, since I've only started on audiobooks about 2-years back, perhaps it's not such a bad thing, because I believe with all my heart that I enjoyed this much more with the superb narration.Firstly, A Short History of Nearly Everything is a title which is ambitious by any measure. Really? Nearly everything? Bill Bryson sure did a nifty job at creating this riveting read which I can describe alternately, though not perfectly, as 'A layman's summary of leading scientific thoughts, discoveries and events that shaped our understanding of the planet Earth as well as the life which resides therein.' And the truth is that even now, we are still pretty far from truly understanding or knowing very much. Bryson's writing style can be described as eloquently delightful. A topic such as this can easily be dry in its rendition, instead Bryson has injected an insouciant dry sense of humour therein. He also has a way of putting together the most amusing or incredibly apt yet elegant descriptions. An example which I loved was how he described a person who was tall, thin and not very nice as 'a lanky assemblage of shortcomings.'The audio narration was delivered with such deadpan flair that combined with the author's style it made for many hours of great entertainment. I've caught myself laughing aloud so many times that passersby must have thought me a bit mad. I particularly appreciated the real life analogies that helped to explain scientific measurements which were either infinitesimally too small or too large for the every day person to comprehend. The flow of the narrative from one scientific branch to another was almost seamless and it was written in a manner that actually makes the title of the book relevant. In short, this book was both enlightening and enjoyable. I highly recommend this to anyone who has even a little interest in science."
12,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67532575-kevin-shepherd,4,"The knocks on Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything essentially come from two camps; those who are well versed in science and feel this treatment lacks any substantial depth or detail, and those whose interest in science is so nominal that they feel put upon by the overwhelming and substantial depth and detail. Such is the lot of authors who set out to bring complex disciplines to wider audiences (*see also Astrophysics For People In a Hurry). Speaking only for myself, this was right in my wheelhouse. I now know a bit more about paleontology, geology, chemistry, astronomy and particle physics than I knew a few days ago, and I'm more than satisfied with the attention & treatment Bryson gives to my science of choice, physical anthropology. Light reading this is not, but you don't need a PhD to comprehend what Bill B is laying down, just a curious mind and a comfortable chair. "
13,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,5,"Must, must, must read.If you enjoy history, and approachable science. From quantum mechanics to clouds, Bryson reviews what humans know and who made the discoveries, often with humorous behind the scenes tidbits. Love, love, loved it.“Tune your television to any channel it doesn't receive and about 1 percent of the dancing static you see is accounted for by this ancient remnant of the Big Bang. The next time you complain that there is nothing on, remember that you can always watch the birth of the universe.” *2020 Update:* I regularly list this book as one of my all time favorites. Thinking I might need to reread it one of these days and see if it is still as good as I remember."

But, now that we are ""here"" we're probably doomed, in all likelihood sooner than later. And we kind of deserve it. Somehow Bryson manages to cheerfully cover those three depressing themes throughout making this is a very fun book! Hard to put down. Thoroughly enjoyed this, what a gifted writer, and learned a tremendous amount along the way. This will be a fun re-read many times over!"
15,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1309606-f-r,5,"A sign that a book is really, really, really gripping you is when you find yourself talking to people about it. And by ‘talking to people about it’, I don’t just mean recommending that they read it, but actually spouting out things you’ve read in its pages, developing arguments from what you’ve learnt and generally just crow-barring whole tracts of knowledge into conversations which, left to their own devices, would have happily meandered elsewhere.Such a book is Bill Bryson’s ‘A Short History of Everything’.For the last week or so I’ve been reading it I’ve felt a little like E.L.Wisty, talking in Peter Cook’s boring, nasal voice about this marvellous book I’ve read and how it contains all these interesting facts.This is a book which tries, and for the most part succeeds, in making very complex areas of science meaningful to a layman such as I. So we have the creation of the universe, the vastness of space, the dawn of life, the changing environments of our planet, the development of life, various extinctions and the complex evolution of man. It’s incredibly illuminating stuff, an array of complex theories broken down and put into reach of those of us who don’t have PHDs (although I’m only slightly more au fait with quantum physics than I was before I started reading that section – but then there are quantum physicists who freely admit they don’t properly understand it.) Bryson grabs the attention by turning it almost into a history lesson of discoveries , so we have thumbnail sketches of Darwin, Halley, Einstein and other great pioneers – many of whom I’d never heard of. That combined with Bryson’s eye for the outstandingly curious, then this ends up as constantly amusing and astounding read.Now if you’ll excuse me I’m off to bother some passers-by, I’m in possession of some facts that they might find very interesting."
16,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/381149-martine,4,"I know virtually nothing about science, so it was with some trepidation that I began reading this introduction to life, the universe and everything, which deals with questions such as ""How did the universe originate?"" and ""How much does planet Earth weigh?"". I ended up enjoying the hell out of it, as Bryson's writing style is so witty and accessible that it frequently made me laugh out loud. He has a knack of telling you not just about major developments in the history of the universe, but also about the scientists who made the discoveries he describes, who were frequently larger-than-life characters leading very tragic lives. To be honest, I enjoyed the asides on the scientists more than the science itself, but that didn't stop me enjoying reading all the bits about the Big Bang, early life forms and quarks. It also gave me an understanding of how random and unpredictable life really is, and how little mutations can lead to massive changes. Impressive stuff. "
17,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19450056-donna-backshall,5,"A Short History of Nearly Everything is simply a masterpiece. This monster of a book offers such dense information in such an entertaining format, I'd need to read it once a year to get everything I could out of it. Now that I think about it, maybe I will!"
18,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jess-the-shelf-declared-bibliophile,1,"Sorry, Bill Bryson, I think this may be the MOST boring thing I've ever read in my life. I really loved Walk in the Woods..I loved his witty banter and his engaging, story-telling writing style. I'm not sure WHO, if anyone, would actually enjoy this bland book. I love science and history, but this was just excruciating and mind-numbingly boring and tedious. I ended up skimming most of it. Life is too short for boring books!"
19,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,5,"Bill Bryson is a versatile and engaging writer with a knack for introducing humor into even the driest of topics. His work A Short History of Nearly Everything is a perfect example of this. In this book, which I listened to over the course of a whole month (mainly when I was out running), he tackled the scientific history of - well quite a lot of stuff or as he put it - nearly everything. Of course that's not possible but he really did cover so many topics and he made them not only interesting but comprehensible to me in a way no other text book or science teacher has managed to do previously. As a layperson who invested three years of his life gathering information, researching and compiling this book, it was obvious he was acutely aware of the potential for the content to be out of the grasp of a non-scientific reader. So not only did he make it completely readable but entertaining too. I loved the way he would throw a fact out there - one that could so easily be ignored - and then made it relevant. There's too many examples to quote them all but he managed to put things clearly into perspective. For example something that was described as being 190 kilometre's deep at first mention sounded significant but he'd put it into context by explaining that if the earth was reduced to the size of a standard globe of the world, the 190km would only be as thick as one or two layers of lacquer. Time and again he'd bring the reader (listener) into focus with reality checks like these which - for me at least - would cause an ahhaa or oh wow type response. Regardless of whether unveiling facts about the Big Bang theory, the periodic table of elements, planets, proteins, paleontology, genetics, evolution and the history of the human race or any of the multitude of other topics discussed my mind was regularly awestruck. Just as regularly he tickled my funny bone and I'd have a bit of a chuckle to myself (at the risk of looking like a bit of a loony running and laughing to myself). This book is one of the few I could share with my partner as he too was enlightened and engaged by the content. A couple of times we'd pluck a random chapter to listen to on a lengthy drive and it would hold us both captivated. I can see myself doing this again and again over time. I may not remember all the facts but I will certainly enjoy trying. Well done Bill Bryson and thanks to Audible for making this the member audiobook of the month. I'm almost positive I'd never have chosen it otherwise."
20,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74466071-charlie-hasler,5,A serious book about science written in an inviting and light hearted way. Superb.
21,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10165256-penny,5,"I loved this book! You don't have to be a scientist to enjoy A Short History of Nearly Everything as part of Bryson's motivation was to make science more accessible to Joe Public, but I have to say that as a scientist this book resonated deeply with me. Bryson delivers the most interesting facts of many of the greatest, and sometimes pretty obscure, men and women in the history of science. Since some scientists can be rather eccentric it makes for some very good stories! It's a remarkably easy read considering the complexity of some of the science and does a wonderful job of showing the evolution of science and the associated politics. This is a must read!!"
22,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13514595-dayanand-prabhu,5,"I finished this book in little over a week. 570 Pages of pure unadulterated trivia. One might argue that this isn't a science book. You see Bill is no scientist, but he is a storyteller, a very good one at that. So in this book Bryson has with all his might presented us a story of how science came to be. A story of how over the centuries our knowledge of the world and beyond has evolved and how different personalities have contributed and fought for it. That itself makes it a very important book. This book made me realize that we know so much yet are so far away from knowing it all. "
23,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1598503-michael,4,"Full review coming soon...but I just wanted to mention how much I enjoyed this. Entertaining, enlightening, and provide plenty of fodder for my creative writing. I'm a huge fan of Bill Bryson and have moved on to his Applacian Trail book."
24,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"You know, for some reason, when I picked up this book way back in 2016, I didn't expect it to be as readable and accessible as it was, and kinda thought that it would be dense and difficult (which begs the question - what the hell did I get it on audio for?) but it wasn't dense or difficult at all, and instead was really interesting and fascinating. That being said, this isn't the book for you if you want any real substantive information on any subject. This is a book jam packed with a lot of little bits of information, enough to explain a bit, pique your interest, maybe inspire you to learn more, but it should not be considered the conclusive info on anything presented here. This book covers a LOT of ground, from the end of nothingness and the beginning of somethingness to the beginnings of earth, the beginnings of life, the beginnings of humans, the ends that humans are bringing to other species, and maybe even ourselves. But... It does say that it's a short history of nearly EVERYTHING. If you are interested in science and learning and origin stories, pick this up. If you like audiobooks you can listen to in the car in 5 minute bits for 3 weeks, pick this up. If you like Simon Vance, or Simon Vance-like readers like Richard Matthews, pick this up. If you are looking for in-depth, science-heavy conclusive information on a topic, maybe look elsewhere. This is not that, but for what this is, it's great. "
25,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233375-bookshop,5,"Bill Bryson is one of my favourite travel writers. He is immensely funny. He's an American married to a Brit and lives in the UK now. That has an influcence is his writing: he has taken up the dry, self-depreciating humour of the Brits while, at times, remained blunt and straight-forward, as Americans do.This is his first attempt to write something other than travelling. The book is about science, general science for general public. It covers everything from astronomy to zoology, from the universe to whatever -the-name-is -for-things-smaller-than-atoms in its 573 pages. Notes, bibliography, and index occupy another 113 pages. Thus, as you can imagine, it is very brief and general for each of the topics.But the book is suprisingly well arranged and deeply reseached. That's the amazing thing about this book: it is brief but not shallow; it explains without going into unnecessary techinal details; and it flows smoothly from one branch to another. He must have understood the subjects very well in order to be able to do that and thus, this book is invaluable in term of education.In term of readibility, he peppers the content with human-interest stories. For example, little-known facts about scientists (do you know that Einstein worked as the Swiss patent clerk for seven years and that he was denied a promotion, a job as a university lecturer and then, as a high-school teacher?), simple explanation ("" On a diagram of the solar system to scale, with the Earth reduced to about the diameter of a pea, Jupiter would be over 300 meters away and Pluto would be two and a half kilometers distant ...""), etc.I cannot recommend this book enough: both for its educative content and for its fine writing style. This is definetely the book to enjoy and to keep."
26,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,2,"After the first 200 pages I thought this book should be titled A Long History of Almost Nothing, but then there were some interesting facts near the end which keep me from giving it one star.Therefore, a more apt name for this book sould really be A Long History of the History of Scientific Discovery. The author touches on subjects ranging from astronomy, to physics, to geology, to anthropology, etc., and walks through how thought developed in each of those fields from at times as far back as the 1600s. The book is really a history book and not a science book so if you are looking to learn the hows and whys of subjects, this is not for you. In fact, whenever it comes to explaining the detail of a theory or law of nature, the author smugly condecends to the reader implying the reader wouldn't understand which i found annoying and off-putting.In fact, the whole tone of the book is smug and works greatly against the author. The author is so proud he did all of the research that he wants to let you know he has done it and parsed through all of the hard parts for you.I am not sure to whom I would recommend this book. If you want snippets of each of the many major fields of science, perhaps it would be interesting, or if you just want to know about the history of scientific development, it could be an ok read, but if you're interested in learning about astronomy or geology or any specific field of science, just read a book tailored to that field (for instance if you're interested in the universe and quantum physics, I would recommend A Brief History of Time by Hawking or anything by Brian Greene).Long, mostly dull, and not what the title makes it out to be. "
27,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/637062-jacob,5,"May 2009I ""read"" the audiobook version about a year and a half ago and really enjoyed it--this book can be really enjoyed in small doses--but I felt like reading it in print this time around. At least, skimming a previous paragraph is a lot easier than trying to rewind while driving. Turns out it's good in big doses too, or any for that matter. Although I haven't read much science writing (yet) and therefore can't compare it to others, I will admit that A Short History of Nearly Everything is one of the most interesting and entertaining books I've ever read, period. It's probably the most educational, too; I'm sure I learned more about the history of the earth, the universe, and science and scientific study in this one book--probably in any one chapter--than I learned in all the science classes I ever took in school. Bryson helpfully explained Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2 and did it better than my physics teachers did, and it took him barely a page and a half. And the rest of the book is the same; that is, every other page is just as informative and fascinating. I would've paid more attention in school if this had been the required reading. There's far more to learn than names, dates, laws, and equations. But apparently science isn't supposed to be interesting..."
28,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4413597-praxedes,4,"This wonderful book is multi-layered enough to appeal to all. My niece recommended it to me since she knows I am a physicist wannabe! Bryson's pages contain elements which will entice anyone with curiosity about how things work in the universe.Using relevant examples and a dynamic tone, the author keeps the reader attentive throughout. This is no small feat since some of the passages can be dense for those of us who are not active in any scientific field. But the rewards and 'A-ha!' moments are worth it. Highly recommended."
29,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233507-s-ach,5,"The science we study in schools can be compared to the tasteless sugary ice cream shoved carelessly in a wet conical-biscuit by the village ice-cream vendor who comes every Tuesday on his bicycle. No wonder, the study becomes repetitive and fails to ignite the passion in us to go further in time. Few of us dare to pursue the study of science. And those who take it, they do not because it interests them, but it promises to give a good job. Very few of us really study science because it amuses us.Bill Bryson blames this lack of interest in science to our school days, “It was as if [the textbook writer] wanted to keep the good stuff secret by making all of it soberly unfathomable.”Probably that was the reason why he came with such a wonderful rough guide to science ‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’. As if a chef decorating your plate with the sweetest creams carefully chosen from all parts of the world leaving you to wonder what to order more.The book takes you from the gargantuan stars to subatomic particles in a matter of few pages. The journey form 10 raised to the power of 100 to 10 degraded to the power of -100 takes less than a minute. Traversing haphazardly from Cosmos to Bacteria, from Big Bang to Genetics,the book leaves the reader open mouthed. The book covers almost all branches of science, Space, Earth, Environmental, Life, Chemistry and Physics introducing us to the pioneers of each field.One moment you will be lost in the cosmos. Next moment you will find yourself measuring the size of earth. You will burn in the fire below the earth’s surface before traveling backwards to the ice age. The book doesn’t claim to explain all. Neither it promises to elucidate the solved/unsolved mysteries. It just takes us in a time machine through all corners of world showing who is getting awestruck at that time by a sudden discovery of something unimaginable. Einstein, Newton, Hubble, Bohr, Avogadro, Planck, Maxwell, Darwin, Feynman. Along with their idiosyncrasies, it describes briefly the lives and wonders of the greatest personalities in the history of science in such fervour that you would gasp for more.Being a gifted travelogue writer, Bill Bryson describes each occurring in such adroitness that not a single chapter will bore you. For example – instead of the text-bookish – ‘a million years ago in the world came the first human being,’ he writes, ‘if you fly backwards traveling one year per second it takes you half an hour to reach Christ’s birth and three weeks to reach the start of human race.’Those who are in that mode of academics where they have to decide what to take up for their higher studies, should read this one and the path will be clear.Bill Bryson shares his delight with such passion that I am sure it will rejuvenate your interest in science. Surely it did for me."

32,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/671638-sharon,4,"This took me some time to get through, but for the most part, it was a very enjoyable read. And really ambitious, which made the less interesting parts way more tolerable. I'm still not even sure how one even writes a book like this; Bryson said in the intro he devoted three years of his life to learning about science after coming to the realization that he knew so little about who we are, why we are, and all that. Surely that's commendable. But where does he get off taking just three years to cover so much ground and still be so... I don't know, ""Bill Bryson"" about it? (""Bill Bryson"" as an adjective, btw, is code for ""entertaining; oftentimes, hilarious, and always personable."")Some chapters were way more successful than others, as I mentioned above. I devoured chapters on space, anything with the word ""quantum"" in it, bacteria, and weird animals. I found myself putting it down whenever there was talk of fossils. I think I highlighted every sentence and read passages and passages out loud to my husband when I got to sections of our own potential demise (supervolcanoes, solar flares, earthquakes, global warming/cooling, epidemics, diminution in magnetism, asteroids, hypercanes (yep, a thing!). I went down many a rabbit hole and googled many a term (the ""Vermeer"", ""Camera Obscura"" relationship took me a whole day--albeit a rewarding one). In summation, I found the book a tad ""light"" when I was interested, and ""more than sufficient"" when I was bored... but always accessible. So all in all, I think my boy Bryson did a terrific job appealing to the masses.As I've done with past Bryson books, I've included some of my favorite highlighted passages below:On where the Moon possibly came from:About 4.5 billion years ago, an object the size of Mars crashed into Earth, blowing out enough material to form a companion sphere, the Moon. Within weeks, it is thought, the flung material had reassembled itself into a single clump, and within a year, it had formed into the spherical rock that companions us yet. Most of the lunar material, it is thought, came from the Earth's crust, not its core, which is why the Moon has so little iron while we have a lot.On our demise by supernova explosion:Our nearest stellar neighbor is Alpha Centauri, 4.3 light years away. I had imagined that if there were an explosion there that we would have 4.3 years to watch the light of this magnificent event spreading across the sky, as if tipped from a giant can. [Not true, he learns later.] The news of such an event travels out at the speed of light, but so does the destructiveness, so you'd learn about it and die from it in the same instant. [But this won't happen either, because...] For the blast of a supernova explosion to kill you, you would have to be ""ridiculously close""--probably within 10 light years or so [and while Alpha Centauri is that close...] it takes a particular kind of star to make a supernova in the first place. A candidate star must be 10 or 20 times as massive as our own Sun and the nearest likely candidate is Betelgeuse, whose various sputterings have for years suggesting that something interestingly unstable is going on there. But Betelgeuse is fifty thousand light-years away.On Gravity (I actually liked Walter Isaacson's explanations better in Einstein, but what can you do; Bryson did say it was going to be a ""short history"":Every object that has mass creates a little depression in the fabric of the cosmos. Gravity is no longer so much a thing as an outcome - not a 'force' but a byproduct of the warping of spacetime.On the notion of an expanding universe (discovered by Edwin Hubble):All the galaxies in the sky (except for our own local cluster) are moving away from us. Moreover, their speed and distance were neatly proportional: the further away the galaxy, the faster it was moving. ... It didn't take a huge amount of imagination to read backwards from this and realize that it must therefore have started from some central point. Far from being the stable, fixed and eternal voice that everyone had always assumed, this was a universe that had a beginning. It might therefore also have an end. [Dark energy and dark matter discussions come later.]On atoms:Because they are so long lived, atoms really get around. Every atom you possess has almost certainly passed through several stars and been part of millions of organisms on its way to becoming you. We are each so atomically numerous and so vigorously recycled at death that a significant number of our atoms--up to a billion for each of us, it has been suggested--probably once belonged to Shakespeare. ... So we are all reincarnations--though short-lived ones. When we die our atoms will disassemble and move off to find new uses elsewhere--as part of a leaf or other human being or drop of dew.One atom is to the width of a millimeter line as the thickness of a sheet of paper is to the height of the Empire State Building.Protons give an atom its identity, electrons its personality.If an atom were expanded to the size of a cathedral, the nucleus would be only about the size of a fly--but a fly many thousands of times heavier than the cathedral.Electrons are not like orbiting planets at all, but more like the blades of a spinning fan, managing to fill every bit of space in their orbits simultaneously.On Quantum Theory:An electron moving between orbits would disappear from one and reappear instantaneously in another without visiting the space between. This idea--the famous ""quantum leap""--is of course utterly strange, but it was too good not to be true.Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the electron is a particle but a particle that can be described in terms of waves. The uncertainty around which the theory is built is that we can know the path an electron takes as it moves through a space or we can know where it is at a given instant, but we cannot know both. Any attempt to measure one will unavoidably disturb the other. This isn't a matter of simply needing more precise instruments, it is an immutable property of the universe. ... What this means in practice is that you can never predict where an electron will be at any given moment. You can only list its probability of being there.""Bohr once commented that a person who wasn't outraged on first hearing about quantum theory didn't understand what had been said."" Heisenberg, when asked how one could envision an atom, replied: ""Don't try.""Fears have been raised that in their enthusiasm scientists might inadvertently create a black hole or even something called ""strange quarks,"" which could theoretically, interact with other subatomic particles and propagate uncontrollably. If you are reading this, that hasn't happened.On String Theory (don't worry; I put this in here to showcase Bryson's humor!)String theory has further spawned something called ""M theory,"" which incorporates surfaces known as membranes--or simply ""branes"" to the hipper souls of the world of physics. I'm afraid this is the stop on the knowledge highway where most of us must get off.On ""The Final Answer"":Karl Popper once suggested that there may not be an ultimate theory for physics--that rather, every explanation may require a further explanation, producing ""an infinite chain of more and more fundamental principles.""On asteroids (this whole section was so freaking good - I can't possibly include it all): Even if we did manage somehow to get a warhead to the asteroid and blasted it to pieces, the chances are that we would simply turn it into a string of rocks that would slam into us one after the other--but with the difference that now the rocks would be intensely radioactive.On Tokyo:""The city waiting to die"" (not a motto you will find on many tourism leaflets). Tokyo stands on the boundary of three tectonic plates in a country already well known for its seismic instability. In 1995, as you will remember, the city of Kobe, three hundred miles to the west, was struck by a magnitude 7.2 quake, which killed 6,394 people. The damage was estimated at $99 billion. But that was as nothing--well, comparatively little--compared with what may await Tokyo.On lightning:A bolt of lightning travels at 270,000 miles an hour and can heat the air around it to a decidedly crisp 50,000 egress Fahrenheit, several times hotter than the surface of the sun. At any one moment 1,800 thunderstorms are in progress around the globe--some 40,000 a day. Day and night across the planet every second about a hundred lightning bolts hit the ground. The sky is a lively place.On the giant squid (this book is out of the date! The giant squid has been SPOTTED!):Consider the fabled giant squid. It is a decidely substantial anima, with eyes the size of soccer balls and trailing tentacles that can reach lengths of sixty feet. It weighs nearly a ton and is Earth's largest invertebrate. If you dumped one in a normal household swimming pool, there wouldn't be much room for anything else. Yet no scientist--no person as far as we know--has ever seen a giant squid alive.On bacteria:Bacteria may not build cities or have interesting social lives, but they will be here when the Sun explodes. This is their planet and we are on it only because they allow us to be. Bacteria, never forget, got along for billions of years without us. We couldn't survive a day without them. They process our wastes and make them usable again; without their diligent munching nothing would rot. They purify our water and keep our soils productive. Bacteria synthesize vitamins in our gut, convert the things we eat into useful sugars and polysaccharides, and go to war on alien microbes that down our gullet.On your brain:Brain cells last as long as you do. You are issued a hundred billion or so at birth, and that is all you are ever going to get. It has been estimated that you lose five hundred of them an hour, so if you have any serious thinking to do, there really isn't a moment to waste."
33,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4042339-andrew,2,"There are some things that make you like a book and some things that put you off. For me, this one had more of the latter. I can understand why Bryson wrote this. A book on science, with the difficulty taken out makes it all the more accessible to the reader. What is traded off to achieve this, is the kind of scientific rigour which makes the subject matter so enticing in the first place. Bryson all too frequently fails to explain statements made or explanations given for scientific phenomena. This leaves me thinking, what is the point? There is some interesting history and some of the characters are fascinating (hence two stars rather than one). But not enough to make 423 pages interesting to read. This is science 'extra-lite', for those who don't have the desire for knowledge which would drive them to read a scientific book with more substance.I guess the final conclusion would be that the chapters are disparate, with no clear progression from one to the next. A hodge podge of trivia, which I would defy anyone to remember, is the result. With so much popular science out there, it is hard to excuse Bill Bryson for penning something that seems to lack everything I would want from a science book. No doubt others would disagree but for me, this one was a bit of a waste of time."
34,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1635072-marian,3,"You're probably looking at this book thinking it is so far off my normal path. And it is. I'm chalking it up to penance for doing so poorly in every science class I ever attended. I truly gave this book an honest effort, but at 2/3 of the way through I cannot continue. In all honesty, the book probably deserves a 5-star rating given there is no fault to be found with either the research or the writing. The problem here is this reader has a 1-star IQ. So I split the difference with 3 stars. Bryson does have the ability to take mind numbing topics such as hiking the Appalachian Trail and, with this book, all things science yet keep your interest with snarky insights and funny details. So, yes, there were parts that peaked my interest such as the lunatic scientist who thought he could distill human urine into gold, instead stumbling onto the element phosphorus. The part about all the bickering paleontologists was especially interesting. And its always nice to be reminded that at any given moment we're carrying around about a trillion bacteria on our person. But as for the rest, I'll save it for those of you who do not feel you want to shove a hot poker in your eye while learning about the earth's crust. I like my eyes. So I quit."
35,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3881494-john-purcell,5,"I read this book many years ago and for the two weeks it took me to read it, I felt like a genius. However, closing the book having read the last page, I found to my dismay that I had returned to my natural moronic state.Only quite recently I bought the audio book online. It was a drunk purchase, one I immediately regretted on discovering when popping it on in the car (I'd sobered up by that time) that it wasn't read by Bill Bryson but by some over excited, irritating Bill wannabe. As I had nothing but an hour of Sydney traffic ahead of me, I persevered and listened to it anyway.With each passing minute my empty head started to fill with knowledge and sooner than expected I was parking the car at work - the pain of Sydney traffic nullified.I have now listened to the audio book end to end three times in a row and one or two facts have begun to stick.I kinda know a little about quantum physics, geology, biology, astronomy and err... moss. If you're feeling particularly ignorant - and in the age of Google who isn't? - get yourself a copy of Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything. Until science discovers a way for us to download knowledge direct to our brains or invents a genius pill, this is the simplest way to know a little bit about a lot."
36,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89715-sarah,5,"I have to say this is by far one of the best books I've ever read. Although I haven't finished I'm in love with this book. My chemistry teacher gave me it to read a while back and it took me a while to get started on it, but after I did I couldn't put it down. You don't have to have a real passion for physics or biology or chemistry to appreciate the book as a whole. Although I find some chapters more intresting than others, the footnotes that Bryson includes definetly make the book as lighthearted as its supposed to be, even when you're discussing how devestating the effects of a meteor the size of Kansas hitting us would be. His indepth explination of the lives of many scientist make the book easier to relate to. and even in the chapters that I don't find as intresting like the chapter called ""cells"" [I was never that fond of biology] when he dicusses that if you increased the atom to the size of a pea, the cell would be a half mile long and thing the size of cars and basketballs would be spinning around in circles at incredible speeds. This book has introduced me to so many different things, and has made the sciences a lot more approachable then one could imagine. And especially for me, someone who loves chemistry, this book comes out as one of top notch quality. "

His writing makes me laugh out loud and cry with laughter - sometimes I can barely breathe.His research is also wonderful and the facts, presented in this book, are not only interesting, but also startling, fascinating and stimulating. The whole book is wonderfully assembled and a delight to read, re-read and simply to dip into.Indeed... I am re-reading again....It is, however, a severe worry to me that many of the facts that I am re-reading for the umpteenth time appear to be as new to me now as they must have been the first time I read them. Oh my... I'm turning into my parents! Where is my memory going?"
38,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"The number of books on the great advances in science (especially physics and biology) is becoming uncountable. Bryson has the merit of placing this giant evolution in a greater frame (including anthropology for example) and at the same time painting the personal tragedies behind the great scientific progress in a very entertaining way. It is outright staggering how much of the discoveries and breakthroughs were the result of personal ambition, gross arrogance and careerism and how many notable people remained behind in total frustration, because their brilliant insights were not taken seriously. The title of this book of course is misleading, but what Bryson presents here is fabulous!"

I especially liked the fact that it took an interest in scientists who had not been properly documented and whose achievements were attributed to others.Very readable and easy to digest. The information isn't that out of date, and all of it together might be a useful overview of the history of the world. A lot of it I knew, but was pleased to know in more detail."

43,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5491350-maria,3,"The universe is an amazingly fickle and eventful place, and our existence within itis a wonder. If a long and unimaginably complex sequence of events stretching back 4.6billion years or so hadn’t played out in a particular manner at particular times—if, to take justone obvious instance, the dinosaurs hadn’t been wiped out by a meteor when they were—youmight well be six inches long, with whiskers and a tail, and reading this in a burrow.So Bryson named this book ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" and it is really the most accurate name and description for it. He talks briefly about the basics of physics, biology, and some chemistry and mentioned theories of how our universe was established, water, air, and our human bodies and how we are affected and affect all those elements, atoms, Nucleus, DNA and birds, and many other topics. Most importantly, it included environmental awareness.This book wasn't comprehensive to the above-mentioned topics in any way but it gave some new and beneficial tips on them and some points were quite complicated. I enjoyed reading more about biological facts maybe because I love biology more than physics. Bryson talked about the topics through how each scientist viewed and worked on it and that part about scientists was so boring.Below are some of the information that I found interesting:(view spoiler)[-Even at the speed of light, it would take seven hours to get to Pluto. - The average distance between stars out there is 20million million miles- An analysis of a strand of Newton’s hair in the 1970s found itcontained mercury—an element of interest to alchemists, hatters, and thermometer-makersbut almost no one else—at a concentration some forty times the natural level. It is perhapslittle wonder that he had trouble remembering to rise in the morning.- The current best estimate for Earth’s weight is 5.9725 billion trillion metric tons.- Einstein’s papers attracted little notice. Having just solved several of the deepest mysteries of the universe, Einstein applied for a job as a university lecturer and was rejected, and then as a high school teacher and was rejected there as well. So he went back to his job as an examiner third class, but of course he kept thinking. He hadn’t even come close to finishing yet.- The most common types of earthquakes are those where two plates meet, as in Californiaalong the San Andreas Fault. As the plates push against each other, pressures build up untilone or the other gives way. - water is about 1,300 times heavier than air.- The Moon’s steady gravitational influence keeps the Earth spinning at the right speed and angle to provide the sort of stability necessary for the long and successful development of life. We now believe, as you will recall from anearlier chapter, that about 4.5 billion years ago a Mars-sized object slammed into Earth,blowing out enough material to create the Moon from the debris.- Without the atmosphere, Earth would be a lifeless ball of ice with an average temperature of minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the atmosphere absorbs or deflects incoming swarms of cosmic rays, charged particles, ultraviolet rays.- The Sun is ninety-three million miles away. To move a couple of thousand feet closer to it is like taking one step closer to a bushfire in Australia when you are standing in Ohio. When you feel the sun warm on your back on a summer’s day, it’s really excited atoms you feel. The higher you climb, the fewer molecules there are, and so the fewer collisions between them.- The oceans are not one uniform mass of water. Their differences in temperature, salinity,depth, density, and so on have huge effects on how they move heat around, which in turnaffects climate. The Atlantic, for instance, is saltier than the Pacific, and a good thing too. Thesaltier water is the denser it is, and dense water sinks. Without its extra burden of salt.- The seas do one other great favor for us. They soak up tremendous volumes of carbon andprovide a means for it to be safely locked away. - Deprived of water, the human body rapidly falls apart. Within days, the lips vanish “as if amputated, the gums blacken, the nose withers to half its length, and the skin so contracts around the eyes as to prevent blinking. - In extreme situations, dehydration will lead to seizures, unconsciousness, and brain damage.- The scariest, most out-of-control bacterial disorder of the moment is a disease callednecrotizing fasciitis in which bacteria essentially eat the victim from the inside out, devouringinternal tissue and leaving behind a pulpy, noxious residue. Patients often come in withcomparatively mild complaints—a skin rash and fever typically—but then dramaticallydeteriorate. When they are opened up it is often found that they are simply being consumed.The only treatment is what is known as “radical excisional surgery”—cutting out every bit ofinfected area. Seventy percent of victims die; many of the rest are left terribly disfigured. Thesource of the infection is a mundane family of bacteria called Group A Streptococcus, whichnormally do no more than cause strep throat.  (hide spoiler)]Finally, this is not an easy or quick read by any means so If you think of giving it a chance, please give it a considerable time, concentration and actually thinking, to make use of it."
44,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56458845-faye,5,"A multi-book review:A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson (5/5 stars), Small Gods by Terry Pratchett (5/5 stars), The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins (4/5 stars).I found myself reading all three of this novels at roughly the same time, and as I feel that they all complement each other, I will use this review for all three books. (So apologies in advance both for the length of this review, and for the fact it is for three books not just this one.) Small Gods is one of Pratchett's more serious Discworld novels; he deals with religion on a totally different level to say - Dawkins. Dawkins is writing from the perspective of our real, non-fictional world and The God Delusion stems from his belief that there is no god and if all world religions vanished tomorrow, the world would be a better place. Pratchett writes from the fantasy fiction perspective that gods (plural) are absolutely real, but that fanatics of any religion can twist and distort even the smallest of these gods (in this case; the god Om trapped in a tortoise's body) to create a brutal doctrine that only pays lip service to those gods they claim to serve. ""Belief shifts. People start out believing in the god and end up believing in the structure."" (SG; pg190) Pratchett has filled the book with some memorable characters; from Om himself, to Brutha the earnest novice/prophet, to the evil Vorbis (who I am inclined to think is in some way related to Vetinari of Ankh Morpork; only more sociopathic.)Bryson on the other hand, does not discuss religion at all and in A Short History of Nearly Everything focuses on pure history, maths and science; humanity's quest to understand our place in the universe and to quantify the world we all inhabit. ""We live in a universe whose age we can't quite compute, surrounded by stars whose distances from us and each other we don't altogether know, filled with matter we can't identify, operating in conformance with physical laws whose properties we don't truly understand."" (ASHoNE: pg 219)There is no doubt that belief in god/gods can be a huge force for good and for evil. Dawkins does acknowledge some of these good things. ""It [religion] gives consolation and comfort. It fosters togetherness in groups. It satisfies our yearning to understand why we exist"" (TGD: 40%). I would argue that it has also inspired many great works of art, architecture and literature. However despite this concession, Dawkins doesn't hold back, ""Thousands of people have been tortured for their loyalty to a religion, persecuted by zealots for what is in many cases a scarcely distinguishable alternative faith...devout people have died for their gods and killed for them...what is it all for?"" (TGD: 40%) Dawkins is a confrontational writer. He expects everyone to disagree with him (and to be fair seeing some of the nasty comments he gets from Christians I do understand why), and therefore spends a lot of time arguing - and justifying his arguments - to various critics. About half way through the book Dawkins really starts to shine, he proposes some fascinating theories on how and why humanity could have evolved religion as a survival instinct. My favourite quote of his is the following; ""I mean it as a compliment when I say that you could almost define a philosopher as someone who won't take common sense for an answer."" (TGD: 22%) Bryson, in simply not engaging in the topic of religion, does much more to throw doubt on the existence of a higher power watching over us. He makes it seem absolutely clear how insignificant our little planet is in the vastness of the universe. ""..in a single cracking instant we were endowed with a universe that was vast - at least a hundred billion light years across.. - and perfectly arrayed for the creation of stars galaxies and other complex systems."" (ASHoNE: pgs 33-34)He describes in detail the 'big bang' theory that led to the existence of life, and the discovery of many scientific and mathematical principles that have held sway for centuries. The amount of research Bryson must have done for this book is incredible. He writes in an engaging tone on a difficult subject and writes as simply as possible to ensure everyone who picks up this book can understand what he's talking about. He discusses some of the words most famous scientists and geologists; Mary Anning, Marie Curie and Albert Einstein, along with those unfortunate figures from history who never got their rightful place in the history books like Karl Scheele; a chemist who discovered eight of the elements now on the period table and got credit for none of them.To sum up the three books for me in a nutshell; Dawkins argues that belief in god and organised religion makes the world a worse place. Pratchett says that some people - no matter what their excuse - are always going to persecute others. Whether or not gods exist isn't even the issue; the issue is human nature itself. While Bryson says, who cares about discussing religion at all, look at all this cool stuff you didn't know about our shared history and the world we live in and look at what's going on in the universe right now.I very much enjoyed reading these three books alongside each other, and I would recommend all three books to anyone interested in the subjects of science and religion. (Small Gods is part of the larger Discworld series but it is easy to read as a stand-alone fantasy novel, and I hope that no one would be put off from reading it when they see that it is number 13 in a series.)"
45,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3034846-melanti,4,"This is sort of a general overview of different scientific fields that at times seems to talk about everything other than actual science. Considering that his book about hiking the Appalachian trail often talked about everything but hiking the AT, I'm assuming this sort of wandering focus is just a general characteristic of his writing style. Despite that, he does manage to be entertaining even when he's rehashing something I already know about. And that, frankly, is most of the book since he doesn't get into the nitty-gritty and just sticks with basic overviews. It wasn't until the last few chapters that he really got into territory where I felt I was truly learning something new rather than filling in occasional gaps. But he also covers a lot of the history behind various discoveries or, more accurately, the foibles of the scientists that made them. All the petty bickering and common lack of cooperation between all the different scientists, while generally amusing, does leave me in awe that we ever figure anything out! One area where he really excels is by providing analogies that make exceedingly huge or tiny numbers easy to grasp. For instance, in describing the size of an atom, he makes the analogy that the size of one atom compared to a millimeter is about the same as the thickness of a single sheet of paper compared to the height of the Empire State Building - which is much easier to grasp conceptually than 10^−10 m.The book does have some flaws, though. Quite a few of them! Bryson often over-simplifies concepts to the point where his version is a bit misleading, even if it's a lot easier to digest than the full version of the story. There were several times I immediately thought ""That's wrong!"" only to think about it for a minute and realize that it wasn't entirely wrong - it just wasn't entirely right either.And while I don't know enough about the scientists themselves to say for certain, I did get the impression he was doing a bit of cherry-picking and talking more about those with the most colorful stories rather than focusing on those with the most important contributions. So, this book is about as accurate as Wikipedia -- generally correct on the biggest things and having enough detail to get you started on a real understanding but perhaps lacking in accuracy and nuance on all the fine little details.Another thing that really bugged me was the organization of the book overall. It's divided up into various sections - Cosmology/formation of the earth, geology, micro biology, biology, evolution, etc. - and he approaches each topic with the assumption that you know little to nothing about the topic. But that sometimes leads to him telling things way out of chronological order. For instance, in the section about fossils, he talks about how important finding evolutionary dead ends was to substantiating Darwin's theories - but that was MANY chapters before discussing Darwin's theories in detail, so if someone hadn't already had a knowledge of those theories, that particular passage wouldn't have made sense.One last thing... Just one sentence on quantum entanglement? Really? That concept is just so incredibly strange it really deserves three or four! Maybe even a whole paragraph!"
46,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,3,"This is probably Bryson's most popular and best known book, although in my opinion not his best. I have read four of his books this year and I definitely like In a Sunburned Country the most. Probably because its subject is the most interesting for me.And here probably begins my basic problem with this book and the reason why it was hard for me to read it. I'm totally not interested in astronomy, astrophysics and geophysics. But of course, it's not the book or its author's fault, and I knew more or less what this book was about from the beginning. Despite this, I have stuck quite many times in the first chapters about the formation of the Earth and only one of the reading challenges forced me to finish it. Fortunately, the later chapters are more interesting to me.Still, I feel like this book is not as brilliant as some other Bryson books. Of course, as in others, there are a lot of interesting facts here, but the whole book is generally not written in this light, humorous tone that I know from other Bryson's works. A pity, because maybe then it would be easier for me to read it. That's why, and not because I didn't like the subject, I think it's not the best of Bryson's books.Bryson usually can draw my attention to the topics that I'm not interested in at all. But somehow not this time. There are large fragments here that I just ran through, waiting for something more interesting. And sometimes I had to wait a long time. Of course, there are also fragments that I read with real amazement and which I liked very much. But it seems to me as if there were less of them than in the other books of this author.I absolutely do not regret reading this book, which more than about the history of almost everything, is about the history of research on the Earth, its origin and life in general and in detail. And that's very good, because this aspect - the history of conducting research - is the most interesting in my opinion. In general, I recommend this book to all who are interested in this topic. And to those who would like to broaden their knowledge in a rather humorous way."
47,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917681-lady-clementina-ffinch-ffarowmore,5,"This wonderfully written history is ‘short’ only perhaps when one considers the vast vast subject matter that Bryson covers, but not so much so otherwise. But it is informative (and extensively researched), engaging, entertaining, humorous, and awe-inspiring, all at once as Bryson takes us through the universe as it began to what it is today—from much of what lies out there in the skies (that we know of) to our own planet, and what lies on its surface and in its depths (not just its topography and features but also life, plant and animal, fungi and insects, and many others that live or have lived on its land and in its waters). And all of this is explored through the contributions of various scholars and scientists, professionals and amateurs highlighting human intelligence on the one hand, and on the other, perhaps what might be our obstinacy and unwillingness to catch on to new ideas when first proposed or findings when first reached, and far worse, our tendency to mindlessly destroy our planet and only realise what it is we are doing when or just before it is too late. It was interesting to see that not only is the universe a mysterious place, but a lot about our own home—the Earth—remains so too as does life itself, of which we have a rather limited understanding (not only how it came about but also in what forms it may take, what is needed for it to exist, and how much of it (and of how many kinds) there might possibly be on the planet even now). I hadn’t realised that our (human) ancestors had walked this earth for quite as long and quite so long ago as they had. One comes away from the book with feelings of wonder, awe, and curiosity (plus a lot of anger at our own kind for the senseless destruction they have caused and are causing—something I had read in one of Crichton’s(?) books, a character who wonders whether humans are here simply to destroy all there is, kept coming to mind) but most of all, with the satisfaction and pleasure of having read a thoroughly good read."
48,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2778377-rajiv,5,"Bryson wasn't exaggerating when he came up with the title. This book certainly chronicles the history of nearly everything, beginning from the Big Bang and ending right up to us and our antics. It was an exceedingly fun and informative read, and I'll highly recommend it to inquisitive minds of all nature.Most importantly, Bryson is never condescending in the book. He never becomes high and mighty; he never looks down on the reader. Instead, he does just the opposite: he takes you on a journey throughout the known history of the universe as a great teacher would--with love and care. Bryson's tone is very jovial, and it's bolstered by his charm and wit. On top of that, it doesn't only contain history. It actually makes you think. He invokes spectacular images from time to time to exemplify his points and make it easy for the reader to comprehend. Additionally, he makes you think about how it all happened. He is brutally honest when he says we don't know it all; he also doesn't have any vanity when it comes to the acts of humankind on nature and itself.The book is an absolute joy to read. However, I do wish he hadn't concluded on such a depressing note (you'll understand when you read it). Having said that, he aptly summarizes the whole book and the human condition in a few sentences that no one else has ever done: ""As humans we are doubly lucky, of course. We enjoy not only the privilege of existence, but also the singular ability to appreciate and to make it better. It is a trick we have only just begun to grasp.""And with that, I humbly ask you to spare some time for this miracle of a book. You won't regret it."

Not that I took a lot of science courses, but it's a source of fascination for me. There was a lot of stuff I already knew -- if you've read A Brief History of Time the first two chapters are a wash -- but there was also a lot of stuff I didn't. It is miraculously accessible and funny, like all of Bryson's work.This is a textbook on its face, but at its heart is the diary of a grown man coming home every evening for a year with the words ""Guess what I learned today"" sparkling on his lips. It's fun to get excited about dinosaurs and asteroids and sub-atomic physics.My favorite bit, though, it less cheerfully indulgent. In every chapter he peels up a little piece of unpleasantness about our world. How we've poisoned ourselves with lead for four generations with the American government barely batting a lash. How naked we are in the path of an asteroid belt, and how microscopic is our knowledge of them. More compelling -- how every century has had its known truths about the nature of the universe, and how frequently they're wrong.This is my fourth Bryson book, after A Walk in the Woods, In a Sunburnt Country, and I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America After 20 Years Away. He's originally from Iowa, worked in England for most of his adult life, and now lives in Hanover, New Hampshire where I once played D&D every Sunday for three months."
50,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,4,"Not much I can say, some information was a bit dated since this was first published in 2003 and science moves really fast, but other than that this has lived up to the title. It puts as much emphasis on explaining a phenomena as it does in explaining the history of it, how we got to discover it, and sadly enough how the person that should get all the credit is often ignored in the favor of another that just stole the idea. Yeah, people. The last chapters made me quite angry. :( 
The fact is, we don't know. Don't have any idea. We don't know when we started doing many of the things we've done. We don't know what we are doing right now or how our present actions will affect the future. What we do know is that there is only one planet to do it on, and only one species of being capable of making a considered difference. Edward O. Wilson expressed it with unimprovable brevity in The Diversity of Life: “One planet, one experiment.”

It is written very clearly, it's very light on the reader and you don't feel weightend by all of the science behind every page.

Well, if like most people you find textbooks mind-numbingly dull or haven’t read a science book since high school, you probably would not do what Bill Bryson did. He has taken it upon himself to basically teach himself about these subjects, and then write an entire book in an approachable and humorous style that will keep you entertained and…wait for it…actually interested in science again. It’s an ambitious project and we should be very grateful for him making the effort.This book is a conversational primer on all the Big Topics:1) the origin of space, time, and universe (The Big Bang)2) the possibility of alien life in the universe and whether we will ever encounter it3) how all the big scientific discoveries occurred in history and who made them (turns out brilliant scientists are often eccentric, frequently secretive and paranoid, have petty rivalries, and even when they do reveal their findings, are generally derided or ignored)4) the origins of organic life, single and multi-celled5) the proliferation of animal and plant species6) the long process of developing sentience7) the very contentious debate over how primates eventually evolved into Neanderthals and Homo Erectus, and where this happened first - Africa or Asia.Separately, he also dives deep into the microscopic world, with a fascinating review of the basics of chemistry, subatomic particles, neutrons, quarks, etc. Much like Carl Sagan and Neil De Grasse Tyson, he is skilled at making big scientific concepts clearer, even if they remain extremely hypothetical and abstract, like quantum mechanics and string theory etc. This is all the more impressive as he is not a scientist like they are, and is best known for his whimsical travel books. I also discovered he had been chancellor at Durham University in England from 2005 to 2011, so he’s got a fascinating life path.Having been a lifelong reader of SF, I myself go through periods where I feel like I really need to know more about the origins of Life, The Universe, and Everything. In the past, this meant reading a number of books on quantum physics and evolution, such as:1) A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design - Stephen Hawking2) A Universe from Nothing - Lawrence Krauss3) The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution - Richard Dawkins4) The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal - Jared DiamondThis time, I’ve been inspired to tackle two books on quantum physics and String Theory that are notoriously difficult:1) The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory - Brian Greene2) Parallel Worlds: A Journey Through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos - Michio KakuWish me luck!"

Bryson is a great nonfiction weaver of words and I have always enjoyed his books that I read.With almost 600 pages, this book is sooo expansive and thus I am sooo overloaded with new knowledge. Nevertheless, it confirmed that I suck at understanding quantum physics and that I know which science subjects I'd love to learn more: oceanography and extinction. "

As humans, we are mere increments—each of us a musty archive of adjustments, adaptations, modifications, and providential tinkerings stretching back 3.8 billion years. Remarkably, we are even quite closely related to fruit and vegetables. About half the chemical functions that take place in a banana are fundamentally the same as the chemical functions that take place in you.  It cannot be said too often: all life is one. That is, and I suspect will forever prove to be, the most profound true statement there is.If this book has a lesson, it is that we are awfully lucky to be here—and by “we” I mean every living thing. To attain any kind of life in this universe of ours appears to be quite an achievement. As humans we are doubly lucky, of course: We enjoy not only the privilege of existence but also the singular ability to appreciate it and even, in a multitude of ways, to make it better. It is a talent we have only barely begun to grasp.  We have arrived at this position of eminence in a stunningly short time. Behaviorally modern human beings—that is, people who can speak and make art and organize complex activities—have existed for only about 0.0001 percent of Earth’s history. But surviving for even that little while has required a nearly endless string of good fortune.  We really are at the beginning of it all. The trick, of course, is to make sure we never find the end. And that, almost certainly, will require a good deal more than lucky breaks. One of the best books which I regret not having read sooner. It took a lot of time to process even a few paragraphs so it took a lot of days to complete this. But totally worth it! Upon completion, the first thought that ran in my mind was 'Why wasn't school education like this? Entertaining, funny and adventurous'. There is so much information in this book that I feel like reading it at least twice again to retain half the information in it. I definitely got a big picture of the world and I will never be able to look at it the same way again. "
57,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69501269-daniel-adam-garwood,5,"I had no prior knowledge or real interest in science before starting this book. But, ‘If you only ever read one non-fiction book…’ was the passionate recommendation from a friend. So I dived in open-minded, let the current pull me through this lengthy publication, treading water occasionally when concepts impeded the flow. About 20% of the book is dedicated to notes, a bibliography and an index, so the distance isn’t quite as daunting as I first feared.The book presents an overview of the natural sciences through the history of discovery. Bryson explores not just what we know, but how we know it and, just as importantly, what we don’t know. It is hard to imagine the research and talent required to write a tome so accomplished in its scope and execution.With more than a hundred thousand five-star Goodreads ratings and thousands of reviews since publication in 2003, I was very late coming to the party. However, that didn’t prevent me from enjoying and discovering this entertaining and enthusiastic work. For the most part, the writing is accessible and breezy. For example, when discussing the elements, Bryson writes:‘What sets the carbon atom apart is that it is shamelessly promiscuous. It is the party animal of the atomic world, latching on to many other atoms (including itself) and holding tight, forming molecular conga lines of hearty robustness – the very trick of nature necessary to build proteins and DNA.’Although I wouldn’t want to sit an exam on the contents, I’m sure I’ve learned much. There were moments where I paused for reflection, appreciating just how much we owe to some truly great minds. Bryson impresses upon the reader just how miraculous it is that humankind exists today. If there is a future for the human race, I wonder what the next stage of evolution will offer. If you too are late for the party, come on in — the after-party is a blast."
58,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"This is an ambitious book covering the history and development of ideas from a very wide range of topics pertaining to how we (humans) got here. Bryson starts all the way with the big bang, to the formation of the cosmos, the solar system and the planet, abiogenesis, evolution, and finally human prehistory. The book spices up a relatively high-level discussion of the relevant scientific topics with the lives and idiosyncrasies of the scientists who made the critical discoveries. I admire the book for its scope, but an unfortunate side effect is that the book doesn’t get a chance to dive in to any one topic in a satisfying manner. Instead we get an overview of many topics and ideas which is fun sometimes unless you’re already familiar with the topics (e.g. Darwin’s beagle voyages, Watson&Crick’s DNA discovery, spread of humans from Africa, etc.). I personally somehow found the book a little tedious by the end and I was happy when it was over. Marking read, phew. 3/5 - it was okay. I suspect someone less familiar with many of the topics who is content with a broad but shallow overview and willing to hear a lot about the lives of scientists who made the relevant discoveries could enjoy it much more."

What reasoning person could possibly want it any other way?A Short History of Nearly Everything was a mixed bag, but a worthwhile journey. This all-encompassing textbook by a non-scientist is chock full of ""did-you-know"" facts (so many that I had to space out my listening as to not become weary). Of course, some of these were very interesting, but the text is also 15 years old at this point so naturally several sections were dated. It was great as an audiobook because you can drift in and out of serious listening. Accordingly, there were several moments where I was proud to be an Earth citizen and part of this beautiful, unexpected life.Yet, I thought it would be a human history book, not a history of science book. So imagine my surprise when most of the book takes place in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. More likely, this book should be called A Short History of Nearly Everything...That Humans Have Discovered Thus Far. I enjoyed it all the same, but this book focuses heavily on scientific discovery, not human culture over time."

Also, it is genuinely funny at times (carbon being the party animal of atoms, mitochondria behaving as if things wouldn't work out between it and the cell). The measure of space, volume etc are represented though various interesting analogies which makes some concepts easy to visualise and remember. The emphasis on the huge number of things that we still don't know is profound.The problem is, it starts getting too full if trivia at times. I do not particularly care about the intimate details of personalities of all the people who contributed to science. I don't care if a particular palaeontologist used to do his studies naked, or if someone wore flowing gowns, or someone was carrying head of a black man in his bag, or if a scientist thought that his co-worker was ugly.None the less, the book is a good one if you want to relive the school days and pick up a few interesting trifles on the way."

Perhaps I heard ""nearly everything"" and transposed my expectations with one of Bill Bryson's other books about the objects we take for granted around the home. Instead, much of his ""history"" takes place well before written history as he tries to explain universal beginnings and the laws of physics. Granted, he does so MUCH more accessibly than does A Brief History of Time with a gift almost entirely lacking in Stephen Hawking for both humor and analogy.Bill Bryson does have a gift for enticing the reader back, and he uses stories of each quirky people to do it. I was amazed how often groundbreaking discoveries were made by people looking for something else, people who didn't even seem qualified to search out what they were originally looking for. Bryson's endearing writing style will mean that this is not my last book of his, but I don't consider myself informed on ""nearly everything""."

Some of these have arisen because new discoveries have been made since the book's publication, and some classifications have changed. For example, Pluto has been reclassified as a dwarf planet, and the universe is not going to stop expanding, it is speeding up.Bryson has a beautiful speaking voice and I found myself mesmerized by his descriptions which were easy to understand.I'll have to read the whole book some day.4 stars"

I do wonder, however, how outdated this information is (having been published in 2006). So I basically now know a lot that I can't quote in educated company. Still, I feel smarter!This book is so entertainingly written, it's given me a whole new love of science and geography and biology and, and, and ... this will definitely lead me to read more of, not only books of this nature, but of books by Bill Bryson too.What this book mainly taught me is that we know so much, and yet surprisingly little about the planet that we live on, and universe that we live in. It also taught me that the chances of us all dying in some global catastrophe are very high and we are but small ant people running around, destroying everything in our paths until said catastrophe occurs.

Interestingly though that doesn't mean it was bad, it is just long and caters easily to frequently month long stops. It is an easy book to pick up and start anywhere. All in all I really liked it, it is mostly a nicely written history of science and some sciences have more interesting history's than others but they all have their eccentrics. Bill Byrson is always entertaining and fun to read so I would recommend this book even to those a little weary of its length. "

Really enjoyed the way he strung all of these many things together, making it all easy to take in and understand and put into context with everything else that's mentioned. It's inspiring, enthralling, and totally engrossing at all times; I've learned so much from this, and have so many more questions that I'll be looking to explore more soon. There's a sense of wonder this exudes, and an awe at all that we've discovered and done. Highly recommend this, especially the audiobook, which was also done well."

I wanted more, I want more.The amount of information this book carries is just immense. The author is so good that he doesn't let you get bored while throwing at you the stories of one person after another with the slow yet very fast progression of science.Is it a short history of nearly everything? Of course not, that task is near impossible to achieve, but I highly expect this book is among the few that got near that title, in some sense at least.I don't know what else to say, if you are curious, which you should be, ready to and love to learn new stuff, then you should really read this book."

Definitely feel like I would get a lot of value out of a second listen because there was so much information that some things just went in one ear and out the other for me. The earlier sections of the book were much more interesting for me because learning about the Big Bang and how they made those ground-breaking discoveries was exciting and incredible. Learning about microbiological discoveries of recent years towards the end of the book held a little less wonder for me but that doesn't take away from the overall quality of my experience.Learned lots, narrator was chipper and fun, good times."
71,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4882137-rebecca-budd,5,"Every year, I include a book that will challenge my left brain functions. This year it was Bill Bryson’s “A Short History of Nearly Everything.” I have never read any of Bill Bryson’s books before even though he is considered one of North America’s most popular writers of non-fiction. His publishers relish the fact that his name sells books, possibly the greatest competitive advantage in the book making business.“A Short History of Nearly Everything” attempts to tell the story of our universe from the very beginning. Bill Bryson covers a great deal of ground, using a master storytelling style that keeps the reader interested from page one, or track one, if you are listening to the audio book as I did. Listening to his softly modulated, welcoming voice added to the appeal. It reminded me of sitting around a campfire listening to the legends of old.Bill Bryson has a knack of targeting his audience, arguably one of the reasons he is so successful. The story of the universe is not an easy subject, nor is the science behind it. In fact, it can be rather intimidating. Never fear, the complexities have been removed so that the narrative unfolds gently, without complicated equations or complex jargon. Instead, Bill Bryson gives us historical anecdotes about the people who contributed to the collective learning.My overall impression was that Bill Bryson was the intermediary, even a translator, between the scientific community and the rest of us who want to expand our knowledge at a leisurely pace. I was amused, however, by his subtle way of letting the reader know that he was an invited guest to the elite scientific community. But then, who can blame him for being excited about conversing with the biggest names in science.Bill Bryson sparked my interest in looking back in to narratives of science and philosophy in more detail. He reminds us that we do indeed “stand on the shoulders of giants.“When the poet Paul Valery once asked Albert Einstein if he kept a notebook to record his ideas, Einstein looked at him with mild but genuine surprise.”Oh, that’s not necessary,” he replied. “It’s so seldom I have one.” Bill Bryson, A Short History of Nearly Everythinghttps://ontheroadbookclub.com/2013/05..."
72,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724388-sammy,5,"I really love this book. I really think you should read it.I must admit that I'm somewhat biased; I was already a fan of Bryson's work, and I am generally interested in the sciences. Perhaps as a function of that, I believe this to be my favorite of his books (so far).It's hard for me not to talk to people about the things I read in this book. I mean, it's all so completely interesting to me that I think it should be discussed at all times, in addition to the fact that I don't think people realize a lot of the things discussed therein.I read excerpts to my sixth graders, most of whom sigh in response to my enthusiasm, when related topics arise in class, particularly Science and Social Studies (Pompeii is always good for a volcano digression), but I really can't imagine any grown individual of reasonable intellect and range of interests to find this book lacking.And yes, I'm willing to contend that some aspects may be overlooked, or others perhaps exaggerated, but come on: Bryson never claimed to be a scientist. Science is imperfect itself, so who can really harp on someone who's just trying to put a little spunk into what many consider unreasonably drab or unappealing material? If anything, any hiccups in accuracy catalyze debate and arguments, which, inevitably, elevates scientific discourse. Even our failures lead to progress.I consider this book to have been somewhat eye-opening with respect to the cursory science education many of us get (save but for scientists, and those pursuing that area of Academia). I mean, take it from me, one who teaches sixth grade science: the curriculum isn't all that exciting at times, and if you only paid attention as much as most of my students, this book goes a lot farther in teaching you where exactly we live, and how unlikely it is that you're reading this right now.(Those probabilistic assertions being made, I might point you to John Allen Paulos's ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences"" for a similarly eye-opening treatment of mathematics. At the very least, you'll get to wow your friends by calculating the rate at which human hair grows in miles per hour.)"
73,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/605807-jason,4,"I found the title of this work somewhat misleading. Perhaps it should have been called A History of the Natural Sciences or maybe even A Short History of Natural History. Nevertheless, science books often do not sell well so I am sure the idea in titling the book A Short History of Nearly Everything was to attract more of a broad readership. The book itself isn't awful but certainly reads like a survey work. In other words, you won't learn complicated how-tos of scientific methodology but you will get a good general idea of a lot of different topics. Some of the things discussed are the origin of the universe, the solar system, the arising of life, and of course man himself or homo sapiens. I found it slightly paradoxical that Bryson spends a good portion of the book building up this almost supernatural-like awe in the reader for the amazing position we find ourselves in of being alive and also of the magical wonder of the universe itself. It's enough to make even the most staunched atheist have reverence. In fact, I could see an atheist while reading the book saying that's God doing that! However, towards the end of the book Bryson seems to take the counter view that we are ultimately doomed to extinction and with continued acts of stuipidity will be just another blip on the evolutionary scale. Despite this the book reads okay for the most part but is interspersed with relative periods of dryness. However, it's difficult to talk about things like algae and lichens and keep everyone interested at all times. Nevertheless, a pretty good read recommended if you keep in mind that it's a survey book that will help you do well on trivial pursuit but is not going to give you the know-how to usurp the current model of the universe. 3.5 out of 5 stars. "
74,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13166784-adrian-fridge,4,"I can't believe I finally finished this monster of a short history.Imagine all the sciences taught K-12, and it's all here, in way easier format to enjoy. Cosmology, physics, chemistry, geology, biology, anthropology, etc. You get the backstories of the scientists along with the side stories of how said scientists screwed each other over along with side side stories about how none of the scientists can agree on shit. Everything in simple language, or as simple as the author can make it before even he gives up.One of the problems of covering everything is there'll always be at least a topic or two you find ridiculously boring, no matter how much sprucing it gets. My only advice is to not let those sections make you quit the book. Also, apparently even geologists find the history of geology boring, so you're in good company if you, like me, find that part exhausting.There is a lot of self-reflection in the book, such as-- ""there are three stages in scientific discovery: first, people deny that it is true; then they deny that it is important; finally they credit the wrong person.""It also gets philosophical-- ""We are so used to the notion of our own inevitability as life's dominant species that it is hard to grasp that we are here only because of timely extraterrestrial bangs and other random flukes.""On one hand, I want to recommend this book because it's spilling over with information, on the other, I sort of wish this was broken up into a series of mini-books, each covering a specific scientific field. But then, all the fields end up tying together at the end, so maybe a TV mini-series? What I'm saying is this shit is long. It's also dated, seeing at it was printed in 2003. Your mileage will vary."

Quotes:Matters in physics have now reached such a pitch that, as Paul Davies noted in Nature , it is “almost impossible for the non-scientist to discriminate between the legitimately weird and the outright crackpot.”Perforated eardrums were quite common, but, as Haldane reassuringly noted in one of his essays, “the drum generally heals up; and if a hole remains in it, although one is somewhat deaf, one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question, which is a social accomplishment.”Every living thing is an elaboration on a single original plan. As humans we are mere increments; each of us a musty archive of adjustments, adaptations, modifications, and providential tinkerings stretching back 3.8 billion years.

76,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/886733-heather,1,"The ego of modern physical scientists is annoying. The first 3/4ths of this book explains why/how scientists of the past were wrong, ignorant or foolish. The last 1/4th of the book is dedicated to extolling the absolute correctness and superior understanding of modern scientists. Does he not see the irony? As always happens in science, centuries to come will look back upon current belief and see it as elementary and simplistic. Especially in the physical sciences. The hubris of this author (and the people he speaks about) is obnoxious. Consider the current debates among physicists. There is much speculation and theorizing involving quantum theory... which is the very basic component of existence. If even they can't agree then where does Bryson get off acting like he is omniscient? I would have liked this book if it weren't for the smug turn it took at the end.

I am following this up with Cosmos and The Selfish Gene and also have added a few books to To-read list based on references here.Also, it involves almost no maths. But is it suitable for people who have studied from other faculties in high-school (humanities/commerce) in high-school ? Maybe not.Also, I think this is a great gift to some1 in his early teens and to show them what great fun learning can be.

I suppose I could make myself listen to the whole book (got is as an audiobook) and learn a few things to increase my general knowledge about science, only I'm not terribly interested beyond an anecdote here and there, as it turns out. Or maybe it's a question of timing. Or maybe it's because I can't retain names or any kind of factual types of information with my terrible short term memory. I'm art-gal after all. Or maybe it's that right now I seek entertainment in my reading more than anything. In any case, it seemed more tedious than fun and brought me back to high school physics class, which I hated more than anything. Which can't be right because this is Bill Bryson who is usually so much fun, so obviously I'm in the wrong frame of mind. So I'll take the blame, I'm fine with that. So just for the record, my rating doesn't reflect how good or bad the book is, it's a rating of ME as a reader of this book. Sometimes I'm just not a very good reader. "

The audio was well done, but there is so much information in this book and audio books are not great for quickly flipping back to remind yourself what scientist so-and-so was doing the last time we encountered him, or to refer back to dates and measurements and other numbers. (The audiobook is over 25 hours long!) Also, the narrator threw me on occasion because he put the stress on unexpected parts of words. Although I suppose that could just be an American English thing.This book is 15 years old now! It would be great to get an updated edition with the latest developments in certain fields. One chapter mentions experiments that CERN will run until 2012... I tried to google whether they actually found the Higgs Boson. And it seems they did.

Bryson is incurably curious, a trait all too rare in our entertainment-anesthetized society. What's more, he's obsessively curious about science, which elevates his geekiness to the level of sainthood, in my view.

How did life begin, How did the universe begin, what are we made of, are only a few of the question he attempts to answer in a way that the non-science types can understand. And he does this with an abundance of entertaining stories making this one of those books you can put down until the last page. This should be the required text book for basic science classes."
84,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7547539-vyl-n,5,"It‘s informative and easy to read even if its topics are completely unfamiliar to you. I had so much fun listening to the audiobook and I wish more books meant to popularize science were this accessible.* Recommended if you like vlogbrothers’ Crash Course, SciShow and/or Emily Graslie’s The Brain Scoop;* Large number of books mentioned can be used to compile a decent reading list if a particular chapter or a period strikes your fancy."

Bryson is a great writer and I respect his tenacity in summarizing the history of the universe into digestible form for us common folks. Unfortunately, the science felt overshadowed by the innumerable stories of the various white European men who ""discovered"" all these bits of science (and then childishly bickered over them), which I found to be profoundly uninteresting and incomplete as a narrative. Maybe Sapiens would have been a better fit for my interests.On the positive side (there is one!), this world is NUTS and we know almost nothing about it! Wow! Plate tectonics were the most fascinating bit to me. “One of the hardest ideas for humans to accept,” he says, “is that we are not the culmination of anything. There is nothing inevitable about our being here. It is part of our vanity as humans that we tend to think of evolution as a process that, in effect, was programmed to produce us. Even anthropologists tended to think this way right up until the 1970s.”"

Maybe I should start with a confession: I bought it because I thought it was a history book. It's not. Well, not in the traditional sense, anyway.A Short History of Nearly Everything is a science book. It covers the history of the universe and the earth through the lenses of the various branches of science. Cosmology, physics, geology, biology, microbiology, genetics, medicine, and more. They're all in there, and each one is given its own section from which to shine. In a way, this is like a double history book. I know that probably doesn't make much sense, but let me explain. Each branch of science is used to educate the reader on the history and evolution of the universe, our planet, our ecosystem, and even our own bodies. (That's one history.) As the author focuses on each of the scientific branches, though, he gives an historical overview of that branch that includes biographies of important scientists and philosophers and many colorful anecdotes all interspersed with more scientific trivia than I could ever possibly memorize. (And, that's the second history.) -- That's a pretty nifty bit of literary weaving when you stop and think about it! --I gave this book five stars because it's an extraordinary piece of writing in its genre: that genre being the history of science. It is not, however, an history of everything - short or otherwise. I bought A Short History of Nearly Everything thinking that it was a world history book. Had I read the description, I probably wouldn't have bought it at all. But I did...... and I read it...... and I'm damn glad I did!!"

Don't believe me?alllllrightAround very entertaining 500 pages about how lucky you were and you are and I hope you will be.And here we go, it is the end of a wonderful book. If this book has a lesson, it is that we are awfully lucky to be here—and by “we” I mean every living thing. To attain any kind of life in this universe of ours appears to be quite an achievement. As humans we are doubly lucky, of course: We enjoy not only the privilege of existence but also the singular ability to appreciate it and even, in a multitude of ways, to make it better.

93,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy,4,"Things I Learned:Behind every scientific discovery, there is always at least one, but usually a whole team of, totally disfunctional, mad, quirky, buffoonish, amusing, curmudgeonly, anti-social, or stupid scientist(s).If a bunch of scientists are trying to figure out the answer to an age-old question, the most likely person to find the answer is someone not even practicing in the field, perhaps not even a scientist. For example: an engineer figures out a physics problem, or a school janitor figures out a geology problem.If someone makes a bold scientific discovery, they are first dismissed and ridiculed, then when their ideas are finally accepted, they are attributed to the wrong person.There are many many many underappreciated, forgotten scientists in the history of mankind.Clair Patterson is one of them, and he is also my new hero. Thanks to him, and his tireless battle with big corporations (how many scientists are also politcal activists? not many) we don't all have to die of lead poisoning. He has been totally forgotten by history.There are many possible scenarios for us homo sapiens to not have made it here today. Just any one factor being slightly different would make it impossible for us to live here. We are very lucky.There are an equal amount of possible scenarios that we will not be here much longer (asteroids, volcanos, ice ages, not to mention human causes like atomic war).Many times the same things that cause mass destruction are the things that allow us to be alive in the first place. Volcanoes cause many deaths, but at the same time, without them we would still be in an ice age. A huge asteroid could destroy us all, but yet without them, the dinosaurs would never have gone extinct, which means we would never have come around in the first place.Every generation thinks it knows everything, or is at the brink of knowing everything. Every generation has been seriously wrong up to now about almost everything. There is still a LOT that we don't know. Especially about the really miniscule and the really huge. But also about our own histories.We are such a small part of everything, and when we go we will only be a blip, we will not be missed. We can't even comprehend how inconsequential we are. Humans are a blight on this earth. Everything we touch goes extinct. We put all kinds of chemicals in the earth. We overtax all earth's resources. We really are like a virus, leeching onto the earth. When humans go extinct it will be our own fault, but also a very healthy turn of events for the earth and all that live on it. Only then would the earth begin its recovery from us. If I were told that I had to spend decades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods, I believe I would lose the will to go on. Lichens don't.p336 "
94,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9402537-preston-kutney,5,"This book is like a guided tour through a natural sciences museum with a brilliant and witty historian/scientist. Bryson takes you through the history of scientific discovery and explains what we know about our planet and how we discovered it. I learned as much about Cosmology, Geology, Paleontology, Cellular Biology, Quantum Physics, Zoology, Chemistry etc in this book as i have in any of the various science classes I have taken throughout my life. This book will inspire in you awe and wonder; awe at the brilliance of modern science and discovery, and wonder at how far we still have to go. If you spent any time with me while I was reading this book, you will also know that it is full of curious, amazing facts. Here are just a few of many:-Every atom you possess has almost certainly passed through several stars and has been part of millions of organisms on its way to becoming you. It has been suggested that a significant number of our atoms, up to a billion for each of us - probably once belonged to Shakespeare, A billion more each came from Buddha and Genghis Khan and Beethoven and any other historical figure you can name. -There is enough salt in the sea to bury every bit of land on the planet to a depth of about 150m.-The indigestible parts of a giant squid, in particular their beaks, accumulate in sperm whales’ stomachs into ambergris, which is used as a fixative in perfumes. The next time you spray on Chanel No. 5, you’re dowsing yourself in the distillate of unseen sea monsters.-Fossils are incredibly improbable: it is estimated that only one bone in a billion ever becomes fossilized. Most of what lived on earth has left no record at all. It is estimated that less than one species in a thousand has made it into the fossil record. -A typical solar flare, something that we wouldn't even notice on earth - will release the energy equivalent of a billion hydrogen bombs and fling into space 100 billion tonnes of murderous high-energy particles.-In the 1960s, geologists studying Yellowstone National Park were searching for the volcano that gave the park so much volcanic activity. After NASA began testing high altitude cameras, it was discovered that the entire park - 65km across - was the crater of an ancient supervolcano. Its largest past eruption was 1,000-2,000 times more explosive than Mt. St. Helens, exploding with the energy of 500,000 to 1,000,000 Hiroshima nuclear bombs. This supervolcano is 30,000 years overdue for an eruption.This book was a blast to read, and gave me an incredible appreciation for the wonder of creation and the massive odds life has overcome in order to exist as it does today."

I’ve listened to the audiobook, after finishing it I felt like if I’m saying goodbye to a friend :/I was skeptical when I read the title for the first time, I mean how can someone tell you the history of nearly everything in just 600 pages ?! fortunately the author did a great job not only in talking about multiple disciplines in science but also in the way he did it, he didn’t dive into any mathematical equations or scientific symbols and that was astonishing! I highly recommend it to anyone interested in science.كتاب ممتع يأخذك الى عالم اخر حيث يعرض أمامك قصة كل شيء ""تقريبا"" بأسلوب سلس وممتع، العجيب في الكتاب أنه يتحدث عن العلوم بشتى أنواعها انطلاقا من الكون والفيزياء مرورا بكيمياء الذرة ونظرية الأوتار، الخلية والكائنات الحية وطريقة عملها وتصنيفاتها، التلوث البيئي والغلاف الجوي والجيولوجيا ثم البراكين والزلازل والألواح التكتونية وانتهاء بالمستحاثات وتطور الكائنات الحية (مع أنني لاأتفق معه في العديد من النقاط في هذه الأخيرة) كل هذا دون ان يثقل كاهل القارئ بالمعادلات والرموز العلمية وانما يوصل الرسالة بأسلوب سلس وممتع للغاية.صدمني في الكتاب المجهود والتضحية التي قام بها العلماء في سبيل فهم الظواهر الكونية، لكن ما صدمني أكثر هو رفض المجتمع العلمي النتائج التي توصل اليها هؤلاء العلماء بعد جهود مضنية وحتى إن تقبلها فإنه ينسب العمل والجهد المبذول إلى الشخص الخطأ شعرت في لحظة من اللحظات بان أغلب جوائز نوبل تم تسليمها لأشخاص لا يستحقونها!!

عندما يأتي شخص ما باكتشاف جديد، يمر الاكتشاف من ثلاث مراحل قبل أن يتم قبوله من المجتمع العلمي:لا أحد يصدق ما قيل.لا أحد يعتقد أنه المهميٌنسب في الأخير (بعد أن يتم قبوله) إلى الشخص الخطأ.

تتكرر هذه المراحل الثلاث مرارا وتكرارا في الكتاب.أنصح الجميع بقراءة هذا الكتاب خاصة المهتمين بالعلوم.سأقرأ النسخة العربية من الكتاب في أقرب وقت ممكن إن شاء الله."
96,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,4,"They should have called this book ""A Short History of Nearly Everything We Think We Know"". Nearly every chapter ends with the idea that so many world views at the time have been wrong and/or that anything that we think we know now is only the smallest fraction of everything that there is to be known.I loved it for the way it made me feel. I mean, when you realize that all around us and inside us there are things that are just way too complicated, fast, powerful, and undetectable for us to understand, it is truly humbling. From the chapters on how huge the universe is, to the uber complicated workings of our cells, the feeling of wonder and awe that it instills in the reader is truly great.When you realize that just by stepping outside and grabbing a handful of dirt you are inadvertently collecting about a billion organisms (such as bacteria, and protozoa, most of which have never been cataloged) you realize how little it is that humans can ever truly know about the universe.The book's last four chapters details what anthropologists believe to have been the ""evolution"" of man. It shows the reader many of the holes that there are in this theory but in the end just accepts it for the established scientific dogma that it is. As I have mentioned before in my reviews, after having read Harun Yahya's brilliant dispelling of the evolutionary theory, I no longer believe that evolution is a viable scientific argument.In the end, I truly enjoyed the book for the wealth of knowledge that it contains, and recommend it for anyone trying to get a better understanding of ""A Short History of Nearly Everything We Think We Know"". "
97,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-he-him-his,4,"There are two reasons why this gets rated so high for me, especially since I knew a lot of the stuff they talked about. Hey, I like educating myself about random things. And, it can be pretty damn random from time to time.1. Scientists are hilarious. If you don't believe me on that, keep in mind that they keep some of the pettiest grudges and also have the oddest hobbies. Newton and Linnaeus are my favorites of the bunch described in here, but I was pretty fond of the whole group who discovered DNA. If you're not familiar with why they're hilarious, then you just have to read this book. There are more scientists out there, but those few stand out to me.2. It's incredibly humbling. This book goes from describing the very big to the very small. Whole universes and entire species are described. The inner workings of all of those things and more. Then, you also have quarks in here, the minutiae details of things that you just take for granted. And, you just take a step back after a paragraph or chapter and think to yourself: ""Wow. And, then there's me."" All of these things and, somehow, here we are. It's so humbling.Not only that, but you're bound to find something interesting in this book. Such as, I love anthropology, genetics, and quantum mechanics. (Even though the latter completely baffles me no matter how many times I read about it.) All of those featured in this book. I'm not so into physics, geology, botany, taxonomy, and some other stuff, yet it was still so interesting.Really, this is a must read. It can really put life into perspective."
98,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,3,"Non-Fiction. Bryson's travelogue of scientific discovery is heavy on trivia and light on science. This is a history more than a science book, which is right in the title, I know, but in the introduction, he says he set out to discover what scientists know, like how much the Earth weighs, and how they figured that out, but mostly what we get is who figured it out and when. The science is watered down, but the stories of scientific achievement (backstabbing and all) make up for it, and Bryson does a fair job of recalling figures from previous chapters when they pop up again in a totally different context, and they do that a lot. Scientists used to get around. Bryson also goes out of his way to identify questions we don't have answers to yet; always an important part of science -- knowing what we don't know. Because this is Bryson it can be laugh out loud funny at times, but read this for the scientists, not the science. Three stars. It's a lot more fun than, say, anything by Richard Dawkins or Jared Diamond, but nowhere near as intensive. Might make a good starter book for someone who wants more science in their life but doesn't know where to begin.Note: if you're squeamish about apocalypse, I suggest skipping Part IV: Dangerous Planet, which is all about how we're going to die horrible fiery deaths."
99,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4676495-reluctant-anesthetist,0,"If science books constituted a buffet, this is an hors d'oeuvre : quick and light and appetizing.The genius of Bryson lies in dishing up huge numbers in a palatable style e.g, compressing Earth's history into a 24 hour day ; if Earth were an apple we wouldn't yet have brokrn through the skin and a lot of other smart-ass comparisons to help us visualize the dry scientific numbers.I (tried) read(ing) the full version in the summer of 2011.It was interesting,yeah but sounded text-bookish due to so many names and numbers.This time, however, I've got an exciting new edition abridged and edited for younger audience ; most of the text has been replaced by clever pictures, comics, blurbs, actual photos of people and places ; it's fascinating experince just looking at its glossy compositions.Last time I read a book this fascinating was in 2007, Reader's Digest's ABC of Human Mind.I found it in my college library ; used to bunk chemistry classes just to be able to read it within college timings.I think that might be one of the reasons why they chucked out my name from the college register that year, but heck! it was bewitching. Moreover,ASHONE is a perfect gift for a nerdy kid.Reading it with my younger brother has been so much fun.Recommended for everyone who's remotely interested in science.Just pick it up and Bryson will take care of the rest."
100,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/656942-david,4,"There are, broadly speaking, two classes of interesting popular science books. The first class is written by scientists who want to reach a popular audience; the second class is written by journalists who find a particular scientific topic interesting. Good examples of the first class include the writing of Henri Poincare (The Value of Science is a recent printing of three of his books in one volume -- still relevant over a century after they appeared, and it made me wish I could read the original French) or Steve Strogatz's Sync, and good examples of the second class include Gleick's Chaos and Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything. The usual failure mode for books written by experts is poor balance between the details and the big picture; the usual failure mode for books written by journalists is when the information conveyed is inaccurate or incomplete in a way that presents something skewed. Bryson's book is surprisingly good, a sort of travelogue through part of the scientific world that has the same flavor has many of his more conventional travelogues. The facts are there, the feel is right, and the whole thing is entirely entertaining without providing anyone the illusion that it's comprehensive. Good stuff."
101,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7866970-ritika,4,"I think the most notable part of this book was my surprise at how much I enjoyed this. As a reader who has never enjoyed non-fiction, barely passed Physics and is yet to decipher the difference between an AC and DC motor, this book came as quite a refresher. Bill Bryson is in love with science, realizes it is usual to not be in love with science and then does his best to show us why he loves it so. In the process, we get introduced to a world of marvels and mysteries and shocks, from our pillowcases to the stars.The raison d'etre behind the popularity of this book is obviously the accessibility of its facts. History, science, evolution is made alive to us with anecdotes, ego battles, doomed scientists and rags-to-riches stories. We are at once made inconsequential in front of the universe and then become the greatest story of survival ever written.Men become heroes and then the villains who put the very survival of earth in question. Not all this is unknown. But Bryson's book is rich in fascinating details and though begins to drag a little in the middle, is an easy read if taken in short bursts rather than a long read."
102,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"In about 600 pages, Bill Bryson has the audacity and talent to tell us not only the history of science and its major discoveries but, also how it works. He even takes advantage of it all to portray some scientists in delicious, although at times doubtful biographical sketches. In fact, in order to tackle such a challenge (how to make difficult and seemingly dull subjects interesting to a large audience) Bryson decided to adopt a very simple and entertaining approach. Thus, the whole seems at times a bit caricatural. For instance, clichés are used to enhance the interests of some topics (the eccentricities of some researchers, where we might ask if there were true or, the products of posthumous legends) and, it's often too superficial (the chapter on human evolution). But, BUT, despite it all the author constantly remains fascinating and engaging and, there's an awful load of stuff to learn! Considering the craziness of his goal, we therefore can easily forgive him his little defects -unavoidable perhaps regarding, once again how challenging such a task was.If you just want to read one and only one science book your whole life, make it this one. "
103,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1969357-jane-ps,5,"I loved this. My interest level was engaged throughout; Bryson delivers a mountain of information in a lively manner, with a good dose of humour, and providing 'personality' and background information almost irrestibly. Whilst I'm sure purists would criticise aspects of this book, it opens the world of science, nature and the universe to those of us who have not continued in these studies but remain interested generally. I highly recommend this book. This would be the ideal audiobook for a long car journey, engaging all ages and maybe encouraging into this line of work future Nobel prize winners :)This will definitely be a reread for me. There is so much information, I have no hope of retaining any decent percentage.Audiobook: narrated excellently by William Roberts. 5 stars."
104,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13023195-isi,5,"I have little to say about this book, except for leave whatever you are doing and read it. Now.This is a book about every branch of science, which explains what we know, how we got to know it, and what is still ahead of our actual knowledge, including brief biographies of great scientific men and women who studied issues and made discoveries we now take for granted. And all that is told in a humorous and concise manner, which not only does it make you get involved in all the mysteries of our world, but also be willing to learn more.Full review on my blog"
105,076790818X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66846583-yanique-gillana,4,"Again, another book where I wasn't the intended audience. Objectively I thought this book was great. It broke down the big concepts of science, history, biology, archeology, and anthropology, in chronological and easily digestable segments. It starts at beginning of the universe and explores our progression from that point on. The writing style for this was conversational and humorous which I think will enhance the learning experience.As a scientist at my education level, I feel like the this book was not a necessary read and offered nothing new to my knowledge or understanding, so keep that in mind if you decide to dive into this one.

It was one of the first books in the conversational non-fiction genre that I became absolutely obsessed with for two years around 2010-2012. It goes off on delightful tangents and explores fascinating pockets of history. Few non-fiction books have been such pure delight to read. Up there with Guns, Germs and Steel and The Selfish Gene as a book that is as riveting as a fiction novel and better paced then many supposed thrillers."

But this was always easy to understand and a joy to read. I think non-fiction should always take a bit longer to read too.

It took me forever.It seems unfair to give it two stars because it is well researched and impressively put together - - but three stars would mean ""I liked it"", and I really can't say I did. I tolerated it. I appreciated the educational value of it. But liked it? Unfortunately no.The good news though is that in the progression from physics to biology to anthropology, it became increasingly interesting to me, and you could tell that Bryson also had a better grasp on the subject matter. The anthropology section was interesting enough that it makes me want to read a book on that subject alone. I recall touching upon the development of man in school, but clearly the details were lacking. I had no idea there were so many competing theories.All in all, for the right reader, I can see why this book is beloved. It delivers on the promise of its title. It just seemed to focus too much on the people involved for my taste and really didn't quite explain the science well enough for me to truly grasp it. I muscled through."

This is perhaps one of the best scientific (or historic or whatever you consider this) books I have ever read since, in my opinion, Bryson gave every view and counter-view enough consideration and offered them to the readers in a fair manner that does not seem to prefer one over the other unless it has been proven that one is without a doubt the correct one."
