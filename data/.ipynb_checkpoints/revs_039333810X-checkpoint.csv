0,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,2,"[Original review, written December 2008]When I read this book, I remember thinking it was pretty interesting, but I am surprised how few insights I have retained... to be honest, hardly any. Smolin's The Trouble with Physics, which I read much more recently, suggests that string theory is in big trouble, and right now I am more tempted to side with Smolin.There's this old Nasrudin story, where he's somehow ended up as judge in a court case. The D.A. really makes a good case, and Nasrudin can't restrain himself. ""Yes, you're right!"" he shouts. Then the defense lawyer gets up and makes his pitch, and Nasrudin is equally impressed. ""Yes, you're right!"" he shouts again. The court recorder clears his throat and leans over towards Nasrudin. ""Your honor,"" he says respectfully, ""they can't both be right!"". Nasrudin shakes his head. ""Yes, you're right!"" he agrees.Well, between Greene and Smolin I feel a bit like Nasrudin, but luckily I am not the judge here. Am I just agreeing with Smolin because I heard him most recently? Maybe. But trying to correct for that, I still think that there is a reason why Smolin seems more convincing and memorable, and why very little of what Greene says has stuck. String theory has become so divorced from experimental reality that it rarely if ever gives you that feeling you get from good science, of suddenly grasping a real physical phenomenon that you have known about for a while, but not understood. I guess the example that makes me least happy is supersymmetry, according to which every particle has a supersymmetric partner. Compare this with the discovery of the periodic table in the late 19th century, or the development of the Standard Theory in the 60s and 70s. There, insightful people gradually realized that objects (atoms in the first case, subatomic particles in the second) were related in a complicated pattern. Most of the time the pattern fit, but there were a few holes, and they were later able to find the things (new elements, new particles) that filled in the holes! I was astonished to read that there is not one single particle which has a known supersymmetric partner - so far, it's all hypothesis, and perhaps none of these ""selectrons"", ""photinos"" etc actually exist. I'm not saying that this means supersymmetry is wrong; I'm just saying it means I don't find it exciting. Maybe next year they will get the LHC working, discover a whole slew of supersymmetric partners (even one would be a lot), and put string theory on a proper experimental footing. If that happens, I'm sure I'll go back to reading books on this subject; I won't be able to stop myself. But until then, well, it may be beautiful math, but I feel no emotional connection to it. I'd love to hear from people who disagree, and can explain to me just what it is I'm missing out on.__________________________________[Update, May 2011]We had another particle physicist over for dinner last night. He'd come mainly to play chess, but when I found out that he was involved in looking for supersymmetric particles I took the opportunity to ask how it was going. Well: assuming he's to be trusted, and he sounded pretty knowledgeable on the subject, we should know pretty soon. The LHC is now up to high enough energies. They're collecting data. If supersymmetric particles exist, there is every reason to suppose that we'll have clear evidence of them within a year or two.I wondered what would happen if they didn't find any supersymmetric particles? Would the theoreticians just retreat into saying that they needed a more powerful collider? Not so, said my informant; if the particles can't be found at the current range of energies, the predictions were wrong. Sounds like we're finally getting a straight up-or-down vote.String theory, you can run but you can't hide!__________________________________[Update, September 2011]I knew it was too good to be true. We had yet another particle physicist over, whose PhD topic had been something to do with searching for a supersymmetric quark. I asked her if it really was the case that we'd soon know if supersymmetric particles existed.Alas, it turns out that, although the energies they're now reaching in the LHC are indeed sufficient to find supersymmetric particle according to the mainstream versions of string theory, there are other versions which predict higher energies - energies which are outside the LHC's range. ""Of course,"" she added, ""the mainstream version is the one that contains the original motivation for supersymmetry. If they retreat to one of the other versions, then most of the rationale disappears. But people have a lot riding on string theory.""""That's terrible!"" I said indignantly. She just shrugged her shoulders. __________________________________[Update, May 2015]Browsing the physics section at the South Australian State Library earlier this week, I picked up a copy of Becker, Becker and Schwarz's 
String Theory and M-Theory
 (2007). The introduction says clearly that supersymmetry is essential to string theory/M-theory, and moreover that the LHC should be able to reach high enough energies to produce supersymmetric particles, if they do in fact exist. Consulting Google Scholar, my impression is that the book is highly respected: I see 661 citations.Eight years later, no supersymmetric particles have been observed. But no doubt string theorists have an explanation for this inconvenient fact.__________________________________[Update, Dec 2015]Hey, if you think I'm being mean to those poor string theorists, just look at what Randall Munroe said the other day!__________________________________[Update, August 2017]It struck me today that the people who are criticising CERN for spending so much money finding the Higgs boson are wrong on at least two counts. First, $13B isn't actually such a large price tag for making a fundamental discovery about the laws of the universe, the truth of which is obvious only in retrospect; many physicists were unsure that the Higgs existed. Second, and perhaps even more importantly, there's the dog that didn't bark in the night. Many physicists were also expecting to find supersymmetric particles, but none have been detected. This greatly weakens the plausibility of string theory and shifts attention to competing theories for unifying quantum mechanics and gravity, of which by far the most attractive is Loop Quantum Gravity.Speaking as someone who used to work for NASA and was involved with the International Space Station project ($150B and counting), I would say CERN has given the taxpayer value for money and then some. It's a pity that all research funding isn't allocated in such a responsible manner.__________________________________[Update, March 2018]On pages 368-9 of Leonard Susskind's 2008 book The Black Hole War, I find the following passage:... there is a whole collection of particles whose existence is only conjectural, but a lot of physicists (including me) think they may exist*. For reasons that are not important to us here, these hypothetical particles are called superpartners.* We will know within a few years, when the European accelerator called the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) starts operating.Well, there it is again. Susskind, one of the foremost proponents of string theory and a world-renowned expert on fundamental physics in general, said ten years ago that the LHC would soon find the superpartners/supersymmetric particles if they were there. It hasn't found them. Ergo... "

Do I understand string theory? Not sure.Do I understand M theory? A little bit but don't ask for any algebraic reasoning.Do I know exactly what a Calabi-Yau is? Not really but I think they look a little like the hair balls from my cat.This is the second time I've equated quantum physics and all its detours to a hair-ball. That's because I can study a hair ball and still have no idea what it is for and why they exist. String Theory and the elusive TOE is in the same category. I could go on my entire life not knowing about them but now that I do, I need to know why. Newton, Einstein, Feynman, Hawking, and my cat can't all be right. Or can they?That is essentially the dilemma of string theory and the book. Greene does a great job of putting everything in layman's term but there is a point which he must exceed the intellectual ionosphere and soar into the incalculable. I really like this type of book. The challenge is the fun. But rest assured when the scientists get their act together and write an Idiot's guide to The Unified Theory Of Everything, I'll be the first in line.P. S. Hair balls and string theories have something else in common. Once you tore one apart, you can never get your hands clean."
2,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44618-alisha,5,"I left Christianity a few years ago and swore off religion altogether; however, after reading this book, string theory has become tantamount to religion in my life. Brian Greene writes beautifully about particles, planets, and the origins of our universe as we know it today. It is a heavy book- I don't recommend it for anyone who wants a quick, easy read. It took me almost two months to get through, but I learned a tremendous amount and came away in complete awe of the world and the forces at work in it today. Since Green wrote his book string theory has come under intense scrutiny; despite this, I would still support this book on the basis that it is gorgeously written, based in fact (many of the experiments and proofs were done by Greene himself), and incredibly informative. A vertible Bible of where we came from, where we're going and the incredibly complex way things function in this glorious universe of ours."

Perhaps these beings are real and at certain levels of dimensional perception they have already seen and experienced these advancements in human history like a child being taught 2+2 to the wave compilation of an electron Y=h/mc = 2.43*10-12m.Mathematics, My Daddy says is simply a game or a toy for the mind. I enjoy playing with math though I truly know now that it is not Universal Knowledge. Mathematics is like some sports. It brings Me fun and excitement. Sometimes I get low scores and I feel sad, but My Daddy simply tells Me that if I want to perfect the exams, I have to study harder. As you all can see, all the so called greatest mathematicians and scientists and physicists humans' scholars humans gave so much high regards to have immediately realized that all those books and all those studies and all those ""humans once thought of as knowledge"" became child's play if not garbage right upon My Daddy revealed this Universal Truth and Knowledge. Literally speaking, humans are among the most primitive civilizations in The Universe and yet we humans are very arrogant, sinful and blasphemous because we, humans do not know any better."

5,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"For most of my life, physics and the general sciences have seemed beyond me. At the same time, I've been lucky enough in high school and university to have instructors who are willing to let me ""give science a try"" in a not threatening way. This book is one such attempt to allow ordinary people to give science a try. In this book, you'll get a crash course in physics as an evolving subject, from the theory of gravity, to special relativity, to general relativity, to quantum mechanics, to string theory, you'll be taken on a fantastic journey into the heart of science. A word of warning, though, one of my geeky friends told me that ""String Theory"" is now a passing fad. That might put you off the book. I still felt like there was a lot of value in reading this book simply as a mental challenge. The book was challenging to read, even if it is supposed to be dumbed down physics.  "
6,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,2,"AN INTRODUCTION BY WAY OF HYPERBOLIC SENTIMENT: The Elegant Universe is ""The Bible"" of superstring theory[*:].I close the covers of The Elegant Universe with powerfully mixed feelings. On the one hand, Brian Greene gives us a lucidly-written layman's-terms explanation for high-concept modern physics, providing an excellent survey of 20th century science and painting a vivid picture of a promising strategy for reconciling the discrepancies in the otherwise dominant theories. On the other hand, about half-way through the text, it devolves into (what feels like) a navel-gazing vanity project that fails to connect that promising strategy with the target audience (i.e., the layman that actually gives a damn about modern science).To be clear: the first third of the book is a remarkable accomplishment. Brian Greene is a cogent writer with a wonderful pedagogical streak that is able to produce a clear image of some otherwise hard-to-decipher concepts in modern physics. Because of The Elegant Universe, I feel like I now have a fairly good understanding of the core concepts underlying Einstein's theories of special and general relativity, and quantum mechanics (e.g., Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle). Greene is also able to give a decent explanation regarding how these theories break down when you try to ""merge"" them (e.g., like when you come up with ""infinite energy"" and/or ""infinite mass"" and/or ""infinite probabilities"" through calculations of black holes or the Big Bang).This first third of the book is very accessible, very enjoyable, and very informative. Engaging, fascinating, and extremely powerful.Somewhere during that potent 130-150 pages, Greene remarks (something to the effect of): You cannot be said to fully understand something until you can explain both its system and significance to a complete stranger. (Not a quote, but I'm sure you know what I'm getting at...)And with that statement does Dr. Greene undermine the remaining two-thirds of the book. After introducing string theory, after explaining that it is a strategy with the potential to marry relativity and quantum mechanics, after getting you (the lay-reader) excited that you too will have some insight into the critical significance that is superstring theory — he glosses over some math (which doesn't really feel like physics after that first 120 pages) and more/less asks you to ""bear with me here, trust me..."" EXAMPLE: after introducing the concept of strings, the text rushes into a discussion of 6-dimensional ""curled up"" Calabi-Yau manifolds without really giving a good way of visualizing that whole mess[†:]. EXAMPLE: after 2 or 3 chapters about string theory where Greene is introducing it and discussing how it might reconcile relativity and quantum mechanics, he starts to segue into reconciling aspects of string theory with itself — looping back (like its own subject strings) on itself in a perverse recursion full of mathematical adjustments and jargon. EXAMPLE: in the midst of discussing how this New Science, and where you expect it to loop back on the promised explanations for the Old Science, Greene veers off into a series of anecdotes about ""this one time at Harvard..."" and/or ""once at Princeton we stayed up all night and..."" — which really just seemed a little gratuitous.By the time I realized what was happening, my attitude was already tainted. Perhaps I could have extracted more of the science if my cynicism hadn't kicked in so virulently and so early on in the reading. Perhaps spending more time with the end-notes will prove fruitful. Or perhaps on a future, subsequent follow-up reading I will discover that I was right the first time and we have 150 or so pages of incredible science writing and the remainder is chintzy vanity project[‡:].RATED FOR HYPE: ★★★★★RATED FOR STYLE: ★★★☆☆RATED FOR SCIENCE: ★★☆☆☆---[*:] Let's hear it for faith-based science?[†:] This is partly me being overly critical of Greene's (in my opinion) cavalier treatment of the Calabi-Yau concepts immediately following their introduction. There are some end-notes and citations for further reading, and he does attempt to dedicate some space in the main text to the idea — but his ""dumbing down"" of the Calabi-Yau manifolds to the ""ant in the garden hose"" analogy just doesn't really address it with sufficient vigor. Not after the incredible work he did in the earlier chapters re explaining relativity and quantum mechanics. I suppose I may have been more satisfied with something along the lines of ""you have your time dimension, your three 'regular' space dimensions, and then these other six are really dedicated to providing reference points to describing the shape and vibration of the string IN THE THREE DIMENSIONS YOU ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH"" — but no such explanation was there. If that's even really what he might have meant.[‡:] Which I mean in the nicest possible way...? To be fair, Greene leaves plenty of room throughout the text to permit himself (and his colleagues studying superstring theory) to be ""wrong"". It reminds me of when Robert Wright hedges his bets in 
The Moral Animal
, saying that the evolutionary psychology approach (as championed by himself, Richard Dawkins, E.O. Wilson, Robert Trivers, and others) is a strong one that explains a whole lot but you better be careful before you go painting too broad of a stroke with those kinds of theories... Greene seems to do similar hedging, admitting that aspects of superstring theory seem tenuous (esp. when you consider how many ""adjustments"" they perform while ""fine-tuning"" a given aspect of the theory(s)) and that they (as scientists) are wise to temper their enthusiasm, to not lose sight of goals like ""experimental verification"". But then there's Greene's enthusiasm — which can easily electrify the reader but also just as easily undermine all of that careful hedging."

There is a great quote to the effect that ""if you can't explain a subject in non-technical terms so that a lay person can understand it than you haven't really mastered the subject yourself."" On that basis, it is clear that Brian Greene has DEFINITELY mastered the subject of general relatively, quantum dynanmics and string theory (at least to the extent present technology allows). For such a complicated and often ""non intuitive"" subject, Greene does an excellent job of laying out in understandable terms: (1) the evolution of special relativity into general relativity; (2) the basics of quantum dynamics; (3) the fundamental conflict between general relativity and quantum dynamics; and (4) the amazing development of string theory and (5) the prospects for string theory to be able to resolve the conflcit between general relativity and quantum mechanics and come up with a Unified Theory of Everything (the fabled TOE). Now even with Greene's fantastic explanations, once we got beyond the basics of string theory and onto such concepts as 10 ""spatial"" dimensions, mirror symmetry and Calabi-Yau manifolds, there were times when the subject matter was just difficult to grasp on an intuitive level. However, Greene was quick to point out that the reader (i.e., me) was not alone in that confusion and it did not prevent me from walking away with a much better understanding of these difficult topics. It also made me interested in learning more. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! "
8,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,4,"My local book club picked this book for our non-fiction month. I've been a part of this group- the largest-best Bay Area Book club!!!!In the 5 years I been part of this group, I can't remember a more challenging book to fully understand. The superstring theory is 'taught' by Brian Green' for those of us with maybe a basic Physics level one course. I can't imagine understanding anything, without having had at least some High School or College physics. This book is not for everyone, yet it's Top Notch ....If you have a strong desire to read about The fundamental laws of the universe, how they are structured, then by all means, give this book a shot. I took soooo many notes, and I've still a dozen questions, yet the author does do an excellent job in explaining the new advances of the cosmos that have come to light during this last decade. The author explained over and over... So the lay person may understand that we must merge general relativity and quantum mechanics--and make use of string theory. It's the 'teaching' of the ways string theory appears which begins to get more challenging to comprehend. I've done my best... Yet hoping others in my book club might be able to fill in some holes which went way over my head. "
9,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1843184-szplug,4,"Greene's eminently readable attempt to explain the possibilities for string/superstrings to provide the linchpin for the long-awaited-and-desired merger of gravity with the two nuclear and electromagnetic forces into a Grand United Theory. Frankly, the entire idea of rolled up dimensions—of a universe containing perhaps ten, twelve, eighteen dimensions, of which we are only capable of perceiving four—is suitably mind-blowing and humbling at the same time; and although Greene's low-culture themed analogies that frequently pop-up to help elucidate the complex concepts he is trying to convey may irritate at times, he does a bang-up job in making it understandable without blotting the outlines in thick physiquese or mathematics. Surfer-Dude physicist Garrett Lisi submitted an 
Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything
 based upon the stunningly beautiful symmetry of Lie Groups as an alternative to String Theory a couple of years after the publication of Greene's follow-up 
The Fabric of the Cosmos
; it will be interesting to see how Lisi's proposal affects the future of string/superstring theory as the most likely path towards that elusive group-wedding of the four forces. I believe that several physicists have now concluded that Lisi's theory doesn't hold up, but I'm intrigued by the rumblings I've encountered by others who consider string theory to be a corridor that is proving of a confining narrowness, one that has consumed a disproportionate amount of the energy from some of the top minds in this field in pursuit of a theory that more and more appears irreconcilably inelegant and complex for the unifying end that it is meant to achieve. I have some potentially stunning books on the shelf awaiting my attention—in particular, Lisa Randall's 
Warped Passages
, Michio Kaku's 
Hyperspace
, Michael Fayer's 
Absolutely Small
, and Lee Smolin's 
The Trouble With Physics
—all of which I have unfortunately neglected for some time now, but are ripe with the promise of immense rewards to the mind when their contents are finally consumed.Personally, one of the most stimulating moments in the The Elegant Universe was Greene's articulation of how we, as humans, are travelling through time at the speed of light; thus tickling my brain with the thought that light—immune to the mundane effects of forward-marching time—is a bridge towards an omnipotent godhead. If light is moving at the speed of light through space—not time—is it possible that its entire permutation from Big Bang through to Cosmic Deflation would be accessible in a single given moment of time, i.e, if some manner of consciousness—not necessarily as we conceive of it—was to exist at that level of configuration, would the entirety of past, present, and future—the ticking tenure that provides the structural frame for the playing out of human existence—be available? At temporal lightspeed, can any photon wave/particle duality be positionally known within Space-Time as it cannot to our Time-delimited minds? Would access to this particular modular level of existence—as alien as it may be to comprehend—be the beginnings of omniscience and the hierarchical understanding of how the universe plays out/was meant to play out/will play out? As an object approaches the speed of light, its mass becomes infinite—would the same exponential assault waylay ever-present light as it approaches the speed of time? Would fulgent awareness become infinitely sluggish or limited as it neared this clock-marked barrier? From the—for lack of a better word—point of view of Lightspeed, would there exist differing quantum pathways that wend throughout the four perceivable dimensions, and from a high enough level, will they appear identical at select points of chronological evolution? Thanks Brian, for zapping me like you did into further confused wonder."

I had physics in high school, watched Cosmos and tons of other programs on the universe/relativity/quantum physics etc. so I have always had an interest but not enough to have that be my profession - nor am I smart enough in that way. Books like this let you visit that world for a while and this author does a fantastic job explaining general and advanced physics, Einstein, etc with many real world examples. Trust me, your mind will be doing flip flops when he talks about time bending, space travel, etc. After he builds the foundation, he sets the stage to cover string theory which many believe will be the next great leap in figuring out why the universe exists and where is it going. Awesome read to keep your mind sharp."
11,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"‘The Elegant Universe’ by Brian Greene is a general introduction to cosmology and string theory. It is a beautifully written book! However, it is not for beginners. I think some classes in physics or cosmology, or a long-time subscription to a magazine like New Scientist or Science News would be a necessary educational background before reading this book. So. As far as I can tell, the book is a five-star read in clarity and expert knowledge.From Wikipedia, I learned Greene is a genuine scientist. He attended Harvard and got his Ph.D. at Oxford. Greene joined the physics faculty at Cornell in 1990 and was appointed to a full professorship in 1995. He joined the staff of Columbia University as a full professor. At Columbia, Greene is co-director of the university's Institute for Strings, Cosmology, and Astroparticle Physics (ISCAP) and is leading a research program applying superstring theory to cosmological questions. With co-investigators David Albert and Maulik Parikh he is a FQXi large-grant awardee for his project entitled ""Arrow of Time in the Quantum Universe.Greene does an amazing job of condensing a hundred years of cosmological science and physics into a few chapters. He describes in the first six chapters the most cogent and clear explanation of Einstein’s Special Relativity and General Relativity theories I have ever read. He also links past discoveries about electricity, magnetism, and gravity insofar as how such discoveries led to Einstein’s theories. These past discoveries about gravity and electricity also led to what were concurrent studies in Einstein’s lifetime by other scientists on quantum mechanics. Greene leads readers, gently, into how scientific experiments on quantum particles, especially photons and electrons, led to discoveries about the structures of atoms. These explorations have added hints about further mysteries yet to know surrounding the beginning and current state of the universe.Around chapter five, Greene begins discussing string theories in depth. At first, I could follow. Clearly mathematics is the main source behind string theories (and physics), making real-world descriptions difficult. Green makes a heroic effort at avoiding direct mention of the maths (except in the Notes section at the back of the book). He includes drawings and word-picture analogies (using vivid visuals such as walnuts and donuts and trampolines and beach balls and floating astronauts moving about in space), to illustrate the theoretical conclusions derived from the mathematical view of the universe. I understand the necessity of alternative visual examples - how do you describe and show visually the concept of Time, or show how a Planck length of strings affects an invisible, to us, dimension’s dimensions!Frankly, my history/literature brain burned out. This is an example of what killed neurons in my head:“The particular calculation we were performing amounts, roughly speaking, to determining the mass of a certain particle species — a specific vibrational pattern of a string — when moving through a universe whose Calabi-Yau component we had spent all fall identifying. We hoped, in line with the strategy discussed earlier, that this mass would agree identically with a similar calculation done on the Calabi-Yau shape emerging from the space-tearing flop transition. The latter was the relatively easy calculation and we had completed it weeks before; the answer turned out to be 3, in the particular units we were using. Since we were now doing the purported mirror calculation numerically on a computer, we expected to get something extremely close to but not exactly 3, something like 3.000001 or 2.999999, with the tiny difference from rounding errors.” Page 277Wtf does 3 mean to Greene? Confirmation of space-tearing flop transitions by a mirror mathematical version of normal physics mathematics, which proved part of the physics of string theory.Got it?Or this:“Two related notions underlie these observable consequences; we will explain each in turn. First, as we have discussed, Strominger’s initial breakthrough was his realization that a three-dimensional sphere inside a Calabi-Yau space can collapse without an ensuing disaster, because a three-brane wrapped around it provides a perfect protective shield. But what does such a wrapped-brane configuration look like? The answer comes from Horowitz and Strominger, which showed that to persons such as ourselves who are directly cognizant only of the three extended spatial dimensions, the three-brane “”smeared”” around the three-dimensional sphere will set up a gravitational field that looks like a black hole. This is not obvious and becomes clear only from a detailed study of the equations governing the branes. Again, it’s hard to draw such higher-dimensional configurations accurately on a page, but figure 13.4 conveys the rough idea with a lower-dimensional analogy involving two-dimensional spheres.....Moreover, in Strominger’s 1995 breakthrough paper, he argued that the mass of the three-brane— the mass of a black hole, that is—is proportional to the volume of the three-dimensional sphere it wraps: The bigger the volume of the sphere, the bigger the three-brane must be in order to wrap around it, and the more massive it becomes. Similarly, the smaller the volume of the sphere, the smaller the mass of the three-brane that wraps it. As this sphere collapses, then, the three-brane that wraps around the sphere, which is perceived as a black hole, appears to become ever lighter. When the three-dimensional sphere has collapsed to a pinched point, the corresponding black hole—brace yourself—is massless.” Page 330My brain vibrated feebly, then flopped, and collapsed into a massless black hole, gentle reader.Also: Perturbation Theory, Duality, Quantum chromodynamics, Symmetry, Spins, Supergravity, M-Theory, primordial nucleosynthesis, curled up dimensions (from nine to eleven - they don’t know how many exactly since the math is giving various answers to the question of multiverses, depending on the equation), Entropy, the Big Bang, the fabric of Space/Time, and my favorites, the uncertainty principle, spatial topology and reciprocals - not. None of this is visible to the naked eye, gentle reader, and some of it not to the naked brain in any kind of brane. My bosons are weak, gentle reader, weak, by my gauge. The forces of my framework have been mechanically perturbed into a mass universe of simplified confusion. I am a flatland of one-dimensional fundamentals when it comes to ‘ordinary’ physics, much less possessing a particle of understanding the speculative kind of physics like string theories!There is a Notes section which supposedly is in English, not that I could tell - a native English speaker - and an Index. Thankfully, there is a glossary of scientific terms, of which its pages I wore down to a Planck’s constant. However, maybe too many donuts (whether torus or spherical) and not enough broccoli in my life has annihilated the necessary electrons I needed to shine like an energetic photon. I am clearly reduced in mental energy to the lower spectrums, like ancient photonic microwaves spread out in a vast void of background noise, barely distinguished.*sigh*I found this, gentle reader - a PBS NOVA show about Brian’s Greene’s book. It’s easier. https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/t..."
12,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,4,"The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate TheoryIf you’ve heard of string theory, and know it’s not about tying shoelaces, then you probably know about Newtonian and Einsteinian physics, especially that which pertains to gravity, special relativity, and general relativity. You’ve probably heard of quantum physics as well, which studies the microscopic interactions of particles. But you might not know that general relativity (which explains the behaviour of massive objects in the universe) and quantum physics (which describe particle behaviour in great detail), are two ways of explaining physical phenomena that do not mesh well and cannot explain the origin of the gravitational force, the fourth element of the Standard Model of Physics, the other three being the strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, and electromagnetic force. This is where string theory was born, and despite it being extremely heavy on theory and very difficult to be tested at the experimental level, there has been a great deal discovered in particle physics, including the Higg’s boson (or “God particle) that was experimentally confirmed on 4 July 2012 using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Bern, Switzerland, which was depicted in very well in the 2013 documentary Particle Fever.String Theory is truly a mind-boggling and reality-bending collection of scientific theories attempting to bridge the gap between relativity, quantum physics, and gravitation. It’s not a single theory, and is still in its early developmental stage, and is immensely difficult to understand both conceptually and to formulate given the incredible complexity of the high-level mathematical constructs needed to model it. So if you are a layman or science enthusiast without a background in particle physics or advanced mathematics, you can be certain you will probably never really understand the underlying details, but Brian Greene, who is one of String Theory’s biggest proponents, has attempted to write a book to explain these highly speculative ideas in a book for non-scientists.Given the inherent difficulty in explaining such impossibly bizarre concepts without any complex equations, he does his level best by providing a large number of analogies to make the conceptualizing a bit easier, but even then you are likely to finish the book thinking, “Yes, I do understand a bit more than before, but much of that still went totally over my head.” So when judging books like this, it’s not really fair to say “Hey, I still don’t get String Theory, so Brian Greene did a bad job in his book.” Far from it, I’d say he tried very hard to convey all the key concepts, so I give him props for that. I understand his mother found the book impossible to understand and gave up, which prompted him to write a second, easier-to-understand version called The Fabric of the Cosmos (2003). Too late, as I started with The Elegant Universe (1999), but it wasn’t so bad.The book is so packed with mind-expanding concepts that it’s impossible to summarize, other than to list some of them here, borrowed from the very helpful SparkNotes website:Antimatter - Matter with the same gravitational properties as regular matter, but with an opposite electric charge and opposite nuclear force charges.Antiparticle - A particle of antimatter.Big Bang - The widely accepted theory concerning the origin of the universe. The big bang theory posits that the universe evolved approximately 10 to 15 billion years ago from the explosion of an incredibly dense, hot substance that was contained at one point. The universe has been expanding since the first fraction of a second after the big bang occurred.Big Crunch - The term referring to what some physicists believe will happen when the expanding universe stops and implodes. When the big crunch occurs, according to the theory, all space and matter will collapse together.Black Hole - A region of space formed when a giant star collapses and all of its mass compresses to a single point, forming a gravitational field so overpowering that it traps anything that comes close to it, including light.Boson - A pattern of string vibration with an amount of spin measurable in whole numbers. A boson is most often a messenger particle.Bosonic String Theory - The first version of string theory. Bosonic string theory, which dealt with string’s vibrational patterns, emerged in the 1970s. This version was later revised and replaced by supersymmetrical string theory.Calabi-Yau Shape/Space - A theoretical configuration that many physicists believe might contain the additional dimension string theory requires. Many thousands of such possible configurations exist, but string theory has yet to verify the correct one.Electromagnetism/Electromagnetic Force - One of the four fundamental forces, along with gravity, the strong force, and the weak force. Electromagnetism determines all types of electromagnetic radiation, including light, X-rays, and radio waves.Electroweak Theory - A relativistic quantum field theory that describes the weak force and the electromagnetic force within a single framework.Elegance - To Greene, string theory defines elegance because it is extremely simple, but it may explain every event in the universe.Elementary Particle - The indivisible or “uncuttable” unit found in all matter and forces. Elementary particles are now categorized by quarks and leptons, and their antimatter counterparts.Equivalence Principle - The basic tenet of general relativity. The equivalence principle states that accelerated motion is indistinguishable from gravity. It generalizes the theory of relativity by showing that all observers, regardless of their state of motion, can say that they are at rest, provided they take the presence of a gravitational field into account.Flop Transitions - Also called topography-changing transitions. Flop transitions are the act of Calabi-Yau space ripping and repairing itself.Force Carrier Particle - A particle that transmits one of the four fundamental forces. The strong force is associated with gluon; electromagnetism with the photon; the weak force with W and Z; and graviton (which hasn’t yet been discovered) with gravity.Fundamental Force - There are four fundamental forces : electromagnetism, strong force, weak force, and gravity.General Theory Of Relativity - Albert Einstein’s formulation that gravity results from the warping of spacetime. Through this curvature, space and time communicate the gravitational force.Graviton - Physicists believe that graviton—which has not yet been proven to exist—is the particle carrier of the gravitational force.Gravity - The weakest and most mysterious of the four fundamental forces. Gravity acts over an infinite range, and gravitation describes the force of attraction between objects containing either mass or energy.M-Theory - The theory under which all five previous versions of string theory fall. The most recent synthesis of string theory ideas, M-theory predicts eleven spacetime dimensions and describes “membranes” as a fundamental element in nature.Mirror Symmetry - A precept of string theory that demonstrates how two different Calabi-Yau shapes have identical physics.Newton’s Laws Of Motion - Laws of motion based on an absolute and unchanging notion of space and time. Newton’s laws of motion were later replaced by Einstein’s theory of special relativity.Particle Accelerator - A machine that speeds up the movement of particles and then either shoots them out at a fixed target or makes them collide. Particle accelerators allow physicists to study the movement of particles in extreme conditions.Perturbation Theory - A formal framework for making approximate calculations. Perturbation theory is a linchpin of string theory in its current form. The approximate solution will be refined later as more details fall into place.Photon - The smallest bundle of light. Photons are the messenger particles of the electromagnetic force.Photoelectric Effect - The action of electrons shooting from a metallic surface when light is shone onto that surface.Planck Energy - The energy required to probe Planck-length-scale distances.Planck Length - Planck length—approximately 10–33 centimeters—is the scale at which quantum fluctuations occur. Planck length is also the size of a typical string.Planck Mass - Planck mass is roughly equal to the mass of a grain of dust, or ten billion billion times the mass of a proton.Planck’s Constant - Planck’s constant is also known (and written) as the “h-bar.” It is a fundamental component of quantum mechanics.Planck Tension - About 10 (to the 39th power) tons. Planck tension is equal to the tension of a typical string.Quanta - According to the laws of quantum mechanics, the smallest physical unit that something can be broken into. Photons are the quanta of the electromagnetic field.Quantum Field Theory - Also known as relativistic quantum field theory. Quantum field theory describes particles in terms of fields, as well as how particles can be created or annihilated, and how they scatter.Quantum Foam - Also known as spacetime foam. Quantum foam is the violent turbulence of spatial fabric at an ultramicroscopic scale. Its existence is one of the chief reasons that quantum mechanics is incompatible with general relativity.Quantum Mechanics - The framework of laws that describe matter on atomic and subatomic scales. The uncertainty principle is a pillar of quantum mechanics.Quarks - A family of elementary particles (matter or antimatter) that make up protons and neutrons. There are many types of quarks: up, charm, top, down, strange, and bottom. Quarks are acted upon by the strong force. Murray Gell-Mann named quarks after he read James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake.Special Theory Of Relativity - Einstein’s description of particle motion, which hinges on the constancy of the speed of light. The theory of relativity states that even if an observer is moving, the speed of light never changes. Distance, time, and mass, however, all depend on the observer’s relative motion.Spin - The theory that all particles have an intrinsic amount of spin in either whole- or half-integer denominations.Standard Model - A quantum model that explains three of the fundamental forces—electromagnetism, the strong force, and the weak force—but does not take gravity into consideration.String - Miniscule one-dimensional vibrating strands of energy. String theories posit that these filaments are the basis of all elementary particles. The length of a string is 10–33 cm; strings have no width.Strong Force - So called because it is the strongest of the four fundamental forces. It holds quarks together and keeps protons and neutrons in the nuclei of atoms.Superstring Theory - A theory that describes resonant strings as the most elementary units in nature.Supersymmetry - A principle of symmetry relating the properties of particles with a whole-number quantity of spin (bosons) to those with half a whole number of spin (fermions). Supersymmetry posits that all elementary matter particles have corresponding superpartner force carrier particles. No one has yet observed these theoretical superpartners, which are thought to be even larger than their counterparts.Tachyon - A particle that has a negative mass when squared. The existence of a tachyon usually indicates a problem with a theory.Topology - The study of geometric figures’ properties that exhibit ongoing transformations and are unchanged by stretching or bending.Uncertainty Principle - Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the crux of quantum mechanics. It proclaims that you can never know both the position and the velocity of a particle simultaneously. To isolate one, you must somehow blur the other.Unified Field Theory - A theory describing all four fundamental forces and all of matter within a single framework.Weak Force - One of the four fundamental forces. Weak force operates over a short range."

I learned so, so, so much in this class & the book helped a lot. If you're reading this book unassisted, be aware that there are some very confusing sections that you'll need to read a few times. Sometimes his analogies are a bit too inane. Also, I've discovered that many physicists have an unhealthy obsession with their research pet projects- I'd advise that you ignore the sections on Calabi-Yau shapes entirely.These faults aside, The Elegant Universe is the only book about science that I have ever read from start to finish and enjoyed from start to finish. It'll blow your mind. "

I love this subject because, where the goal of civilization is to appreciate life in some form of organized chaos, some well spoken theorists have the ability to put things into perspective in such a way that the world seems to teem with possibility. Food for thought if you read this: Presentism holds that neither the future nor the past exist—that the only things that exist are present things, and there are no non-present objects. Some have taken presentism to indicate that time travel is impossible for there is no future or past to travel to; however, recently some presentists have argued that although past and future objects do not exist, there can still be definite truths about past and future events, and that it is possible that a future truth about the time traveler deciding to return to the present date could explain the time traveler's actual presence in the present.[5] This view is contested by another contemporary advocate of presentism, Craig Bourne, in his recent book 'A Future for Presentism', although for substantially different (and more complex) reasons. In any case, the relativity of simultaneity in modern physics is generally understood to cast serious doubt on presentism and to favor the view known as four dimensionalism (closely related to the idea of block time) in which past, present and future events all coexist in a single spacetime."

Greene does good job of putting a number of theories into perspective. It can be a bit of a challenge keeping up with the science listening to the audiobook. 
17,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7206839-jenny,4,"The first few chapters are fascinating as Greene recounts the history of modern physics, its departure from classical, Newtonian understanding. Then, he moves into string theory, and I found the arguments and explanations harder to follow. As Greene wrote the book just a few years after the Second Superstring Revolution, it makes sense that the arguments aren't as well-developed as those describing theories and experiments perfected and refined over the past 100 years or so. I really enjoyed the last few chapters: one on black holes, one about cosmology, and the final chapter, entitled ""Prospects,"" in which Greene discusses the implications of string/M-theory on future thought and the possible questions string/M-theory may be able to answer. Overall, I really liked this book. It took me a while to get through because of the subtlety of the arguments and the density of the subject matter (no pun intended), but it was extremely informative. I also enjoyed Greene's writing style, especially the examples/metaphors/analogs he presented the reader with for help in understanding the extremely subtle topics he discusses. The only thing missing for me from Greene (and from Hawking and K.C. Cole) is: why did the Big Bang happen when it did, and where did the materials constituting the singularity (or the ""Planck-size nugget"") come from? My only problem with non-Christian, scientific accounts. The physicists never do offer a possible explanation of the origins of the origins. I recommend this book to anybody interested in astrophysics, to fans of Greene, and to anybody looking for a book geared towards general readers that is more updated than Hawking's A Brief History of Time but that still offers insight into points that Hawking discusses in his famous book."
18,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7556938-jo-o-vaz,4,"Dear God, Will you ever allow us folks down here on Earth to come up with Einstein’s dream of a Theory of Everything (ToE)? The fact of the matter is that there are essentially two opposing theories upon which rests our knowledge of the universe: General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. That is, the world of the large and the world of the miniscule. But whenever we try to unify them, our calculations just fall short; or better, fall large!, for we bump into infinity. Oh wait!, this book has just told me that String theorists already have! They claim that all fundamental particles are composed of tiny vibrating strings of energy whose movement gives rise to all those different particles that we know of. And in so doing, not only do these strings fit into Quantum theory, but they're also able to accurately predict the whys and wherefores of the big bulks of matter, like those of stars and galaxies! TADÃÃN!BUT, not only are there five different versions to the theory, but also, and because we are talking about excruciatingly small objects, it is impossible to test it! Not really a theory is it? (daimn!) It shamelessly enters the realm of Philosophy… Oh those naysayers! Tell me of one thing that we take for granted today that hasn’t started as Cartesian doubt! You go get them my fairy little oscillating strings, which so happen to explain black holes! But back to you old man, you never really cease to surprise me! So you’re telling me that the universe is this big cosmic symphony whose musical notes are the sounds exuded by the movement of strings? Oh you shrewd mayster!, I always knew you had a bend for drama! With my heart in your stars, J"
19,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,2,"I never really got the hang of String Theory. I find it awfully weird and almost nigh-unscientific. Not being a physicist, I try not to make judgments about it, since I clearly don't understand it one bit - at least on the math level! - but I have to say that Brian Greene didn't endear it to me.I also fervently found myself wishing for the Nth time that science books were not so firmly divided between ""professional, terrifying math texts"" and ""written for people who never figured out the Theory of Relativity"". I think we need ""Science for the Educated Sci-Fi Reader"" or something like that. As it is, unless you're Stephen Hawking, who pretty much has the right to do anything he liked, if you're trying to explain relativity to me, again, you will put me off."
20,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Greene can explain complicated theories better than anyone. I read the best explanation of Einstein’s general and special relativity theories. Especially when when we see an object travelling at high speed, they appear the age more slowly. But the same applies to the other side looking at us, making us age more slowly from their standpoint! This is perfectly fine unless they want to meet up, and one side accelerates to meet the other one. In this case the accelerating side will find they indeed had aged much more than the side being caught up. Had gravity bends space time itself, and we always travel at light speed; any other movement slows down time itself. Nobody really understands quantum physics, like a photon behaves like a particle when passing through one slit but when faced with double slit it interferes with itself and show wave interference patterns. Particles can appear and disappear spontaneously. Shrodinger’s cat is both dead and alive until one looks and collapses its wave function. Gravity stumps quantum physics because when quantum equations are applied to gravitons, infinite solutions appear. So string theory comes to the rescue. So strings are fundamental stuff of everything, the real Greek Atoms. They coil up in 3 big dimensions and many tiny dimensions. Unfortunately this is untestable and thus lots of maths and imagination are required. In the end, the M theory which is a master theories of all string sub-theories is proposed. 10 physical and 1 time dimension. I must say I am a but lost from that point onwards, because of lack of experimental support. To identify strings. we would need an impossibly large amount of energy so we may Never be able to prove its existence. It is tough to actual acknowledge that we may never be able to go much further in particle physics, but such is life. The best physics book I have ever read. "

I have a MSc in environmental sciences which is 20 years out of date.Brian Greene describes elegantly special and general relativity as well as important aspects of quantum physics in the first third of his book. It is worth its money for these first few chapters.Unfortunately, his writing about the five string theories and their meta-theory called M-theory is almost unreadable and loses its focus very rapidly. Brian Greene seems to be so intimately and unconditionally in love with string theories that there remains no hope for an objective assessment of their ability to stand up as a collection of scientific theories. As far as I understand, none of the string theories makes falsifiable predictions or suggests doable experiments compatible with today's technology.Greene admits by his own writing that string theories have not delivered what they have been invented for, in spite of intense research for more than 15 years (the book was written in the 90s'):- the seemingly arbitrary values of the standard model masses and force charges have not been explained- the number of possible implementations of the theories is so big that any specific real world observation can be explained by at least some of the myriad of possible solutions these thought models allow.In spite of these facts, the reader is invited to believe that string theories are the only way forward for physics in the 21st century. The main arguments I have retained are as follows: string theories are beautifully elegant. Hence, they must be true in some important and overarching way. And if the most clever mathematicians and physicists believe this, the not so gifted have no choice than to support their view.Well, I disagree."

Dr. Greene fairly well crosses the line into talking down instead of explaining things.However, this book has some rather well laid out charts and diagrams and other visual aids. Importantly these come with a gracious degree of explanation. It almost makes up for the long-windedness.The universe & Dr. Greene's charts are elegant; Dr. Greene's writing is not."

25,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,4,"Picked this one up in preparation for an event with Brian Greene. Written over 15 years ago, it is missing the latest developments and consensus, which seems to be that the original vision for String Theory (ST) as a TOE didn’t pan out, yet it is still the only TOE we got. It's a bitch we can’t test it, and a shame we can’t find the shape of the Calabi-Yau manifold that corresponds to reality that we live in, but otherwise ST is quite beautiful indeed. On the plus side - ideas from ST are now firmly embedded into quantum field theories, condensed matter physics, and cosmology. Also, in select areas, but in an unprecedented fashion, ST forged away ahead of mathematics by providing the intuitions that weren’t available to the latter. Anyway, back to the book - regardless of where we are today, Greene gives a nice intro into the historiography and basic tenets of ST, and provides a nice expose on the challenges that any TOE would have to grapple with sooner or later. Rest are notes to self.Starts off with Einstein’s resolution to Maxwell-Newton incompatibility (via special relativity), and then Newton’s gravity as force-at-distance paradox (general relativity); frames ST as an attempt to resolve GTR and QM. Brief, fairly conventional overview of SR/GTR and QM. Nice stories of how SR logically falls out of fully appreciating the absoluteness of c, and similarly how QM falls out of fully accepting implications of h (Planck’s constant) . Feynman sum-over-history interpretation is rarely covered, so that was cool.Unification attempts. Must explain all 4 fundamental forces at quantum level. Quantum Field Theory(s)  do it for 3. Issues with G: Schrodinger’s equation blows up at sub-Planck level, Heisenberg’s “borrowing of energy”  resulting in “constant creation and destruction” is a real nuisance, and zero-gravity flat space is no longer flat due to quantum foam. Enter ST. Standard Model’s zero-dimension point particles blow up math with zero distances and infinite energies at the limit. But Strings are 1-dimensional, and end up quantizing size with a minimum non-zero value, and so quantum foam is masked. Now zero-g space is actually flat, ‘cause smallest building block (1D string) is too coarse. QM and GTR play nicely together.Crap, infinities are avoided, but you still get probabilities going negative in Schrodinger’s equation… Not to worry – add 6 curved dimensions to spacetime and you are home free! But where is “home” in the 10D Calabi-Yau landscape of possibilities??Btw, “String Theory”’s full name is Superstring Theory with “super” for supersymmetry. Quite nifty with particles, antiparticles and spin symmetries. But it gets even better with symmetry, you see – with ST when you collapse something you don’t shrink to zero (minimum size constraint), but you go through the minimum and blow it out on the other side. And so you got “mirror symmetry” Calabi-Yau manifolds – geometrically different, yet physics-wise equivalent. And boy, ST gets a lot of mileage out of minimum size and mirror symmetry – seems like whenever there is an issue, just transform it into a different geometric space where it is easier to solve. And if math blows up, dig up that minimum size constraint and avoid that pesky singularity. For example, in the 90s there were 5 legitimate and different formulations of ST (“Type I”, “Heterotic” etc.), a tad hard to maintain a straight face when you are shooting for an ultimate TOE… But in ’95 Edward Witten himself unifies them all into M-theory, by throwing in another (11th!) dimension and demonstrating the equivalence of the 5 ST theories. Not to be complacent he even throws in a bonus 6th one - 11D supergravity!Now let's launch ST into outer space and see what sticks. Black Hole as elementary particle? No problem, ST got you covered via Calabi-Yau equivalence. Hawking radiation and black hole entropy? ST jumps in with black hole thermodynamics. And now, for the encore - what happens when black hole swallows Schrodinger’s wave function!? Is information lost? Not sure about ST, but I distinctly hear Claude Shannon’s muffled moan coming from his grave… Curtain falls."

The first chapters were amazing and engaging, however later chapters about string theory were very hard for me to understand and I actually didn't finish the whole book, because I could not understand what I was reading.The author uses many metaphors to make his ideas simpler. He starts with a very easy to understand telling of history of scientific discoveries reaching to the theory of general relativity and quantum physics and the unification efforts. He maintains that string theory could be the one that finally unifies them and explain the number of particles we have and their specific masses and properties.My understanding of special and general relativity theories was greatly enhanced after reading it here as well as that of quantum physics. However when he got the details of string theory I was completely lost and gave up on it."

There are ample evidences that proves this theory to be correct.but this theory is still in its premature form and due to its complexity, its hard to prove it experimentally.I learn many new things in this book and even made a notebook to prepare notes regarding the theory.I believe that time is not far enough when our physicist can finally prove whether The String Theory is really an Ultimate Theory of Universe or not."

While I understand he is probably the leading public proponent of string theory, I felt that his oversimplification lead to some really problematic axioms and it was upon these shaky foundations that he tried to map out string theory. I'm afraid I think that the Theory of Everything (or Grand Unified Theory) will be articulated in a much more coherent way if one sets aside the supposition that is string theory. This may also be an oversimplification, but the theory strikes me as designed to be mathematically expedient, so while most theories are tested to find out if the equations work, this theory has the equations designed to work in the framework before it is even tested. Not my definition of true scientific work."

As the authors specialty is string theory about 50% of the book is dedicated to this subject. I admit that there were some concepts that I had a hard time understanding as there is no easy way to make the subject relateable to everyday experiences. Almost all of string theory is math driven and all the discoveries are just the relationships and solutions to incredibly complex math formulas. Even then, many of the ideas come down to interpreting results that are just approximations of the final solutions. Even our most powerful computers are unable to solve these equations completely. For me that's where string theory loses some of it's credibility. With such complex math it's manipulating the numbers until you get the answer you want.As this book was written in 1999 it's inevitably a bit out of date. This was before the existence of the LHC at CERN and some of the experiments in the last decade may have shed more light and indirectly confirmed some string theory concepts. In particular the existence of the superheavy Higgs boson would be evidence of symmetry predicted by string theory.A decent book but only for people really interested in the subject.

Mathematically speaking, the theory (or rather the hypothesis) seems to be flawless. However, it's never been experimentally proved. The reason is obvious. The strings are so tiny and hard to find if they exist. Even our most powerful atom smashers and super colliders can't produce them. Brian Green says, we need a collider the size of the entire Milky Way Galaxy to create such strings. a more advanced version of the theory is called M-theory and it's an amalgamation of a number of different theories, five to be exact, that are brought together like the arms of a starfish. the problem with the current standard model of particle physics is that it does not unite gravity with other forces. For instance, at the moment of the big bang or at the core of a black hole, Einstein's theory of general relativity (the theory of the large) and quantum mechanics (the theory of the small) can not come together. Each of these theories is perfectly capable of explaining the world in its own domain, however. String theory is thought to be our current hope to reconcile gravity and QM. Strange as it may seem, the mathematics of string theory tells us that there are eleven dimensions (ten dimensions of space and one of time) instead of four. The reason you and I can't see these dimensions is because they're so tiny.According to string theory, if we could examine particles with great precision—a precision many orders of magnitude beyond our present technological capacity—we would find that each is not pointlike, but instead consists of a tiny one-dimensional loop."

35,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110610415-richard-seltzer,5,"A few months ago, when I was reviewing What Remains to be Discovered by John Maddox, I was convinced that the world is ""unknowable.""Now, thanks to The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene, I've done a flip-flop.As Maddox says in his concluding chapter, ""Unwilling or unable to accept the seemingly paradoxical behavior of single particles, such as electrons moving through both of two slits at the same time, for example, he [Albert Einstein] sought instead a set of equations whose elegance and symmetry would command respect, and by which even paradoxical phenomena would be explicable. Einstein's quest was no doubt impelled by his great success with the general theory of relativity (otherwise the theory of gravitation), which first won attention through its elegance. As the world now knows, it was a fruitless search. Quantum phenomena are often wrongly described as paradoxes for no better reason than that they conflict with the expectations of common sense, which themselves spring from human senses that have been honed by natural selection for telling what the macroscopic world is like. It is disconcerting that phenomena on the small scale are at odds with expectation, but there is a wealth of experimental data for which no other explanation is possible. How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" (p. 373)In my review, I noted, ""...a non-scientist, like myself, might well dream the impossible dream of a science that goes beyond science, a means of learning about 'reality' and describing it without depending on experiments.""Remarkably, Greene answers that key question ""How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" While experiment has its limitations, based on what can be measured and how, indirect techniques can give us glimpses of what lies beyond, leading to new hypotheses which can also be verified, with a high degree of confidence, by indirect techniques. The vastness of the cosmos provides clues to the physical structure of matter smaller than quarks (the components of electrons, protons, and other subatomic particles) and provides ways of verifying hypotheses that are beyond the limits of our most advanced laboratories.In Green's book, the universe is ""elegant"" and knowable, in ways man believed before the discoveries of quantum physics. When confronted with new previously unexplained phenomena, he turns to such principles as symmetry, beauty and logic to gain new insight. At the end of the dark tunnel of unknowability, he sees a ""multi-verse"" consisting of many universes; he sees black holes not just as the ugly ends of dying stars, but rather as seeds for other universes; he see a multi-verse in which those universes that have the most black holes are the most likely to survive and spawn new universes in a cosmic evolution scheme, based on survival of the fittest of universes.Just when I was getting used to the idea that the world is unfundamentally unknowable -- that our brains evolved to help us cope with the world of ordinary experience and simply aren't equipped to grasp the bizarre realms of the very small and the very large -- along comes a book that inspires me with renewed faith that we can know -- based on a classical belief in beauty and symmetry -- like a revelation from the 17th or 18th century.This book is convincing, lucid, powerful, mind-expanding.I had been aesthetically wallowing in the concept of unknowability -- convinced that the greatest advances in the 20th century came from acknowledging the limitations of the human mind, proving what cannot be known. That attitude led me to a high appreciation of the works of Stanislaw Lem (see my review at www.seltzerbooks.com/lem.html) and to a whole range of authors, starting with Plato, who emphasized that the value of the pursuit of wisdom was all in the process, that nothing can be known with any certainty. It is good to seek truth; but to believe that you have found truth is bad. The value comes from the seeking itself.In the days of Emerson and Swedenborg, the world and our senses and our ability to understand seemed perfectly suited to one another. Then modern science led us to see a disjunction between the world perceived in ordinary experience and the realm of the extremely small and the realm of the extremely large, both of which were revealed by advanced instruments; and led us to conclude that the limits of our instruments were the limits of our ability to understand. Now it appears that we can leap beyond those limits, arriving at new levels of understanding about the workings of the physical world, both at the sub-particle level and at the cosmic level.I won't attempt to explain Greene's explanations. I don't presume to have grasped it in great enough detail to do it justice. Read the book itself. He writes with the authority of one of the leaders in the field of string theory, but with a clarity and patience and ability to explain complex matters simply that rivals the efforts of the very best popularizers of science.Basically, quarks consist of ""strings"", and the ""vibrations"" of these strings determine their energy, mass, and other characteristics. These vibrations have ""frequency"" or rhythm, which leads me to think of this change of perspective in terms of Yeats: the focus is now on the dance rather than the dancer. The dancers come and go and combine and recombine; come into existance and annihiate and come into existence again in new forms. Yes, there are physical limits to what we can know about the dancer; but our knowledge of the dance can extend far beyond and lead us to important new conclusions.Strangely, such a change in the underlying concepts of physics leads to a new appreciation for old authors. I can't help but think of Frazier, Jung, and Joyce, and their attempts to grasp the flow and rhythm of all of human culture. I think of the multiple natural and mental rhythms of Virginia Woolf's Waves. I think of resonance and harmonics and extraordinary effects that can come from small changes, like a bridge breaking up because of the rhythm of the wind that strikes it; and I think of transistors and how they capitalize on how, in electronics, small changes can result in large effects. I also think of the theme of music and rhythm as an important element in how the mind works and how the world works in Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach. I think of Steven Pinker's books where he gains insight into the workings of the human mind by analyzing how we use language and the rules of grammar, and I wonder if there might be a ""grammar"" or ""rules of choreography"" for the cosmic dance. I may even develop a new appreciation for the art of dance. Greene himself alludes to the ancient notion of the ""music of the spheres.""And wonder of wonders, I feel myself motivated to tackle Heidegger's Being and Time. Contrary to the ruminations of Hamlet, being and not being may not be opposites, or may not be the only alternatives. To become or not to become? To become what from what? There may be a range or field of becoming, a pattern of becoming and interacting in the rhythm of individual human life and of life in aggregate.But don't be sidetracked by my vague speculations. Read the book. It could change your image of yourself and the world you live in."
36,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"Physicists today think they may have discovered what Einstein spent the last decades of his life searching for: the Theory of Everything. String Theory (technically, Superstring Theory) is the idea that everything we see in the world is really the result of one-dimensional strings vibrating in particular patterns. And if the idea of one-dimensional strings is hard for you to wrap your head around, then buckle up before you read this book, because that's the easy part. This book is dense. It's very, very technical. Yes, he promises no math, so we don't actually look at the formulas. But you can't talk about this theory without talking about math. We can't observe things this small with our technology today, so this is basically all math equations that add up nicely. So the book talks about math a lot--including a chapter that centered the differences between physics-based math and academic-Phd math. Unlike Einstein's theories, which were prompted by cool thought experiments, string theory is driven by equations. It's not intuitive at all. But if you can march through that technical data and make your brain stretch into odd shapes, then there are some interesting implications. He's not a Christian, but as a Christian I find some fascinating tidbits. Example: this new theory says all of reality is a result of vibrating strings, that the particular vibration patterns manifest as the bits of matter and energy that we observe. And the Bible says that the universe was formless and void until God spoke."
37,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"At long last I finished reading this! Detailed science books aren't the best bus books. :oSo this book about M-theory etc. was a great read. I very much enjoyed myself reading it and weirdly enough I kept laughing because Greene has a really amusing way of throwing in ridiculous humor while dreaming up weird analogies. I'm sure I wouldn't understand any of the mathematics behind what's described here, and to be honest even the layperson's explanation of the science was a stretch for me sometimes, but I was invested enough sometimes to wonder about what else has progressed on the questions raised in this book since it was written and have looked things up to find out what's newer in the field. Especially when Greene made references to the particle accelerator and what it might find when it was completed. I read some cool stuff about the Higgs Boson and all that. YEAH!Anyway, some notes I took while reading are my best way to share my thoughts.1. I giggled when the author described a scientist's reaction to the discovery of muons: ""Who ordered THAT?""2. His way of explaining the way physical objects change as they go faster was well thought out. Showing how it's happening every day but we can't detect it due to small measurements. Increasing them would make the difference apparent, and if we lived in a world where those measurements were standard, it'd be intuitive and invisible to us again.3. There was a great explanation of how a race car reaches the finish line slower if it travels diagonally, since some of the time is taken away to achieve horizontal travel.4. I find it really interesting that it apparently takes infinite power to push something faster than light because it becomes heavier and heavier as it approaches light speed, and that's why we can't go faster than light.5. I was envisioning warped space like a rubber tarp before the author explained the 3D problem. I am secretly a physicist after all!6. In a discussion of why energy is in lumps (discussing Planck's Constant): ""It's as if nature allows a whole pint of beer or no beer at all."" Haha.7. It's so interesting that observing matter affects it (photos hitting it has an effect), and if we lessened the photons we'd also be less likely to be able to determine its location because of the wave's length. And the electrons become ""frantic"" when they're cornered so they can't have their speed or location determined at the same time.8. The quantum tunneling descriptions were effective! It was cool to learn that electrons can go through stuff because of the space around the particles, but that it is unlikely that it will happen because being lucky enough for that to happen takes a really long time.9. The fifth level of magnification showing quantum froth was really effective. The borrowing and paying back analogy makes sense to explain why over long distances space seems flat, like a dot matrix printer makes images that look smooth.10. The ""Price is Right"" analogy for the large amount of money (energy) leaving a small amount down to the penny was a good way to explain why the specifics are too difficult for existing math to figure out.11. It's true that ""elegance"" and aesthetic doesn't prove a theory. We want theories to be beautiful, but if they're proved wrong we have to reject them, even if it's tempting to assume the elegance means it's accurate. But aesthetic does figure into choices in the research direction for theories.12. Sypersymmetry demands an as yet undetected super-partner particle. They're calling the one for electron ""selectron."" Also, ""squark"" and ""sneutrino."" I laughed.13. I like that they're allowing for the fact that the universe might not have the property of supersymmetry just because it would be mathematically matchy.14. The metaphor of 5 different theories of what happened to Earhart was a great way to explain why 5 slightly different superstring theories makes the idea itself less trustworthy.15. ""Comings and Goings of a Garden Hose."" I laughed. Maybe Kaluza K. Line came up with this epiphany just to combat the drudgery of staring at his neighbor's dot-eye. According to Linestein, there's a way to expand that dimension! 16. These ways of explaining the 10 dimensions (6 of them curled up in larger ones) WAS SO COOL.17. I really love the story of how Greene learned that another paper had duplicated the same findings as his and mirror symmetry in string theory is A THING. With holes that match up in Calabi-Yau shapes. !!!!!!18. I like how Greene explains counting a huge bin of oranges and then having a solution presented with a friend showing up with a box and how many boxes there were when the oranges were delivered. This is an analogy for why doing calculations on a mirror-imaged Calabi-Yau shape is sometimes easier than doing the math on its first one.19. The rivalry between the mathematicians and the physicists--I giggled a lot. I love that they compared their results, got different answers, and later found an error in the math camp's computer code that when fixed yielded the physics answer. After mining math for tools all this time, physics can give back, as it also solved other insurmountable math issues!20. I love the human element to the scientists' research into flop transitions and how Greene and Morrison had to teach each other their disciplines to make progress. They wanted to beat Witten to a discovery.21. I liked the story of working with Aspinwall to determine the shape of the Calabi-Yau shape they're looking for and having to buy him beer to make him come in on Saturday.22. Nobody knows the string coupling constant. Oy.23. Black holes have no ""hair."" They are all the same as each other. Small black holes will act just like large black holes in experiments.24. The revisions Greene and Morrison made after posting their article the first time resulted from having devil's advocate conversations. Haha.25. Hawking and Thorne had a bet with Preskill about whether information can reemerge after a black hole evaporates. Loser buys the winner an encyclopedia!I love learning about all these innovations and I love what dorks scientists are. I admire their imagination and passion, and even though most of the rest of the world will have no idea when they make their breakthroughs, I love all these ideas and I want to know where they've gone since."
38,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12872086-sheeraz,4,"It's a little difficult to review this book because I can't say I understood and retained everything that was presented. With that caveat, I think the author did a great job in explaining some very gnarly and unintuitive concepts to a non-physicist. The use of analogies was spot on and kept the narrative interesting even when my brain grasped at the edges of the ideas presented.The book, as the name suggests, is primarily about the development, current state and future outlook of string theory -- a good contender for a theory that unifies the description of different forces, and hopefully has physical properties of the universe as emergent quantities. The ideas are fascinating, like challenging our notion of distance building on Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The book got me excited about the future of string physics and its bearing on cosmology, and hoping that we will see some potential evidence in the favor of the theory in our lifetimes."
39,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8379733-bookhode,2,"Well, this was disappointing. Brian Greene's book with a pointlessly superlong title, had started off just fine, providing a nice recap of major developments in physics during the last century or so, with the special focus on Einstein's revolutionary theories, and on quantum mechanics that followed. This part was relatively easy to grasp, and despite the author's rather clumsy attempts at metaphor on almost every page, it was also relatively easy to read. The next part, where we reached the conflict between physics of the very small (with its rules based on probability), and physics of the very large (with exact rules), was also ok, as the book kept its flow, and I was able to follow the plot, and at least understand what the problem was all about.But then, we got to the central topic of this book, which is supposed to be the superstring theory, and things just quickly deteriorated in almost every way. The metaphors Greene kept on using became really weird, and were more hurting than helping the reader to cope with the increasingly difficult explanations. Chapters where he talked about his own achievements and discoveries in this field, were presented with overabundance of details, which was rather sharp contrast to the tone used in the rest of this book. And complete lack of any critical thought by the author towards the superstrings theory, made me feel like I was reading some kind of political pamphlet, and not an open-minded work of popular science.To a layman like me, the superstrings theory is bullshit. It's a fantasy about something we cannot see, feel or test in any practical manner. And the fact that the whole thing requires making up some weird multidimensional shapes, and then adjusting our regular mathematics by inventing more and more dimensions just to make the numbers fit, should completely kill its credibility. Of course, I am way out of my league here, and the theory could be quite correct, but the author never really managed to find the language or approach to persuade me to accept his opinion. All he did was to highhandedly wave off any criticism, and basically put the reader in a fait accompli position, where he should either agree with this inevitable new wisdom, or feel stupid. And I would rather feel stupid, than accept bullshit without any chance of verification.Current score: 49/100Current ranking: 37th among my non-fiction books."
40,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12365204-y-l,3,"I have to admit this has been a book I have had a love-hate relationship with for a good few months. I may have had it a lot easier than others as the friend who graciously loaned me this book had preempted me with a few documentary videos of Stephen Hawking and BBC as an introduction to the subject. Nevertheless, the universe is (as always) a long and lengthy subject to grasp and claiming that reading this book was a breeze would do the universe no justice.Thanks to three hours or so of videos, reading the first few chapters of this book was like reading revision notes on a day's worth of lecture. I wouldn't say I made every effort to understand each mathematic equation or even appreciate the technicality of physics and quantum mechanics that make the most part of this book, but I can now truly appreciate how mind-blowing it is to perceive the universe to be so much more than a big black blanket of space. Greene offered a glimpse of how quantum physicists and mathematicians look at our universe and writes eloquently on the slow and painstaking process of discovering the universe and the mechanics of it through decades of theories, collaboration and backsteps. I especially love how he details the life of himself and his colleagues as they accept each others strength and weaknesses on the subject and push each other to their limits to solve the mysteries that the universe has set at their doorstep. That itself would have probably made it a much more enjoyable book for me. As much as I am grateful for being given the opportunity to appreciate this subject via layman standards, I still feel that the book needs to be expressed a little better. Introductions on some parts of the subject could have been spared as the selling point of this book seems to be the concept of possibilities rather than dry science.I ended this book feeling a little overwhelmed - not sure if it is because of all the unnecessary fluff leading up to String Theory, the anticipation of whether String Theory will live up to its potential of a unified theory, or the fact that Greene had unsuspectingly dumped all his hopes and ideologies into the last few pages of the book to sell his idea of String Theory to the masses. I am all set to read Paul Davies' take on this...just as soon as I recover."
41,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9729716-jason,3," I was given this book as a gift. I typically don't go for the sort of fluffy stuff you'd find in the ""Science"" section at Barnes & Noble, which I figured this would be. I'm much more into mathematics than physics and have devoted most of my academic career to math shit rather than physics shit. So I was already prepared to lose my footing at some point in this book. I have a pretty good grasp on Special Relativity though so I tried to use that as a gauge for how well this dude was describing the more recent stuff beyond the point where my eyes just glazed over. I was happy that this fella got into stuff that lost me. It worries me when I finish a book about a complex or abstract thing and it's not a struggle to understand the material. I wonder whether the writer is just that good or that bad. What I found about this dude is that his wanting to illustrate everything with a metaphor or an analogy wound up confusing the stuff more. I mean, some were cool and I think I gleaned something of the rough shape of an idea. There were other spots where he used 3-4 different metaphors to get across an idea that was already pretty damn abstract. I think at those spots I'd have preferred more elaboration in the form of the notes in the back for ""the expert reader"" or for ""the mathematically inclined"". I basically read this as a starting point. I kept a book for notes as I read and now I have a bunch of pages of leads for further investigation. On a superficial level, I liked this guy's writing style. And the book was somewhat enjoyable while discussing bananas shit. I think there was a chapter or 2 where my reading was as productive as staring at the floor. All in all I don't know who I'd recommend this to. I'm part of a math club and no one there would take it off my hands when I was done because they don't like ""rock star physicists"" who write fluffy science books. But at the same time I can't give it to my mom because it does get into stuff within the first page that would lose her.  I'm not sure if all this explains why I gave it 3 stars, but I felt the need to be lengthy."
42,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458834-mark-laflamme,0,"For me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that started it all. Greene has such a smooth way of easing the novice into the complexities of string theory, the reader feels almost acquainted by the time the science is introduced. Never boring or tedious, Greene deftly guides us through the basics of relativity, explains the importance of frames of reference, and eases us into the almost magical world of gravity and timespace.Like Einstein, Greene presents the science through simple visuals - balls and bicycles, funny cars and cartoon spaceships. The reader will never feel as though he sits in a classroom with a boring professor droning away the afternoon. Instead, Greene describes the physics in a real world way and in doing so, prepares even the most casual student for the truly strange world of strings.String theory appears to be the road to a unified theory, the long sought Theory of Everything that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics. Along the way is a wonderous world of possibilities, with extra dimensions, parallel worlds, and all the while, tiny strings vibrating the symphony of the universe.I read this book with a zeal normally reserved for action novels. Each night was a new lesson and a new glimpse at a different part of the universe. Greene's gift is a clear and friendly writing style that makes this heavy science accessible to those of us without a string of initials at the end of our name.Many physicists came before Greene and others have followed suit. But for me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that opened my eyes to the mind blowing world of strings and the possibilities they present. And I've been hooked on string theory since. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked at a sky full of stars and wondered what it's all about.Mark LaFlamme, author of ""The Pink Room"" "
43,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"Though the first third of this book was amusing and accessible in a childish way, the book as a whole left me with a feeling that my brain is as tiny and crumpled up as a Calabi-Yau space, whichever shape it implies! :(My opinion of this book is similar but not equal to Rob's (though I liked his review), because I didn't think the first third of the book gave me a fairly good understanding of the Einstein's relativity concepts at all. For instance, the rubber membrane - bowling ball analogy was totally misleading for me.I like Marvin's review much more and I think it's clear why. :)Anyway, after this book I felt an awful need to 'unwarp' and 'uncurl' my brain, which made me look for another one - with better explanations of physics concepts ... and I had luck! Hmm, could this be the reason to change my rating to 5 stars?! No, because my lucky find doesn't deal with the string theory.Almost forgot to add: My lucky find was The Perception of Space... and its Measurement plus Galloping with Light - The Special Theory of Relativity by Felix Alba-Juez"

What gives?!Ok, in all seriousness, this is an enjoyable book to read, but you're not going to come out of it understanding much about string theory. It's just too complicated, which is one of its serious flaws. I have really liked all of Brian Greene's books, but the more I read the less inclined I am to believe in string theory. Maybe if I had read this before Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law by Peter Holt or The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next by Lee Smolin, but those two books really do a good job of refuting this one."

String theory might be an approach that doesn't work, but it remains a unique approach to describing the universe and a mathematically beautiful approach at that. Science needs new ways to describe the world time after time. Otherwise it becomes stagnant and fails to expand our understanding of things.Greene does a good job of explaining the basics of it. Many popular science writers tend to oversimplify some things and only mention other things in vague passages. The oversimplified ideas lose half of their meaning and the rest become hard to notice even by people who already understand them. Green wants your full attention. He will not butcher scientific concepts to tell you half-truths you can understand easier. However, he does his best to make things as simple as possible for the reader. Greene is passionate and his writing shows that he cares about it. I think that makes the book even better."
46,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"About the best book on the subject and by a mile. As almost all the other reviewers claim, the initial parts on Newtonian, Relativistic and Quantum science are so beautifully and novelly explained that they should be made mandatory in any study books on the topic. The approach continues as the author jumps to explaining a far more complex super-string theory. And here, the simplistic explanations make the theory look highly speculative, fantastic and without much ground/proof. This is certainly not the case and perhaps that's because far more work is needed not just in completing the theory but grasping its real meaning. This does not remotely lessen the utility or interesting style of the book as I strongly believe that there does not exist - at least so far - any simpler explanations. For anyone interested in cosmology, an absolute must read - ideally multiple times over a few years. Hope the author comes with an update soon."

This is not as accessible as Stephen hawking, but a very well written book none the less. I would say this is for people who've already been introduced to the string theory, I tried reading it the first time without knowing anything about it and found myself staring like a deer in headlights. Once I got more familiar with the concepts (I used youtube videos) I went back to this book and enjoyed myself a lot.

At times fascinating at others almost unintelligible (to this newb) this book was anything but 'elegant' and the Universe described even less so. To start with, is anyone not able to do the math really able to understand this this stuff, at all? The number of times Dr. Greene describes the mathematics as extremely difficult or tricky or almost inaccessible (to PhD physicists and mathematicians, some of them Nobel level minds) is enough to make any 'normal' person falter in pretending to get it. Starting with the chapters on String Theory if you are not partially lost then you have either been exposed to these ideas repeatedly or are one or two orders of magnitude smarter than me. Calabai-Yau shapes, M-theory, branes, curled-up dimensions, Heterotic string theory (not very erotic!!), symmetry, super-symmetry, super-gravity, duality, etc. the list of concepts brand new to me goes on and on. That is is not to say he does not make brave efforts to have it make some sense. I do feel that I have some vague notion how of things beyond relativity and quantum mechanics might operate but that is about it. I guess there is a NOVA series and it might be worth to check out at this moment before it is all vaporised by time. And of course this book was written in 1999/2003 and many of the concepts may already have been 'clarified', confirmed or rejected. But overall I'd still recommend this book for an introduction to a very complex subject which asks some really big questions and tries to give some answers."
57,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71115989-liliana,3,"I've been diving into some physics books to try to catch up on scientific knowledge that hasn't been a part of my lexicon for a long time. It hasn't been a straightforward or easy journey, but I'm getting there. Greene's book on String Theory has definitely provided that well-balanced mix between a scientific and detailed book and an accessible and digestible narrative. There were plenty of metaphors and examples throughout that simplified what to me at least was a very complex topic, and I find this is a good foundational book for someone dipping their toes in physics.As a theory, nonetheless, I must stress that this is not an answer to the big question, but a potential ""theory of everything"". It hasn't been proven - in fact, it might have been quite battered down in recent years. Therefore, take everything with a grain of salt and a critical mind that a science book should ultimately stimulate.I will admit, though, that despite the accessible and interesting character of The Elegant Universe, I find myself forgetting quite a lot of what it contained... I suck. I do recommend it because, again, I felt like it provided a lot of the foundation to understand physics in our time, but I am not sure I personally attained a greater understanding. You'll let me know how it works for you."

I would have loved to give this mind-rattling book a full 5 stars, but I simply couldn't when, in the end, there were so many phenomena and consequences I simply could not understand, or ""see,"" particularly at the Planck level where string theory resides and remains controversial. (And, for what it's worth, I used an audiobook to either preview or review, or simply to follow along with, chapters. Erik Davies is a superb, well-prepared narrator, but for the most part, you must have the book, and its many helpful illustrations, in your hand as you go through this material. Unless you're a physicist, you shouldn't be listening to this one on the way to work.) I have two additional Brian Greene books on my science shelf, and I want to get to them, soon, but I have to review some of the more impenetrable parts of The Elegant Universe, as well as entries in its useful glossary, yet again and hope for the voila! lightbulb to flash over my head."
59,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay,3,"To evaluate a review of this book, you must know about the background of the reviewer. I had college physics classes in the early 80s, and have read a number of “modern” pop physics books in the past couple of decades. I understand, in many aspects, the basics of physics pre-string theory. But this new stuff? I understand some of the definitions, but that’s about it. Greene’s book is very good at giving descriptions and examples and analogies for aspects of physics it is trying to explain. And for the older concepts, it does a great job. The newer concepts, string theory and beyond, are explained in the same way, with the same care. I found these concepts more difficult to understand, but I suspect that’s my problem, not the fault of the author. I found the book well organized, and the examples often memorable. However, I didn’t get the level of understanding I was hoping for concerning recent advances in physics. I would consider reading more by this author, but may be looking for a lower grade level."

61,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3590983-andrewp,3,"This book covers most of the basics of Physics theory. Relativity, quantum physics and then string theory. As the authors specialty is string theory about 50% of the book is dedicated to this subject. I admit that there were some concepts that I had a hard time understanding as there is no easy way to make the subject relateable to everyday experiences. Almost all of string theory is math driven and all the discoveries are just the relationships and solutions to incredibly complex math formulas. Even then, many of the ideas come down to interpreting results that are just approximations of the final solutions. Even our most powerful computers are unable to solve these equations completely. For me that's where string theory loses some of it's credibility. With such complex math it's manipulating the numbers until you get the answer you want.As this book was written in 1999 it's inevitably a bit out of date. This was before the existence of the LHC at CERN and some of the experiments in the last decade may have shed more light and indirectly confirmed some string theory concepts. In particular the existence of the superheavy Higgs boson would be evidence of symmetry predicted by string theory.A decent book but only for people really interested in the subject. It's hard going at times so be prepared to read some sections more than once."

I found myself drawn into what he's saying even if it was a little challenging to follow sometimes."
63,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,4,"This was a fascinating book about the prospects of string theory and how it may be the ultimate theory that gives us a complete picture of reality. Mathematically speaking, the theory (or rather the hypothesis) seems to be flawless. However, it's never been experimentally proved. The reason is obvious. The strings are so tiny and hard to find if they exist. Even our most powerful atom smashers and super colliders can't produce them. Brian Green says, we need a collider the size of the entire Milky Way Galaxy to create such strings. a more advanced version of the theory is called M-theory and it's an amalgamation of a number of different theories, five to be exact, that are brought together like the arms of a starfish. the problem with the current standard model of particle physics is that it does not unite gravity with other forces. For instance, at the moment of the big bang or at the core of a black hole, Einstein's theory of general relativity (the theory of the large) and quantum mechanics (the theory of the small) can not come together. Each of these theories is perfectly capable of explaining the world in its own domain, however. String theory is thought to be our current hope to reconcile gravity and QM. Strange as it may seem, the mathematics of string theory tells us that there are eleven dimensions (ten dimensions of space and one of time) instead of four. The reason you and I can't see these dimensions is because they're so tiny.According to string theory, if we could examine particles with great precision—a precision many orders of magnitude beyond our present technological capacity—we would find that each is not pointlike, but instead consists of a tiny one-dimensional loop."

65,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110610415-richard-seltzer,5,"A few months ago, when I was reviewing What Remains to be Discovered by John Maddox, I was convinced that the world is ""unknowable.""Now, thanks to The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene, I've done a flip-flop.As Maddox says in his concluding chapter, ""Unwilling or unable to accept the seemingly paradoxical behavior of single particles, such as electrons moving through both of two slits at the same time, for example, he [Albert Einstein] sought instead a set of equations whose elegance and symmetry would command respect, and by which even paradoxical phenomena would be explicable. Einstein's quest was no doubt impelled by his great success with the general theory of relativity (otherwise the theory of gravitation), which first won attention through its elegance. As the world now knows, it was a fruitless search. Quantum phenomena are often wrongly described as paradoxes for no better reason than that they conflict with the expectations of common sense, which themselves spring from human senses that have been honed by natural selection for telling what the macroscopic world is like. It is disconcerting that phenomena on the small scale are at odds with expectation, but there is a wealth of experimental data for which no other explanation is possible. How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" (p. 373)In my review, I noted, ""...a non-scientist, like myself, might well dream the impossible dream of a science that goes beyond science, a means of learning about 'reality' and describing it without depending on experiments.""Remarkably, Greene answers that key question ""How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" While experiment has its limitations, based on what can be measured and how, indirect techniques can give us glimpses of what lies beyond, leading to new hypotheses which can also be verified, with a high degree of confidence, by indirect techniques. The vastness of the cosmos provides clues to the physical structure of matter smaller than quarks (the components of electrons, protons, and other subatomic particles) and provides ways of verifying hypotheses that are beyond the limits of our most advanced laboratories.In Green's book, the universe is ""elegant"" and knowable, in ways man believed before the discoveries of quantum physics. When confronted with new previously unexplained phenomena, he turns to such principles as symmetry, beauty and logic to gain new insight. At the end of the dark tunnel of unknowability, he sees a ""multi-verse"" consisting of many universes; he sees black holes not just as the ugly ends of dying stars, but rather as seeds for other universes; he see a multi-verse in which those universes that have the most black holes are the most likely to survive and spawn new universes in a cosmic evolution scheme, based on survival of the fittest of universes.Just when I was getting used to the idea that the world is unfundamentally unknowable -- that our brains evolved to help us cope with the world of ordinary experience and simply aren't equipped to grasp the bizarre realms of the very small and the very large -- along comes a book that inspires me with renewed faith that we can know -- based on a classical belief in beauty and symmetry -- like a revelation from the 17th or 18th century.This book is convincing, lucid, powerful, mind-expanding.I had been aesthetically wallowing in the concept of unknowability -- convinced that the greatest advances in the 20th century came from acknowledging the limitations of the human mind, proving what cannot be known. That attitude led me to a high appreciation of the works of Stanislaw Lem (see my review at www.seltzerbooks.com/lem.html) and to a whole range of authors, starting with Plato, who emphasized that the value of the pursuit of wisdom was all in the process, that nothing can be known with any certainty. It is good to seek truth; but to believe that you have found truth is bad. The value comes from the seeking itself.In the days of Emerson and Swedenborg, the world and our senses and our ability to understand seemed perfectly suited to one another. Then modern science led us to see a disjunction between the world perceived in ordinary experience and the realm of the extremely small and the realm of the extremely large, both of which were revealed by advanced instruments; and led us to conclude that the limits of our instruments were the limits of our ability to understand. Now it appears that we can leap beyond those limits, arriving at new levels of understanding about the workings of the physical world, both at the sub-particle level and at the cosmic level.I won't attempt to explain Greene's explanations. I don't presume to have grasped it in great enough detail to do it justice. Read the book itself. He writes with the authority of one of the leaders in the field of string theory, but with a clarity and patience and ability to explain complex matters simply that rivals the efforts of the very best popularizers of science.Basically, quarks consist of ""strings"", and the ""vibrations"" of these strings determine their energy, mass, and other characteristics. These vibrations have ""frequency"" or rhythm, which leads me to think of this change of perspective in terms of Yeats: the focus is now on the dance rather than the dancer. The dancers come and go and combine and recombine; come into existance and annihiate and come into existence again in new forms. Yes, there are physical limits to what we can know about the dancer; but our knowledge of the dance can extend far beyond and lead us to important new conclusions.Strangely, such a change in the underlying concepts of physics leads to a new appreciation for old authors. I can't help but think of Frazier, Jung, and Joyce, and their attempts to grasp the flow and rhythm of all of human culture. I think of the multiple natural and mental rhythms of Virginia Woolf's Waves. I think of resonance and harmonics and extraordinary effects that can come from small changes, like a bridge breaking up because of the rhythm of the wind that strikes it; and I think of transistors and how they capitalize on how, in electronics, small changes can result in large effects. I also think of the theme of music and rhythm as an important element in how the mind works and how the world works in Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach. I think of Steven Pinker's books where he gains insight into the workings of the human mind by analyzing how we use language and the rules of grammar, and I wonder if there might be a ""grammar"" or ""rules of choreography"" for the cosmic dance. I may even develop a new appreciation for the art of dance. Greene himself alludes to the ancient notion of the ""music of the spheres.""And wonder of wonders, I feel myself motivated to tackle Heidegger's Being and Time. Contrary to the ruminations of Hamlet, being and not being may not be opposites, or may not be the only alternatives. To become or not to become? To become what from what? There may be a range or field of becoming, a pattern of becoming and interacting in the rhythm of individual human life and of life in aggregate.But don't be sidetracked by my vague speculations. Read the book. It could change your image of yourself and the world you live in."
66,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"Physicists today think they may have discovered what Einstein spent the last decades of his life searching for: the Theory of Everything. String Theory (technically, Superstring Theory) is the idea that everything we see in the world is really the result of one-dimensional strings vibrating in particular patterns. And if the idea of one-dimensional strings is hard for you to wrap your head around, then buckle up before you read this book, because that's the easy part. This book is dense. It's very, very technical. Yes, he promises no math, so we don't actually look at the formulas. But you can't talk about this theory without talking about math. We can't observe things this small with our technology today, so this is basically all math equations that add up nicely. So the book talks about math a lot--including a chapter that centered the differences between physics-based math and academic-Phd math. Unlike Einstein's theories, which were prompted by cool thought experiments, string theory is driven by equations. It's not intuitive at all. But if you can march through that technical data and make your brain stretch into odd shapes, then there are some interesting implications. He's not a Christian, but as a Christian I find some fascinating tidbits. Example: this new theory says all of reality is a result of vibrating strings, that the particular vibration patterns manifest as the bits of matter and energy that we observe. And the Bible says that the universe was formless and void until God spoke."
67,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"At long last I finished reading this! Detailed science books aren't the best bus books. :oSo this book about M-theory etc. was a great read. I very much enjoyed myself reading it and weirdly enough I kept laughing because Greene has a really amusing way of throwing in ridiculous humor while dreaming up weird analogies. I'm sure I wouldn't understand any of the mathematics behind what's described here, and to be honest even the layperson's explanation of the science was a stretch for me sometimes, but I was invested enough sometimes to wonder about what else has progressed on the questions raised in this book since it was written and have looked things up to find out what's newer in the field. Especially when Greene made references to the particle accelerator and what it might find when it was completed. I read some cool stuff about the Higgs Boson and all that. YEAH!Anyway, some notes I took while reading are my best way to share my thoughts.1. I giggled when the author described a scientist's reaction to the discovery of muons: ""Who ordered THAT?""2. His way of explaining the way physical objects change as they go faster was well thought out. Showing how it's happening every day but we can't detect it due to small measurements. Increasing them would make the difference apparent, and if we lived in a world where those measurements were standard, it'd be intuitive and invisible to us again.3. There was a great explanation of how a race car reaches the finish line slower if it travels diagonally, since some of the time is taken away to achieve horizontal travel.4. I find it really interesting that it apparently takes infinite power to push something faster than light because it becomes heavier and heavier as it approaches light speed, and that's why we can't go faster than light.5. I was envisioning warped space like a rubber tarp before the author explained the 3D problem. I am secretly a physicist after all!6. In a discussion of why energy is in lumps (discussing Planck's Constant): ""It's as if nature allows a whole pint of beer or no beer at all."" Haha.7. It's so interesting that observing matter affects it (photos hitting it has an effect), and if we lessened the photons we'd also be less likely to be able to determine its location because of the wave's length. And the electrons become ""frantic"" when they're cornered so they can't have their speed or location determined at the same time.8. The quantum tunneling descriptions were effective! It was cool to learn that electrons can go through stuff because of the space around the particles, but that it is unlikely that it will happen because being lucky enough for that to happen takes a really long time.9. The fifth level of magnification showing quantum froth was really effective. The borrowing and paying back analogy makes sense to explain why over long distances space seems flat, like a dot matrix printer makes images that look smooth.10. The ""Price is Right"" analogy for the large amount of money (energy) leaving a small amount down to the penny was a good way to explain why the specifics are too difficult for existing math to figure out.11. It's true that ""elegance"" and aesthetic doesn't prove a theory. We want theories to be beautiful, but if they're proved wrong we have to reject them, even if it's tempting to assume the elegance means it's accurate. But aesthetic does figure into choices in the research direction for theories.12. Sypersymmetry demands an as yet undetected super-partner particle. They're calling the one for electron ""selectron."" Also, ""squark"" and ""sneutrino."" I laughed.13. I like that they're allowing for the fact that the universe might not have the property of supersymmetry just because it would be mathematically matchy.14. The metaphor of 5 different theories of what happened to Earhart was a great way to explain why 5 slightly different superstring theories makes the idea itself less trustworthy.15. ""Comings and Goings of a Garden Hose."" I laughed. Maybe Kaluza K. Line came up with this epiphany just to combat the drudgery of staring at his neighbor's dot-eye. According to Linestein, there's a way to expand that dimension! 16. These ways of explaining the 10 dimensions (6 of them curled up in larger ones) WAS SO COOL.17. I really love the story of how Greene learned that another paper had duplicated the same findings as his and mirror symmetry in string theory is A THING. With holes that match up in Calabi-Yau shapes. !!!!!!18. I like how Greene explains counting a huge bin of oranges and then having a solution presented with a friend showing up with a box and how many boxes there were when the oranges were delivered. This is an analogy for why doing calculations on a mirror-imaged Calabi-Yau shape is sometimes easier than doing the math on its first one.19. The rivalry between the mathematicians and the physicists--I giggled a lot. I love that they compared their results, got different answers, and later found an error in the math camp's computer code that when fixed yielded the physics answer. After mining math for tools all this time, physics can give back, as it also solved other insurmountable math issues!20. I love the human element to the scientists' research into flop transitions and how Greene and Morrison had to teach each other their disciplines to make progress. They wanted to beat Witten to a discovery.21. I liked the story of working with Aspinwall to determine the shape of the Calabi-Yau shape they're looking for and having to buy him beer to make him come in on Saturday.22. Nobody knows the string coupling constant. Oy.23. Black holes have no ""hair."" They are all the same as each other. Small black holes will act just like large black holes in experiments.24. The revisions Greene and Morrison made after posting their article the first time resulted from having devil's advocate conversations. Haha.25. Hawking and Thorne had a bet with Preskill about whether information can reemerge after a black hole evaporates. Loser buys the winner an encyclopedia!I love learning about all these innovations and I love what dorks scientists are. I admire their imagination and passion, and even though most of the rest of the world will have no idea when they make their breakthroughs, I love all these ideas and I want to know where they've gone since."
68,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12872086-sheeraz,4,"It's a little difficult to review this book because I can't say I understood and retained everything that was presented. With that caveat, I think the author did a great job in explaining some very gnarly and unintuitive concepts to a non-physicist. The use of analogies was spot on and kept the narrative interesting even when my brain grasped at the edges of the ideas presented.The book, as the name suggests, is primarily about the development, current state and future outlook of string theory -- a good contender for a theory that unifies the description of different forces, and hopefully has physical properties of the universe as emergent quantities. The ideas are fascinating, like challenging our notion of distance building on Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The book got me excited about the future of string physics and its bearing on cosmology, and hoping that we will see some potential evidence in the favor of the theory in our lifetimes."
69,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8379733-bookhode,2,"Well, this was disappointing. Brian Greene's book with a pointlessly superlong title, had started off just fine, providing a nice recap of major developments in physics during the last century or so, with the special focus on Einstein's revolutionary theories, and on quantum mechanics that followed. This part was relatively easy to grasp, and despite the author's rather clumsy attempts at metaphor on almost every page, it was also relatively easy to read. The next part, where we reached the conflict between physics of the very small (with its rules based on probability), and physics of the very large (with exact rules), was also ok, as the book kept its flow, and I was able to follow the plot, and at least understand what the problem was all about.But then, we got to the central topic of this book, which is supposed to be the superstring theory, and things just quickly deteriorated in almost every way. The metaphors Greene kept on using became really weird, and were more hurting than helping the reader to cope with the increasingly difficult explanations. Chapters where he talked about his own achievements and discoveries in this field, were presented with overabundance of details, which was rather sharp contrast to the tone used in the rest of this book. And complete lack of any critical thought by the author towards the superstrings theory, made me feel like I was reading some kind of political pamphlet, and not an open-minded work of popular science.To a layman like me, the superstrings theory is bullshit. It's a fantasy about something we cannot see, feel or test in any practical manner. And the fact that the whole thing requires making up some weird multidimensional shapes, and then adjusting our regular mathematics by inventing more and more dimensions just to make the numbers fit, should completely kill its credibility. Of course, I am way out of my league here, and the theory could be quite correct, but the author never really managed to find the language or approach to persuade me to accept his opinion. All he did was to highhandedly wave off any criticism, and basically put the reader in a fait accompli position, where he should either agree with this inevitable new wisdom, or feel stupid. And I would rather feel stupid, than accept bullshit without any chance of verification.Current score: 49/100Current ranking: 37th among my non-fiction books."
70,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12365204-y-l,3,"I have to admit this has been a book I have had a love-hate relationship with for a good few months. I may have had it a lot easier than others as the friend who graciously loaned me this book had preempted me with a few documentary videos of Stephen Hawking and BBC as an introduction to the subject. Nevertheless, the universe is (as always) a long and lengthy subject to grasp and claiming that reading this book was a breeze would do the universe no justice.Thanks to three hours or so of videos, reading the first few chapters of this book was like reading revision notes on a day's worth of lecture. I wouldn't say I made every effort to understand each mathematic equation or even appreciate the technicality of physics and quantum mechanics that make the most part of this book, but I can now truly appreciate how mind-blowing it is to perceive the universe to be so much more than a big black blanket of space. Greene offered a glimpse of how quantum physicists and mathematicians look at our universe and writes eloquently on the slow and painstaking process of discovering the universe and the mechanics of it through decades of theories, collaboration and backsteps. I especially love how he details the life of himself and his colleagues as they accept each others strength and weaknesses on the subject and push each other to their limits to solve the mysteries that the universe has set at their doorstep. That itself would have probably made it a much more enjoyable book for me. As much as I am grateful for being given the opportunity to appreciate this subject via layman standards, I still feel that the book needs to be expressed a little better. Introductions on some parts of the subject could have been spared as the selling point of this book seems to be the concept of possibilities rather than dry science.I ended this book feeling a little overwhelmed - not sure if it is because of all the unnecessary fluff leading up to String Theory, the anticipation of whether String Theory will live up to its potential of a unified theory, or the fact that Greene had unsuspectingly dumped all his hopes and ideologies into the last few pages of the book to sell his idea of String Theory to the masses. I am all set to read Paul Davies' take on this...just as soon as I recover."
71,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9729716-jason,3," I was given this book as a gift. I typically don't go for the sort of fluffy stuff you'd find in the ""Science"" section at Barnes & Noble, which I figured this would be. I'm much more into mathematics than physics and have devoted most of my academic career to math shit rather than physics shit. So I was already prepared to lose my footing at some point in this book. I have a pretty good grasp on Special Relativity though so I tried to use that as a gauge for how well this dude was describing the more recent stuff beyond the point where my eyes just glazed over. I was happy that this fella got into stuff that lost me. It worries me when I finish a book about a complex or abstract thing and it's not a struggle to understand the material. I wonder whether the writer is just that good or that bad. What I found about this dude is that his wanting to illustrate everything with a metaphor or an analogy wound up confusing the stuff more. I mean, some were cool and I think I gleaned something of the rough shape of an idea. There were other spots where he used 3-4 different metaphors to get across an idea that was already pretty damn abstract. I think at those spots I'd have preferred more elaboration in the form of the notes in the back for ""the expert reader"" or for ""the mathematically inclined"". I basically read this as a starting point. I kept a book for notes as I read and now I have a bunch of pages of leads for further investigation. On a superficial level, I liked this guy's writing style. And the book was somewhat enjoyable while discussing bananas shit. I think there was a chapter or 2 where my reading was as productive as staring at the floor. All in all I don't know who I'd recommend this to. I'm part of a math club and no one there would take it off my hands when I was done because they don't like ""rock star physicists"" who write fluffy science books. But at the same time I can't give it to my mom because it does get into stuff within the first page that would lose her.  I'm not sure if all this explains why I gave it 3 stars, but I felt the need to be lengthy."
72,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458834-mark-laflamme,0,"For me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that started it all. Greene has such a smooth way of easing the novice into the complexities of string theory, the reader feels almost acquainted by the time the science is introduced. Never boring or tedious, Greene deftly guides us through the basics of relativity, explains the importance of frames of reference, and eases us into the almost magical world of gravity and timespace.Like Einstein, Greene presents the science through simple visuals - balls and bicycles, funny cars and cartoon spaceships. The reader will never feel as though he sits in a classroom with a boring professor droning away the afternoon. Instead, Greene describes the physics in a real world way and in doing so, prepares even the most casual student for the truly strange world of strings.String theory appears to be the road to a unified theory, the long sought Theory of Everything that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics. Along the way is a wonderous world of possibilities, with extra dimensions, parallel worlds, and all the while, tiny strings vibrating the symphony of the universe.I read this book with a zeal normally reserved for action novels. Each night was a new lesson and a new glimpse at a different part of the universe. Greene's gift is a clear and friendly writing style that makes this heavy science accessible to those of us without a string of initials at the end of our name.Many physicists came before Greene and others have followed suit. But for me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that opened my eyes to the mind blowing world of strings and the possibilities they present. And I've been hooked on string theory since. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked at a sky full of stars and wondered what it's all about.Mark LaFlamme, author of ""The Pink Room"" "
73,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"Though the first third of this book was amusing and accessible in a childish way, the book as a whole left me with a feeling that my brain is as tiny and crumpled up as a Calabi-Yau space, whichever shape it implies! :(My opinion of this book is similar but not equal to Rob's (though I liked his review), because I didn't think the first third of the book gave me a fairly good understanding of the Einstein's relativity concepts at all. For instance, the rubber membrane - bowling ball analogy was totally misleading for me.I like Marvin's review much more and I think it's clear why. :)Anyway, after this book I felt an awful need to 'unwarp' and 'uncurl' my brain, which made me look for another one - with better explanations of physics concepts ... and I had luck! Hmm, could this be the reason to change my rating to 5 stars?! No, because my lucky find doesn't deal with the string theory.Almost forgot to add: My lucky find was The Perception of Space... and its Measurement plus Galloping with Light - The Special Theory of Relativity by Felix Alba-Juez"

What gives?!Ok, in all seriousness, this is an enjoyable book to read, but you're not going to come out of it understanding much about string theory. It's just too complicated, which is one of its serious flaws. I have really liked all of Brian Greene's books, but the more I read the less inclined I am to believe in string theory. Maybe if I had read this before Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law by Peter Holt or The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next by Lee Smolin, but those two books really do a good job of refuting this one."

String theory might be an approach that doesn't work, but it remains a unique approach to describing the universe and a mathematically beautiful approach at that. Science needs new ways to describe the world time after time. Otherwise it becomes stagnant and fails to expand our understanding of things.Greene does a good job of explaining the basics of it. Many popular science writers tend to oversimplify some things and only mention other things in vague passages. The oversimplified ideas lose half of their meaning and the rest become hard to notice even by people who already understand them. Green wants your full attention. He will not butcher scientific concepts to tell you half-truths you can understand easier. However, he does his best to make things as simple as possible for the reader. Greene is passionate and his writing shows that he cares about it. I think that makes the book even better."
76,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"About the best book on the subject and by a mile. As almost all the other reviewers claim, the initial parts on Newtonian, Relativistic and Quantum science are so beautifully and novelly explained that they should be made mandatory in any study books on the topic. The approach continues as the author jumps to explaining a far more complex super-string theory. And here, the simplistic explanations make the theory look highly speculative, fantastic and without much ground/proof. This is certainly not the case and perhaps that's because far more work is needed not just in completing the theory but grasping its real meaning. This does not remotely lessen the utility or interesting style of the book as I strongly believe that there does not exist - at least so far - any simpler explanations. For anyone interested in cosmology, an absolute must read - ideally multiple times over a few years. Hope the author comes with an update soon."

This is not as accessible as Stephen hawking, but a very well written book none the less. I would say this is for people who've already been introduced to the string theory, I tried reading it the first time without knowing anything about it and found myself staring like a deer in headlights. Once I got more familiar with the concepts (I used youtube videos) I went back to this book and enjoyed myself a lot.

There was a lot of very nice analogies and explanations - but the opposite is also true. I also don't really feel like I gained all that much from reading this. Like, I still don't know very much about string theory. Overall, I do not think this is a very good book, but the easily readable parts of the book, with their analogies and what not, prevent it from getting bottom score from me. So two stars from here."

At times fascinating at others almost unintelligible (to this newb) this book was anything but 'elegant' and the Universe described even less so. To start with, is anyone not able to do the math really able to understand this this stuff, at all? The number of times Dr. Greene describes the mathematics as extremely difficult or tricky or almost inaccessible (to PhD physicists and mathematicians, some of them Nobel level minds) is enough to make any 'normal' person falter in pretending to get it. Starting with the chapters on String Theory if you are not partially lost then you have either been exposed to these ideas repeatedly or are one or two orders of magnitude smarter than me. Calabai-Yau shapes, M-theory, branes, curled-up dimensions, Heterotic string theory (not very erotic!!), symmetry, super-symmetry, super-gravity, duality, etc. the list of concepts brand new to me goes on and on. That is is not to say he does not make brave efforts to have it make some sense. I do feel that I have some vague notion how of things beyond relativity and quantum mechanics might operate but that is about it. I guess there is a NOVA series and it might be worth to check out at this moment before it is all vaporised by time. And of course this book was written in 1999/2003 and many of the concepts may already have been 'clarified', confirmed or rejected. But overall I'd still recommend this book for an introduction to a very complex subject which asks some really big questions and tries to give some answers."

It hasn't been a straightforward or easy journey, but I'm getting there. Greene's book on String Theory has definitely provided that well-balanced mix between a scientific and detailed book and an accessible and digestible narrative. There were plenty of metaphors and examples throughout that simplified what to me at least was a very complex topic, and I find this is a good foundational book for someone dipping their toes in physics.As a theory, nonetheless, I must stress that this is not an answer to the big question, but a potential ""theory of everything"". It hasn't been proven - in fact, it might have been quite battered down in recent years. Therefore, take everything with a grain of salt and a critical mind that a science book should ultimately stimulate.I will admit, though, that despite the accessible and interesting character of The Elegant Universe, I find myself forgetting quite a lot of what it contained... I suck. I do recommend it because, again, I felt like it provided a lot of the foundation to understand physics in our time, but I am not sure I personally attained a greater understanding.

(And, for what it's worth, I used an audiobook to either preview or review, or simply to follow along with, chapters. Erik Davies is a superb, well-prepared narrator, but for the most part, you must have the book, and its many helpful illustrations, in your hand as you go through this material. Unless you're a physicist, you shouldn't be listening to this one on the way to work.)

I had college physics classes in the early 80s, and have read a number of “modern” pop physics books in the past couple of decades. I understand, in many aspects, the basics of physics pre-string theory. But this new stuff? I understand some of the definitions, but that’s about it. Greene’s book is very good at giving descriptions and examples and analogies for aspects of physics it is trying to explain. And for the older concepts, it does a great job. The newer concepts, string theory and beyond, are explained in the same way, with the same care. I found these concepts more difficult to understand, but I suspect that’s my problem, not the fault of the author. I found the book well organized, and the examples often memorable. However, I didn’t get the level of understanding I was hoping for concerning recent advances in physics. I would consider reading more by this author, but may be looking for a lower grade level."

91,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3590983-andrewp,3,"This book covers most of the basics of Physics theory. Relativity, quantum physics and then string theory. As the authors specialty is string theory about 50% of the book is dedicated to this subject. I admit that there were some concepts that I had a hard time understanding as there is no easy way to make the subject relateable to everyday experiences. Almost all of string theory is math driven and all the discoveries are just the relationships and solutions to incredibly complex math formulas. Even then, many of the ideas come down to interpreting results that are just approximations of the final solutions. Even our most powerful computers are unable to solve these equations completely. For me that's where string theory loses some of it's credibility. With such complex math it's manipulating the numbers until you get the answer you want.As this book was written in 1999 it's inevitably a bit out of date. This was before the existence of the LHC at CERN and some of the experiments in the last decade may have shed more light and indirectly confirmed some string theory concepts. In particular the existence of the superheavy Higgs boson would be evidence of symmetry predicted by string theory.A decent book but only for people really interested in the subject.

93,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,4,"This was a fascinating book about the prospects of string theory and how it may be the ultimate theory that gives us a complete picture of reality. Mathematically speaking, the theory (or rather the hypothesis) seems to be flawless. However, it's never been experimentally proved. The reason is obvious. The strings are so tiny and hard to find if they exist. Even our most powerful atom smashers and super colliders can't produce them. Brian Green says, we need a collider the size of the entire Milky Way Galaxy to create such strings. a more advanced version of the theory is called M-theory and it's an amalgamation of a number of different theories, five to be exact, that are brought together like the arms of a starfish. the problem with the current standard model of particle physics is that it does not unite gravity with other forces. For instance, at the moment of the big bang or at the core of a black hole, Einstein's theory of general relativity (the theory of the large) and quantum mechanics (the theory of the small) can not come together. Each of these theories is perfectly capable of explaining the world in its own domain, however. String theory is thought to be our current hope to reconcile gravity and QM. Strange as it may seem, the mathematics of string theory tells us that there are eleven dimensions (ten dimensions of space and one of time) instead of four. The reason you and I can't see these dimensions is because they're so tiny.According to string theory, if we could examine particles with great precision—a precision many orders of magnitude beyond our present technological capacity—we would find that each is not pointlike, but instead consists of a tiny one-dimensional loop."

95,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110610415-richard-seltzer,5,"A few months ago, when I was reviewing What Remains to be Discovered by John Maddox, I was convinced that the world is ""unknowable.""Now, thanks to The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene, I've done a flip-flop.As Maddox says in his concluding chapter, ""Unwilling or unable to accept the seemingly paradoxical behavior of single particles, such as electrons moving through both of two slits at the same time, for example, he [Albert Einstein] sought instead a set of equations whose elegance and symmetry would command respect, and by which even paradoxical phenomena would be explicable. Einstein's quest was no doubt impelled by his great success with the general theory of relativity (otherwise the theory of gravitation), which first won attention through its elegance. As the world now knows, it was a fruitless search. Quantum phenomena are often wrongly described as paradoxes for no better reason than that they conflict with the expectations of common sense, which themselves spring from human senses that have been honed by natural selection for telling what the macroscopic world is like. It is disconcerting that phenomena on the small scale are at odds with expectation, but there is a wealth of experimental data for which no other explanation is possible. How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" (p. 373)In my review, I noted, ""...a non-scientist, like myself, might well dream the impossible dream of a science that goes beyond science, a means of learning about 'reality' and describing it without depending on experiments.""Remarkably, Greene answers that key question ""How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" While experiment has its limitations, based on what can be measured and how, indirect techniques can give us glimpses of what lies beyond, leading to new hypotheses which can also be verified, with a high degree of confidence, by indirect techniques. The vastness of the cosmos provides clues to the physical structure of matter smaller than quarks (the components of electrons, protons, and other subatomic particles) and provides ways of verifying hypotheses that are beyond the limits of our most advanced laboratories.In Green's book, the universe is ""elegant"" and knowable, in ways man believed before the discoveries of quantum physics. When confronted with new previously unexplained phenomena, he turns to such principles as symmetry, beauty and logic to gain new insight. At the end of the dark tunnel of unknowability, he sees a ""multi-verse"" consisting of many universes; he sees black holes not just as the ugly ends of dying stars, but rather as seeds for other universes; he see a multi-verse in which those universes that have the most black holes are the most likely to survive and spawn new universes in a cosmic evolution scheme, based on survival of the fittest of universes.Just when I was getting used to the idea that the world is unfundamentally unknowable -- that our brains evolved to help us cope with the world of ordinary experience and simply aren't equipped to grasp the bizarre realms of the very small and the very large -- along comes a book that inspires me with renewed faith that we can know -- based on a classical belief in beauty and symmetry -- like a revelation from the 17th or 18th century.This book is convincing, lucid, powerful, mind-expanding.I had been aesthetically wallowing in the concept of unknowability -- convinced that the greatest advances in the 20th century came from acknowledging the limitations of the human mind, proving what cannot be known. That attitude led me to a high appreciation of the works of Stanislaw Lem (see my review at www.seltzerbooks.com/lem.html) and to a whole range of authors, starting with Plato, who emphasized that the value of the pursuit of wisdom was all in the process, that nothing can be known with any certainty. It is good to seek truth; but to believe that you have found truth is bad. The value comes from the seeking itself.In the days of Emerson and Swedenborg, the world and our senses and our ability to understand seemed perfectly suited to one another. Then modern science led us to see a disjunction between the world perceived in ordinary experience and the realm of the extremely small and the realm of the extremely large, both of which were revealed by advanced instruments; and led us to conclude that the limits of our instruments were the limits of our ability to understand. Now it appears that we can leap beyond those limits, arriving at new levels of understanding about the workings of the physical world, both at the sub-particle level and at the cosmic level.I won't attempt to explain Greene's explanations. I don't presume to have grasped it in great enough detail to do it justice. Read the book itself. He writes with the authority of one of the leaders in the field of string theory, but with a clarity and patience and ability to explain complex matters simply that rivals the efforts of the very best popularizers of science.Basically, quarks consist of ""strings"", and the ""vibrations"" of these strings determine their energy, mass, and other characteristics. These vibrations have ""frequency"" or rhythm, which leads me to think of this change of perspective in terms of Yeats: the focus is now on the dance rather than the dancer. The dancers come and go and combine and recombine; come into existance and annihiate and come into existence again in new forms. Yes, there are physical limits to what we can know about the dancer; but our knowledge of the dance can extend far beyond and lead us to important new conclusions.Strangely, such a change in the underlying concepts of physics leads to a new appreciation for old authors. I can't help but think of Frazier, Jung, and Joyce, and their attempts to grasp the flow and rhythm of all of human culture. I think of the multiple natural and mental rhythms of Virginia Woolf's Waves. I think of resonance and harmonics and extraordinary effects that can come from small changes, like a bridge breaking up because of the rhythm of the wind that strikes it; and I think of transistors and how they capitalize on how, in electronics, small changes can result in large effects. I also think of the theme of music and rhythm as an important element in how the mind works and how the world works in Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach. I think of Steven Pinker's books where he gains insight into the workings of the human mind by analyzing how we use language and the rules of grammar, and I wonder if there might be a ""grammar"" or ""rules of choreography"" for the cosmic dance. I may even develop a new appreciation for the art of dance. Greene himself alludes to the ancient notion of the ""music of the spheres.""And wonder of wonders, I feel myself motivated to tackle Heidegger's Being and Time. Contrary to the ruminations of Hamlet, being and not being may not be opposites, or may not be the only alternatives. To become or not to become? To become what from what? There may be a range or field of becoming, a pattern of becoming and interacting in the rhythm of individual human life and of life in aggregate.But don't be sidetracked by my vague speculations. Read the book. It could change your image of yourself and the world you live in."
96,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"Physicists today think they may have discovered what Einstein spent the last decades of his life searching for: the Theory of Everything. String Theory (technically, Superstring Theory) is the idea that everything we see in the world is really the result of one-dimensional strings vibrating in particular patterns. And if the idea of one-dimensional strings is hard for you to wrap your head around, then buckle up before you read this book, because that's the easy part. This book is dense. It's very, very technical. Yes, he promises no math, so we don't actually look at the formulas. But you can't talk about this theory without talking about math. We can't observe things this small with our technology today, so this is basically all math equations that add up nicely. So the book talks about math a lot--including a chapter that centered the differences between physics-based math and academic-Phd math. Unlike Einstein's theories, which were prompted by cool thought experiments, string theory is driven by equations. It's not intuitive at all. But if you can march through that technical data and make your brain stretch into odd shapes, then there are some interesting implications. He's not a Christian, but as a Christian I find some fascinating tidbits. Example: this new theory says all of reality is a result of vibrating strings, that the particular vibration patterns manifest as the bits of matter and energy that we observe. And the Bible says that the universe was formless and void until God spoke."
97,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"At long last I finished reading this! Detailed science books aren't the best bus books. :oSo this book about M-theory etc. was a great read. I very much enjoyed myself reading it and weirdly enough I kept laughing because Greene has a really amusing way of throwing in ridiculous humor while dreaming up weird analogies. I'm sure I wouldn't understand any of the mathematics behind what's described here, and to be honest even the layperson's explanation of the science was a stretch for me sometimes, but I was invested enough sometimes to wonder about what else has progressed on the questions raised in this book since it was written and have looked things up to find out what's newer in the field. Especially when Greene made references to the particle accelerator and what it might find when it was completed. I read some cool stuff about the Higgs Boson and all that. YEAH!Anyway, some notes I took while reading are my best way to share my thoughts.1. I giggled when the author described a scientist's reaction to the discovery of muons: ""Who ordered THAT?""2. His way of explaining the way physical objects change as they go faster was well thought out. Showing how it's happening every day but we can't detect it due to small measurements. Increasing them would make the difference apparent, and if we lived in a world where those measurements were standard, it'd be intuitive and invisible to us again.3. There was a great explanation of how a race car reaches the finish line slower if it travels diagonally, since some of the time is taken away to achieve horizontal travel.4. I find it really interesting that it apparently takes infinite power to push something faster than light because it becomes heavier and heavier as it approaches light speed, and that's why we can't go faster than light.5. I was envisioning warped space like a rubber tarp before the author explained the 3D problem. I am secretly a physicist after all!6. In a discussion of why energy is in lumps (discussing Planck's Constant): ""It's as if nature allows a whole pint of beer or no beer at all."" Haha.7. It's so interesting that observing matter affects it (photos hitting it has an effect), and if we lessened the photons we'd also be less likely to be able to determine its location because of the wave's length. And the electrons become ""frantic"" when they're cornered so they can't have their speed or location determined at the same time.8. The quantum tunneling descriptions were effective! It was cool to learn that electrons can go through stuff because of the space around the particles, but that it is unlikely that it will happen because being lucky enough for that to happen takes a really long time.9. The fifth level of magnification showing quantum froth was really effective. The borrowing and paying back analogy makes sense to explain why over long distances space seems flat, like a dot matrix printer makes images that look smooth.10. The ""Price is Right"" analogy for the large amount of money (energy) leaving a small amount down to the penny was a good way to explain why the specifics are too difficult for existing math to figure out.11. It's true that ""elegance"" and aesthetic doesn't prove a theory. We want theories to be beautiful, but if they're proved wrong we have to reject them, even if it's tempting to assume the elegance means it's accurate. But aesthetic does figure into choices in the research direction for theories.12. Sypersymmetry demands an as yet undetected super-partner particle. They're calling the one for electron ""selectron."" Also, ""squark"" and ""sneutrino."" I laughed.13. I like that they're allowing for the fact that the universe might not have the property of supersymmetry just because it would be mathematically matchy.14. The metaphor of 5 different theories of what happened to Earhart was a great way to explain why 5 slightly different superstring theories makes the idea itself less trustworthy.15. ""Comings and Goings of a Garden Hose."" I laughed. Maybe Kaluza K. Line came up with this epiphany just to combat the drudgery of staring at his neighbor's dot-eye. According to Linestein, there's a way to expand that dimension! 16. These ways of explaining the 10 dimensions (6 of them curled up in larger ones) WAS SO COOL.17. I really love the story of how Greene learned that another paper had duplicated the same findings as his and mirror symmetry in string theory is A THING. With holes that match up in Calabi-Yau shapes. !!!!!!18. I like how Greene explains counting a huge bin of oranges and then having a solution presented with a friend showing up with a box and how many boxes there were when the oranges were delivered. This is an analogy for why doing calculations on a mirror-imaged Calabi-Yau shape is sometimes easier than doing the math on its first one.19. The rivalry between the mathematicians and the physicists--I giggled a lot. I love that they compared their results, got different answers, and later found an error in the math camp's computer code that when fixed yielded the physics answer. After mining math for tools all this time, physics can give back, as it also solved other insurmountable math issues!20. I love the human element to the scientists' research into flop transitions and how Greene and Morrison had to teach each other their disciplines to make progress. They wanted to beat Witten to a discovery.21. I liked the story of working with Aspinwall to determine the shape of the Calabi-Yau shape they're looking for and having to buy him beer to make him come in on Saturday.22. Nobody knows the string coupling constant. Oy.23. Black holes have no ""hair."" They are all the same as each other. Small black holes will act just like large black holes in experiments.24. The revisions Greene and Morrison made after posting their article the first time resulted from having devil's advocate conversations. Haha.25. Hawking and Thorne had a bet with Preskill about whether information can reemerge after a black hole evaporates. Loser buys the winner an encyclopedia!I love learning about all these innovations and I love what dorks scientists are. I admire their imagination and passion, and even though most of the rest of the world will have no idea when they make their breakthroughs, I love all these ideas and I want to know where they've gone since."

The use of analogies was spot on and kept the narrative interesting even when my brain grasped at the edges of the ideas presented.The book, as the name suggests, is primarily about the development, current state and future outlook of string theory -- a good contender for a theory that unifies the description of different forces, and hopefully has physical properties of the universe as emergent quantities. The ideas are fascinating, like challenging our notion of distance building on Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The book got me excited about the future of string physics and its bearing on cosmology, and hoping that we will see some potential evidence in the favor of the theory in our lifetimes."
99,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8379733-bookhode,2,"Well, this was disappointing. Brian Greene's book with a pointlessly superlong title, had started off just fine, providing a nice recap of major developments in physics during the last century or so, with the special focus on Einstein's revolutionary theories, and on quantum mechanics that followed. This part was relatively easy to grasp, and despite the author's rather clumsy attempts at metaphor on almost every page, it was also relatively easy to read. The next part, where we reached the conflict between physics of the very small (with its rules based on probability), and physics of the very large (with exact rules), was also ok, as the book kept its flow, and I was able to follow the plot, and at least understand what the problem was all about.But then, we got to the central topic of this book, which is supposed to be the superstring theory, and things just quickly deteriorated in almost every way. The metaphors Greene kept on using became really weird, and were more hurting than helping the reader to cope with the increasingly difficult explanations. Chapters where he talked about his own achievements and discoveries in this field, were presented with overabundance of details, which was rather sharp contrast to the tone used in the rest of this book. And complete lack of any critical thought by the author towards the superstrings theory, made me feel like I was reading some kind of political pamphlet, and not an open-minded work of popular science.To a layman like me, the superstrings theory is bullshit. It's a fantasy about something we cannot see, feel or test in any practical manner. And the fact that the whole thing requires making up some weird multidimensional shapes, and then adjusting our regular mathematics by inventing more and more dimensions just to make the numbers fit, should completely kill its credibility. Of course, I am way out of my league here, and the theory could be quite correct, but the author never really managed to find the language or approach to persuade me to accept his opinion. All he did was to highhandedly wave off any criticism, and basically put the reader in a fait accompli position, where he should either agree with this inevitable new wisdom, or feel stupid. And I would rather feel stupid, than accept bullshit without any chance of verification.Current score: 49/100Current ranking: 37th among my non-fiction books."
100,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12365204-y-l,3,"I have to admit this has been a book I have had a love-hate relationship with for a good few months. I may have had it a lot easier than others as the friend who graciously loaned me this book had preempted me with a few documentary videos of Stephen Hawking and BBC as an introduction to the subject. Nevertheless, the universe is (as always) a long and lengthy subject to grasp and claiming that reading this book was a breeze would do the universe no justice.Thanks to three hours or so of videos, reading the first few chapters of this book was like reading revision notes on a day's worth of lecture. I wouldn't say I made every effort to understand each mathematic equation or even appreciate the technicality of physics and quantum mechanics that make the most part of this book, but I can now truly appreciate how mind-blowing it is to perceive the universe to be so much more than a big black blanket of space. Greene offered a glimpse of how quantum physicists and mathematicians look at our universe and writes eloquently on the slow and painstaking process of discovering the universe and the mechanics of it through decades of theories, collaboration and backsteps. I especially love how he details the life of himself and his colleagues as they accept each others strength and weaknesses on the subject and push each other to their limits to solve the mysteries that the universe has set at their doorstep. That itself would have probably made it a much more enjoyable book for me. As much as I am grateful for being given the opportunity to appreciate this subject via layman standards, I still feel that the book needs to be expressed a little better. Introductions on some parts of the subject could have been spared as the selling point of this book seems to be the concept of possibilities rather than dry science.I ended this book feeling a little overwhelmed - not sure if it is because of all the unnecessary fluff leading up to String Theory, the anticipation of whether String Theory will live up to its potential of a unified theory, or the fact that Greene had unsuspectingly dumped all his hopes and ideologies into the last few pages of the book to sell his idea of String Theory to the masses. I am all set to read Paul Davies' take on this...just as soon as I recover."
101,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9729716-jason,3," I was given this book as a gift. I typically don't go for the sort of fluffy stuff you'd find in the ""Science"" section at Barnes & Noble, which I figured this would be. I'm much more into mathematics than physics and have devoted most of my academic career to math shit rather than physics shit. So I was already prepared to lose my footing at some point in this book. I have a pretty good grasp on Special Relativity though so I tried to use that as a gauge for how well this dude was describing the more recent stuff beyond the point where my eyes just glazed over. I was happy that this fella got into stuff that lost me. It worries me when I finish a book about a complex or abstract thing and it's not a struggle to understand the material. I wonder whether the writer is just that good or that bad. What I found about this dude is that his wanting to illustrate everything with a metaphor or an analogy wound up confusing the stuff more. I mean, some were cool and I think I gleaned something of the rough shape of an idea. There were other spots where he used 3-4 different metaphors to get across an idea that was already pretty damn abstract. I think at those spots I'd have preferred more elaboration in the form of the notes in the back for ""the expert reader"" or for ""the mathematically inclined"". I basically read this as a starting point. I kept a book for notes as I read and now I have a bunch of pages of leads for further investigation. On a superficial level, I liked this guy's writing style. And the book was somewhat enjoyable while discussing bananas shit. I think there was a chapter or 2 where my reading was as productive as staring at the floor. All in all I don't know who I'd recommend this to. I'm part of a math club and no one there would take it off my hands when I was done because they don't like ""rock star physicists"" who write fluffy science books. But at the same time I can't give it to my mom because it does get into stuff within the first page that would lose her.  I'm not sure if all this explains why I gave it 3 stars, but I felt the need to be lengthy."
102,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458834-mark-laflamme,0,"For me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that started it all. Greene has such a smooth way of easing the novice into the complexities of string theory, the reader feels almost acquainted by the time the science is introduced. Never boring or tedious, Greene deftly guides us through the basics of relativity, explains the importance of frames of reference, and eases us into the almost magical world of gravity and timespace.Like Einstein, Greene presents the science through simple visuals - balls and bicycles, funny cars and cartoon spaceships. The reader will never feel as though he sits in a classroom with a boring professor droning away the afternoon. Instead, Greene describes the physics in a real world way and in doing so, prepares even the most casual student for the truly strange world of strings.String theory appears to be the road to a unified theory, the long sought Theory of Everything that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics. Along the way is a wonderous world of possibilities, with extra dimensions, parallel worlds, and all the while, tiny strings vibrating the symphony of the universe.I read this book with a zeal normally reserved for action novels. Each night was a new lesson and a new glimpse at a different part of the universe. Greene's gift is a clear and friendly writing style that makes this heavy science accessible to those of us without a string of initials at the end of our name.Many physicists came before Greene and others have followed suit. But for me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that opened my eyes to the mind blowing world of strings and the possibilities they present. And I've been hooked on string theory since. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked at a sky full of stars and wondered what it's all about.Mark LaFlamme, author of ""The Pink Room"" "
103,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"Though the first third of this book was amusing and accessible in a childish way, the book as a whole left me with a feeling that my brain is as tiny and crumpled up as a Calabi-Yau space, whichever shape it implies! :(My opinion of this book is similar but not equal to Rob's (though I liked his review), because I didn't think the first third of the book gave me a fairly good understanding of the Einstein's relativity concepts at all. For instance, the rubber membrane - bowling ball analogy was totally misleading for me.I like Marvin's review much more and I think it's clear why. :)Anyway, after this book I felt an awful need to 'unwarp' and 'uncurl' my brain, which made me look for another one - with better explanations of physics concepts ... and I had luck! Hmm, could this be the reason to change my rating to 5 stars?! No, because my lucky find doesn't deal with the string theory.Almost forgot to add: My lucky find was The Perception of Space... and its Measurement plus Galloping with Light - The Special Theory of Relativity by Felix Alba-Juez"
104,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,4,"I read (well, listened to) this book twice and I still don't understand string theory. What gives?!Ok, in all seriousness, this is an enjoyable book to read, but you're not going to come out of it understanding much about string theory. It's just too complicated, which is one of its serious flaws. I have really liked all of Brian Greene's books, but the more I read the less inclined I am to believe in string theory. Maybe if I had read this before Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law by Peter Holt or The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next by Lee Smolin, but those two books really do a good job of refuting this one."
105,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10896364-jehona,5,"Regardless of whether the string theory will ever be useful or not, this book remains useful. String theory might be an approach that doesn't work, but it remains a unique approach to describing the universe and a mathematically beautiful approach at that. Science needs new ways to describe the world time after time. Otherwise it becomes stagnant and fails to expand our understanding of things.Greene does a good job of explaining the basics of it. Many popular science writers tend to oversimplify some things and only mention other things in vague passages. The oversimplified ideas lose half of their meaning and the rest become hard to notice even by people who already understand them. Green wants your full attention. He will not butcher scientific concepts to tell you half-truths you can understand easier. However, he does his best to make things as simple as possible for the reader. Greene is passionate and his writing shows that he cares about it. I think that makes the book even better."
106,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"About the best book on the subject and by a mile. As almost all the other reviewers claim, the initial parts on Newtonian, Relativistic and Quantum science are so beautifully and novelly explained that they should be made mandatory in any study books on the topic. The approach continues as the author jumps to explaining a far more complex super-string theory. And here, the simplistic explanations make the theory look highly speculative, fantastic and without much ground/proof. This is certainly not the case and perhaps that's because far more work is needed not just in completing the theory but grasping its real meaning. This does not remotely lessen the utility or interesting style of the book as I strongly believe that there does not exist - at least so far - any simpler explanations. For anyone interested in cosmology, an absolute must read - ideally multiple times over a few years. Hope the author comes with an update soon."

This is not as accessible as Stephen hawking, but a very well written book none the less. I would say this is for people who've already been introduced to the string theory, I tried reading it the first time without knowing anything about it and found myself staring like a deer in headlights. Once I got more familiar with the concepts (I used youtube videos) I went back to this book and enjoyed myself a lot. I won't pretend I understood everything, but I understood much much more than I did the first time picking it up. "

There was a lot of very nice analogies and explanations - but the opposite is also true. I also don't really feel like I gained all that much from reading this. Like, I still don't know very much about string theory. Overall, I do not think this is a very good book, but the easily readable parts of the book, with their analogies and what not, prevent it from getting bottom score from me. So two stars from here."

At times fascinating at others almost unintelligible (to this newb) this book was anything but 'elegant' and the Universe described even less so. To start with, is anyone not able to do the math really able to understand this this stuff, at all? The number of times Dr. Greene describes the mathematics as extremely difficult or tricky or almost inaccessible (to PhD physicists and mathematicians, some of them Nobel level minds) is enough to make any 'normal' person falter in pretending to get it. Starting with the chapters on String Theory if you are not partially lost then you have either been exposed to these ideas repeatedly or are one or two orders of magnitude smarter than me. Calabai-Yau shapes, M-theory, branes, curled-up dimensions, Heterotic string theory (not very erotic!!), symmetry, super-symmetry, super-gravity, duality, etc. the list of concepts brand new to me goes on and on. That is is not to say he does not make brave efforts to have it make some sense. I do feel that I have some vague notion how of things beyond relativity and quantum mechanics might operate but that is about it. I guess there is a NOVA series and it might be worth to check out at this moment before it is all vaporised by time. And of course this book was written in 1999/2003 and many of the concepts may already have been 'clarified', confirmed or rejected. But overall I'd still recommend this book for an introduction to a very complex subject which asks some really big questions and tries to give some answers."

It hasn't been a straightforward or easy journey, but I'm getting there. Greene's book on String Theory has definitely provided that well-balanced mix between a scientific and detailed book and an accessible and digestible narrative. There were plenty of metaphors and examples throughout that simplified what to me at least was a very complex topic, and I find this is a good foundational book for someone dipping their toes in physics.As a theory, nonetheless, I must stress that this is not an answer to the big question, but a potential ""theory of everything"". It hasn't been proven - in fact, it might have been quite battered down in recent years. Therefore, take everything with a grain of salt and a critical mind that a science book should ultimately stimulate.I will admit, though, that despite the accessible and interesting character of The Elegant Universe, I find myself forgetting quite a lot of what it contained... I suck. I do recommend it because, again, I felt like it provided a lot of the foundation to understand physics in our time, but I am not sure I personally attained a greater understanding.

Erik Davies is a superb, well-prepared narrator, but for the most part, you must have the book, and its many helpful illustrations, in your hand as you go through this material. Unless you're a physicist, you shouldn't be listening to this one on the way to work.)

I understand, in many aspects, the basics of physics pre-string theory. But this new stuff? I understand some of the definitions, but that’s about it. Greene’s book is very good at giving descriptions and examples and analogies for aspects of physics it is trying to explain. And for the older concepts, it does a great job. The newer concepts, string theory and beyond, are explained in the same way, with the same care. I found these concepts more difficult to understand, but I suspect that’s my problem, not the fault of the author. I found the book well organized, and the examples often memorable. However, I didn’t get the level of understanding I was hoping for concerning recent advances in physics. I would consider reading more by this author, but may be looking for a lower grade level."

121,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3590983-andrewp,3,"This book covers most of the basics of Physics theory. Relativity, quantum physics and then string theory. As the authors specialty is string theory about 50% of the book is dedicated to this subject. I admit that there were some concepts that I had a hard time understanding as there is no easy way to make the subject relateable to everyday experiences. Almost all of string theory is math driven and all the discoveries are just the relationships and solutions to incredibly complex math formulas. Even then, many of the ideas come down to interpreting results that are just approximations of the final solutions. Even our most powerful computers are unable to solve these equations completely. For me that's where string theory loses some of it's credibility. With such complex math it's manipulating the numbers until you get the answer you want.As this book was written in 1999 it's inevitably a bit out of date. This was before the existence of the LHC at CERN and some of the experiments in the last decade may have shed more light and indirectly confirmed some string theory concepts. In particular the existence of the superheavy Higgs boson would be evidence of symmetry predicted by string theory.A decent book but only for people really interested in the subject.

123,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,4,"This was a fascinating book about the prospects of string theory and how it may be the ultimate theory that gives us a complete picture of reality. Mathematically speaking, the theory (or rather the hypothesis) seems to be flawless. However, it's never been experimentally proved. The reason is obvious. The strings are so tiny and hard to find if they exist. Even our most powerful atom smashers and super colliders can't produce them. Brian Green says, we need a collider the size of the entire Milky Way Galaxy to create such strings. a more advanced version of the theory is called M-theory and it's an amalgamation of a number of different theories, five to be exact, that are brought together like the arms of a starfish. the problem with the current standard model of particle physics is that it does not unite gravity with other forces. For instance, at the moment of the big bang or at the core of a black hole, Einstein's theory of general relativity (the theory of the large) and quantum mechanics (the theory of the small) can not come together. Each of these theories is perfectly capable of explaining the world in its own domain, however. String theory is thought to be our current hope to reconcile gravity and QM. Strange as it may seem, the mathematics of string theory tells us that there are eleven dimensions (ten dimensions of space and one of time) instead of four. The reason you and I can't see these dimensions is because they're so tiny.According to string theory, if we could examine particles with great precision—a precision many orders of magnitude beyond our present technological capacity—we would find that each is not pointlike, but instead consists of a tiny one-dimensional loop."

125,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110610415-richard-seltzer,5,"A few months ago, when I was reviewing What Remains to be Discovered by John Maddox, I was convinced that the world is ""unknowable.""Now, thanks to The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene, I've done a flip-flop.As Maddox says in his concluding chapter, ""Unwilling or unable to accept the seemingly paradoxical behavior of single particles, such as electrons moving through both of two slits at the same time, for example, he [Albert Einstein] sought instead a set of equations whose elegance and symmetry would command respect, and by which even paradoxical phenomena would be explicable. Einstein's quest was no doubt impelled by his great success with the general theory of relativity (otherwise the theory of gravitation), which first won attention through its elegance. As the world now knows, it was a fruitless search. Quantum phenomena are often wrongly described as paradoxes for no better reason than that they conflict with the expectations of common sense, which themselves spring from human senses that have been honed by natural selection for telling what the macroscopic world is like. It is disconcerting that phenomena on the small scale are at odds with expectation, but there is a wealth of experimental data for which no other explanation is possible. How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" (p. 373)In my review, I noted, ""...a non-scientist, like myself, might well dream the impossible dream of a science that goes beyond science, a means of learning about 'reality' and describing it without depending on experiments.""Remarkably, Greene answers that key question ""How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" While experiment has its limitations, based on what can be measured and how, indirect techniques can give us glimpses of what lies beyond, leading to new hypotheses which can also be verified, with a high degree of confidence, by indirect techniques. The vastness of the cosmos provides clues to the physical structure of matter smaller than quarks (the components of electrons, protons, and other subatomic particles) and provides ways of verifying hypotheses that are beyond the limits of our most advanced laboratories.In Green's book, the universe is ""elegant"" and knowable, in ways man believed before the discoveries of quantum physics. When confronted with new previously unexplained phenomena, he turns to such principles as symmetry, beauty and logic to gain new insight. At the end of the dark tunnel of unknowability, he sees a ""multi-verse"" consisting of many universes; he sees black holes not just as the ugly ends of dying stars, but rather as seeds for other universes; he see a multi-verse in which those universes that have the most black holes are the most likely to survive and spawn new universes in a cosmic evolution scheme, based on survival of the fittest of universes.Just when I was getting used to the idea that the world is unfundamentally unknowable -- that our brains evolved to help us cope with the world of ordinary experience and simply aren't equipped to grasp the bizarre realms of the very small and the very large -- along comes a book that inspires me with renewed faith that we can know -- based on a classical belief in beauty and symmetry -- like a revelation from the 17th or 18th century.This book is convincing, lucid, powerful, mind-expanding.I had been aesthetically wallowing in the concept of unknowability -- convinced that the greatest advances in the 20th century came from acknowledging the limitations of the human mind, proving what cannot be known. That attitude led me to a high appreciation of the works of Stanislaw Lem (see my review at www.seltzerbooks.com/lem.html) and to a whole range of authors, starting with Plato, who emphasized that the value of the pursuit of wisdom was all in the process, that nothing can be known with any certainty. It is good to seek truth; but to believe that you have found truth is bad. The value comes from the seeking itself.In the days of Emerson and Swedenborg, the world and our senses and our ability to understand seemed perfectly suited to one another. Then modern science led us to see a disjunction between the world perceived in ordinary experience and the realm of the extremely small and the realm of the extremely large, both of which were revealed by advanced instruments; and led us to conclude that the limits of our instruments were the limits of our ability to understand. Now it appears that we can leap beyond those limits, arriving at new levels of understanding about the workings of the physical world, both at the sub-particle level and at the cosmic level.I won't attempt to explain Greene's explanations. I don't presume to have grasped it in great enough detail to do it justice. Read the book itself. He writes with the authority of one of the leaders in the field of string theory, but with a clarity and patience and ability to explain complex matters simply that rivals the efforts of the very best popularizers of science.Basically, quarks consist of ""strings"", and the ""vibrations"" of these strings determine their energy, mass, and other characteristics. These vibrations have ""frequency"" or rhythm, which leads me to think of this change of perspective in terms of Yeats: the focus is now on the dance rather than the dancer. The dancers come and go and combine and recombine; come into existance and annihiate and come into existence again in new forms. Yes, there are physical limits to what we can know about the dancer; but our knowledge of the dance can extend far beyond and lead us to important new conclusions.Strangely, such a change in the underlying concepts of physics leads to a new appreciation for old authors. I can't help but think of Frazier, Jung, and Joyce, and their attempts to grasp the flow and rhythm of all of human culture. I think of the multiple natural and mental rhythms of Virginia Woolf's Waves. I think of resonance and harmonics and extraordinary effects that can come from small changes, like a bridge breaking up because of the rhythm of the wind that strikes it; and I think of transistors and how they capitalize on how, in electronics, small changes can result in large effects. I also think of the theme of music and rhythm as an important element in how the mind works and how the world works in Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach. I think of Steven Pinker's books where he gains insight into the workings of the human mind by analyzing how we use language and the rules of grammar, and I wonder if there might be a ""grammar"" or ""rules of choreography"" for the cosmic dance. I may even develop a new appreciation for the art of dance. Greene himself alludes to the ancient notion of the ""music of the spheres.""And wonder of wonders, I feel myself motivated to tackle Heidegger's Being and Time. Contrary to the ruminations of Hamlet, being and not being may not be opposites, or may not be the only alternatives. To become or not to become? To become what from what? There may be a range or field of becoming, a pattern of becoming and interacting in the rhythm of individual human life and of life in aggregate.But don't be sidetracked by my vague speculations. Read the book. It could change your image of yourself and the world you live in."
126,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"Physicists today think they may have discovered what Einstein spent the last decades of his life searching for: the Theory of Everything. String Theory (technically, Superstring Theory) is the idea that everything we see in the world is really the result of one-dimensional strings vibrating in particular patterns. And if the idea of one-dimensional strings is hard for you to wrap your head around, then buckle up before you read this book, because that's the easy part. This book is dense. It's very, very technical. Yes, he promises no math, so we don't actually look at the formulas. But you can't talk about this theory without talking about math. We can't observe things this small with our technology today, so this is basically all math equations that add up nicely. So the book talks about math a lot--including a chapter that centered the differences between physics-based math and academic-Phd math. Unlike Einstein's theories, which were prompted by cool thought experiments, string theory is driven by equations. It's not intuitive at all. But if you can march through that technical data and make your brain stretch into odd shapes, then there are some interesting implications. He's not a Christian, but as a Christian I find some fascinating tidbits. Example: this new theory says all of reality is a result of vibrating strings, that the particular vibration patterns manifest as the bits of matter and energy that we observe. And the Bible says that the universe was formless and void until God spoke."
127,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"At long last I finished reading this! Detailed science books aren't the best bus books. :oSo this book about M-theory etc. was a great read. I very much enjoyed myself reading it and weirdly enough I kept laughing because Greene has a really amusing way of throwing in ridiculous humor while dreaming up weird analogies. I'm sure I wouldn't understand any of the mathematics behind what's described here, and to be honest even the layperson's explanation of the science was a stretch for me sometimes, but I was invested enough sometimes to wonder about what else has progressed on the questions raised in this book since it was written and have looked things up to find out what's newer in the field. Especially when Greene made references to the particle accelerator and what it might find when it was completed. I read some cool stuff about the Higgs Boson and all that. YEAH!Anyway, some notes I took while reading are my best way to share my thoughts.1. I giggled when the author described a scientist's reaction to the discovery of muons: ""Who ordered THAT?""2. His way of explaining the way physical objects change as they go faster was well thought out. Showing how it's happening every day but we can't detect it due to small measurements. Increasing them would make the difference apparent, and if we lived in a world where those measurements were standard, it'd be intuitive and invisible to us again.3. There was a great explanation of how a race car reaches the finish line slower if it travels diagonally, since some of the time is taken away to achieve horizontal travel.4. I find it really interesting that it apparently takes infinite power to push something faster than light because it becomes heavier and heavier as it approaches light speed, and that's why we can't go faster than light.5. I was envisioning warped space like a rubber tarp before the author explained the 3D problem. I am secretly a physicist after all!6. In a discussion of why energy is in lumps (discussing Planck's Constant): ""It's as if nature allows a whole pint of beer or no beer at all."" Haha.7. It's so interesting that observing matter affects it (photos hitting it has an effect), and if we lessened the photons we'd also be less likely to be able to determine its location because of the wave's length. And the electrons become ""frantic"" when they're cornered so they can't have their speed or location determined at the same time.8. The quantum tunneling descriptions were effective! It was cool to learn that electrons can go through stuff because of the space around the particles, but that it is unlikely that it will happen because being lucky enough for that to happen takes a really long time.9. The fifth level of magnification showing quantum froth was really effective. The borrowing and paying back analogy makes sense to explain why over long distances space seems flat, like a dot matrix printer makes images that look smooth.10. The ""Price is Right"" analogy for the large amount of money (energy) leaving a small amount down to the penny was a good way to explain why the specifics are too difficult for existing math to figure out.11. It's true that ""elegance"" and aesthetic doesn't prove a theory. We want theories to be beautiful, but if they're proved wrong we have to reject them, even if it's tempting to assume the elegance means it's accurate. But aesthetic does figure into choices in the research direction for theories.12. Sypersymmetry demands an as yet undetected super-partner particle. They're calling the one for electron ""selectron."" Also, ""squark"" and ""sneutrino."" I laughed.13. I like that they're allowing for the fact that the universe might not have the property of supersymmetry just because it would be mathematically matchy.14. The metaphor of 5 different theories of what happened to Earhart was a great way to explain why 5 slightly different superstring theories makes the idea itself less trustworthy.15. ""Comings and Goings of a Garden Hose."" I laughed. Maybe Kaluza K. Line came up with this epiphany just to combat the drudgery of staring at his neighbor's dot-eye. According to Linestein, there's a way to expand that dimension! 16. These ways of explaining the 10 dimensions (6 of them curled up in larger ones) WAS SO COOL.17. I really love the story of how Greene learned that another paper had duplicated the same findings as his and mirror symmetry in string theory is A THING. With holes that match up in Calabi-Yau shapes. !!!!!!18. I like how Greene explains counting a huge bin of oranges and then having a solution presented with a friend showing up with a box and how many boxes there were when the oranges were delivered. This is an analogy for why doing calculations on a mirror-imaged Calabi-Yau shape is sometimes easier than doing the math on its first one.19. The rivalry between the mathematicians and the physicists--I giggled a lot. I love that they compared their results, got different answers, and later found an error in the math camp's computer code that when fixed yielded the physics answer. After mining math for tools all this time, physics can give back, as it also solved other insurmountable math issues!20. I love the human element to the scientists' research into flop transitions and how Greene and Morrison had to teach each other their disciplines to make progress. They wanted to beat Witten to a discovery.21. I liked the story of working with Aspinwall to determine the shape of the Calabi-Yau shape they're looking for and having to buy him beer to make him come in on Saturday.22. Nobody knows the string coupling constant. Oy.23. Black holes have no ""hair."" They are all the same as each other. Small black holes will act just like large black holes in experiments.24. The revisions Greene and Morrison made after posting their article the first time resulted from having devil's advocate conversations. Haha.25. Hawking and Thorne had a bet with Preskill about whether information can reemerge after a black hole evaporates. Loser buys the winner an encyclopedia!I love learning about all these innovations and I love what dorks scientists are. I admire their imagination and passion, and even though most of the rest of the world will have no idea when they make their breakthroughs, I love all these ideas and I want to know where they've gone since."
128,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12872086-sheeraz,4,"It's a little difficult to review this book because I can't say I understood and retained everything that was presented. With that caveat, I think the author did a great job in explaining some very gnarly and unintuitive concepts to a non-physicist. The use of analogies was spot on and kept the narrative interesting even when my brain grasped at the edges of the ideas presented.The book, as the name suggests, is primarily about the development, current state and future outlook of string theory -- a good contender for a theory that unifies the description of different forces, and hopefully has physical properties of the universe as emergent quantities. The ideas are fascinating, like challenging our notion of distance building on Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The book got me excited about the future of string physics and its bearing on cosmology, and hoping that we will see some potential evidence in the favor of the theory in our lifetimes."
129,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8379733-bookhode,2,"Well, this was disappointing. Brian Greene's book with a pointlessly superlong title, had started off just fine, providing a nice recap of major developments in physics during the last century or so, with the special focus on Einstein's revolutionary theories, and on quantum mechanics that followed. This part was relatively easy to grasp, and despite the author's rather clumsy attempts at metaphor on almost every page, it was also relatively easy to read. The next part, where we reached the conflict between physics of the very small (with its rules based on probability), and physics of the very large (with exact rules), was also ok, as the book kept its flow, and I was able to follow the plot, and at least understand what the problem was all about.But then, we got to the central topic of this book, which is supposed to be the superstring theory, and things just quickly deteriorated in almost every way. The metaphors Greene kept on using became really weird, and were more hurting than helping the reader to cope with the increasingly difficult explanations. Chapters where he talked about his own achievements and discoveries in this field, were presented with overabundance of details, which was rather sharp contrast to the tone used in the rest of this book. And complete lack of any critical thought by the author towards the superstrings theory, made me feel like I was reading some kind of political pamphlet, and not an open-minded work of popular science.To a layman like me, the superstrings theory is bullshit. It's a fantasy about something we cannot see, feel or test in any practical manner. And the fact that the whole thing requires making up some weird multidimensional shapes, and then adjusting our regular mathematics by inventing more and more dimensions just to make the numbers fit, should completely kill its credibility. Of course, I am way out of my league here, and the theory could be quite correct, but the author never really managed to find the language or approach to persuade me to accept his opinion. All he did was to highhandedly wave off any criticism, and basically put the reader in a fait accompli position, where he should either agree with this inevitable new wisdom, or feel stupid. And I would rather feel stupid, than accept bullshit without any chance of verification.Current score: 49/100Current ranking: 37th among my non-fiction books."
130,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12365204-y-l,3,"I have to admit this has been a book I have had a love-hate relationship with for a good few months. I may have had it a lot easier than others as the friend who graciously loaned me this book had preempted me with a few documentary videos of Stephen Hawking and BBC as an introduction to the subject. Nevertheless, the universe is (as always) a long and lengthy subject to grasp and claiming that reading this book was a breeze would do the universe no justice.Thanks to three hours or so of videos, reading the first few chapters of this book was like reading revision notes on a day's worth of lecture. I wouldn't say I made every effort to understand each mathematic equation or even appreciate the technicality of physics and quantum mechanics that make the most part of this book, but I can now truly appreciate how mind-blowing it is to perceive the universe to be so much more than a big black blanket of space. Greene offered a glimpse of how quantum physicists and mathematicians look at our universe and writes eloquently on the slow and painstaking process of discovering the universe and the mechanics of it through decades of theories, collaboration and backsteps. I especially love how he details the life of himself and his colleagues as they accept each others strength and weaknesses on the subject and push each other to their limits to solve the mysteries that the universe has set at their doorstep. That itself would have probably made it a much more enjoyable book for me. As much as I am grateful for being given the opportunity to appreciate this subject via layman standards, I still feel that the book needs to be expressed a little better. Introductions on some parts of the subject could have been spared as the selling point of this book seems to be the concept of possibilities rather than dry science.I ended this book feeling a little overwhelmed - not sure if it is because of all the unnecessary fluff leading up to String Theory, the anticipation of whether String Theory will live up to its potential of a unified theory, or the fact that Greene had unsuspectingly dumped all his hopes and ideologies into the last few pages of the book to sell his idea of String Theory to the masses. I am all set to read Paul Davies' take on this...just as soon as I recover."
131,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9729716-jason,3," I was given this book as a gift. I typically don't go for the sort of fluffy stuff you'd find in the ""Science"" section at Barnes & Noble, which I figured this would be. I'm much more into mathematics than physics and have devoted most of my academic career to math shit rather than physics shit. So I was already prepared to lose my footing at some point in this book. I have a pretty good grasp on Special Relativity though so I tried to use that as a gauge for how well this dude was describing the more recent stuff beyond the point where my eyes just glazed over. I was happy that this fella got into stuff that lost me. It worries me when I finish a book about a complex or abstract thing and it's not a struggle to understand the material. I wonder whether the writer is just that good or that bad. What I found about this dude is that his wanting to illustrate everything with a metaphor or an analogy wound up confusing the stuff more. I mean, some were cool and I think I gleaned something of the rough shape of an idea. There were other spots where he used 3-4 different metaphors to get across an idea that was already pretty damn abstract. I think at those spots I'd have preferred more elaboration in the form of the notes in the back for ""the expert reader"" or for ""the mathematically inclined"". I basically read this as a starting point. I kept a book for notes as I read and now I have a bunch of pages of leads for further investigation. On a superficial level, I liked this guy's writing style. And the book was somewhat enjoyable while discussing bananas shit. I think there was a chapter or 2 where my reading was as productive as staring at the floor. All in all I don't know who I'd recommend this to. I'm part of a math club and no one there would take it off my hands when I was done because they don't like ""rock star physicists"" who write fluffy science books. But at the same time I can't give it to my mom because it does get into stuff within the first page that would lose her.  I'm not sure if all this explains why I gave it 3 stars, but I felt the need to be lengthy."
132,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458834-mark-laflamme,0,"For me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that started it all. Greene has such a smooth way of easing the novice into the complexities of string theory, the reader feels almost acquainted by the time the science is introduced. Never boring or tedious, Greene deftly guides us through the basics of relativity, explains the importance of frames of reference, and eases us into the almost magical world of gravity and timespace.Like Einstein, Greene presents the science through simple visuals - balls and bicycles, funny cars and cartoon spaceships. The reader will never feel as though he sits in a classroom with a boring professor droning away the afternoon. Instead, Greene describes the physics in a real world way and in doing so, prepares even the most casual student for the truly strange world of strings.String theory appears to be the road to a unified theory, the long sought Theory of Everything that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics. Along the way is a wonderous world of possibilities, with extra dimensions, parallel worlds, and all the while, tiny strings vibrating the symphony of the universe.I read this book with a zeal normally reserved for action novels. Each night was a new lesson and a new glimpse at a different part of the universe. Greene's gift is a clear and friendly writing style that makes this heavy science accessible to those of us without a string of initials at the end of our name.Many physicists came before Greene and others have followed suit. But for me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that opened my eyes to the mind blowing world of strings and the possibilities they present. And I've been hooked on string theory since. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked at a sky full of stars and wondered what it's all about.Mark LaFlamme, author of ""The Pink Room"" "
133,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"Though the first third of this book was amusing and accessible in a childish way, the book as a whole left me with a feeling that my brain is as tiny and crumpled up as a Calabi-Yau space, whichever shape it implies! :(My opinion of this book is similar but not equal to Rob's (though I liked his review), because I didn't think the first third of the book gave me a fairly good understanding of the Einstein's relativity concepts at all. For instance, the rubber membrane - bowling ball analogy was totally misleading for me.I like Marvin's review much more and I think it's clear why. :)Anyway, after this book I felt an awful need to 'unwarp' and 'uncurl' my brain, which made me look for another one - with better explanations of physics concepts ... and I had luck! Hmm, could this be the reason to change my rating to 5 stars?! No, because my lucky find doesn't deal with the string theory.Almost forgot to add: My lucky find was The Perception of Space... and its Measurement plus Galloping with Light - The Special Theory of Relativity by Felix Alba-Juez"
134,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,4,"I read (well, listened to) this book twice and I still don't understand string theory. What gives?!Ok, in all seriousness, this is an enjoyable book to read, but you're not going to come out of it understanding much about string theory. It's just too complicated, which is one of its serious flaws. I have really liked all of Brian Greene's books, but the more I read the less inclined I am to believe in string theory. Maybe if I had read this before Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law by Peter Holt or The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next by Lee Smolin, but those two books really do a good job of refuting this one."
135,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10896364-jehona,5,"Regardless of whether the string theory will ever be useful or not, this book remains useful. String theory might be an approach that doesn't work, but it remains a unique approach to describing the universe and a mathematically beautiful approach at that. Science needs new ways to describe the world time after time. Otherwise it becomes stagnant and fails to expand our understanding of things.Greene does a good job of explaining the basics of it. Many popular science writers tend to oversimplify some things and only mention other things in vague passages. The oversimplified ideas lose half of their meaning and the rest become hard to notice even by people who already understand them. Green wants your full attention. He will not butcher scientific concepts to tell you half-truths you can understand easier. However, he does his best to make things as simple as possible for the reader. Greene is passionate and his writing shows that he cares about it. I think that makes the book even better."
136,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"About the best book on the subject and by a mile. As almost all the other reviewers claim, the initial parts on Newtonian, Relativistic and Quantum science are so beautifully and novelly explained that they should be made mandatory in any study books on the topic. The approach continues as the author jumps to explaining a far more complex super-string theory. And here, the simplistic explanations make the theory look highly speculative, fantastic and without much ground/proof. This is certainly not the case and perhaps that's because far more work is needed not just in completing the theory but grasping its real meaning. This does not remotely lessen the utility or interesting style of the book as I strongly believe that there does not exist - at least so far - any simpler explanations. For anyone interested in cosmology, an absolute must read - ideally multiple times over a few years. Hope the author comes with an update soon."

This is not as accessible as Stephen hawking, but a very well written book none the less. I would say this is for people who've already been introduced to the string theory, I tried reading it the first time without knowing anything about it and found myself staring like a deer in headlights. Once I got more familiar with the concepts (I used youtube videos) I went back to this book and enjoyed myself a lot. I won't pretend I understood everything, but I understood much much more than I did the first time picking it up. "

I'm not a particularly smart person, but I'd heard that this book was very readable even for people without knowledge on the subject. And parts of the book definitely was. There was a lot of very nice analogies and explanations - but the opposite is also true. I also don't really feel like I gained all that much from reading this. Like, I still don't know very much about string theory. Overall, I do not think this is a very good book, but the easily readable parts of the book, with their analogies and what not, prevent it from getting bottom score from me. So two stars from here."

At times fascinating at others almost unintelligible (to this newb) this book was anything but 'elegant' and the Universe described even less so. To start with, is anyone not able to do the math really able to understand this this stuff, at all? The number of times Dr. Greene describes the mathematics as extremely difficult or tricky or almost inaccessible (to PhD physicists and mathematicians, some of them Nobel level minds) is enough to make any 'normal' person falter in pretending to get it. Starting with the chapters on String Theory if you are not partially lost then you have either been exposed to these ideas repeatedly or are one or two orders of magnitude smarter than me. Calabai-Yau shapes, M-theory, branes, curled-up dimensions, Heterotic string theory (not very erotic!!), symmetry, super-symmetry, super-gravity, duality, etc. the list of concepts brand new to me goes on and on. That is is not to say he does not make brave efforts to have it make some sense. I do feel that I have some vague notion how of things beyond relativity and quantum mechanics might operate but that is about it. I guess there is a NOVA series and it might be worth to check out at this moment before it is all vaporised by time. And of course this book was written in 1999/2003 and many of the concepts may already have been 'clarified', confirmed or rejected. But overall I'd still recommend this book for an introduction to a very complex subject which asks some really big questions and tries to give some answers."

It hasn't been a straightforward or easy journey, but I'm getting there. Greene's book on String Theory has definitely provided that well-balanced mix between a scientific and detailed book and an accessible and digestible narrative. There were plenty of metaphors and examples throughout that simplified what to me at least was a very complex topic, and I find this is a good foundational book for someone dipping their toes in physics.As a theory, nonetheless, I must stress that this is not an answer to the big question, but a potential ""theory of everything"". It hasn't been proven - in fact, it might have been quite battered down in recent years. Therefore, take everything with a grain of salt and a critical mind that a science book should ultimately stimulate.I will admit, though, that despite the accessible and interesting character of The Elegant Universe, I find myself forgetting quite a lot of what it contained... I suck. I do recommend it because, again, I felt like it provided a lot of the foundation to understand physics in our time, but I am not sure I personally attained a greater understanding.

I understand, in many aspects, the basics of physics pre-string theory. But this new stuff? I understand some of the definitions, but that’s about it. Greene’s book is very good at giving descriptions and examples and analogies for aspects of physics it is trying to explain. And for the older concepts, it does a great job. The newer concepts, string theory and beyond, are explained in the same way, with the same care. I found these concepts more difficult to understand, but I suspect that’s my problem, not the fault of the author. I found the book well organized, and the examples often memorable. However, I didn’t get the level of understanding I was hoping for concerning recent advances in physics. I would consider reading more by this author, but may be looking for a lower grade level."

Almost all of string theory is math driven and all the discoveries are just the relationships and solutions to incredibly complex math formulas. Even then, many of the ideas come down to interpreting results that are just approximations of the final solutions. Even our most powerful computers are unable to solve these equations completely. For me that's where string theory loses some of it's credibility. With such complex math it's manipulating the numbers until you get the answer you want.As this book was written in 1999 it's inevitably a bit out of date. This was before the existence of the LHC at CERN and some of the experiments in the last decade may have shed more light and indirectly confirmed some string theory concepts. In particular the existence of the superheavy Higgs boson would be evidence of symmetry predicted by string theory.A decent book but only for people really interested in the subject. It's hard going at times so be prepared to read some sections more than once."

It explains a lot and I mean a LOT of things about many theories I've heard of plenty of times and I hadn't had the clue on what they are or how they came to be, chief among them is string theory.I've always been fascinated by physicists and I liked the author's passion for what he does. I found myself drawn into what he's saying even if it was a little challenging to follow sometimes."
153,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,4,"This was a fascinating book about the prospects of string theory and how it may be the ultimate theory that gives us a complete picture of reality. Mathematically speaking, the theory (or rather the hypothesis) seems to be flawless. However, it's never been experimentally proved. The reason is obvious. The strings are so tiny and hard to find if they exist. Even our most powerful atom smashers and super colliders can't produce them. Brian Green says, we need a collider the size of the entire Milky Way Galaxy to create such strings. a more advanced version of the theory is called M-theory and it's an amalgamation of a number of different theories, five to be exact, that are brought together like the arms of a starfish. the problem with the current standard model of particle physics is that it does not unite gravity with other forces. For instance, at the moment of the big bang or at the core of a black hole, Einstein's theory of general relativity (the theory of the large) and quantum mechanics (the theory of the small) can not come together. Each of these theories is perfectly capable of explaining the world in its own domain, however. String theory is thought to be our current hope to reconcile gravity and QM. Strange as it may seem, the mathematics of string theory tells us that there are eleven dimensions (ten dimensions of space and one of time) instead of four. The reason you and I can't see these dimensions is because they're so tiny.According to string theory, if we could examine particles with great precision—a precision many orders of magnitude beyond our present technological capacity—we would find that each is not pointlike, but instead consists of a tiny one-dimensional loop."

155,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110610415-richard-seltzer,5,"A few months ago, when I was reviewing What Remains to be Discovered by John Maddox, I was convinced that the world is ""unknowable.""Now, thanks to The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene, I've done a flip-flop.As Maddox says in his concluding chapter, ""Unwilling or unable to accept the seemingly paradoxical behavior of single particles, such as electrons moving through both of two slits at the same time, for example, he [Albert Einstein] sought instead a set of equations whose elegance and symmetry would command respect, and by which even paradoxical phenomena would be explicable. Einstein's quest was no doubt impelled by his great success with the general theory of relativity (otherwise the theory of gravitation), which first won attention through its elegance. As the world now knows, it was a fruitless search. Quantum phenomena are often wrongly described as paradoxes for no better reason than that they conflict with the expectations of common sense, which themselves spring from human senses that have been honed by natural selection for telling what the macroscopic world is like. It is disconcerting that phenomena on the small scale are at odds with expectation, but there is a wealth of experimental data for which no other explanation is possible. How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" (p. 373)In my review, I noted, ""...a non-scientist, like myself, might well dream the impossible dream of a science that goes beyond science, a means of learning about 'reality' and describing it without depending on experiments.""Remarkably, Greene answers that key question ""How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" While experiment has its limitations, based on what can be measured and how, indirect techniques can give us glimpses of what lies beyond, leading to new hypotheses which can also be verified, with a high degree of confidence, by indirect techniques. The vastness of the cosmos provides clues to the physical structure of matter smaller than quarks (the components of electrons, protons, and other subatomic particles) and provides ways of verifying hypotheses that are beyond the limits of our most advanced laboratories.In Green's book, the universe is ""elegant"" and knowable, in ways man believed before the discoveries of quantum physics. When confronted with new previously unexplained phenomena, he turns to such principles as symmetry, beauty and logic to gain new insight. At the end of the dark tunnel of unknowability, he sees a ""multi-verse"" consisting of many universes; he sees black holes not just as the ugly ends of dying stars, but rather as seeds for other universes; he see a multi-verse in which those universes that have the most black holes are the most likely to survive and spawn new universes in a cosmic evolution scheme, based on survival of the fittest of universes.Just when I was getting used to the idea that the world is unfundamentally unknowable -- that our brains evolved to help us cope with the world of ordinary experience and simply aren't equipped to grasp the bizarre realms of the very small and the very large -- along comes a book that inspires me with renewed faith that we can know -- based on a classical belief in beauty and symmetry -- like a revelation from the 17th or 18th century.This book is convincing, lucid, powerful, mind-expanding.I had been aesthetically wallowing in the concept of unknowability -- convinced that the greatest advances in the 20th century came from acknowledging the limitations of the human mind, proving what cannot be known. That attitude led me to a high appreciation of the works of Stanislaw Lem (see my review at www.seltzerbooks.com/lem.html) and to a whole range of authors, starting with Plato, who emphasized that the value of the pursuit of wisdom was all in the process, that nothing can be known with any certainty. It is good to seek truth; but to believe that you have found truth is bad. The value comes from the seeking itself.In the days of Emerson and Swedenborg, the world and our senses and our ability to understand seemed perfectly suited to one another. Then modern science led us to see a disjunction between the world perceived in ordinary experience and the realm of the extremely small and the realm of the extremely large, both of which were revealed by advanced instruments; and led us to conclude that the limits of our instruments were the limits of our ability to understand. Now it appears that we can leap beyond those limits, arriving at new levels of understanding about the workings of the physical world, both at the sub-particle level and at the cosmic level.I won't attempt to explain Greene's explanations. I don't presume to have grasped it in great enough detail to do it justice. Read the book itself. He writes with the authority of one of the leaders in the field of string theory, but with a clarity and patience and ability to explain complex matters simply that rivals the efforts of the very best popularizers of science.Basically, quarks consist of ""strings"", and the ""vibrations"" of these strings determine their energy, mass, and other characteristics. These vibrations have ""frequency"" or rhythm, which leads me to think of this change of perspective in terms of Yeats: the focus is now on the dance rather than the dancer. The dancers come and go and combine and recombine; come into existance and annihiate and come into existence again in new forms. Yes, there are physical limits to what we can know about the dancer; but our knowledge of the dance can extend far beyond and lead us to important new conclusions.Strangely, such a change in the underlying concepts of physics leads to a new appreciation for old authors. I can't help but think of Frazier, Jung, and Joyce, and their attempts to grasp the flow and rhythm of all of human culture. I think of the multiple natural and mental rhythms of Virginia Woolf's Waves. I think of resonance and harmonics and extraordinary effects that can come from small changes, like a bridge breaking up because of the rhythm of the wind that strikes it; and I think of transistors and how they capitalize on how, in electronics, small changes can result in large effects. I also think of the theme of music and rhythm as an important element in how the mind works and how the world works in Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach. I think of Steven Pinker's books where he gains insight into the workings of the human mind by analyzing how we use language and the rules of grammar, and I wonder if there might be a ""grammar"" or ""rules of choreography"" for the cosmic dance. I may even develop a new appreciation for the art of dance. Greene himself alludes to the ancient notion of the ""music of the spheres.""And wonder of wonders, I feel myself motivated to tackle Heidegger's Being and Time. Contrary to the ruminations of Hamlet, being and not being may not be opposites, or may not be the only alternatives. To become or not to become? To become what from what? There may be a range or field of becoming, a pattern of becoming and interacting in the rhythm of individual human life and of life in aggregate.But don't be sidetracked by my vague speculations. Read the book. It could change your image of yourself and the world you live in."
156,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"Physicists today think they may have discovered what Einstein spent the last decades of his life searching for: the Theory of Everything. String Theory (technically, Superstring Theory) is the idea that everything we see in the world is really the result of one-dimensional strings vibrating in particular patterns. And if the idea of one-dimensional strings is hard for you to wrap your head around, then buckle up before you read this book, because that's the easy part. This book is dense. It's very, very technical. Yes, he promises no math, so we don't actually look at the formulas. But you can't talk about this theory without talking about math. We can't observe things this small with our technology today, so this is basically all math equations that add up nicely. So the book talks about math a lot--including a chapter that centered the differences between physics-based math and academic-Phd math. Unlike Einstein's theories, which were prompted by cool thought experiments, string theory is driven by equations. It's not intuitive at all. But if you can march through that technical data and make your brain stretch into odd shapes, then there are some interesting implications. He's not a Christian, but as a Christian I find some fascinating tidbits. Example: this new theory says all of reality is a result of vibrating strings, that the particular vibration patterns manifest as the bits of matter and energy that we observe. And the Bible says that the universe was formless and void until God spoke."
157,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"At long last I finished reading this! Detailed science books aren't the best bus books. :oSo this book about M-theory etc. was a great read. I very much enjoyed myself reading it and weirdly enough I kept laughing because Greene has a really amusing way of throwing in ridiculous humor while dreaming up weird analogies. I'm sure I wouldn't understand any of the mathematics behind what's described here, and to be honest even the layperson's explanation of the science was a stretch for me sometimes, but I was invested enough sometimes to wonder about what else has progressed on the questions raised in this book since it was written and have looked things up to find out what's newer in the field. Especially when Greene made references to the particle accelerator and what it might find when it was completed. I read some cool stuff about the Higgs Boson and all that. YEAH!Anyway, some notes I took while reading are my best way to share my thoughts.1. I giggled when the author described a scientist's reaction to the discovery of muons: ""Who ordered THAT?""2. His way of explaining the way physical objects change as they go faster was well thought out. Showing how it's happening every day but we can't detect it due to small measurements. Increasing them would make the difference apparent, and if we lived in a world where those measurements were standard, it'd be intuitive and invisible to us again.3. There was a great explanation of how a race car reaches the finish line slower if it travels diagonally, since some of the time is taken away to achieve horizontal travel.4. I find it really interesting that it apparently takes infinite power to push something faster than light because it becomes heavier and heavier as it approaches light speed, and that's why we can't go faster than light.5. I was envisioning warped space like a rubber tarp before the author explained the 3D problem. I am secretly a physicist after all!6. In a discussion of why energy is in lumps (discussing Planck's Constant): ""It's as if nature allows a whole pint of beer or no beer at all."" Haha.7. It's so interesting that observing matter affects it (photos hitting it has an effect), and if we lessened the photons we'd also be less likely to be able to determine its location because of the wave's length. And the electrons become ""frantic"" when they're cornered so they can't have their speed or location determined at the same time.8. The quantum tunneling descriptions were effective! It was cool to learn that electrons can go through stuff because of the space around the particles, but that it is unlikely that it will happen because being lucky enough for that to happen takes a really long time.9. The fifth level of magnification showing quantum froth was really effective. The borrowing and paying back analogy makes sense to explain why over long distances space seems flat, like a dot matrix printer makes images that look smooth.10. The ""Price is Right"" analogy for the large amount of money (energy) leaving a small amount down to the penny was a good way to explain why the specifics are too difficult for existing math to figure out.11. It's true that ""elegance"" and aesthetic doesn't prove a theory. We want theories to be beautiful, but if they're proved wrong we have to reject them, even if it's tempting to assume the elegance means it's accurate. But aesthetic does figure into choices in the research direction for theories.12. Sypersymmetry demands an as yet undetected super-partner particle. They're calling the one for electron ""selectron."" Also, ""squark"" and ""sneutrino."" I laughed.13. I like that they're allowing for the fact that the universe might not have the property of supersymmetry just because it would be mathematically matchy.14. The metaphor of 5 different theories of what happened to Earhart was a great way to explain why 5 slightly different superstring theories makes the idea itself less trustworthy.15. ""Comings and Goings of a Garden Hose."" I laughed. Maybe Kaluza K. Line came up with this epiphany just to combat the drudgery of staring at his neighbor's dot-eye. According to Linestein, there's a way to expand that dimension! 16. These ways of explaining the 10 dimensions (6 of them curled up in larger ones) WAS SO COOL.17. I really love the story of how Greene learned that another paper had duplicated the same findings as his and mirror symmetry in string theory is A THING. With holes that match up in Calabi-Yau shapes. !!!!!!18. I like how Greene explains counting a huge bin of oranges and then having a solution presented with a friend showing up with a box and how many boxes there were when the oranges were delivered. This is an analogy for why doing calculations on a mirror-imaged Calabi-Yau shape is sometimes easier than doing the math on its first one.19. The rivalry between the mathematicians and the physicists--I giggled a lot. I love that they compared their results, got different answers, and later found an error in the math camp's computer code that when fixed yielded the physics answer. After mining math for tools all this time, physics can give back, as it also solved other insurmountable math issues!20. I love the human element to the scientists' research into flop transitions and how Greene and Morrison had to teach each other their disciplines to make progress. They wanted to beat Witten to a discovery.21. I liked the story of working with Aspinwall to determine the shape of the Calabi-Yau shape they're looking for and having to buy him beer to make him come in on Saturday.22. Nobody knows the string coupling constant. Oy.23. Black holes have no ""hair."" They are all the same as each other. Small black holes will act just like large black holes in experiments.24. The revisions Greene and Morrison made after posting their article the first time resulted from having devil's advocate conversations. Haha.25. Hawking and Thorne had a bet with Preskill about whether information can reemerge after a black hole evaporates. Loser buys the winner an encyclopedia!I love learning about all these innovations and I love what dorks scientists are. I admire their imagination and passion, and even though most of the rest of the world will have no idea when they make their breakthroughs, I love all these ideas and I want to know where they've gone since."
158,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12872086-sheeraz,4,"It's a little difficult to review this book because I can't say I understood and retained everything that was presented. With that caveat, I think the author did a great job in explaining some very gnarly and unintuitive concepts to a non-physicist. The use of analogies was spot on and kept the narrative interesting even when my brain grasped at the edges of the ideas presented.The book, as the name suggests, is primarily about the development, current state and future outlook of string theory -- a good contender for a theory that unifies the description of different forces, and hopefully has physical properties of the universe as emergent quantities. The ideas are fascinating, like challenging our notion of distance building on Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The book got me excited about the future of string physics and its bearing on cosmology, and hoping that we will see some potential evidence in the favor of the theory in our lifetimes."
159,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8379733-bookhode,2,"Well, this was disappointing. Brian Greene's book with a pointlessly superlong title, had started off just fine, providing a nice recap of major developments in physics during the last century or so, with the special focus on Einstein's revolutionary theories, and on quantum mechanics that followed. This part was relatively easy to grasp, and despite the author's rather clumsy attempts at metaphor on almost every page, it was also relatively easy to read. The next part, where we reached the conflict between physics of the very small (with its rules based on probability), and physics of the very large (with exact rules), was also ok, as the book kept its flow, and I was able to follow the plot, and at least understand what the problem was all about.But then, we got to the central topic of this book, which is supposed to be the superstring theory, and things just quickly deteriorated in almost every way. The metaphors Greene kept on using became really weird, and were more hurting than helping the reader to cope with the increasingly difficult explanations. Chapters where he talked about his own achievements and discoveries in this field, were presented with overabundance of details, which was rather sharp contrast to the tone used in the rest of this book. And complete lack of any critical thought by the author towards the superstrings theory, made me feel like I was reading some kind of political pamphlet, and not an open-minded work of popular science.To a layman like me, the superstrings theory is bullshit. It's a fantasy about something we cannot see, feel or test in any practical manner. And the fact that the whole thing requires making up some weird multidimensional shapes, and then adjusting our regular mathematics by inventing more and more dimensions just to make the numbers fit, should completely kill its credibility. Of course, I am way out of my league here, and the theory could be quite correct, but the author never really managed to find the language or approach to persuade me to accept his opinion. All he did was to highhandedly wave off any criticism, and basically put the reader in a fait accompli position, where he should either agree with this inevitable new wisdom, or feel stupid. And I would rather feel stupid, than accept bullshit without any chance of verification.Current score: 49/100Current ranking: 37th among my non-fiction books."
160,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12365204-y-l,3,"I have to admit this has been a book I have had a love-hate relationship with for a good few months. I may have had it a lot easier than others as the friend who graciously loaned me this book had preempted me with a few documentary videos of Stephen Hawking and BBC as an introduction to the subject. Nevertheless, the universe is (as always) a long and lengthy subject to grasp and claiming that reading this book was a breeze would do the universe no justice.Thanks to three hours or so of videos, reading the first few chapters of this book was like reading revision notes on a day's worth of lecture. I wouldn't say I made every effort to understand each mathematic equation or even appreciate the technicality of physics and quantum mechanics that make the most part of this book, but I can now truly appreciate how mind-blowing it is to perceive the universe to be so much more than a big black blanket of space. Greene offered a glimpse of how quantum physicists and mathematicians look at our universe and writes eloquently on the slow and painstaking process of discovering the universe and the mechanics of it through decades of theories, collaboration and backsteps. I especially love how he details the life of himself and his colleagues as they accept each others strength and weaknesses on the subject and push each other to their limits to solve the mysteries that the universe has set at their doorstep. That itself would have probably made it a much more enjoyable book for me. As much as I am grateful for being given the opportunity to appreciate this subject via layman standards, I still feel that the book needs to be expressed a little better. Introductions on some parts of the subject could have been spared as the selling point of this book seems to be the concept of possibilities rather than dry science.I ended this book feeling a little overwhelmed - not sure if it is because of all the unnecessary fluff leading up to String Theory, the anticipation of whether String Theory will live up to its potential of a unified theory, or the fact that Greene had unsuspectingly dumped all his hopes and ideologies into the last few pages of the book to sell his idea of String Theory to the masses. I am all set to read Paul Davies' take on this...just as soon as I recover."
161,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9729716-jason,3," I was given this book as a gift. I typically don't go for the sort of fluffy stuff you'd find in the ""Science"" section at Barnes & Noble, which I figured this would be. I'm much more into mathematics than physics and have devoted most of my academic career to math shit rather than physics shit. So I was already prepared to lose my footing at some point in this book. I have a pretty good grasp on Special Relativity though so I tried to use that as a gauge for how well this dude was describing the more recent stuff beyond the point where my eyes just glazed over. I was happy that this fella got into stuff that lost me. It worries me when I finish a book about a complex or abstract thing and it's not a struggle to understand the material. I wonder whether the writer is just that good or that bad. What I found about this dude is that his wanting to illustrate everything with a metaphor or an analogy wound up confusing the stuff more. I mean, some were cool and I think I gleaned something of the rough shape of an idea. There were other spots where he used 3-4 different metaphors to get across an idea that was already pretty damn abstract. I think at those spots I'd have preferred more elaboration in the form of the notes in the back for ""the expert reader"" or for ""the mathematically inclined"". I basically read this as a starting point. I kept a book for notes as I read and now I have a bunch of pages of leads for further investigation. On a superficial level, I liked this guy's writing style. And the book was somewhat enjoyable while discussing bananas shit. I think there was a chapter or 2 where my reading was as productive as staring at the floor. All in all I don't know who I'd recommend this to. I'm part of a math club and no one there would take it off my hands when I was done because they don't like ""rock star physicists"" who write fluffy science books. But at the same time I can't give it to my mom because it does get into stuff within the first page that would lose her.  I'm not sure if all this explains why I gave it 3 stars, but I felt the need to be lengthy."
162,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458834-mark-laflamme,0,"For me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that started it all. Greene has such a smooth way of easing the novice into the complexities of string theory, the reader feels almost acquainted by the time the science is introduced. Never boring or tedious, Greene deftly guides us through the basics of relativity, explains the importance of frames of reference, and eases us into the almost magical world of gravity and timespace.Like Einstein, Greene presents the science through simple visuals - balls and bicycles, funny cars and cartoon spaceships. The reader will never feel as though he sits in a classroom with a boring professor droning away the afternoon. Instead, Greene describes the physics in a real world way and in doing so, prepares even the most casual student for the truly strange world of strings.String theory appears to be the road to a unified theory, the long sought Theory of Everything that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics. Along the way is a wonderous world of possibilities, with extra dimensions, parallel worlds, and all the while, tiny strings vibrating the symphony of the universe.I read this book with a zeal normally reserved for action novels. Each night was a new lesson and a new glimpse at a different part of the universe. Greene's gift is a clear and friendly writing style that makes this heavy science accessible to those of us without a string of initials at the end of our name.Many physicists came before Greene and others have followed suit. But for me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that opened my eyes to the mind blowing world of strings and the possibilities they present. And I've been hooked on string theory since. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked at a sky full of stars and wondered what it's all about.Mark LaFlamme, author of ""The Pink Room"" "
163,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"Though the first third of this book was amusing and accessible in a childish way, the book as a whole left me with a feeling that my brain is as tiny and crumpled up as a Calabi-Yau space, whichever shape it implies! :(My opinion of this book is similar but not equal to Rob's (though I liked his review), because I didn't think the first third of the book gave me a fairly good understanding of the Einstein's relativity concepts at all. For instance, the rubber membrane - bowling ball analogy was totally misleading for me.I like Marvin's review much more and I think it's clear why. :)Anyway, after this book I felt an awful need to 'unwarp' and 'uncurl' my brain, which made me look for another one - with better explanations of physics concepts ... and I had luck! Hmm, could this be the reason to change my rating to 5 stars?! No, because my lucky find doesn't deal with the string theory.Almost forgot to add: My lucky find was The Perception of Space... and its Measurement plus Galloping with Light - The Special Theory of Relativity by Felix Alba-Juez"
164,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,4,"I read (well, listened to) this book twice and I still don't understand string theory. What gives?!Ok, in all seriousness, this is an enjoyable book to read, but you're not going to come out of it understanding much about string theory. It's just too complicated, which is one of its serious flaws. I have really liked all of Brian Greene's books, but the more I read the less inclined I am to believe in string theory. Maybe if I had read this before Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law by Peter Holt or The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next by Lee Smolin, but those two books really do a good job of refuting this one."
165,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10896364-jehona,5,"Regardless of whether the string theory will ever be useful or not, this book remains useful. String theory might be an approach that doesn't work, but it remains a unique approach to describing the universe and a mathematically beautiful approach at that. Science needs new ways to describe the world time after time. Otherwise it becomes stagnant and fails to expand our understanding of things.Greene does a good job of explaining the basics of it. Many popular science writers tend to oversimplify some things and only mention other things in vague passages. The oversimplified ideas lose half of their meaning and the rest become hard to notice even by people who already understand them. Green wants your full attention. He will not butcher scientific concepts to tell you half-truths you can understand easier. However, he does his best to make things as simple as possible for the reader. Greene is passionate and his writing shows that he cares about it. I think that makes the book even better."
166,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"About the best book on the subject and by a mile. As almost all the other reviewers claim, the initial parts on Newtonian, Relativistic and Quantum science are so beautifully and novelly explained that they should be made mandatory in any study books on the topic. The approach continues as the author jumps to explaining a far more complex super-string theory. And here, the simplistic explanations make the theory look highly speculative, fantastic and without much ground/proof. This is certainly not the case and perhaps that's because far more work is needed not just in completing the theory but grasping its real meaning. This does not remotely lessen the utility or interesting style of the book as I strongly believe that there does not exist - at least so far - any simpler explanations. For anyone interested in cosmology, an absolute must read - ideally multiple times over a few years. Hope the author comes with an update soon."
167,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44110461-esme,4,"The first time I read this, a lot of it went way over my head, I was in high school and I was looking for something along the lines of Stephen Hawking, but a book written about a different topic. This is not as accessible as Stephen hawking, but a very well written book none the less. I would say this is for people who've already been introduced to the string theory, I tried reading it the first time without knowing anything about it and found myself staring like a deer in headlights. Once I got more familiar with the concepts (I used youtube videos) I went back to this book and enjoyed myself a lot. I won't pretend I understood everything, but I understood much much more than I did the first time picking it up. "

I'm not a particularly smart person, but I'd heard that this book was very readable even for people without knowledge on the subject. And parts of the book definitely was. There was a lot of very nice analogies and explanations - but the opposite is also true. I also don't really feel like I gained all that much from reading this. Like, I still don't know very much about string theory. Overall, I do not think this is a very good book, but the easily readable parts of the book, with their analogies and what not, prevent it from getting bottom score from me. So two stars from here."

At times fascinating at others almost unintelligible (to this newb) this book was anything but 'elegant' and the Universe described even less so. To start with, is anyone not able to do the math really able to understand this this stuff, at all? The number of times Dr. Greene describes the mathematics as extremely difficult or tricky or almost inaccessible (to PhD physicists and mathematicians, some of them Nobel level minds) is enough to make any 'normal' person falter in pretending to get it. Starting with the chapters on String Theory if you are not partially lost then you have either been exposed to these ideas repeatedly or are one or two orders of magnitude smarter than me. Calabai-Yau shapes, M-theory, branes, curled-up dimensions, Heterotic string theory (not very erotic!!), symmetry, super-symmetry, super-gravity, duality, etc. the list of concepts brand new to me goes on and on. That is is not to say he does not make brave efforts to have it make some sense. I do feel that I have some vague notion how of things beyond relativity and quantum mechanics might operate but that is about it. I guess there is a NOVA series and it might be worth to check out at this moment before it is all vaporised by time. And of course this book was written in 1999/2003 and many of the concepts may already have been 'clarified', confirmed or rejected. But overall I'd still recommend this book for an introduction to a very complex subject which asks some really big questions and tries to give some answers."

It hasn't been a straightforward or easy journey, but I'm getting there. Greene's book on String Theory has definitely provided that well-balanced mix between a scientific and detailed book and an accessible and digestible narrative. There were plenty of metaphors and examples throughout that simplified what to me at least was a very complex topic, and I find this is a good foundational book for someone dipping their toes in physics.As a theory, nonetheless, I must stress that this is not an answer to the big question, but a potential ""theory of everything"". It hasn't been proven - in fact, it might have been quite battered down in recent years. Therefore, take everything with a grain of salt and a critical mind that a science book should ultimately stimulate.I will admit, though, that despite the accessible and interesting character of The Elegant Universe, I find myself forgetting quite a lot of what it contained... I suck. I do recommend it because, again, I felt like it provided a lot of the foundation to understand physics in our time, but I am not sure I personally attained a greater understanding.

(And, for what it's worth, I used an audiobook to either preview or review, or simply to follow along with, chapters. Erik Davies is a superb, well-prepared narrator, but for the most part, you must have the book, and its many helpful illustrations, in your hand as you go through this material. Unless you're a physicist, you shouldn't be listening to this one on the way to work.)

I had college physics classes in the early 80s, and have read a number of “modern” pop physics books in the past couple of decades. I understand, in many aspects, the basics of physics pre-string theory. But this new stuff? I understand some of the definitions, but that’s about it. Greene’s book is very good at giving descriptions and examples and analogies for aspects of physics it is trying to explain. And for the older concepts, it does a great job. The newer concepts, string theory and beyond, are explained in the same way, with the same care. I found these concepts more difficult to understand, but I suspect that’s my problem, not the fault of the author. I found the book well organized, and the examples often memorable. However, I didn’t get the level of understanding I was hoping for concerning recent advances in physics. I would consider reading more by this author, but may be looking for a lower grade level."

181,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3590983-andrewp,3,"This book covers most of the basics of Physics theory. Relativity, quantum physics and then string theory. As the authors specialty is string theory about 50% of the book is dedicated to this subject. I admit that there were some concepts that I had a hard time understanding as there is no easy way to make the subject relateable to everyday experiences. Almost all of string theory is math driven and all the discoveries are just the relationships and solutions to incredibly complex math formulas. Even then, many of the ideas come down to interpreting results that are just approximations of the final solutions. Even our most powerful computers are unable to solve these equations completely. For me that's where string theory loses some of it's credibility. With such complex math it's manipulating the numbers until you get the answer you want.As this book was written in 1999 it's inevitably a bit out of date. This was before the existence of the LHC at CERN and some of the experiments in the last decade may have shed more light and indirectly confirmed some string theory concepts. In particular the existence of the superheavy Higgs boson would be evidence of symmetry predicted by string theory.A decent book but only for people really interested in the subject.

183,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,4,"This was a fascinating book about the prospects of string theory and how it may be the ultimate theory that gives us a complete picture of reality. Mathematically speaking, the theory (or rather the hypothesis) seems to be flawless. However, it's never been experimentally proved. The reason is obvious. The strings are so tiny and hard to find if they exist. Even our most powerful atom smashers and super colliders can't produce them. Brian Green says, we need a collider the size of the entire Milky Way Galaxy to create such strings. a more advanced version of the theory is called M-theory and it's an amalgamation of a number of different theories, five to be exact, that are brought together like the arms of a starfish. the problem with the current standard model of particle physics is that it does not unite gravity with other forces. For instance, at the moment of the big bang or at the core of a black hole, Einstein's theory of general relativity (the theory of the large) and quantum mechanics (the theory of the small) can not come together. Each of these theories is perfectly capable of explaining the world in its own domain, however. String theory is thought to be our current hope to reconcile gravity and QM. Strange as it may seem, the mathematics of string theory tells us that there are eleven dimensions (ten dimensions of space and one of time) instead of four. The reason you and I can't see these dimensions is because they're so tiny.According to string theory, if we could examine particles with great precision—a precision many orders of magnitude beyond our present technological capacity—we would find that each is not pointlike, but instead consists of a tiny one-dimensional loop."

185,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110610415-richard-seltzer,5,"A few months ago, when I was reviewing What Remains to be Discovered by John Maddox, I was convinced that the world is ""unknowable.""Now, thanks to The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene, I've done a flip-flop.As Maddox says in his concluding chapter, ""Unwilling or unable to accept the seemingly paradoxical behavior of single particles, such as electrons moving through both of two slits at the same time, for example, he [Albert Einstein] sought instead a set of equations whose elegance and symmetry would command respect, and by which even paradoxical phenomena would be explicable. Einstein's quest was no doubt impelled by his great success with the general theory of relativity (otherwise the theory of gravitation), which first won attention through its elegance. As the world now knows, it was a fruitless search. Quantum phenomena are often wrongly described as paradoxes for no better reason than that they conflict with the expectations of common sense, which themselves spring from human senses that have been honed by natural selection for telling what the macroscopic world is like. It is disconcerting that phenomena on the small scale are at odds with expectation, but there is a wealth of experimental data for which no other explanation is possible. How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" (p. 373)In my review, I noted, ""...a non-scientist, like myself, might well dream the impossible dream of a science that goes beyond science, a means of learning about 'reality' and describing it without depending on experiments.""Remarkably, Greene answers that key question ""How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" While experiment has its limitations, based on what can be measured and how, indirect techniques can give us glimpses of what lies beyond, leading to new hypotheses which can also be verified, with a high degree of confidence, by indirect techniques. The vastness of the cosmos provides clues to the physical structure of matter smaller than quarks (the components of electrons, protons, and other subatomic particles) and provides ways of verifying hypotheses that are beyond the limits of our most advanced laboratories.In Green's book, the universe is ""elegant"" and knowable, in ways man believed before the discoveries of quantum physics. When confronted with new previously unexplained phenomena, he turns to such principles as symmetry, beauty and logic to gain new insight. At the end of the dark tunnel of unknowability, he sees a ""multi-verse"" consisting of many universes; he sees black holes not just as the ugly ends of dying stars, but rather as seeds for other universes; he see a multi-verse in which those universes that have the most black holes are the most likely to survive and spawn new universes in a cosmic evolution scheme, based on survival of the fittest of universes.Just when I was getting used to the idea that the world is unfundamentally unknowable -- that our brains evolved to help us cope with the world of ordinary experience and simply aren't equipped to grasp the bizarre realms of the very small and the very large -- along comes a book that inspires me with renewed faith that we can know -- based on a classical belief in beauty and symmetry -- like a revelation from the 17th or 18th century.This book is convincing, lucid, powerful, mind-expanding.I had been aesthetically wallowing in the concept of unknowability -- convinced that the greatest advances in the 20th century came from acknowledging the limitations of the human mind, proving what cannot be known. That attitude led me to a high appreciation of the works of Stanislaw Lem (see my review at www.seltzerbooks.com/lem.html) and to a whole range of authors, starting with Plato, who emphasized that the value of the pursuit of wisdom was all in the process, that nothing can be known with any certainty. It is good to seek truth; but to believe that you have found truth is bad. The value comes from the seeking itself.In the days of Emerson and Swedenborg, the world and our senses and our ability to understand seemed perfectly suited to one another. Then modern science led us to see a disjunction between the world perceived in ordinary experience and the realm of the extremely small and the realm of the extremely large, both of which were revealed by advanced instruments; and led us to conclude that the limits of our instruments were the limits of our ability to understand. Now it appears that we can leap beyond those limits, arriving at new levels of understanding about the workings of the physical world, both at the sub-particle level and at the cosmic level.I won't attempt to explain Greene's explanations. I don't presume to have grasped it in great enough detail to do it justice. Read the book itself. He writes with the authority of one of the leaders in the field of string theory, but with a clarity and patience and ability to explain complex matters simply that rivals the efforts of the very best popularizers of science.Basically, quarks consist of ""strings"", and the ""vibrations"" of these strings determine their energy, mass, and other characteristics. These vibrations have ""frequency"" or rhythm, which leads me to think of this change of perspective in terms of Yeats: the focus is now on the dance rather than the dancer. The dancers come and go and combine and recombine; come into existance and annihiate and come into existence again in new forms. Yes, there are physical limits to what we can know about the dancer; but our knowledge of the dance can extend far beyond and lead us to important new conclusions.Strangely, such a change in the underlying concepts of physics leads to a new appreciation for old authors. I can't help but think of Frazier, Jung, and Joyce, and their attempts to grasp the flow and rhythm of all of human culture. I think of the multiple natural and mental rhythms of Virginia Woolf's Waves. I think of resonance and harmonics and extraordinary effects that can come from small changes, like a bridge breaking up because of the rhythm of the wind that strikes it; and I think of transistors and how they capitalize on how, in electronics, small changes can result in large effects. I also think of the theme of music and rhythm as an important element in how the mind works and how the world works in Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach. I think of Steven Pinker's books where he gains insight into the workings of the human mind by analyzing how we use language and the rules of grammar, and I wonder if there might be a ""grammar"" or ""rules of choreography"" for the cosmic dance. I may even develop a new appreciation for the art of dance. Greene himself alludes to the ancient notion of the ""music of the spheres.""And wonder of wonders, I feel myself motivated to tackle Heidegger's Being and Time. Contrary to the ruminations of Hamlet, being and not being may not be opposites, or may not be the only alternatives. To become or not to become? To become what from what? There may be a range or field of becoming, a pattern of becoming and interacting in the rhythm of individual human life and of life in aggregate.But don't be sidetracked by my vague speculations. Read the book. It could change your image of yourself and the world you live in."
186,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"Physicists today think they may have discovered what Einstein spent the last decades of his life searching for: the Theory of Everything. String Theory (technically, Superstring Theory) is the idea that everything we see in the world is really the result of one-dimensional strings vibrating in particular patterns. And if the idea of one-dimensional strings is hard for you to wrap your head around, then buckle up before you read this book, because that's the easy part. This book is dense. It's very, very technical. Yes, he promises no math, so we don't actually look at the formulas. But you can't talk about this theory without talking about math. We can't observe things this small with our technology today, so this is basically all math equations that add up nicely. So the book talks about math a lot--including a chapter that centered the differences between physics-based math and academic-Phd math. Unlike Einstein's theories, which were prompted by cool thought experiments, string theory is driven by equations. It's not intuitive at all. But if you can march through that technical data and make your brain stretch into odd shapes, then there are some interesting implications. He's not a Christian, but as a Christian I find some fascinating tidbits. Example: this new theory says all of reality is a result of vibrating strings, that the particular vibration patterns manifest as the bits of matter and energy that we observe. And the Bible says that the universe was formless and void until God spoke."
187,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"At long last I finished reading this! Detailed science books aren't the best bus books. :oSo this book about M-theory etc. was a great read. I very much enjoyed myself reading it and weirdly enough I kept laughing because Greene has a really amusing way of throwing in ridiculous humor while dreaming up weird analogies. I'm sure I wouldn't understand any of the mathematics behind what's described here, and to be honest even the layperson's explanation of the science was a stretch for me sometimes, but I was invested enough sometimes to wonder about what else has progressed on the questions raised in this book since it was written and have looked things up to find out what's newer in the field. Especially when Greene made references to the particle accelerator and what it might find when it was completed. I read some cool stuff about the Higgs Boson and all that. YEAH!Anyway, some notes I took while reading are my best way to share my thoughts.1. I giggled when the author described a scientist's reaction to the discovery of muons: ""Who ordered THAT?""2. His way of explaining the way physical objects change as they go faster was well thought out. Showing how it's happening every day but we can't detect it due to small measurements. Increasing them would make the difference apparent, and if we lived in a world where those measurements were standard, it'd be intuitive and invisible to us again.3. There was a great explanation of how a race car reaches the finish line slower if it travels diagonally, since some of the time is taken away to achieve horizontal travel.4. I find it really interesting that it apparently takes infinite power to push something faster than light because it becomes heavier and heavier as it approaches light speed, and that's why we can't go faster than light.5. I was envisioning warped space like a rubber tarp before the author explained the 3D problem. I am secretly a physicist after all!6. In a discussion of why energy is in lumps (discussing Planck's Constant): ""It's as if nature allows a whole pint of beer or no beer at all."" Haha.7. It's so interesting that observing matter affects it (photos hitting it has an effect), and if we lessened the photons we'd also be less likely to be able to determine its location because of the wave's length. And the electrons become ""frantic"" when they're cornered so they can't have their speed or location determined at the same time.8. The quantum tunneling descriptions were effective! It was cool to learn that electrons can go through stuff because of the space around the particles, but that it is unlikely that it will happen because being lucky enough for that to happen takes a really long time.9. The fifth level of magnification showing quantum froth was really effective. The borrowing and paying back analogy makes sense to explain why over long distances space seems flat, like a dot matrix printer makes images that look smooth.10. The ""Price is Right"" analogy for the large amount of money (energy) leaving a small amount down to the penny was a good way to explain why the specifics are too difficult for existing math to figure out.11. It's true that ""elegance"" and aesthetic doesn't prove a theory. We want theories to be beautiful, but if they're proved wrong we have to reject them, even if it's tempting to assume the elegance means it's accurate. But aesthetic does figure into choices in the research direction for theories.12. Sypersymmetry demands an as yet undetected super-partner particle. They're calling the one for electron ""selectron."" Also, ""squark"" and ""sneutrino."" I laughed.13. I like that they're allowing for the fact that the universe might not have the property of supersymmetry just because it would be mathematically matchy.14. The metaphor of 5 different theories of what happened to Earhart was a great way to explain why 5 slightly different superstring theories makes the idea itself less trustworthy.15. ""Comings and Goings of a Garden Hose."" I laughed. Maybe Kaluza K. Line came up with this epiphany just to combat the drudgery of staring at his neighbor's dot-eye. According to Linestein, there's a way to expand that dimension! 16. These ways of explaining the 10 dimensions (6 of them curled up in larger ones) WAS SO COOL.17. I really love the story of how Greene learned that another paper had duplicated the same findings as his and mirror symmetry in string theory is A THING. With holes that match up in Calabi-Yau shapes. !!!!!!18. I like how Greene explains counting a huge bin of oranges and then having a solution presented with a friend showing up with a box and how many boxes there were when the oranges were delivered. This is an analogy for why doing calculations on a mirror-imaged Calabi-Yau shape is sometimes easier than doing the math on its first one.19. The rivalry between the mathematicians and the physicists--I giggled a lot. I love that they compared their results, got different answers, and later found an error in the math camp's computer code that when fixed yielded the physics answer. After mining math for tools all this time, physics can give back, as it also solved other insurmountable math issues!20. I love the human element to the scientists' research into flop transitions and how Greene and Morrison had to teach each other their disciplines to make progress. They wanted to beat Witten to a discovery.21. I liked the story of working with Aspinwall to determine the shape of the Calabi-Yau shape they're looking for and having to buy him beer to make him come in on Saturday.22. Nobody knows the string coupling constant. Oy.23. Black holes have no ""hair."" They are all the same as each other. Small black holes will act just like large black holes in experiments.24. The revisions Greene and Morrison made after posting their article the first time resulted from having devil's advocate conversations. Haha.25. Hawking and Thorne had a bet with Preskill about whether information can reemerge after a black hole evaporates. Loser buys the winner an encyclopedia!I love learning about all these innovations and I love what dorks scientists are. I admire their imagination and passion, and even though most of the rest of the world will have no idea when they make their breakthroughs, I love all these ideas and I want to know where they've gone since."

With that caveat, I think the author did a great job in explaining some very gnarly and unintuitive concepts to a non-physicist. The use of analogies was spot on and kept the narrative interesting even when my brain grasped at the edges of the ideas presented.The book, as the name suggests, is primarily about the development, current state and future outlook of string theory -- a good contender for a theory that unifies the description of different forces, and hopefully has physical properties of the universe as emergent quantities. The ideas are fascinating, like challenging our notion of distance building on Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The book got me excited about the future of string physics and its bearing on cosmology, and hoping that we will see some potential evidence in the favor of the theory in our lifetimes."
189,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8379733-bookhode,2,"Well, this was disappointing. Brian Greene's book with a pointlessly superlong title, had started off just fine, providing a nice recap of major developments in physics during the last century or so, with the special focus on Einstein's revolutionary theories, and on quantum mechanics that followed. This part was relatively easy to grasp, and despite the author's rather clumsy attempts at metaphor on almost every page, it was also relatively easy to read. The next part, where we reached the conflict between physics of the very small (with its rules based on probability), and physics of the very large (with exact rules), was also ok, as the book kept its flow, and I was able to follow the plot, and at least understand what the problem was all about.But then, we got to the central topic of this book, which is supposed to be the superstring theory, and things just quickly deteriorated in almost every way. The metaphors Greene kept on using became really weird, and were more hurting than helping the reader to cope with the increasingly difficult explanations. Chapters where he talked about his own achievements and discoveries in this field, were presented with overabundance of details, which was rather sharp contrast to the tone used in the rest of this book. And complete lack of any critical thought by the author towards the superstrings theory, made me feel like I was reading some kind of political pamphlet, and not an open-minded work of popular science.To a layman like me, the superstrings theory is bullshit. It's a fantasy about something we cannot see, feel or test in any practical manner. And the fact that the whole thing requires making up some weird multidimensional shapes, and then adjusting our regular mathematics by inventing more and more dimensions just to make the numbers fit, should completely kill its credibility. Of course, I am way out of my league here, and the theory could be quite correct, but the author never really managed to find the language or approach to persuade me to accept his opinion. All he did was to highhandedly wave off any criticism, and basically put the reader in a fait accompli position, where he should either agree with this inevitable new wisdom, or feel stupid. And I would rather feel stupid, than accept bullshit without any chance of verification.Current score: 49/100Current ranking: 37th among my non-fiction books."
190,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12365204-y-l,3,"I have to admit this has been a book I have had a love-hate relationship with for a good few months. I may have had it a lot easier than others as the friend who graciously loaned me this book had preempted me with a few documentary videos of Stephen Hawking and BBC as an introduction to the subject. Nevertheless, the universe is (as always) a long and lengthy subject to grasp and claiming that reading this book was a breeze would do the universe no justice.Thanks to three hours or so of videos, reading the first few chapters of this book was like reading revision notes on a day's worth of lecture. I wouldn't say I made every effort to understand each mathematic equation or even appreciate the technicality of physics and quantum mechanics that make the most part of this book, but I can now truly appreciate how mind-blowing it is to perceive the universe to be so much more than a big black blanket of space. Greene offered a glimpse of how quantum physicists and mathematicians look at our universe and writes eloquently on the slow and painstaking process of discovering the universe and the mechanics of it through decades of theories, collaboration and backsteps. I especially love how he details the life of himself and his colleagues as they accept each others strength and weaknesses on the subject and push each other to their limits to solve the mysteries that the universe has set at their doorstep. That itself would have probably made it a much more enjoyable book for me. As much as I am grateful for being given the opportunity to appreciate this subject via layman standards, I still feel that the book needs to be expressed a little better. Introductions on some parts of the subject could have been spared as the selling point of this book seems to be the concept of possibilities rather than dry science.I ended this book feeling a little overwhelmed - not sure if it is because of all the unnecessary fluff leading up to String Theory, the anticipation of whether String Theory will live up to its potential of a unified theory, or the fact that Greene had unsuspectingly dumped all his hopes and ideologies into the last few pages of the book to sell his idea of String Theory to the masses. I am all set to read Paul Davies' take on this...just as soon as I recover."
191,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9729716-jason,3," I was given this book as a gift. I typically don't go for the sort of fluffy stuff you'd find in the ""Science"" section at Barnes & Noble, which I figured this would be. I'm much more into mathematics than physics and have devoted most of my academic career to math shit rather than physics shit. So I was already prepared to lose my footing at some point in this book. I have a pretty good grasp on Special Relativity though so I tried to use that as a gauge for how well this dude was describing the more recent stuff beyond the point where my eyes just glazed over. I was happy that this fella got into stuff that lost me. It worries me when I finish a book about a complex or abstract thing and it's not a struggle to understand the material. I wonder whether the writer is just that good or that bad. What I found about this dude is that his wanting to illustrate everything with a metaphor or an analogy wound up confusing the stuff more. I mean, some were cool and I think I gleaned something of the rough shape of an idea. There were other spots where he used 3-4 different metaphors to get across an idea that was already pretty damn abstract. I think at those spots I'd have preferred more elaboration in the form of the notes in the back for ""the expert reader"" or for ""the mathematically inclined"". I basically read this as a starting point. I kept a book for notes as I read and now I have a bunch of pages of leads for further investigation. On a superficial level, I liked this guy's writing style. And the book was somewhat enjoyable while discussing bananas shit. I think there was a chapter or 2 where my reading was as productive as staring at the floor. All in all I don't know who I'd recommend this to. I'm part of a math club and no one there would take it off my hands when I was done because they don't like ""rock star physicists"" who write fluffy science books. But at the same time I can't give it to my mom because it does get into stuff within the first page that would lose her.  I'm not sure if all this explains why I gave it 3 stars, but I felt the need to be lengthy."
192,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458834-mark-laflamme,0,"For me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that started it all. Greene has such a smooth way of easing the novice into the complexities of string theory, the reader feels almost acquainted by the time the science is introduced. Never boring or tedious, Greene deftly guides us through the basics of relativity, explains the importance of frames of reference, and eases us into the almost magical world of gravity and timespace.Like Einstein, Greene presents the science through simple visuals - balls and bicycles, funny cars and cartoon spaceships. The reader will never feel as though he sits in a classroom with a boring professor droning away the afternoon. Instead, Greene describes the physics in a real world way and in doing so, prepares even the most casual student for the truly strange world of strings.String theory appears to be the road to a unified theory, the long sought Theory of Everything that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics. Along the way is a wonderous world of possibilities, with extra dimensions, parallel worlds, and all the while, tiny strings vibrating the symphony of the universe.I read this book with a zeal normally reserved for action novels. Each night was a new lesson and a new glimpse at a different part of the universe. Greene's gift is a clear and friendly writing style that makes this heavy science accessible to those of us without a string of initials at the end of our name.Many physicists came before Greene and others have followed suit. But for me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that opened my eyes to the mind blowing world of strings and the possibilities they present. And I've been hooked on string theory since. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked at a sky full of stars and wondered what it's all about.Mark LaFlamme, author of ""The Pink Room"" "
193,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"Though the first third of this book was amusing and accessible in a childish way, the book as a whole left me with a feeling that my brain is as tiny and crumpled up as a Calabi-Yau space, whichever shape it implies! :(My opinion of this book is similar but not equal to Rob's (though I liked his review), because I didn't think the first third of the book gave me a fairly good understanding of the Einstein's relativity concepts at all. For instance, the rubber membrane - bowling ball analogy was totally misleading for me.I like Marvin's review much more and I think it's clear why. :)Anyway, after this book I felt an awful need to 'unwarp' and 'uncurl' my brain, which made me look for another one - with better explanations of physics concepts ... and I had luck! Hmm, could this be the reason to change my rating to 5 stars?! No, because my lucky find doesn't deal with the string theory.Almost forgot to add: My lucky find was The Perception of Space... and its Measurement plus Galloping with Light - The Special Theory of Relativity by Felix Alba-Juez"
194,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,4,"I read (well, listened to) this book twice and I still don't understand string theory. What gives?!Ok, in all seriousness, this is an enjoyable book to read, but you're not going to come out of it understanding much about string theory. It's just too complicated, which is one of its serious flaws. I have really liked all of Brian Greene's books, but the more I read the less inclined I am to believe in string theory. Maybe if I had read this before Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law by Peter Holt or The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next by Lee Smolin, but those two books really do a good job of refuting this one."
195,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10896364-jehona,5,"Regardless of whether the string theory will ever be useful or not, this book remains useful. String theory might be an approach that doesn't work, but it remains a unique approach to describing the universe and a mathematically beautiful approach at that. Science needs new ways to describe the world time after time. Otherwise it becomes stagnant and fails to expand our understanding of things.Greene does a good job of explaining the basics of it. Many popular science writers tend to oversimplify some things and only mention other things in vague passages. The oversimplified ideas lose half of their meaning and the rest become hard to notice even by people who already understand them. Green wants your full attention. He will not butcher scientific concepts to tell you half-truths you can understand easier. However, he does his best to make things as simple as possible for the reader. Greene is passionate and his writing shows that he cares about it. I think that makes the book even better."
196,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"About the best book on the subject and by a mile. As almost all the other reviewers claim, the initial parts on Newtonian, Relativistic and Quantum science are so beautifully and novelly explained that they should be made mandatory in any study books on the topic. The approach continues as the author jumps to explaining a far more complex super-string theory. And here, the simplistic explanations make the theory look highly speculative, fantastic and without much ground/proof. This is certainly not the case and perhaps that's because far more work is needed not just in completing the theory but grasping its real meaning. This does not remotely lessen the utility or interesting style of the book as I strongly believe that there does not exist - at least so far - any simpler explanations. For anyone interested in cosmology, an absolute must read - ideally multiple times over a few years. Hope the author comes with an update soon."

This is not as accessible as Stephen hawking, but a very well written book none the less. I would say this is for people who've already been introduced to the string theory, I tried reading it the first time without knowing anything about it and found myself staring like a deer in headlights. Once I got more familiar with the concepts (I used youtube videos) I went back to this book and enjoyed myself a lot. I won't pretend I understood everything, but I understood much much more than I did the first time picking it up. "

I'm not a particularly smart person, but I'd heard that this book was very readable even for people without knowledge on the subject. And parts of the book definitely was. There was a lot of very nice analogies and explanations - but the opposite is also true. I also don't really feel like I gained all that much from reading this. Like, I still don't know very much about string theory. Overall, I do not think this is a very good book, but the easily readable parts of the book, with their analogies and what not, prevent it from getting bottom score from me. So two stars from here."

At times fascinating at others almost unintelligible (to this newb) this book was anything but 'elegant' and the Universe described even less so. To start with, is anyone not able to do the math really able to understand this this stuff, at all? The number of times Dr. Greene describes the mathematics as extremely difficult or tricky or almost inaccessible (to PhD physicists and mathematicians, some of them Nobel level minds) is enough to make any 'normal' person falter in pretending to get it. Starting with the chapters on String Theory if you are not partially lost then you have either been exposed to these ideas repeatedly or are one or two orders of magnitude smarter than me. Calabai-Yau shapes, M-theory, branes, curled-up dimensions, Heterotic string theory (not very erotic!!), symmetry, super-symmetry, super-gravity, duality, etc. the list of concepts brand new to me goes on and on. That is is not to say he does not make brave efforts to have it make some sense. I do feel that I have some vague notion how of things beyond relativity and quantum mechanics might operate but that is about it. I guess there is a NOVA series and it might be worth to check out at this moment before it is all vaporised by time. And of course this book was written in 1999/2003 and many of the concepts may already have been 'clarified', confirmed or rejected. But overall I'd still recommend this book for an introduction to a very complex subject which asks some really big questions and tries to give some answers."

It hasn't been a straightforward or easy journey, but I'm getting there. Greene's book on String Theory has definitely provided that well-balanced mix between a scientific and detailed book and an accessible and digestible narrative. There were plenty of metaphors and examples throughout that simplified what to me at least was a very complex topic, and I find this is a good foundational book for someone dipping their toes in physics.As a theory, nonetheless, I must stress that this is not an answer to the big question, but a potential ""theory of everything"". It hasn't been proven - in fact, it might have been quite battered down in recent years. Therefore, take everything with a grain of salt and a critical mind that a science book should ultimately stimulate.I will admit, though, that despite the accessible and interesting character of The Elegant Universe, I find myself forgetting quite a lot of what it contained... I suck. I do recommend it because, again, I felt like it provided a lot of the foundation to understand physics in our time, but I am not sure I personally attained a greater understanding.

(And, for what it's worth, I used an audiobook to either preview or review, or simply to follow along with, chapters. Erik Davies is a superb, well-prepared narrator, but for the most part, you must have the book, and its many helpful illustrations, in your hand as you go through this material. Unless you're a physicist, you shouldn't be listening to this one on the way to work.) I have two additional Brian Greene books on my science shelf, and I want to get to them, soon, but I have to review some of the more impenetrable parts of The Elegant Universe, as well as entries in its useful glossary, yet again and hope for the voila! lightbulb to flash over my head."

I had college physics classes in the early 80s, and have read a number of “modern” pop physics books in the past couple of decades. I understand, in many aspects, the basics of physics pre-string theory. But this new stuff? I understand some of the definitions, but that’s about it. Greene’s book is very good at giving descriptions and examples and analogies for aspects of physics it is trying to explain. And for the older concepts, it does a great job. The newer concepts, string theory and beyond, are explained in the same way, with the same care. I found these concepts more difficult to understand, but I suspect that’s my problem, not the fault of the author. I found the book well organized, and the examples often memorable. However, I didn’t get the level of understanding I was hoping for concerning recent advances in physics. I would consider reading more by this author, but may be looking for a lower grade level."

211,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3590983-andrewp,3,"This book covers most of the basics of Physics theory. Relativity, quantum physics and then string theory. As the authors specialty is string theory about 50% of the book is dedicated to this subject. I admit that there were some concepts that I had a hard time understanding as there is no easy way to make the subject relateable to everyday experiences. Almost all of string theory is math driven and all the discoveries are just the relationships and solutions to incredibly complex math formulas. Even then, many of the ideas come down to interpreting results that are just approximations of the final solutions. Even our most powerful computers are unable to solve these equations completely. For me that's where string theory loses some of it's credibility. With such complex math it's manipulating the numbers until you get the answer you want.As this book was written in 1999 it's inevitably a bit out of date. This was before the existence of the LHC at CERN and some of the experiments in the last decade may have shed more light and indirectly confirmed some string theory concepts. In particular the existence of the superheavy Higgs boson would be evidence of symmetry predicted by string theory.A decent book but only for people really interested in the subject.

213,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,4,"This was a fascinating book about the prospects of string theory and how it may be the ultimate theory that gives us a complete picture of reality. Mathematically speaking, the theory (or rather the hypothesis) seems to be flawless. However, it's never been experimentally proved. The reason is obvious. The strings are so tiny and hard to find if they exist. Even our most powerful atom smashers and super colliders can't produce them. Brian Green says, we need a collider the size of the entire Milky Way Galaxy to create such strings. a more advanced version of the theory is called M-theory and it's an amalgamation of a number of different theories, five to be exact, that are brought together like the arms of a starfish. the problem with the current standard model of particle physics is that it does not unite gravity with other forces. For instance, at the moment of the big bang or at the core of a black hole, Einstein's theory of general relativity (the theory of the large) and quantum mechanics (the theory of the small) can not come together. Each of these theories is perfectly capable of explaining the world in its own domain, however. String theory is thought to be our current hope to reconcile gravity and QM. Strange as it may seem, the mathematics of string theory tells us that there are eleven dimensions (ten dimensions of space and one of time) instead of four. The reason you and I can't see these dimensions is because they're so tiny.According to string theory, if we could examine particles with great precision—a precision many orders of magnitude beyond our present technological capacity—we would find that each is not pointlike, but instead consists of a tiny one-dimensional loop."

215,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110610415-richard-seltzer,5,"A few months ago, when I was reviewing What Remains to be Discovered by John Maddox, I was convinced that the world is ""unknowable.""Now, thanks to The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene, I've done a flip-flop.As Maddox says in his concluding chapter, ""Unwilling or unable to accept the seemingly paradoxical behavior of single particles, such as electrons moving through both of two slits at the same time, for example, he [Albert Einstein] sought instead a set of equations whose elegance and symmetry would command respect, and by which even paradoxical phenomena would be explicable. Einstein's quest was no doubt impelled by his great success with the general theory of relativity (otherwise the theory of gravitation), which first won attention through its elegance. As the world now knows, it was a fruitless search. Quantum phenomena are often wrongly described as paradoxes for no better reason than that they conflict with the expectations of common sense, which themselves spring from human senses that have been honed by natural selection for telling what the macroscopic world is like. It is disconcerting that phenomena on the small scale are at odds with expectation, but there is a wealth of experimental data for which no other explanation is possible. How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" (p. 373)In my review, I noted, ""...a non-scientist, like myself, might well dream the impossible dream of a science that goes beyond science, a means of learning about 'reality' and describing it without depending on experiments.""Remarkably, Greene answers that key question ""How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" While experiment has its limitations, based on what can be measured and how, indirect techniques can give us glimpses of what lies beyond, leading to new hypotheses which can also be verified, with a high degree of confidence, by indirect techniques. The vastness of the cosmos provides clues to the physical structure of matter smaller than quarks (the components of electrons, protons, and other subatomic particles) and provides ways of verifying hypotheses that are beyond the limits of our most advanced laboratories.In Green's book, the universe is ""elegant"" and knowable, in ways man believed before the discoveries of quantum physics. When confronted with new previously unexplained phenomena, he turns to such principles as symmetry, beauty and logic to gain new insight. At the end of the dark tunnel of unknowability, he sees a ""multi-verse"" consisting of many universes; he sees black holes not just as the ugly ends of dying stars, but rather as seeds for other universes; he see a multi-verse in which those universes that have the most black holes are the most likely to survive and spawn new universes in a cosmic evolution scheme, based on survival of the fittest of universes.Just when I was getting used to the idea that the world is unfundamentally unknowable -- that our brains evolved to help us cope with the world of ordinary experience and simply aren't equipped to grasp the bizarre realms of the very small and the very large -- along comes a book that inspires me with renewed faith that we can know -- based on a classical belief in beauty and symmetry -- like a revelation from the 17th or 18th century.This book is convincing, lucid, powerful, mind-expanding.I had been aesthetically wallowing in the concept of unknowability -- convinced that the greatest advances in the 20th century came from acknowledging the limitations of the human mind, proving what cannot be known. That attitude led me to a high appreciation of the works of Stanislaw Lem (see my review at www.seltzerbooks.com/lem.html) and to a whole range of authors, starting with Plato, who emphasized that the value of the pursuit of wisdom was all in the process, that nothing can be known with any certainty. It is good to seek truth; but to believe that you have found truth is bad. The value comes from the seeking itself.In the days of Emerson and Swedenborg, the world and our senses and our ability to understand seemed perfectly suited to one another. Then modern science led us to see a disjunction between the world perceived in ordinary experience and the realm of the extremely small and the realm of the extremely large, both of which were revealed by advanced instruments; and led us to conclude that the limits of our instruments were the limits of our ability to understand. Now it appears that we can leap beyond those limits, arriving at new levels of understanding about the workings of the physical world, both at the sub-particle level and at the cosmic level.I won't attempt to explain Greene's explanations. I don't presume to have grasped it in great enough detail to do it justice. Read the book itself. He writes with the authority of one of the leaders in the field of string theory, but with a clarity and patience and ability to explain complex matters simply that rivals the efforts of the very best popularizers of science.Basically, quarks consist of ""strings"", and the ""vibrations"" of these strings determine their energy, mass, and other characteristics. These vibrations have ""frequency"" or rhythm, which leads me to think of this change of perspective in terms of Yeats: the focus is now on the dance rather than the dancer. The dancers come and go and combine and recombine; come into existance and annihiate and come into existence again in new forms. Yes, there are physical limits to what we can know about the dancer; but our knowledge of the dance can extend far beyond and lead us to important new conclusions.Strangely, such a change in the underlying concepts of physics leads to a new appreciation for old authors. I can't help but think of Frazier, Jung, and Joyce, and their attempts to grasp the flow and rhythm of all of human culture. I think of the multiple natural and mental rhythms of Virginia Woolf's Waves. I think of resonance and harmonics and extraordinary effects that can come from small changes, like a bridge breaking up because of the rhythm of the wind that strikes it; and I think of transistors and how they capitalize on how, in electronics, small changes can result in large effects. I also think of the theme of music and rhythm as an important element in how the mind works and how the world works in Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach. I think of Steven Pinker's books where he gains insight into the workings of the human mind by analyzing how we use language and the rules of grammar, and I wonder if there might be a ""grammar"" or ""rules of choreography"" for the cosmic dance. I may even develop a new appreciation for the art of dance. Greene himself alludes to the ancient notion of the ""music of the spheres.""And wonder of wonders, I feel myself motivated to tackle Heidegger's Being and Time. Contrary to the ruminations of Hamlet, being and not being may not be opposites, or may not be the only alternatives. To become or not to become? To become what from what? There may be a range or field of becoming, a pattern of becoming and interacting in the rhythm of individual human life and of life in aggregate.But don't be sidetracked by my vague speculations. Read the book. It could change your image of yourself and the world you live in."
216,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"Physicists today think they may have discovered what Einstein spent the last decades of his life searching for: the Theory of Everything. String Theory (technically, Superstring Theory) is the idea that everything we see in the world is really the result of one-dimensional strings vibrating in particular patterns. And if the idea of one-dimensional strings is hard for you to wrap your head around, then buckle up before you read this book, because that's the easy part. This book is dense. It's very, very technical. Yes, he promises no math, so we don't actually look at the formulas. But you can't talk about this theory without talking about math. We can't observe things this small with our technology today, so this is basically all math equations that add up nicely. So the book talks about math a lot--including a chapter that centered the differences between physics-based math and academic-Phd math. Unlike Einstein's theories, which were prompted by cool thought experiments, string theory is driven by equations. It's not intuitive at all. But if you can march through that technical data and make your brain stretch into odd shapes, then there are some interesting implications. He's not a Christian, but as a Christian I find some fascinating tidbits. Example: this new theory says all of reality is a result of vibrating strings, that the particular vibration patterns manifest as the bits of matter and energy that we observe. And the Bible says that the universe was formless and void until God spoke."
217,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"At long last I finished reading this! Detailed science books aren't the best bus books. :oSo this book about M-theory etc. was a great read. I very much enjoyed myself reading it and weirdly enough I kept laughing because Greene has a really amusing way of throwing in ridiculous humor while dreaming up weird analogies. I'm sure I wouldn't understand any of the mathematics behind what's described here, and to be honest even the layperson's explanation of the science was a stretch for me sometimes, but I was invested enough sometimes to wonder about what else has progressed on the questions raised in this book since it was written and have looked things up to find out what's newer in the field. Especially when Greene made references to the particle accelerator and what it might find when it was completed. I read some cool stuff about the Higgs Boson and all that. YEAH!Anyway, some notes I took while reading are my best way to share my thoughts.1. I giggled when the author described a scientist's reaction to the discovery of muons: ""Who ordered THAT?""2. His way of explaining the way physical objects change as they go faster was well thought out. Showing how it's happening every day but we can't detect it due to small measurements. Increasing them would make the difference apparent, and if we lived in a world where those measurements were standard, it'd be intuitive and invisible to us again.3. There was a great explanation of how a race car reaches the finish line slower if it travels diagonally, since some of the time is taken away to achieve horizontal travel.4. I find it really interesting that it apparently takes infinite power to push something faster than light because it becomes heavier and heavier as it approaches light speed, and that's why we can't go faster than light.5. I was envisioning warped space like a rubber tarp before the author explained the 3D problem. I am secretly a physicist after all!6. In a discussion of why energy is in lumps (discussing Planck's Constant): ""It's as if nature allows a whole pint of beer or no beer at all."" Haha.7. It's so interesting that observing matter affects it (photos hitting it has an effect), and if we lessened the photons we'd also be less likely to be able to determine its location because of the wave's length. And the electrons become ""frantic"" when they're cornered so they can't have their speed or location determined at the same time.8. The quantum tunneling descriptions were effective! It was cool to learn that electrons can go through stuff because of the space around the particles, but that it is unlikely that it will happen because being lucky enough for that to happen takes a really long time.9. The fifth level of magnification showing quantum froth was really effective. The borrowing and paying back analogy makes sense to explain why over long distances space seems flat, like a dot matrix printer makes images that look smooth.10. The ""Price is Right"" analogy for the large amount of money (energy) leaving a small amount down to the penny was a good way to explain why the specifics are too difficult for existing math to figure out.11. It's true that ""elegance"" and aesthetic doesn't prove a theory. We want theories to be beautiful, but if they're proved wrong we have to reject them, even if it's tempting to assume the elegance means it's accurate. But aesthetic does figure into choices in the research direction for theories.12. Sypersymmetry demands an as yet undetected super-partner particle. They're calling the one for electron ""selectron."" Also, ""squark"" and ""sneutrino."" I laughed.13. I like that they're allowing for the fact that the universe might not have the property of supersymmetry just because it would be mathematically matchy.14. The metaphor of 5 different theories of what happened to Earhart was a great way to explain why 5 slightly different superstring theories makes the idea itself less trustworthy.15. ""Comings and Goings of a Garden Hose."" I laughed. Maybe Kaluza K. Line came up with this epiphany just to combat the drudgery of staring at his neighbor's dot-eye. According to Linestein, there's a way to expand that dimension! 16. These ways of explaining the 10 dimensions (6 of them curled up in larger ones) WAS SO COOL.17. I really love the story of how Greene learned that another paper had duplicated the same findings as his and mirror symmetry in string theory is A THING. With holes that match up in Calabi-Yau shapes. !!!!!!18. I like how Greene explains counting a huge bin of oranges and then having a solution presented with a friend showing up with a box and how many boxes there were when the oranges were delivered. This is an analogy for why doing calculations on a mirror-imaged Calabi-Yau shape is sometimes easier than doing the math on its first one.19. The rivalry between the mathematicians and the physicists--I giggled a lot. I love that they compared their results, got different answers, and later found an error in the math camp's computer code that when fixed yielded the physics answer. After mining math for tools all this time, physics can give back, as it also solved other insurmountable math issues!20. I love the human element to the scientists' research into flop transitions and how Greene and Morrison had to teach each other their disciplines to make progress. They wanted to beat Witten to a discovery.21. I liked the story of working with Aspinwall to determine the shape of the Calabi-Yau shape they're looking for and having to buy him beer to make him come in on Saturday.22. Nobody knows the string coupling constant. Oy.23. Black holes have no ""hair."" They are all the same as each other. Small black holes will act just like large black holes in experiments.24. The revisions Greene and Morrison made after posting their article the first time resulted from having devil's advocate conversations. Haha.25. Hawking and Thorne had a bet with Preskill about whether information can reemerge after a black hole evaporates. Loser buys the winner an encyclopedia!I love learning about all these innovations and I love what dorks scientists are. I admire their imagination and passion, and even though most of the rest of the world will have no idea when they make their breakthroughs, I love all these ideas and I want to know where they've gone since."

With that caveat, I think the author did a great job in explaining some very gnarly and unintuitive concepts to a non-physicist. The use of analogies was spot on and kept the narrative interesting even when my brain grasped at the edges of the ideas presented.The book, as the name suggests, is primarily about the development, current state and future outlook of string theory -- a good contender for a theory that unifies the description of different forces, and hopefully has physical properties of the universe as emergent quantities. The ideas are fascinating, like challenging our notion of distance building on Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The book got me excited about the future of string physics and its bearing on cosmology, and hoping that we will see some potential evidence in the favor of the theory in our lifetimes."
219,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8379733-bookhode,2,"Well, this was disappointing. Brian Greene's book with a pointlessly superlong title, had started off just fine, providing a nice recap of major developments in physics during the last century or so, with the special focus on Einstein's revolutionary theories, and on quantum mechanics that followed. This part was relatively easy to grasp, and despite the author's rather clumsy attempts at metaphor on almost every page, it was also relatively easy to read. The next part, where we reached the conflict between physics of the very small (with its rules based on probability), and physics of the very large (with exact rules), was also ok, as the book kept its flow, and I was able to follow the plot, and at least understand what the problem was all about.But then, we got to the central topic of this book, which is supposed to be the superstring theory, and things just quickly deteriorated in almost every way. The metaphors Greene kept on using became really weird, and were more hurting than helping the reader to cope with the increasingly difficult explanations. Chapters where he talked about his own achievements and discoveries in this field, were presented with overabundance of details, which was rather sharp contrast to the tone used in the rest of this book. And complete lack of any critical thought by the author towards the superstrings theory, made me feel like I was reading some kind of political pamphlet, and not an open-minded work of popular science.To a layman like me, the superstrings theory is bullshit. It's a fantasy about something we cannot see, feel or test in any practical manner. And the fact that the whole thing requires making up some weird multidimensional shapes, and then adjusting our regular mathematics by inventing more and more dimensions just to make the numbers fit, should completely kill its credibility. Of course, I am way out of my league here, and the theory could be quite correct, but the author never really managed to find the language or approach to persuade me to accept his opinion. All he did was to highhandedly wave off any criticism, and basically put the reader in a fait accompli position, where he should either agree with this inevitable new wisdom, or feel stupid. And I would rather feel stupid, than accept bullshit without any chance of verification.Current score: 49/100Current ranking: 37th among my non-fiction books."
220,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12365204-y-l,3,"I have to admit this has been a book I have had a love-hate relationship with for a good few months. I may have had it a lot easier than others as the friend who graciously loaned me this book had preempted me with a few documentary videos of Stephen Hawking and BBC as an introduction to the subject. Nevertheless, the universe is (as always) a long and lengthy subject to grasp and claiming that reading this book was a breeze would do the universe no justice.Thanks to three hours or so of videos, reading the first few chapters of this book was like reading revision notes on a day's worth of lecture. I wouldn't say I made every effort to understand each mathematic equation or even appreciate the technicality of physics and quantum mechanics that make the most part of this book, but I can now truly appreciate how mind-blowing it is to perceive the universe to be so much more than a big black blanket of space. Greene offered a glimpse of how quantum physicists and mathematicians look at our universe and writes eloquently on the slow and painstaking process of discovering the universe and the mechanics of it through decades of theories, collaboration and backsteps. I especially love how he details the life of himself and his colleagues as they accept each others strength and weaknesses on the subject and push each other to their limits to solve the mysteries that the universe has set at their doorstep. That itself would have probably made it a much more enjoyable book for me. As much as I am grateful for being given the opportunity to appreciate this subject via layman standards, I still feel that the book needs to be expressed a little better. Introductions on some parts of the subject could have been spared as the selling point of this book seems to be the concept of possibilities rather than dry science.I ended this book feeling a little overwhelmed - not sure if it is because of all the unnecessary fluff leading up to String Theory, the anticipation of whether String Theory will live up to its potential of a unified theory, or the fact that Greene had unsuspectingly dumped all his hopes and ideologies into the last few pages of the book to sell his idea of String Theory to the masses. I am all set to read Paul Davies' take on this...just as soon as I recover."
221,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9729716-jason,3," I was given this book as a gift. I typically don't go for the sort of fluffy stuff you'd find in the ""Science"" section at Barnes & Noble, which I figured this would be. I'm much more into mathematics than physics and have devoted most of my academic career to math shit rather than physics shit. So I was already prepared to lose my footing at some point in this book. I have a pretty good grasp on Special Relativity though so I tried to use that as a gauge for how well this dude was describing the more recent stuff beyond the point where my eyes just glazed over. I was happy that this fella got into stuff that lost me. It worries me when I finish a book about a complex or abstract thing and it's not a struggle to understand the material. I wonder whether the writer is just that good or that bad. What I found about this dude is that his wanting to illustrate everything with a metaphor or an analogy wound up confusing the stuff more. I mean, some were cool and I think I gleaned something of the rough shape of an idea. There were other spots where he used 3-4 different metaphors to get across an idea that was already pretty damn abstract. I think at those spots I'd have preferred more elaboration in the form of the notes in the back for ""the expert reader"" or for ""the mathematically inclined"". I basically read this as a starting point. I kept a book for notes as I read and now I have a bunch of pages of leads for further investigation. On a superficial level, I liked this guy's writing style. And the book was somewhat enjoyable while discussing bananas shit. I think there was a chapter or 2 where my reading was as productive as staring at the floor. All in all I don't know who I'd recommend this to. I'm part of a math club and no one there would take it off my hands when I was done because they don't like ""rock star physicists"" who write fluffy science books. But at the same time I can't give it to my mom because it does get into stuff within the first page that would lose her.  I'm not sure if all this explains why I gave it 3 stars, but I felt the need to be lengthy."
222,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458834-mark-laflamme,0,"For me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that started it all. Greene has such a smooth way of easing the novice into the complexities of string theory, the reader feels almost acquainted by the time the science is introduced. Never boring or tedious, Greene deftly guides us through the basics of relativity, explains the importance of frames of reference, and eases us into the almost magical world of gravity and timespace.Like Einstein, Greene presents the science through simple visuals - balls and bicycles, funny cars and cartoon spaceships. The reader will never feel as though he sits in a classroom with a boring professor droning away the afternoon. Instead, Greene describes the physics in a real world way and in doing so, prepares even the most casual student for the truly strange world of strings.String theory appears to be the road to a unified theory, the long sought Theory of Everything that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics. Along the way is a wonderous world of possibilities, with extra dimensions, parallel worlds, and all the while, tiny strings vibrating the symphony of the universe.I read this book with a zeal normally reserved for action novels. Each night was a new lesson and a new glimpse at a different part of the universe. Greene's gift is a clear and friendly writing style that makes this heavy science accessible to those of us without a string of initials at the end of our name.Many physicists came before Greene and others have followed suit. But for me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that opened my eyes to the mind blowing world of strings and the possibilities they present. And I've been hooked on string theory since. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked at a sky full of stars and wondered what it's all about.Mark LaFlamme, author of ""The Pink Room"" "
223,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"Though the first third of this book was amusing and accessible in a childish way, the book as a whole left me with a feeling that my brain is as tiny and crumpled up as a Calabi-Yau space, whichever shape it implies! :(My opinion of this book is similar but not equal to Rob's (though I liked his review), because I didn't think the first third of the book gave me a fairly good understanding of the Einstein's relativity concepts at all. For instance, the rubber membrane - bowling ball analogy was totally misleading for me.I like Marvin's review much more and I think it's clear why. :)Anyway, after this book I felt an awful need to 'unwarp' and 'uncurl' my brain, which made me look for another one - with better explanations of physics concepts ... and I had luck! Hmm, could this be the reason to change my rating to 5 stars?! No, because my lucky find doesn't deal with the string theory.Almost forgot to add: My lucky find was The Perception of Space... and its Measurement plus Galloping with Light - The Special Theory of Relativity by Felix Alba-Juez"
224,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,4,"I read (well, listened to) this book twice and I still don't understand string theory. What gives?!Ok, in all seriousness, this is an enjoyable book to read, but you're not going to come out of it understanding much about string theory. It's just too complicated, which is one of its serious flaws. I have really liked all of Brian Greene's books, but the more I read the less inclined I am to believe in string theory. Maybe if I had read this before Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law by Peter Holt or The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next by Lee Smolin, but those two books really do a good job of refuting this one."
225,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10896364-jehona,5,"Regardless of whether the string theory will ever be useful or not, this book remains useful. String theory might be an approach that doesn't work, but it remains a unique approach to describing the universe and a mathematically beautiful approach at that. Science needs new ways to describe the world time after time. Otherwise it becomes stagnant and fails to expand our understanding of things.Greene does a good job of explaining the basics of it. Many popular science writers tend to oversimplify some things and only mention other things in vague passages. The oversimplified ideas lose half of their meaning and the rest become hard to notice even by people who already understand them. Green wants your full attention. He will not butcher scientific concepts to tell you half-truths you can understand easier. However, he does his best to make things as simple as possible for the reader. Greene is passionate and his writing shows that he cares about it. I think that makes the book even better."
226,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"About the best book on the subject and by a mile. As almost all the other reviewers claim, the initial parts on Newtonian, Relativistic and Quantum science are so beautifully and novelly explained that they should be made mandatory in any study books on the topic. The approach continues as the author jumps to explaining a far more complex super-string theory. And here, the simplistic explanations make the theory look highly speculative, fantastic and without much ground/proof. This is certainly not the case and perhaps that's because far more work is needed not just in completing the theory but grasping its real meaning. This does not remotely lessen the utility or interesting style of the book as I strongly believe that there does not exist - at least so far - any simpler explanations. For anyone interested in cosmology, an absolute must read - ideally multiple times over a few years. Hope the author comes with an update soon."

This is not as accessible as Stephen hawking, but a very well written book none the less. I would say this is for people who've already been introduced to the string theory, I tried reading it the first time without knowing anything about it and found myself staring like a deer in headlights. Once I got more familiar with the concepts (I used youtube videos) I went back to this book and enjoyed myself a lot. I won't pretend I understood everything, but I understood much much more than I did the first time picking it up. "

I'm not a particularly smart person, but I'd heard that this book was very readable even for people without knowledge on the subject. And parts of the book definitely was. There was a lot of very nice analogies and explanations - but the opposite is also true. I also don't really feel like I gained all that much from reading this. Like, I still don't know very much about string theory. Overall, I do not think this is a very good book, but the easily readable parts of the book, with their analogies and what not, prevent it from getting bottom score from me. So two stars from here."

At times fascinating at others almost unintelligible (to this newb) this book was anything but 'elegant' and the Universe described even less so. To start with, is anyone not able to do the math really able to understand this this stuff, at all? The number of times Dr. Greene describes the mathematics as extremely difficult or tricky or almost inaccessible (to PhD physicists and mathematicians, some of them Nobel level minds) is enough to make any 'normal' person falter in pretending to get it. Starting with the chapters on String Theory if you are not partially lost then you have either been exposed to these ideas repeatedly or are one or two orders of magnitude smarter than me. Calabai-Yau shapes, M-theory, branes, curled-up dimensions, Heterotic string theory (not very erotic!!), symmetry, super-symmetry, super-gravity, duality, etc. the list of concepts brand new to me goes on and on. That is is not to say he does not make brave efforts to have it make some sense. I do feel that I have some vague notion how of things beyond relativity and quantum mechanics might operate but that is about it. I guess there is a NOVA series and it might be worth to check out at this moment before it is all vaporised by time. And of course this book was written in 1999/2003 and many of the concepts may already have been 'clarified', confirmed or rejected. But overall I'd still recommend this book for an introduction to a very complex subject which asks some really big questions and tries to give some answers."

It hasn't been a straightforward or easy journey, but I'm getting there. Greene's book on String Theory has definitely provided that well-balanced mix between a scientific and detailed book and an accessible and digestible narrative. There were plenty of metaphors and examples throughout that simplified what to me at least was a very complex topic, and I find this is a good foundational book for someone dipping their toes in physics.As a theory, nonetheless, I must stress that this is not an answer to the big question, but a potential ""theory of everything"". It hasn't been proven - in fact, it might have been quite battered down in recent years. Therefore, take everything with a grain of salt and a critical mind that a science book should ultimately stimulate.I will admit, though, that despite the accessible and interesting character of The Elegant Universe, I find myself forgetting quite a lot of what it contained... I suck. I do recommend it because, again, I felt like it provided a lot of the foundation to understand physics in our time, but I am not sure I personally attained a greater understanding.

(And, for what it's worth, I used an audiobook to either preview or review, or simply to follow along with, chapters. Erik Davies is a superb, well-prepared narrator, but for the most part, you must have the book, and its many helpful illustrations, in your hand as you go through this material. Unless you're a physicist, you shouldn't be listening to this one on the way to work.)

I had college physics classes in the early 80s, and have read a number of “modern” pop physics books in the past couple of decades. I understand, in many aspects, the basics of physics pre-string theory. But this new stuff? I understand some of the definitions, but that’s about it. Greene’s book is very good at giving descriptions and examples and analogies for aspects of physics it is trying to explain. And for the older concepts, it does a great job. The newer concepts, string theory and beyond, are explained in the same way, with the same care. I found these concepts more difficult to understand, but I suspect that’s my problem, not the fault of the author. I found the book well organized, and the examples often memorable. However, I didn’t get the level of understanding I was hoping for concerning recent advances in physics. I would consider reading more by this author, but may be looking for a lower grade level."

As the authors specialty is string theory about 50% of the book is dedicated to this subject. I admit that there were some concepts that I had a hard time understanding as there is no easy way to make the subject relateable to everyday experiences. Almost all of string theory is math driven and all the discoveries are just the relationships and solutions to incredibly complex math formulas. Even then, many of the ideas come down to interpreting results that are just approximations of the final solutions. Even our most powerful computers are unable to solve these equations completely. For me that's where string theory loses some of it's credibility. With such complex math it's manipulating the numbers until you get the answer you want.As this book was written in 1999 it's inevitably a bit out of date. This was before the existence of the LHC at CERN and some of the experiments in the last decade may have shed more light and indirectly confirmed some string theory concepts. In particular the existence of the superheavy Higgs boson would be evidence of symmetry predicted by string theory.A decent book but only for people really interested in the subject.

243,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,4,"This was a fascinating book about the prospects of string theory and how it may be the ultimate theory that gives us a complete picture of reality. Mathematically speaking, the theory (or rather the hypothesis) seems to be flawless. However, it's never been experimentally proved. The reason is obvious. The strings are so tiny and hard to find if they exist. Even our most powerful atom smashers and super colliders can't produce them. Brian Green says, we need a collider the size of the entire Milky Way Galaxy to create such strings. a more advanced version of the theory is called M-theory and it's an amalgamation of a number of different theories, five to be exact, that are brought together like the arms of a starfish. the problem with the current standard model of particle physics is that it does not unite gravity with other forces. For instance, at the moment of the big bang or at the core of a black hole, Einstein's theory of general relativity (the theory of the large) and quantum mechanics (the theory of the small) can not come together. Each of these theories is perfectly capable of explaining the world in its own domain, however. String theory is thought to be our current hope to reconcile gravity and QM. Strange as it may seem, the mathematics of string theory tells us that there are eleven dimensions (ten dimensions of space and one of time) instead of four. The reason you and I can't see these dimensions is because they're so tiny.According to string theory, if we could examine particles with great precision—a precision many orders of magnitude beyond our present technological capacity—we would find that each is not pointlike, but instead consists of a tiny one-dimensional loop."

Einstein's quest was no doubt impelled by his great success with the general theory of relativity (otherwise the theory of gravitation), which first won attention through its elegance. As the world now knows, it was a fruitless search. Quantum phenomena are often wrongly described as paradoxes for no better reason than that they conflict with the expectations of common sense, which themselves spring from human senses that have been honed by natural selection for telling what the macroscopic world is like. It is disconcerting that phenomena on the small scale are at odds with expectation, but there is a wealth of experimental data for which no other explanation is possible. How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" (p. 373)In my review, I noted, ""...a non-scientist, like myself, might well dream the impossible dream of a science that goes beyond science, a means of learning about 'reality' and describing it without depending on experiments.""Remarkably, Greene answers that key question ""How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" While experiment has its limitations, based on what can be measured and how, indirect techniques can give us glimpses of what lies beyond, leading to new hypotheses which can also be verified, with a high degree of confidence, by indirect techniques. The vastness of the cosmos provides clues to the physical structure of matter smaller than quarks (the components of electrons, protons, and other subatomic particles) and provides ways of verifying hypotheses that are beyond the limits of our most advanced laboratories.In Green's book, the universe is ""elegant"" and knowable, in ways man believed before the discoveries of quantum physics. When confronted with new previously unexplained phenomena, he turns to such principles as symmetry, beauty and logic to gain new insight. At the end of the dark tunnel of unknowability, he sees a ""multi-verse"" consisting of many universes; he sees black holes not just as the ugly ends of dying stars, but rather as seeds for other universes; he see a multi-verse in which those universes that have the most black holes are the most likely to survive and spawn new universes in a cosmic evolution scheme, based on survival of the fittest of universes.Just when I was getting used to the idea that the world is unfundamentally unknowable -- that our brains evolved to help us cope with the world of ordinary experience and simply aren't equipped to grasp the bizarre realms of the very small and the very large -- along comes a book that inspires me with renewed faith that we can know -- based on a classical belief in beauty and symmetry -- like a revelation from the 17th or 18th century.This book is convincing, lucid, powerful, mind-expanding.I had been aesthetically wallowing in the concept of unknowability -- convinced that the greatest advances in the 20th century came from acknowledging the limitations of the human mind, proving what cannot be known. That attitude led me to a high appreciation of the works of Stanislaw Lem (see my review at www.seltzerbooks.com/lem.html) and to a whole range of authors, starting with Plato, who emphasized that the value of the pursuit of wisdom was all in the process, that nothing can be known with any certainty. It is good to seek truth; but to believe that you have found truth is bad. The value comes from the seeking itself.In the days of Emerson and Swedenborg, the world and our senses and our ability to understand seemed perfectly suited to one another. Then modern science led us to see a disjunction between the world perceived in ordinary experience and the realm of the extremely small and the realm of the extremely large, both of which were revealed by advanced instruments; and led us to conclude that the limits of our instruments were the limits of our ability to understand. Now it appears that we can leap beyond those limits, arriving at new levels of understanding about the workings of the physical world, both at the sub-particle level and at the cosmic level.I won't attempt to explain Greene's explanations. I don't presume to have grasped it in great enough detail to do it justice. Read the book itself. He writes with the authority of one of the leaders in the field of string theory, but with a clarity and patience and ability to explain complex matters simply that rivals the efforts of the very best popularizers of science.Basically, quarks consist of ""strings"", and the ""vibrations"" of these strings determine their energy, mass, and other characteristics. These vibrations have ""frequency"" or rhythm, which leads me to think of this change of perspective in terms of Yeats: the focus is now on the dance rather than the dancer. The dancers come and go and combine and recombine; come into existance and annihiate and come into existence again in new forms. Yes, there are physical limits to what we can know about the dancer; but our knowledge of the dance can extend far beyond and lead us to important new conclusions.Strangely, such a change in the underlying concepts of physics leads to a new appreciation for old authors. I can't help but think of Frazier, Jung, and Joyce, and their attempts to grasp the flow and rhythm of all of human culture. I think of the multiple natural and mental rhythms of Virginia Woolf's Waves. I think of resonance and harmonics and extraordinary effects that can come from small changes, like a bridge breaking up because of the rhythm of the wind that strikes it; and I think of transistors and how they capitalize on how, in electronics, small changes can result in large effects. I also think of the theme of music and rhythm as an important element in how the mind works and how the world works in Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach. I think of Steven Pinker's books where he gains insight into the workings of the human mind by analyzing how we use language and the rules of grammar, and I wonder if there might be a ""grammar"" or ""rules of choreography"" for the cosmic dance. I may even develop a new appreciation for the art of dance. Greene himself alludes to the ancient notion of the ""music of the spheres.""And wonder of wonders, I feel myself motivated to tackle Heidegger's Being and Time. Contrary to the ruminations of Hamlet, being and not being may not be opposites, or may not be the only alternatives. To become or not to become? To become what from what? There may be a range or field of becoming, a pattern of becoming and interacting in the rhythm of individual human life and of life in aggregate.But don't be sidetracked by my vague speculations. Read the book. It could change your image of yourself and the world you live in."
246,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"Physicists today think they may have discovered what Einstein spent the last decades of his life searching for: the Theory of Everything. String Theory (technically, Superstring Theory) is the idea that everything we see in the world is really the result of one-dimensional strings vibrating in particular patterns. And if the idea of one-dimensional strings is hard for you to wrap your head around, then buckle up before you read this book, because that's the easy part. This book is dense. It's very, very technical. Yes, he promises no math, so we don't actually look at the formulas. But you can't talk about this theory without talking about math. We can't observe things this small with our technology today, so this is basically all math equations that add up nicely. So the book talks about math a lot--including a chapter that centered the differences between physics-based math and academic-Phd math. Unlike Einstein's theories, which were prompted by cool thought experiments, string theory is driven by equations. It's not intuitive at all. But if you can march through that technical data and make your brain stretch into odd shapes, then there are some interesting implications. He's not a Christian, but as a Christian I find some fascinating tidbits. Example: this new theory says all of reality is a result of vibrating strings, that the particular vibration patterns manifest as the bits of matter and energy that we observe. And the Bible says that the universe was formless and void until God spoke."
247,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"At long last I finished reading this! Detailed science books aren't the best bus books. :oSo this book about M-theory etc. was a great read. I very much enjoyed myself reading it and weirdly enough I kept laughing because Greene has a really amusing way of throwing in ridiculous humor while dreaming up weird analogies. I'm sure I wouldn't understand any of the mathematics behind what's described here, and to be honest even the layperson's explanation of the science was a stretch for me sometimes, but I was invested enough sometimes to wonder about what else has progressed on the questions raised in this book since it was written and have looked things up to find out what's newer in the field. Especially when Greene made references to the particle accelerator and what it might find when it was completed. I read some cool stuff about the Higgs Boson and all that. YEAH!Anyway, some notes I took while reading are my best way to share my thoughts.1. I giggled when the author described a scientist's reaction to the discovery of muons: ""Who ordered THAT?""2. His way of explaining the way physical objects change as they go faster was well thought out. Showing how it's happening every day but we can't detect it due to small measurements. Increasing them would make the difference apparent, and if we lived in a world where those measurements were standard, it'd be intuitive and invisible to us again.3. There was a great explanation of how a race car reaches the finish line slower if it travels diagonally, since some of the time is taken away to achieve horizontal travel.4. I find it really interesting that it apparently takes infinite power to push something faster than light because it becomes heavier and heavier as it approaches light speed, and that's why we can't go faster than light.5. I was envisioning warped space like a rubber tarp before the author explained the 3D problem. I am secretly a physicist after all!6. In a discussion of why energy is in lumps (discussing Planck's Constant): ""It's as if nature allows a whole pint of beer or no beer at all."" Haha.7. It's so interesting that observing matter affects it (photos hitting it has an effect), and if we lessened the photons we'd also be less likely to be able to determine its location because of the wave's length. And the electrons become ""frantic"" when they're cornered so they can't have their speed or location determined at the same time.8. The quantum tunneling descriptions were effective! It was cool to learn that electrons can go through stuff because of the space around the particles, but that it is unlikely that it will happen because being lucky enough for that to happen takes a really long time.9. The fifth level of magnification showing quantum froth was really effective. The borrowing and paying back analogy makes sense to explain why over long distances space seems flat, like a dot matrix printer makes images that look smooth.10. The ""Price is Right"" analogy for the large amount of money (energy) leaving a small amount down to the penny was a good way to explain why the specifics are too difficult for existing math to figure out.11. It's true that ""elegance"" and aesthetic doesn't prove a theory. We want theories to be beautiful, but if they're proved wrong we have to reject them, even if it's tempting to assume the elegance means it's accurate. But aesthetic does figure into choices in the research direction for theories.12. Sypersymmetry demands an as yet undetected super-partner particle. They're calling the one for electron ""selectron."" Also, ""squark"" and ""sneutrino."" I laughed.13. I like that they're allowing for the fact that the universe might not have the property of supersymmetry just because it would be mathematically matchy.14. The metaphor of 5 different theories of what happened to Earhart was a great way to explain why 5 slightly different superstring theories makes the idea itself less trustworthy.15. ""Comings and Goings of a Garden Hose."" I laughed. Maybe Kaluza K. Line came up with this epiphany just to combat the drudgery of staring at his neighbor's dot-eye. According to Linestein, there's a way to expand that dimension! 16. These ways of explaining the 10 dimensions (6 of them curled up in larger ones) WAS SO COOL.17. I really love the story of how Greene learned that another paper had duplicated the same findings as his and mirror symmetry in string theory is A THING. With holes that match up in Calabi-Yau shapes. !!!!!!18. I like how Greene explains counting a huge bin of oranges and then having a solution presented with a friend showing up with a box and how many boxes there were when the oranges were delivered. This is an analogy for why doing calculations on a mirror-imaged Calabi-Yau shape is sometimes easier than doing the math on its first one.19. The rivalry between the mathematicians and the physicists--I giggled a lot. I love that they compared their results, got different answers, and later found an error in the math camp's computer code that when fixed yielded the physics answer. After mining math for tools all this time, physics can give back, as it also solved other insurmountable math issues!20. I love the human element to the scientists' research into flop transitions and how Greene and Morrison had to teach each other their disciplines to make progress. They wanted to beat Witten to a discovery.21. I liked the story of working with Aspinwall to determine the shape of the Calabi-Yau shape they're looking for and having to buy him beer to make him come in on Saturday.22. Nobody knows the string coupling constant. Oy.23. Black holes have no ""hair."" They are all the same as each other. Small black holes will act just like large black holes in experiments.24. The revisions Greene and Morrison made after posting their article the first time resulted from having devil's advocate conversations. Haha.25. Hawking and Thorne had a bet with Preskill about whether information can reemerge after a black hole evaporates. Loser buys the winner an encyclopedia!I love learning about all these innovations and I love what dorks scientists are. I admire their imagination and passion, and even though most of the rest of the world will have no idea when they make their breakthroughs, I love all these ideas and I want to know where they've gone since."
248,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12872086-sheeraz,4,"It's a little difficult to review this book because I can't say I understood and retained everything that was presented. With that caveat, I think the author did a great job in explaining some very gnarly and unintuitive concepts to a non-physicist. The use of analogies was spot on and kept the narrative interesting even when my brain grasped at the edges of the ideas presented.The book, as the name suggests, is primarily about the development, current state and future outlook of string theory -- a good contender for a theory that unifies the description of different forces, and hopefully has physical properties of the universe as emergent quantities. The ideas are fascinating, like challenging our notion of distance building on Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The book got me excited about the future of string physics and its bearing on cosmology, and hoping that we will see some potential evidence in the favor of the theory in our lifetimes."
249,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8379733-bookhode,2,"Well, this was disappointing. Brian Greene's book with a pointlessly superlong title, had started off just fine, providing a nice recap of major developments in physics during the last century or so, with the special focus on Einstein's revolutionary theories, and on quantum mechanics that followed. This part was relatively easy to grasp, and despite the author's rather clumsy attempts at metaphor on almost every page, it was also relatively easy to read. The next part, where we reached the conflict between physics of the very small (with its rules based on probability), and physics of the very large (with exact rules), was also ok, as the book kept its flow, and I was able to follow the plot, and at least understand what the problem was all about.But then, we got to the central topic of this book, which is supposed to be the superstring theory, and things just quickly deteriorated in almost every way. The metaphors Greene kept on using became really weird, and were more hurting than helping the reader to cope with the increasingly difficult explanations. Chapters where he talked about his own achievements and discoveries in this field, were presented with overabundance of details, which was rather sharp contrast to the tone used in the rest of this book. And complete lack of any critical thought by the author towards the superstrings theory, made me feel like I was reading some kind of political pamphlet, and not an open-minded work of popular science.To a layman like me, the superstrings theory is bullshit. It's a fantasy about something we cannot see, feel or test in any practical manner. And the fact that the whole thing requires making up some weird multidimensional shapes, and then adjusting our regular mathematics by inventing more and more dimensions just to make the numbers fit, should completely kill its credibility. Of course, I am way out of my league here, and the theory could be quite correct, but the author never really managed to find the language or approach to persuade me to accept his opinion. All he did was to highhandedly wave off any criticism, and basically put the reader in a fait accompli position, where he should either agree with this inevitable new wisdom, or feel stupid. And I would rather feel stupid, than accept bullshit without any chance of verification.Current score: 49/100Current ranking: 37th among my non-fiction books."
250,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12365204-y-l,3,"I have to admit this has been a book I have had a love-hate relationship with for a good few months. I may have had it a lot easier than others as the friend who graciously loaned me this book had preempted me with a few documentary videos of Stephen Hawking and BBC as an introduction to the subject. Nevertheless, the universe is (as always) a long and lengthy subject to grasp and claiming that reading this book was a breeze would do the universe no justice.Thanks to three hours or so of videos, reading the first few chapters of this book was like reading revision notes on a day's worth of lecture. I wouldn't say I made every effort to understand each mathematic equation or even appreciate the technicality of physics and quantum mechanics that make the most part of this book, but I can now truly appreciate how mind-blowing it is to perceive the universe to be so much more than a big black blanket of space. Greene offered a glimpse of how quantum physicists and mathematicians look at our universe and writes eloquently on the slow and painstaking process of discovering the universe and the mechanics of it through decades of theories, collaboration and backsteps. I especially love how he details the life of himself and his colleagues as they accept each others strength and weaknesses on the subject and push each other to their limits to solve the mysteries that the universe has set at their doorstep. That itself would have probably made it a much more enjoyable book for me. As much as I am grateful for being given the opportunity to appreciate this subject via layman standards, I still feel that the book needs to be expressed a little better. Introductions on some parts of the subject could have been spared as the selling point of this book seems to be the concept of possibilities rather than dry science.I ended this book feeling a little overwhelmed - not sure if it is because of all the unnecessary fluff leading up to String Theory, the anticipation of whether String Theory will live up to its potential of a unified theory, or the fact that Greene had unsuspectingly dumped all his hopes and ideologies into the last few pages of the book to sell his idea of String Theory to the masses. I am all set to read Paul Davies' take on this...just as soon as I recover."
251,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9729716-jason,3," I was given this book as a gift. I typically don't go for the sort of fluffy stuff you'd find in the ""Science"" section at Barnes & Noble, which I figured this would be. I'm much more into mathematics than physics and have devoted most of my academic career to math shit rather than physics shit. So I was already prepared to lose my footing at some point in this book. I have a pretty good grasp on Special Relativity though so I tried to use that as a gauge for how well this dude was describing the more recent stuff beyond the point where my eyes just glazed over. I was happy that this fella got into stuff that lost me. It worries me when I finish a book about a complex or abstract thing and it's not a struggle to understand the material. I wonder whether the writer is just that good or that bad. What I found about this dude is that his wanting to illustrate everything with a metaphor or an analogy wound up confusing the stuff more. I mean, some were cool and I think I gleaned something of the rough shape of an idea. There were other spots where he used 3-4 different metaphors to get across an idea that was already pretty damn abstract. I think at those spots I'd have preferred more elaboration in the form of the notes in the back for ""the expert reader"" or for ""the mathematically inclined"". I basically read this as a starting point. I kept a book for notes as I read and now I have a bunch of pages of leads for further investigation. On a superficial level, I liked this guy's writing style. And the book was somewhat enjoyable while discussing bananas shit. I think there was a chapter or 2 where my reading was as productive as staring at the floor. All in all I don't know who I'd recommend this to. I'm part of a math club and no one there would take it off my hands when I was done because they don't like ""rock star physicists"" who write fluffy science books. But at the same time I can't give it to my mom because it does get into stuff within the first page that would lose her.  I'm not sure if all this explains why I gave it 3 stars, but I felt the need to be lengthy."
252,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458834-mark-laflamme,0,"For me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that started it all. Greene has such a smooth way of easing the novice into the complexities of string theory, the reader feels almost acquainted by the time the science is introduced. Never boring or tedious, Greene deftly guides us through the basics of relativity, explains the importance of frames of reference, and eases us into the almost magical world of gravity and timespace.Like Einstein, Greene presents the science through simple visuals - balls and bicycles, funny cars and cartoon spaceships. The reader will never feel as though he sits in a classroom with a boring professor droning away the afternoon. Instead, Greene describes the physics in a real world way and in doing so, prepares even the most casual student for the truly strange world of strings.String theory appears to be the road to a unified theory, the long sought Theory of Everything that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics. Along the way is a wonderous world of possibilities, with extra dimensions, parallel worlds, and all the while, tiny strings vibrating the symphony of the universe.I read this book with a zeal normally reserved for action novels. Each night was a new lesson and a new glimpse at a different part of the universe. Greene's gift is a clear and friendly writing style that makes this heavy science accessible to those of us without a string of initials at the end of our name.Many physicists came before Greene and others have followed suit. But for me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that opened my eyes to the mind blowing world of strings and the possibilities they present. And I've been hooked on string theory since. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked at a sky full of stars and wondered what it's all about.Mark LaFlamme, author of ""The Pink Room"" "
253,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"Though the first third of this book was amusing and accessible in a childish way, the book as a whole left me with a feeling that my brain is as tiny and crumpled up as a Calabi-Yau space, whichever shape it implies! :(My opinion of this book is similar but not equal to Rob's (though I liked his review), because I didn't think the first third of the book gave me a fairly good understanding of the Einstein's relativity concepts at all. For instance, the rubber membrane - bowling ball analogy was totally misleading for me.I like Marvin's review much more and I think it's clear why. :)Anyway, after this book I felt an awful need to 'unwarp' and 'uncurl' my brain, which made me look for another one - with better explanations of physics concepts ... and I had luck! Hmm, could this be the reason to change my rating to 5 stars?! No, because my lucky find doesn't deal with the string theory.Almost forgot to add: My lucky find was The Perception of Space... and its Measurement plus Galloping with Light - The Special Theory of Relativity by Felix Alba-Juez"
254,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,4,"I read (well, listened to) this book twice and I still don't understand string theory. What gives?!Ok, in all seriousness, this is an enjoyable book to read, but you're not going to come out of it understanding much about string theory. It's just too complicated, which is one of its serious flaws. I have really liked all of Brian Greene's books, but the more I read the less inclined I am to believe in string theory. Maybe if I had read this before Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law by Peter Holt or The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next by Lee Smolin, but those two books really do a good job of refuting this one."
255,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10896364-jehona,5,"Regardless of whether the string theory will ever be useful or not, this book remains useful. String theory might be an approach that doesn't work, but it remains a unique approach to describing the universe and a mathematically beautiful approach at that. Science needs new ways to describe the world time after time. Otherwise it becomes stagnant and fails to expand our understanding of things.Greene does a good job of explaining the basics of it. Many popular science writers tend to oversimplify some things and only mention other things in vague passages. The oversimplified ideas lose half of their meaning and the rest become hard to notice even by people who already understand them. Green wants your full attention. He will not butcher scientific concepts to tell you half-truths you can understand easier. However, he does his best to make things as simple as possible for the reader. Greene is passionate and his writing shows that he cares about it. I think that makes the book even better."
256,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"About the best book on the subject and by a mile. As almost all the other reviewers claim, the initial parts on Newtonian, Relativistic and Quantum science are so beautifully and novelly explained that they should be made mandatory in any study books on the topic. The approach continues as the author jumps to explaining a far more complex super-string theory. And here, the simplistic explanations make the theory look highly speculative, fantastic and without much ground/proof. This is certainly not the case and perhaps that's because far more work is needed not just in completing the theory but grasping its real meaning. This does not remotely lessen the utility or interesting style of the book as I strongly believe that there does not exist - at least so far - any simpler explanations. For anyone interested in cosmology, an absolute must read - ideally multiple times over a few years. Hope the author comes with an update soon."

This is not as accessible as Stephen hawking, but a very well written book none the less. I would say this is for people who've already been introduced to the string theory, I tried reading it the first time without knowing anything about it and found myself staring like a deer in headlights. Once I got more familiar with the concepts (I used youtube videos) I went back to this book and enjoyed myself a lot. I won't pretend I understood everything, but I understood much much more than I did the first time picking it up. "

There was a lot of very nice analogies and explanations - but the opposite is also true. I also don't really feel like I gained all that much from reading this. Like, I still don't know very much about string theory. Overall, I do not think this is a very good book, but the easily readable parts of the book, with their analogies and what not, prevent it from getting bottom score from me. So two stars from here."

At times fascinating at others almost unintelligible (to this newb) this book was anything but 'elegant' and the Universe described even less so. To start with, is anyone not able to do the math really able to understand this this stuff, at all? The number of times Dr. Greene describes the mathematics as extremely difficult or tricky or almost inaccessible (to PhD physicists and mathematicians, some of them Nobel level minds) is enough to make any 'normal' person falter in pretending to get it. Starting with the chapters on String Theory if you are not partially lost then you have either been exposed to these ideas repeatedly or are one or two orders of magnitude smarter than me. Calabai-Yau shapes, M-theory, branes, curled-up dimensions, Heterotic string theory (not very erotic!!), symmetry, super-symmetry, super-gravity, duality, etc. the list of concepts brand new to me goes on and on. That is is not to say he does not make brave efforts to have it make some sense. I do feel that I have some vague notion how of things beyond relativity and quantum mechanics might operate but that is about it. I guess there is a NOVA series and it might be worth to check out at this moment before it is all vaporised by time. And of course this book was written in 1999/2003 and many of the concepts may already have been 'clarified', confirmed or rejected. But overall I'd still recommend this book for an introduction to a very complex subject which asks some really big questions and tries to give some answers."
267,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71115989-liliana,3,"I've been diving into some physics books to try to catch up on scientific knowledge that hasn't been a part of my lexicon for a long time. It hasn't been a straightforward or easy journey, but I'm getting there. Greene's book on String Theory has definitely provided that well-balanced mix between a scientific and detailed book and an accessible and digestible narrative. There were plenty of metaphors and examples throughout that simplified what to me at least was a very complex topic, and I find this is a good foundational book for someone dipping their toes in physics.As a theory, nonetheless, I must stress that this is not an answer to the big question, but a potential ""theory of everything"". It hasn't been proven - in fact, it might have been quite battered down in recent years. Therefore, take everything with a grain of salt and a critical mind that a science book should ultimately stimulate.I will admit, though, that despite the accessible and interesting character of The Elegant Universe, I find myself forgetting quite a lot of what it contained... I suck. I do recommend it because, again, I felt like it provided a lot of the foundation to understand physics in our time, but I am not sure I personally attained a greater understanding. You'll let me know how it works for you."

I would have loved to give this mind-rattling book a full 5 stars, but I simply couldn't when, in the end, there were so many phenomena and consequences I simply could not understand, or ""see,"" particularly at the Planck level where string theory resides and remains controversial. (And, for what it's worth, I used an audiobook to either preview or review, or simply to follow along with, chapters. Erik Davies is a superb, well-prepared narrator, but for the most part, you must have the book, and its many helpful illustrations, in your hand as you go through this material. Unless you're a physicist, you shouldn't be listening to this one on the way to work.) I have two additional Brian Greene books on my science shelf, and I want to get to them, soon, but I have to review some of the more impenetrable parts of The Elegant Universe, as well as entries in its useful glossary, yet again and hope for the voila! lightbulb to flash over my head."
269,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay,3,"To evaluate a review of this book, you must know about the background of the reviewer. I had college physics classes in the early 80s, and have read a number of “modern” pop physics books in the past couple of decades. I understand, in many aspects, the basics of physics pre-string theory. But this new stuff? I understand some of the definitions, but that’s about it. Greene’s book is very good at giving descriptions and examples and analogies for aspects of physics it is trying to explain. And for the older concepts, it does a great job. The newer concepts, string theory and beyond, are explained in the same way, with the same care. I found these concepts more difficult to understand, but I suspect that’s my problem, not the fault of the author. I found the book well organized, and the examples often memorable. However, I didn’t get the level of understanding I was hoping for concerning recent advances in physics. I would consider reading more by this author, but may be looking for a lower grade level."

271,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3590983-andrewp,3,"This book covers most of the basics of Physics theory. Relativity, quantum physics and then string theory. As the authors specialty is string theory about 50% of the book is dedicated to this subject. I admit that there were some concepts that I had a hard time understanding as there is no easy way to make the subject relateable to everyday experiences. Almost all of string theory is math driven and all the discoveries are just the relationships and solutions to incredibly complex math formulas. Even then, many of the ideas come down to interpreting results that are just approximations of the final solutions. Even our most powerful computers are unable to solve these equations completely. For me that's where string theory loses some of it's credibility. With such complex math it's manipulating the numbers until you get the answer you want.As this book was written in 1999 it's inevitably a bit out of date. This was before the existence of the LHC at CERN and some of the experiments in the last decade may have shed more light and indirectly confirmed some string theory concepts. In particular the existence of the superheavy Higgs boson would be evidence of symmetry predicted by string theory.A decent book but only for people really interested in the subject. It's hard going at times so be prepared to read some sections more than once."

It explains a lot and I mean a LOT of things about many theories I've heard of plenty of times and I hadn't had the clue on what they are or how they came to be, chief among them is string theory.I've always been fascinated by physicists and I liked the author's passion for what he does. I found myself drawn into what he's saying even if it was a little challenging to follow sometimes."
273,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,4,"This was a fascinating book about the prospects of string theory and how it may be the ultimate theory that gives us a complete picture of reality. Mathematically speaking, the theory (or rather the hypothesis) seems to be flawless. However, it's never been experimentally proved. The reason is obvious. The strings are so tiny and hard to find if they exist. Even our most powerful atom smashers and super colliders can't produce them. Brian Green says, we need a collider the size of the entire Milky Way Galaxy to create such strings. a more advanced version of the theory is called M-theory and it's an amalgamation of a number of different theories, five to be exact, that are brought together like the arms of a starfish. the problem with the current standard model of particle physics is that it does not unite gravity with other forces. For instance, at the moment of the big bang or at the core of a black hole, Einstein's theory of general relativity (the theory of the large) and quantum mechanics (the theory of the small) can not come together. Each of these theories is perfectly capable of explaining the world in its own domain, however. String theory is thought to be our current hope to reconcile gravity and QM. Strange as it may seem, the mathematics of string theory tells us that there are eleven dimensions (ten dimensions of space and one of time) instead of four. The reason you and I can't see these dimensions is because they're so tiny.According to string theory, if we could examine particles with great precision—a precision many orders of magnitude beyond our present technological capacity—we would find that each is not pointlike, but instead consists of a tiny one-dimensional loop."

275,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110610415-richard-seltzer,5,"A few months ago, when I was reviewing What Remains to be Discovered by John Maddox, I was convinced that the world is ""unknowable.""Now, thanks to The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene, I've done a flip-flop.As Maddox says in his concluding chapter, ""Unwilling or unable to accept the seemingly paradoxical behavior of single particles, such as electrons moving through both of two slits at the same time, for example, he [Albert Einstein] sought instead a set of equations whose elegance and symmetry would command respect, and by which even paradoxical phenomena would be explicable. Einstein's quest was no doubt impelled by his great success with the general theory of relativity (otherwise the theory of gravitation), which first won attention through its elegance. As the world now knows, it was a fruitless search. Quantum phenomena are often wrongly described as paradoxes for no better reason than that they conflict with the expectations of common sense, which themselves spring from human senses that have been honed by natural selection for telling what the macroscopic world is like. It is disconcerting that phenomena on the small scale are at odds with expectation, but there is a wealth of experimental data for which no other explanation is possible. How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" (p. 373)In my review, I noted, ""...a non-scientist, like myself, might well dream the impossible dream of a science that goes beyond science, a means of learning about 'reality' and describing it without depending on experiments.""Remarkably, Greene answers that key question ""How else than by experiment can reality be described?"" While experiment has its limitations, based on what can be measured and how, indirect techniques can give us glimpses of what lies beyond, leading to new hypotheses which can also be verified, with a high degree of confidence, by indirect techniques. The vastness of the cosmos provides clues to the physical structure of matter smaller than quarks (the components of electrons, protons, and other subatomic particles) and provides ways of verifying hypotheses that are beyond the limits of our most advanced laboratories.In Green's book, the universe is ""elegant"" and knowable, in ways man believed before the discoveries of quantum physics. When confronted with new previously unexplained phenomena, he turns to such principles as symmetry, beauty and logic to gain new insight. At the end of the dark tunnel of unknowability, he sees a ""multi-verse"" consisting of many universes; he sees black holes not just as the ugly ends of dying stars, but rather as seeds for other universes; he see a multi-verse in which those universes that have the most black holes are the most likely to survive and spawn new universes in a cosmic evolution scheme, based on survival of the fittest of universes.Just when I was getting used to the idea that the world is unfundamentally unknowable -- that our brains evolved to help us cope with the world of ordinary experience and simply aren't equipped to grasp the bizarre realms of the very small and the very large -- along comes a book that inspires me with renewed faith that we can know -- based on a classical belief in beauty and symmetry -- like a revelation from the 17th or 18th century.This book is convincing, lucid, powerful, mind-expanding.I had been aesthetically wallowing in the concept of unknowability -- convinced that the greatest advances in the 20th century came from acknowledging the limitations of the human mind, proving what cannot be known. That attitude led me to a high appreciation of the works of Stanislaw Lem (see my review at www.seltzerbooks.com/lem.html) and to a whole range of authors, starting with Plato, who emphasized that the value of the pursuit of wisdom was all in the process, that nothing can be known with any certainty. It is good to seek truth; but to believe that you have found truth is bad. The value comes from the seeking itself.In the days of Emerson and Swedenborg, the world and our senses and our ability to understand seemed perfectly suited to one another. Then modern science led us to see a disjunction between the world perceived in ordinary experience and the realm of the extremely small and the realm of the extremely large, both of which were revealed by advanced instruments; and led us to conclude that the limits of our instruments were the limits of our ability to understand. Now it appears that we can leap beyond those limits, arriving at new levels of understanding about the workings of the physical world, both at the sub-particle level and at the cosmic level.I won't attempt to explain Greene's explanations. I don't presume to have grasped it in great enough detail to do it justice. Read the book itself. He writes with the authority of one of the leaders in the field of string theory, but with a clarity and patience and ability to explain complex matters simply that rivals the efforts of the very best popularizers of science.Basically, quarks consist of ""strings"", and the ""vibrations"" of these strings determine their energy, mass, and other characteristics. These vibrations have ""frequency"" or rhythm, which leads me to think of this change of perspective in terms of Yeats: the focus is now on the dance rather than the dancer. The dancers come and go and combine and recombine; come into existance and annihiate and come into existence again in new forms. Yes, there are physical limits to what we can know about the dancer; but our knowledge of the dance can extend far beyond and lead us to important new conclusions.Strangely, such a change in the underlying concepts of physics leads to a new appreciation for old authors. I can't help but think of Frazier, Jung, and Joyce, and their attempts to grasp the flow and rhythm of all of human culture. I think of the multiple natural and mental rhythms of Virginia Woolf's Waves. I think of resonance and harmonics and extraordinary effects that can come from small changes, like a bridge breaking up because of the rhythm of the wind that strikes it; and I think of transistors and how they capitalize on how, in electronics, small changes can result in large effects. I also think of the theme of music and rhythm as an important element in how the mind works and how the world works in Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach. I think of Steven Pinker's books where he gains insight into the workings of the human mind by analyzing how we use language and the rules of grammar, and I wonder if there might be a ""grammar"" or ""rules of choreography"" for the cosmic dance. I may even develop a new appreciation for the art of dance. Greene himself alludes to the ancient notion of the ""music of the spheres.""And wonder of wonders, I feel myself motivated to tackle Heidegger's Being and Time. Contrary to the ruminations of Hamlet, being and not being may not be opposites, or may not be the only alternatives. To become or not to become? To become what from what? There may be a range or field of becoming, a pattern of becoming and interacting in the rhythm of individual human life and of life in aggregate.But don't be sidetracked by my vague speculations. Read the book. It could change your image of yourself and the world you live in."
276,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"Physicists today think they may have discovered what Einstein spent the last decades of his life searching for: the Theory of Everything. String Theory (technically, Superstring Theory) is the idea that everything we see in the world is really the result of one-dimensional strings vibrating in particular patterns. And if the idea of one-dimensional strings is hard for you to wrap your head around, then buckle up before you read this book, because that's the easy part. This book is dense. It's very, very technical. Yes, he promises no math, so we don't actually look at the formulas. But you can't talk about this theory without talking about math. We can't observe things this small with our technology today, so this is basically all math equations that add up nicely. So the book talks about math a lot--including a chapter that centered the differences between physics-based math and academic-Phd math. Unlike Einstein's theories, which were prompted by cool thought experiments, string theory is driven by equations. It's not intuitive at all. But if you can march through that technical data and make your brain stretch into odd shapes, then there are some interesting implications. He's not a Christian, but as a Christian I find some fascinating tidbits. Example: this new theory says all of reality is a result of vibrating strings, that the particular vibration patterns manifest as the bits of matter and energy that we observe. And the Bible says that the universe was formless and void until God spoke."
277,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"At long last I finished reading this! Detailed science books aren't the best bus books. :oSo this book about M-theory etc. was a great read. I very much enjoyed myself reading it and weirdly enough I kept laughing because Greene has a really amusing way of throwing in ridiculous humor while dreaming up weird analogies. I'm sure I wouldn't understand any of the mathematics behind what's described here, and to be honest even the layperson's explanation of the science was a stretch for me sometimes, but I was invested enough sometimes to wonder about what else has progressed on the questions raised in this book since it was written and have looked things up to find out what's newer in the field. Especially when Greene made references to the particle accelerator and what it might find when it was completed. I read some cool stuff about the Higgs Boson and all that. YEAH!Anyway, some notes I took while reading are my best way to share my thoughts.1. I giggled when the author described a scientist's reaction to the discovery of muons: ""Who ordered THAT?""2. His way of explaining the way physical objects change as they go faster was well thought out. Showing how it's happening every day but we can't detect it due to small measurements. Increasing them would make the difference apparent, and if we lived in a world where those measurements were standard, it'd be intuitive and invisible to us again.3. There was a great explanation of how a race car reaches the finish line slower if it travels diagonally, since some of the time is taken away to achieve horizontal travel.4. I find it really interesting that it apparently takes infinite power to push something faster than light because it becomes heavier and heavier as it approaches light speed, and that's why we can't go faster than light.5. I was envisioning warped space like a rubber tarp before the author explained the 3D problem. I am secretly a physicist after all!6. In a discussion of why energy is in lumps (discussing Planck's Constant): ""It's as if nature allows a whole pint of beer or no beer at all."" Haha.7. It's so interesting that observing matter affects it (photos hitting it has an effect), and if we lessened the photons we'd also be less likely to be able to determine its location because of the wave's length. And the electrons become ""frantic"" when they're cornered so they can't have their speed or location determined at the same time.8. The quantum tunneling descriptions were effective! It was cool to learn that electrons can go through stuff because of the space around the particles, but that it is unlikely that it will happen because being lucky enough for that to happen takes a really long time.9. The fifth level of magnification showing quantum froth was really effective. The borrowing and paying back analogy makes sense to explain why over long distances space seems flat, like a dot matrix printer makes images that look smooth.10. The ""Price is Right"" analogy for the large amount of money (energy) leaving a small amount down to the penny was a good way to explain why the specifics are too difficult for existing math to figure out.11. It's true that ""elegance"" and aesthetic doesn't prove a theory. We want theories to be beautiful, but if they're proved wrong we have to reject them, even if it's tempting to assume the elegance means it's accurate. But aesthetic does figure into choices in the research direction for theories.12. Sypersymmetry demands an as yet undetected super-partner particle. They're calling the one for electron ""selectron."" Also, ""squark"" and ""sneutrino."" I laughed.13. I like that they're allowing for the fact that the universe might not have the property of supersymmetry just because it would be mathematically matchy.14. The metaphor of 5 different theories of what happened to Earhart was a great way to explain why 5 slightly different superstring theories makes the idea itself less trustworthy.15. ""Comings and Goings of a Garden Hose."" I laughed. Maybe Kaluza K. Line came up with this epiphany just to combat the drudgery of staring at his neighbor's dot-eye. According to Linestein, there's a way to expand that dimension! 16. These ways of explaining the 10 dimensions (6 of them curled up in larger ones) WAS SO COOL.17. I really love the story of how Greene learned that another paper had duplicated the same findings as his and mirror symmetry in string theory is A THING. With holes that match up in Calabi-Yau shapes. !!!!!!18. I like how Greene explains counting a huge bin of oranges and then having a solution presented with a friend showing up with a box and how many boxes there were when the oranges were delivered. This is an analogy for why doing calculations on a mirror-imaged Calabi-Yau shape is sometimes easier than doing the math on its first one.19. The rivalry between the mathematicians and the physicists--I giggled a lot. I love that they compared their results, got different answers, and later found an error in the math camp's computer code that when fixed yielded the physics answer. After mining math for tools all this time, physics can give back, as it also solved other insurmountable math issues!20. I love the human element to the scientists' research into flop transitions and how Greene and Morrison had to teach each other their disciplines to make progress. They wanted to beat Witten to a discovery.21. I liked the story of working with Aspinwall to determine the shape of the Calabi-Yau shape they're looking for and having to buy him beer to make him come in on Saturday.22. Nobody knows the string coupling constant. Oy.23. Black holes have no ""hair."" They are all the same as each other. Small black holes will act just like large black holes in experiments.24. The revisions Greene and Morrison made after posting their article the first time resulted from having devil's advocate conversations. Haha.25. Hawking and Thorne had a bet with Preskill about whether information can reemerge after a black hole evaporates. Loser buys the winner an encyclopedia!I love learning about all these innovations and I love what dorks scientists are. I admire their imagination and passion, and even though most of the rest of the world will have no idea when they make their breakthroughs, I love all these ideas and I want to know where they've gone since."
278,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12872086-sheeraz,4,"It's a little difficult to review this book because I can't say I understood and retained everything that was presented. With that caveat, I think the author did a great job in explaining some very gnarly and unintuitive concepts to a non-physicist. The use of analogies was spot on and kept the narrative interesting even when my brain grasped at the edges of the ideas presented.The book, as the name suggests, is primarily about the development, current state and future outlook of string theory -- a good contender for a theory that unifies the description of different forces, and hopefully has physical properties of the universe as emergent quantities. The ideas are fascinating, like challenging our notion of distance building on Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The book got me excited about the future of string physics and its bearing on cosmology, and hoping that we will see some potential evidence in the favor of the theory in our lifetimes."
279,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8379733-bookhode,2,"Well, this was disappointing. Brian Greene's book with a pointlessly superlong title, had started off just fine, providing a nice recap of major developments in physics during the last century or so, with the special focus on Einstein's revolutionary theories, and on quantum mechanics that followed. This part was relatively easy to grasp, and despite the author's rather clumsy attempts at metaphor on almost every page, it was also relatively easy to read. The next part, where we reached the conflict between physics of the very small (with its rules based on probability), and physics of the very large (with exact rules), was also ok, as the book kept its flow, and I was able to follow the plot, and at least understand what the problem was all about.But then, we got to the central topic of this book, which is supposed to be the superstring theory, and things just quickly deteriorated in almost every way. The metaphors Greene kept on using became really weird, and were more hurting than helping the reader to cope with the increasingly difficult explanations. Chapters where he talked about his own achievements and discoveries in this field, were presented with overabundance of details, which was rather sharp contrast to the tone used in the rest of this book. And complete lack of any critical thought by the author towards the superstrings theory, made me feel like I was reading some kind of political pamphlet, and not an open-minded work of popular science.To a layman like me, the superstrings theory is bullshit. It's a fantasy about something we cannot see, feel or test in any practical manner. And the fact that the whole thing requires making up some weird multidimensional shapes, and then adjusting our regular mathematics by inventing more and more dimensions just to make the numbers fit, should completely kill its credibility. Of course, I am way out of my league here, and the theory could be quite correct, but the author never really managed to find the language or approach to persuade me to accept his opinion. All he did was to highhandedly wave off any criticism, and basically put the reader in a fait accompli position, where he should either agree with this inevitable new wisdom, or feel stupid. And I would rather feel stupid, than accept bullshit without any chance of verification.Current score: 49/100Current ranking: 37th among my non-fiction books."
280,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12365204-y-l,3,"I have to admit this has been a book I have had a love-hate relationship with for a good few months. I may have had it a lot easier than others as the friend who graciously loaned me this book had preempted me with a few documentary videos of Stephen Hawking and BBC as an introduction to the subject. Nevertheless, the universe is (as always) a long and lengthy subject to grasp and claiming that reading this book was a breeze would do the universe no justice.Thanks to three hours or so of videos, reading the first few chapters of this book was like reading revision notes on a day's worth of lecture. I wouldn't say I made every effort to understand each mathematic equation or even appreciate the technicality of physics and quantum mechanics that make the most part of this book, but I can now truly appreciate how mind-blowing it is to perceive the universe to be so much more than a big black blanket of space. Greene offered a glimpse of how quantum physicists and mathematicians look at our universe and writes eloquently on the slow and painstaking process of discovering the universe and the mechanics of it through decades of theories, collaboration and backsteps. I especially love how he details the life of himself and his colleagues as they accept each others strength and weaknesses on the subject and push each other to their limits to solve the mysteries that the universe has set at their doorstep. That itself would have probably made it a much more enjoyable book for me. As much as I am grateful for being given the opportunity to appreciate this subject via layman standards, I still feel that the book needs to be expressed a little better. Introductions on some parts of the subject could have been spared as the selling point of this book seems to be the concept of possibilities rather than dry science.I ended this book feeling a little overwhelmed - not sure if it is because of all the unnecessary fluff leading up to String Theory, the anticipation of whether String Theory will live up to its potential of a unified theory, or the fact that Greene had unsuspectingly dumped all his hopes and ideologies into the last few pages of the book to sell his idea of String Theory to the masses. I am all set to read Paul Davies' take on this...just as soon as I recover."
281,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9729716-jason,3," I was given this book as a gift. I typically don't go for the sort of fluffy stuff you'd find in the ""Science"" section at Barnes & Noble, which I figured this would be. I'm much more into mathematics than physics and have devoted most of my academic career to math shit rather than physics shit. So I was already prepared to lose my footing at some point in this book. I have a pretty good grasp on Special Relativity though so I tried to use that as a gauge for how well this dude was describing the more recent stuff beyond the point where my eyes just glazed over. I was happy that this fella got into stuff that lost me. It worries me when I finish a book about a complex or abstract thing and it's not a struggle to understand the material. I wonder whether the writer is just that good or that bad. What I found about this dude is that his wanting to illustrate everything with a metaphor or an analogy wound up confusing the stuff more. I mean, some were cool and I think I gleaned something of the rough shape of an idea. There were other spots where he used 3-4 different metaphors to get across an idea that was already pretty damn abstract. I think at those spots I'd have preferred more elaboration in the form of the notes in the back for ""the expert reader"" or for ""the mathematically inclined"". I basically read this as a starting point. I kept a book for notes as I read and now I have a bunch of pages of leads for further investigation. On a superficial level, I liked this guy's writing style. And the book was somewhat enjoyable while discussing bananas shit. I think there was a chapter or 2 where my reading was as productive as staring at the floor. All in all I don't know who I'd recommend this to. I'm part of a math club and no one there would take it off my hands when I was done because they don't like ""rock star physicists"" who write fluffy science books. But at the same time I can't give it to my mom because it does get into stuff within the first page that would lose her.  I'm not sure if all this explains why I gave it 3 stars, but I felt the need to be lengthy."
282,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4458834-mark-laflamme,0,"For me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that started it all. Greene has such a smooth way of easing the novice into the complexities of string theory, the reader feels almost acquainted by the time the science is introduced. Never boring or tedious, Greene deftly guides us through the basics of relativity, explains the importance of frames of reference, and eases us into the almost magical world of gravity and timespace.Like Einstein, Greene presents the science through simple visuals - balls and bicycles, funny cars and cartoon spaceships. The reader will never feel as though he sits in a classroom with a boring professor droning away the afternoon. Instead, Greene describes the physics in a real world way and in doing so, prepares even the most casual student for the truly strange world of strings.String theory appears to be the road to a unified theory, the long sought Theory of Everything that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics. Along the way is a wonderous world of possibilities, with extra dimensions, parallel worlds, and all the while, tiny strings vibrating the symphony of the universe.I read this book with a zeal normally reserved for action novels. Each night was a new lesson and a new glimpse at a different part of the universe. Greene's gift is a clear and friendly writing style that makes this heavy science accessible to those of us without a string of initials at the end of our name.Many physicists came before Greene and others have followed suit. But for me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that opened my eyes to the mind blowing world of strings and the possibilities they present. And I've been hooked on string theory since. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked at a sky full of stars and wondered what it's all about.Mark LaFlamme, author of ""The Pink Room"" "
283,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"Though the first third of this book was amusing and accessible in a childish way, the book as a whole left me with a feeling that my brain is as tiny and crumpled up as a Calabi-Yau space, whichever shape it implies! :(My opinion of this book is similar but not equal to Rob's (though I liked his review), because I didn't think the first third of the book gave me a fairly good understanding of the Einstein's relativity concepts at all. For instance, the rubber membrane - bowling ball analogy was totally misleading for me.I like Marvin's review much more and I think it's clear why. :)Anyway, after this book I felt an awful need to 'unwarp' and 'uncurl' my brain, which made me look for another one - with better explanations of physics concepts ... and I had luck! Hmm, could this be the reason to change my rating to 5 stars?! No, because my lucky find doesn't deal with the string theory.Almost forgot to add: My lucky find was The Perception of Space... and its Measurement plus Galloping with Light - The Special Theory of Relativity by Felix Alba-Juez"
284,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,4,"I read (well, listened to) this book twice and I still don't understand string theory. What gives?!Ok, in all seriousness, this is an enjoyable book to read, but you're not going to come out of it understanding much about string theory. It's just too complicated, which is one of its serious flaws. I have really liked all of Brian Greene's books, but the more I read the less inclined I am to believe in string theory. Maybe if I had read this before Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law by Peter Holt or The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next by Lee Smolin, but those two books really do a good job of refuting this one."

String theory might be an approach that doesn't work, but it remains a unique approach to describing the universe and a mathematically beautiful approach at that. Science needs new ways to describe the world time after time. Otherwise it becomes stagnant and fails to expand our understanding of things.Greene does a good job of explaining the basics of it. Many popular science writers tend to oversimplify some things and only mention other things in vague passages. The oversimplified ideas lose half of their meaning and the rest become hard to notice even by people who already understand them. Green wants your full attention. He will not butcher scientific concepts to tell you half-truths you can understand easier. However, he does his best to make things as simple as possible for the reader. Greene is passionate and his writing shows that he cares about it. I think that makes the book even better."

As almost all the other reviewers claim, the initial parts on Newtonian, Relativistic and Quantum science are so beautifully and novelly explained that they should be made mandatory in any study books on the topic. The approach continues as the author jumps to explaining a far more complex super-string theory. And here, the simplistic explanations make the theory look highly speculative, fantastic and without much ground/proof. This is certainly not the case and perhaps that's because far more work is needed not just in completing the theory but grasping its real meaning. This does not remotely lessen the utility or interesting style of the book as I strongly believe that there does not exist - at least so far - any simpler explanations. For anyone interested in cosmology, an absolute must read - ideally multiple times over a few years. Hope the author comes with an update soon."

This is not as accessible as Stephen hawking, but a very well written book none the less. I would say this is for people who've already been introduced to the string theory, I tried reading it the first time without knowing anything about it and found myself staring like a deer in headlights. Once I got more familiar with the concepts (I used youtube videos) I went back to this book and enjoyed myself a lot. I won't pretend I understood everything, but I understood much much more than I did the first time picking it up. "
288,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65956490-jonas-pihl,2,"The Elegant Universe explains the famous string-theory, and also touches on general relativity and quantum mechanics. I'm not a particularly smart person, but I'd heard that this book was very readable even for people without knowledge on the subject. And parts of the book definitely was. There was a lot of very nice analogies and explanations - but the opposite is also true. I also don't really feel like I gained all that much from reading this. Like, I still don't know very much about string theory. Overall, I do not think this is a very good book, but the easily readable parts of the book, with their analogies and what not, prevent it from getting bottom score from me. So two stars from here."
289,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8223932-q,5,"This book has very high entropy, inundated with heavy information compiled compactly into a book of elegant language (not pretentious like Sense and Sensibility), though the analogies do help a lot. The middle section filled with technical ratiocination was the hardest and slowest to read, especially because I don't consider finishing the book without reading these chapters. People with previous knowledge about math and physics would probably find this easier or even entertaining, instead of taxing, to read. "

It just got too complicated.Kudos to Greene for even attempting to explain the whole thing, and he really does do a great job of it. But beyond a certain point, it's just too hard to grasp.I think I'll have to read this one again someday."

I could say that string theory is maybe not my thing, but honestly I wouldn't know based on this book. It read almost cult-like or like the text of a religious zealot trying to convince someone of the existence of something simply because no one can prove it doesn't.If I was to play a drinking game every time ""string theory"" was written on the page, I'd die an alcoholic long before finishing the book."

And when I say understandable . . . I'm sure I missed some things, but it was very interesting, riveting I would even say. It is worth a second read through for more complete understanding, but enhances my imagination and my love for physics and cosmology. "

296,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41396647-peter-corrigan,3,"Wow. I won't go into much detail for the legitimate fear of sounding like an idiot. At times fascinating at others almost unintelligible (to this newb) this book was anything but 'elegant' and the Universe described even less so. To start with, is anyone not able to do the math really able to understand this this stuff, at all? The number of times Dr. Greene describes the mathematics as extremely difficult or tricky or almost inaccessible (to PhD physicists and mathematicians, some of them Nobel level minds) is enough to make any 'normal' person falter in pretending to get it. Starting with the chapters on String Theory if you are not partially lost then you have either been exposed to these ideas repeatedly or are one or two orders of magnitude smarter than me. Calabai-Yau shapes, M-theory, branes, curled-up dimensions, Heterotic string theory (not very erotic!!), symmetry, super-symmetry, super-gravity, duality, etc. the list of concepts brand new to me goes on and on. That is is not to say he does not make brave efforts to have it make some sense. I do feel that I have some vague notion how of things beyond relativity and quantum mechanics might operate but that is about it. I guess there is a NOVA series and it might be worth to check out at this moment before it is all vaporised by time. And of course this book was written in 1999/2003 and many of the concepts may already have been 'clarified', confirmed or rejected. But overall I'd still recommend this book for an introduction to a very complex subject which asks some really big questions and tries to give some answers."
297,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71115989-liliana,3,"I've been diving into some physics books to try to catch up on scientific knowledge that hasn't been a part of my lexicon for a long time. It hasn't been a straightforward or easy journey, but I'm getting there. Greene's book on String Theory has definitely provided that well-balanced mix between a scientific and detailed book and an accessible and digestible narrative. There were plenty of metaphors and examples throughout that simplified what to me at least was a very complex topic, and I find this is a good foundational book for someone dipping their toes in physics.As a theory, nonetheless, I must stress that this is not an answer to the big question, but a potential ""theory of everything"". It hasn't been proven - in fact, it might have been quite battered down in recent years. Therefore, take everything with a grain of salt and a critical mind that a science book should ultimately stimulate.I will admit, though, that despite the accessible and interesting character of The Elegant Universe, I find myself forgetting quite a lot of what it contained... I suck. I do recommend it because, again, I felt like it provided a lot of the foundation to understand physics in our time, but I am not sure I personally attained a greater understanding. You'll let me know how it works for you."

I would have loved to give this mind-rattling book a full 5 stars, but I simply couldn't when, in the end, there were so many phenomena and consequences I simply could not understand, or ""see,"" particularly at the Planck level where string theory resides and remains controversial. (And, for what it's worth, I used an audiobook to either preview or review, or simply to follow along with, chapters. Erik Davies is a superb, well-prepared narrator, but for the most part, you must have the book, and its many helpful illustrations, in your hand as you go through this material. Unless you're a physicist, you shouldn't be listening to this one on the way to work.) I have two additional Brian Greene books on my science shelf, and I want to get to them, soon, but I have to review some of the more impenetrable parts of The Elegant Universe, as well as entries in its useful glossary, yet again and hope for the voila! lightbulb to flash over my head."
299,039333810X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay,3,"To evaluate a review of this book, you must know about the background of the reviewer. I had college physics classes in the early 80s, and have read a number of “modern” pop physics books in the past couple of decades. I understand, in many aspects, the basics of physics pre-string theory. But this new stuff? I understand some of the definitions, but that’s about it. Greene’s book is very good at giving descriptions and examples and analogies for aspects of physics it is trying to explain. And for the older concepts, it does a great job. The newer concepts, string theory and beyond, are explained in the same way, with the same care. I found these concepts more difficult to understand, but I suspect that’s my problem, not the fault of the author. I found the book well organized, and the examples often memorable. However, I didn’t get the level of understanding I was hoping for concerning recent advances in physics. I would consider reading more by this author, but may be looking for a lower grade level."
