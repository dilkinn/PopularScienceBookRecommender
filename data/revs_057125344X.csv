0,057125344X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3115798-stacy,1,"I made it to page 114 in this book, where the author states as fact that some Victorian women had their ribs surgically removed to enhance their ""wasp waist"" look. This rumor has been repeatedly disproved, and anyone with a passing knowledge of medical history would be aware of the dangers of surgery in this era, prior to antibiotics and with limited painkillers.That the author presents such a thoroughly discredited notion as fact leads me to suspect the validity of the rest of his writing. Combined with the rather superficial level of analysis and reliance on fairly small research studies to back up his various arguments, I decided to spend my time reading a better-researched book on the topic instead."

It is a bit repetitive if you've read a few of his other works - as I have. Still, if you are new to Dunbar, you are in for an interesting dissection of the human psyche in love and hate!"

Possibly because, having read all of Dunbar's previous books, there was a certain amount of repetition and very little to surprise. That said, there was enough new information to hold my interest . . . and here it comes . . . BUT as for the conclusion, well I could have told him that if he'd only asked!"
3,057125344X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The Science of Love by Robin Dunbar""The Science of Love"" is the fascinating science behind the human universal of falling in love. Anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist, Professor Dunbar takes the reader on a journey of an often-ignored part of science that deals with what causes us to feel love. Drawing on extensive research and interesting theories, the book provides an insightful biological story. This excellent 325-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. Now We Are One, 2. Truly, Madly, Deeply, 3. The Monogamous Brain, 4. Through a Glass Darkly, 5, Saving face, 6. By Kith or by Kin, 7. A Cheat by Any Other Name, 8. Sleeping with the Devil, 9. Love and Betrayal Online, and 10. Evolution's Dilemma.Positives:1. A well-written, extensively researched, and accessible book.2. A fascinating topic in the hands of an author with pedigree.3. Finally, a book on love that is science driven. Anthropology, psychology, and biology (evolution).4. Professor Dunbar keeps it real. He makes it clear that our scientific knowledge is limited and is not afraid to say so.5. Defining the elusive term of love. ""Perhaps the best and most successful of the attempts to define romantic relationships in this way is Robert Sternberg's `Triangular Theory of Love'. He argued that romantic relationships can be categorized along three independent dimensions: intimacy, passion and commitment.""6. The book is full of interesting research. On monogamy, ""Similar behaviour is seen in antelope like the klipspringer. This small African antelope, not a lot bigger than a weaned lamb, is intensely monogamous, perhaps one of the most intensely monogamous of all mammal species.""7. Great use of neurobiology and psychology, to explain how romantic attachments differ from other kinds of relationships. ""If oxytocin is about bonding, then its job might simply be to strengthen the bond with whomever you happen to be involved with at the particular moment - baby in the first case, partner in the second. It's a cheap chemical trick to bypass your natural defenses. Rational thought flies out of the window, and instead you get poleaxed whether you want to or not, your better judgment notwithstanding.""8. Laugh it up, it's good for you. ""Laughter turns out to be a very good releaser of endorphins. Laughter seems to produce a more generalised effect that applies rather more equally to everyone who happens to be in the conversation at the time, whereas physical contact is very much a one-on-one thing.""9. The importance of smell, ""smell plays a very important role in sexual arousal for women in a way it doesn't for men. Perhaps as a result, women rate smell as more important in mate choice than men do, whereas men rely much more on visual cues, reflecting the fact that men tend to make up their minds about a prospective mate from further away than women do.""10. What's really behind all that kissing?11. Brains and how it relates to relationships. ""Nonetheless, the bottom line is that both our brains and theirs are designed to manage our relationships. Our brains provide us with a semi-rational computer that complements the purely emotional component arising from the neuroendocrine systems...""12. The six most important traits for a prospective partner are....13. Great facts. ""Humans are unusually fat by primate standards. In normal, healthy, average-weight women, about 20 per cent of body weight is fat, with men closer to 15 per cent, compared to around 3 to 5 per cent in monkeys and apes.""14. The importance of being networked. ""In another study, wounds healed more quickly in patients with harmonious marital relationships than in those with more hostile relationships. Your social circle protects you in some way that we don't really understand.""15. It pains me to tell you this. "" Yet one involves physical injury, and the other is a purely psychological experience. In fact, it turns out that both kinds of pain are processed in the same part of the brain, an area known as the anterior cingulate cortex (or ACC for short), which lies just below the main layers of the cortex in the centre of the brain.""16. One of the most interesting and surprising sections of the book has to do with religious kind of love. "" Andrew Newberg (a neuroscientist) and Eugene d'Aquili (an anthropologist) found that individuals in the state of religious ecstasy produced during meditation have a unique pattern of brain activation. They show greatly reduced levels of activity in the left posterior parietal lobe (in effect, near-complete shutdown) and a great deal of generalised activity in the right hemisphere, usually associated with more unconscious, emotional responses.""17. Virtual love, romantic spamming. "" Romantic spamming is a psychological art, often perpetrated by people who are not especially well educated. But they understand the victims' psychology and weaknesses and can exploit the loopholes in their defences in what is invariably a masterclass in deception.""18. The four most likely reasons pairbonding evolved. Interesting theories.19. The importance of science. "" Understanding the machinery that creates our experiences does not, and cannot, change those experiences for us, if only because we experience them as emotions, not as bits of the brain lighting up. We will continue to fall in love despite knowing exactly which bits of the brain fire up when we do so.""20. Extensive bibliography.Negatives:1. Very few links despite the fact that the book includes an exhaustive bibliography/notes section. In other words, does not take advantage of the Kindle technology. Shame.2. Repetitive.3. Graphs or diagrams would have added value.4. Conveying conclusions with more conviction would have been welcomed.In summary, I really enjoyed this book. The Science of Love lived up to my expectations. The book is full of interesting research backed by science. Professor Dunbar does a wonderful job of explaining the science behind falling in love and makes this book a worthwhile read.

4,057125344X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3967110-tom-roth,3,"Much of the book is quite interesting. However, it is highly dependent on research in social psychology using self assessments. In addition, Dunbar never explores alternative explanations for the results he presents. One example comes to mind: Dunbar mentions that families with more sons were more likely to have a son who turned Catholic priest. Dunbar interprets this as a strategy to maximize ""lineage survival"". However, couldn't it just be that more religious families have more offspring? And that more religious families are also more likely to produce a priest, as a result of their religiousness?The book is full with this kind of rationalizations, and his argumentation is therefore a bit too simple in my opinion."
5,057125344X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59640899-nicole-garcia,3,"I enjoyed the beginning and the end of this book- I almost found those portions to be page turners, but after previously reading other Robin Dunbar works, I began to find the book repatitive and interchangeable. There is far too much reliance on self-assessments and seem to be rooted in gender roles and biases, that we unfortunately still see today.I don't feel as though I had gained very much insight but perhaps more so layered on different opinions than the ones I previously held.

13,057125344X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58530751-james,3,"This was interesting enough but not quite as advertised in my view, more about mate selection and the practicalities of relationships than the 'science of love.' It was on-topic for the first part, and written in a very accessible style it was quite similar to Jared Diamond's effort in its focus on evolutionary psychology, but was keener to veer into speculation rather than sticking to the science.Towards the start Dunbar had argued that the science of love has not been given massive coverage, and the lack of popular science titles certainly backs up his claim. I suspect the reason is that there is not a lot of concrete evidence on the subject, with Dunbar quoting many poems to illustrate points that were hard to articulate, and quickly running out of material related to the title subject. It was interesting that some couples fall in love after having an arranged marriage, but a lot of the evidence quoted related to similar topics, such as attraction and polygamy.Because Dunbar can translate the science into accessible language, the topics were still interesting, but his tone did mean that he made a few remarks that were less solid, such as the non-verified evidence that women talk to each other about the merits of men more often than the other way round. For a serious book it seemed out of character to use inconclusive evidence to make a point, and I wonder why it was included unless Dunbar has an axe to grind with Bechdel. This wasn't a one-off either, and this came as a surprise. Like Diamond, Dunbar uses primates and birds to try and explain the underlying cause for monogamy, and he also talks about the nature of friendship, and the relative strengths of the bonds between family and friends. I'm aware of Dunbar's number and it's clear this is his expertise, but it's still a tangential subject to the title.It may be there just isn't the depth of research to genuinely write about the science of love, and there were many parts of this that were completely new to me. However the monogamy argument was one of many I'd seen in Diamond's book, and the crossover meant that it wasn't as fascinating to me. The main difference was expectation management, as Diamond's book was upfront about its contents."
14,057125344X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56783659-andrew,2,"I found the overwhelming sense that our relationships are driven by biological determinants somewhat depressing. And not only that, that our respective cultural beliefs and conventions give meaning and reinforce certain biological underpinnings. I.e. Tall Rich Men are the Ant's Pants.The nature of scientific analysis of these relationships cannot delve into the magic and sorcery of the chemistry between unique individuals. The book doesn't serve to ignore the nature of individual responses, but it's limitations are nonetheless frustrating. You get the impression after reading it that individuals take a role within a specific cohort of like individuals and then form relationships that are preordained. Which I get is often the case. But still, some misshapen losers fall for other losers and that's a beautiful thing.The insights set out in this book were often interesting. But the book overall struggled, or didn't really attempt to, weave them into a compelling narrative. Perhaps that's the nature of the discoveries described - there is not overriding story to be told. Even if this is the case, it makes for tough reading as it's hard to engage.Having said that, the overview of cross culturally different and historically contextual patterns of relationship development are super interesting. So monogamy isn't necessarily the only healthy way to pursue relationships - it is contingent on our economic and social environment, and our culture beliefs serve to police this mode as the only respectable or desirable way to to be. Okay."

W oparciu o najnowsze interdyscyplinarne badania i odkrycia, w sposób niezwykle przystępny, Robin Dunbar wyjaśnia - między innymi - dlaczego podobają nam się takie a nie inne osoby, jak nawiązujemy przyjaźni, tudzież dlaczego relacje i związki się rozpadają, a także czym uwarunkowana jest monogamia i skąd biorą się w nas skłonności do niewierności. Ponadto masę innych kwestii, które uświadomią Wam, że - mimo, iż każde głębokie uczucie, jakie przeżywacie wydaje się tak niepowtarzalne, osobiste i jedyne w swoim rodzaju - w swych namiętnościach nie jesteśmy ani specjalnie wyjątkowi, ani (często) szczególnie wyrafinowani.

It really gave the books material room to shine.The book goes through the science standing behind the emotions and biological processes of ""love"" (or the complex dance of chemicals that surround the phenomenon we call love). There's really quite a lot involved.The author goes as far as bringing in evolutionary insights as well as psychological and anthropological. There is much to be said, whether its about the pair-bond experiences of animals, or the poetic lullaby of ancients describing their experiences of love. All of this and more has been tied fantastically together by the writing of this book."

Even though many of our decisions and feelings are hard-wired to the patterns we inherited from our ancestors, we are slowly evolving to have more control of ourselves. I didn't give 4 or 5, just because there are many hypotheses stated by the author which are not exactly proved by some large studies. Robin is deducting a lot of his findings from some small surveys he has done throughout his career. Hence, it's less of a scientific/psychological book, but more of a list of opinions written by the person who studies the topic of love, men-women relations etc."
