Krauss“The curvature of spacetime is determined by the distribution of matter and energy in the universe, but this distribution is in turn governed by the curvature of space. It is like the chicken and the egg. Which was there first? Matter acts as the source of curvature, which in turn determines how matter evolves, which in turn alters the curvature, and so on. Indeed, this may be perhaps the most important single aspect of general relativity as far as Star Trek concerned. [...] It is these exotic possibilities [which general relativity does not rule out] that are the grist of Star Trek’s mill.”In “The Physics of Star Trek” Lawrence M. KraussTeleporting an object using entangled particles involves taking it apart, transferring the state of each sub-atomic particle to the receiving end, then building duplicate atoms to assemble a duplicate object using those particles.

Smart reading!

STAR TREK TECHNOBABBLE
You have to give attention to a book when Stephen Hawking does the foreword!In this reference book, Lawrence M. Krauss, the author, engages into the area of topics that Star Trek always has been a pioneer in the media field......the presentation of science-fiction in way that you may very well think that eventually it will be possible......even more in account when you think that some of the ""futuristic"" technololgy presented, not only in the Original Series, but also in the spin-offs, it was already made possible thanks to the inspiration of using in the TV shows, such like automatic doors, touch screens, cell phones, tablets, hyposprays, portable computers, etc......so it's quite advisable to take a moment to study about the more ambitious technologies that they are still to be possible, but with time, resources and intelligence, I am sure that they will be possible too eventually.Therefore, here you can read about the plausibility of advances such like warp engines, transporters, phasers, holodecks, along with the study of space phenomenons that still are in the theorical level, like wormholes, subspace, time travel, etc...Star Trek isn't only a franchise to be beyond its time in areas like social rights but it has been since the beginning a beacon of inspiration of bright new minds to reach out a way to make a reality many of the futuristic gadgets to make them a nowadays common tools.Star Trek designing the future... today!"
2,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"This is a short, enjoyable read for anybody who loves the Star Trek series, as I do. The book describes how most of the concepts and technologies in Star Trek are possible but quite implausible. My favorite chapter was actually the last one, describing the things that are absolutely impossible, that one might call ""bloopers"".Krauss really does get to the heart of each issue related to Star Trek concepts and technologies. But, do not read this book with the intention of learning about physics. You won't learn much, because of the lop-sided approach taken in this book. There is no systematic coverage of topics in physics, leading up to the point where a reader might understand the issues. Instead, the reader is simply plumped down beside the relevant issue, which is then explained at a layman's level. It's sort of like skipping the high school and undergraduate-level physics courses, and trying to learn graduate-level concepts in a junior-high school level class."
3,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/904090-tresuiri,4,"As a physicist and a Star Trek fan I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I never took the fantasy parts of the television show so seriously so I never dwelt on the inconsistencies and glairing errors. The TV shows are a good get away when you want them. That said it doesn’t surprise me in the least that others have taken the series with a bit less forgiveness. Beyond being a Star Trek critic I think this book is an excellent educational resource for the layman about the basic physics involved about the requirements and constraints for real interstellar travel. And, incidentally, a little about the basics of the Stargate series too. It is too bad the author hasn’t updated his book (written in 1995). I found it particularly amusing when he was talking about the CERN particle accelerators, and mentions the new one to be built in Europe (Large Hadron Collider). It is too bad the new particle accelerator has been delayed, but in a weird way, has made for an eerie coincidence in its being ramped up now and my reading this book. "
4,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,3,"This is a ""fun"" book with a sound scientific foundation. The fun is in experiencing the hard work Kraus has done to provide a foundation for the imaginative devices and phenomena that any Trekie knows intimately. If you are looking for something like Astrophysics for Trekies you may be disappointed that you won't be able to pass astrophysics 101 after reading this book. If you are looking for the basic plans for building a transporter, you too will find this book lacking.On the other hand, if you have been wondering how close the writers of Star Trek came to describing a working transporter or was there science behind how the Enterprise tracked the Crystalline Entity after it destroyed a Federation outpost, you will enjoy much of the book. I appreciate Krauss' labor of love and 3.5 stars is what I would give it. "
5,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,5,"Target audience: Mainly, people passionate about the Star Trek universe, and secondarily people passionate about sci-fi and science.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Lawrence Krauss is an American-Canadian theoretical physicist and cosmologist who is a professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University and a former professor at Yale University and Case Western Reserve University. He founded ASU’s Origins Project to investigate fundamental questions about the universe and served as its director until July 2018. He is an advocate of the public understanding of science, of public policy based on sound empirical data, of scientific skepticism and of science education. Krauss, who is an atheist, works to reduce the influence of what he regards as superstition and religious dogma in popular culture.Structure of the book: The book has around 208 pages, which are divided into 10 chapters. About 5 hours of reading.Overview: I like Lawrence Krauss as a scientist and, recently, as an author as well. This book is not my first contact with him. I watched him many times on YouTube and he was mentioned with various occasions on different books I read about science. If you are familiar with Lawrence Krauss, imagine putting him at one place with Stephen Hawking (even though he wrote only the Introduction), and you know you have in front of you a good piece of work.	In essence, this book is about making peace between science and fantasy. At a high level, Krauss answers many scientific questions regarding strictly the Star Trek universe. I’m sure that many people from the old generations watched the Start Trek series and asked themselves questions about what were they watching: Is teleportation possible? When can we use laser beams as weapons? What is actually Warp technology? Can we time-travel through a wormhole? And so on… At a deeper level, however, Krauss answers questions that transcend the Star Trek universe, are part of many/all sci-fi stories, and ultimately are a reflection of our dreams as a group. Even better, the author also teaches us about science, its standing at the moment and how it might be the future, a future that might resemble the one portrayed by the Start Trek universe. Some of the ideas and facts related here might be very familiar if you watched/read Neil deGrasse Tyson’s work (for example).	Is this book obsolete? Maybe. I was a Star Trek fan in the 1990s, but we are now in 2019. I must say that the book brought back many memories, and I often stopped reading and searched on YouTube for various Stat Trek scenes in order to enjoy them once again or simply to refresh my memory. Unfortunately, the book makes references regarding scenes and ideas from the entire Star Trek universe, not just one series; of course there were mentions I did not know. That being said, someone who wants to learn more about science but it has not any idea about Star Trek must expect to encounter passages he cannot or little understand. But that does not make the book less informative from a scientific point of view.	And last but not least, we, reads and fans, have to keep in mind that Star Trek was sci-fi. Krauss dismantles some (quite serious) aspects from this universe, which for some might break the aura of magic surrounding it. Nevertheless, you cannot but admire the genius and imagination behind the creators of Star Trek and how they influenced generations of people and made them dreaming. What is even more interesting is that the influence of sci-fi is not reduced only to dressing like Picard at conventions or naming your dog “La Forge”, but it also influences science itself. When we dream at something, we want to make that something real; we work to materialize our dreams. Moreover, many names in science (entities or mechanisms) are given by seeking inspiration in the sci-fi universe. Quote: The date here is very interesting, because, as far as I can determine, the first Star Trek episode to refer to a black hole, which it called a ""black star,"" was aired in 1967 before Wheeler ever used the term in public.Strong points: The book is quite entertaining, it is written in common language, while scientific terms are reduced to minimum. Moreover, you can only admire the finesse with which the author interweaved facts with fiction. Weak points: In order to fully understand the book, you have to be familiar with the Star Trek universe, which reduced the target audience by quite a lot. Moreover, the Star Trek universe is not what it was used to be, even with the new productions. Even Star Trek fans like me have difficulties understanding/remembering some aspects from this universe now, in 2019."
6,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,2,"Lacking in whimsy and excitement. Half-hazzard. Under-developed.I picked this up randomly in the library, because it looked short and interesting... but eh. It was only slightly worth the effort. His language is too much a mixture of trifling observational comments about Star Trek in general, along with elevated science vocabulary that is not very well explained.Most of the topics he explores barely have anything to do with Star Trek. Chapter eight, for instance, about the Big Bang and evolution and aliens, hardly had any Star Trek references. And as for the specific Star Trek gadgets he does decide to talk about, he's lacking in his selection. What about the replicators, or gravity machines, or communicators, or the computer? He may mention most Star Trek technologies, but he doesn't really launch into explaining even half of them.Instead Krauss seems to get distracted by his favorite physics and cosmology techno-babble, which is not very well written. He tries to translate it for the common layman, but I don't think he does a good job. When he starts listing numbers and new atomic particles I started to tune out. At least his writing style is somewhat loose, and conversational, and evening inviting sometimes. But I would have much rather preferred a deeper, more focused investigation into specific Star Trek technology.It's also a little out of date. This was written around 1999, and he only focuses on the original series, Voyager, and Next Generation, with maybe two references to Deep Space Nine, and nothing about Enterprise or the new relaunch."
7,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,4,"A serious romp through the cosmology of Star Trek?The Physics of Star Trek is a light-hearted, informative, thoroughly entertaining and yet, paradoxically, entirely serious overview of the physics of Star Trek - arguably the longest-running, most popular, and most famous franchise in the history of television and movies. Dr Krauss regales us with essay after essay on what the writers got right, what they got wrong and how their imaginative brilliance sometimes made them look like prescient scientists instead of script writers - black holes, parallel universes, time travel, quantum gravity, phasers, holographic virtual reality, warp drives, teleportation, replication, alien life forms, scanners, tractor beams, antimatter fuel and much, much more.Similar in content and style to Michio Kaku's popular Physics of the Impossible, Krauss' approach to the academic side of the physics involved is just a little more light-hearted and easy going which, of course, will appeal to the less-informed readers of popular science. If you feel up to the challenge, this makes a great prequel and companion read to Michio Kaku's excellent book.For diehard Star Trek fans, Krauss also regales us with a set of laughable physics bloopers and ends with the hint of a sequel to come that he will entitle Physics of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Krauss! Now that's hilarious.Well done, Mr Krauss. Highly recommended. On a side note, I recently had the privilege of hearing Mr Krauss speak live in a physics ""debate"" at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, Ontario. If you ever get the chance to hear, be sure to take the opportunity. His speaking is every bit as entertaining as his writing. (Or is it the other way around?)Paul Weiss"
8,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48728532-xochi,5,"Cool book if you like physics and star trek. It explains a lot of the scientific phenomena often mentioned in the show, as well as some things the show also gets wrong. Some of it is kind of dense to read, but i think the author does his best to explain it in a way that’s easier to understand. "
9,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22028152-sarah-parrish,4,"I don’t believe you have to be a physicist to understand this book, but advanced high school or undergraduate levels would definitely help. I had to refresh my brain of these concepts presented here often, and that can be frustrating and not as accessible as one would hope – but, like, it’s called “Physics of Startrek.” It’s in the title! So, uh, I sucked it up because I love Startrek. It’s ok to feel stupid now and then. That’s how we learn, right?Regardless of my poked and prodded intellectual pride, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Seriously, it was worth all the Wikipedia trips. The last chapter is full of funny impossibilities (contrast to the rest of the book, which tries to mostly argue in favor of the trek world they sometimes sloppily set up) that makes you laugh out loud, and the rest is just as enjoyable. It’s fun to think about the future possibilities of technology, no matter how far the stretch. Pick it up if you’re a fan – it’s not too long either, which is fabulous."
10,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,4,"This book can be very interesting for someone who loves Star Trek as well as Physics. On several occasions episode titles are referenced to, and it could be interesting to pay attention to the matter dealt for that episode while also viewing it. These can also be directly navigated from within the index at the end of the book; I would certainly be doing the same.Section One deals with Inertial Dampers, Tractor Beams, Time Travel, Warp Speeds, Deflector Shields, Wormholes, and other Space-time Stuff. How they are used, its physics and possibilities. If anyone has read a certain couple of books by Michio Kaku (or any Popular Science books on Physics), these ideas would be nothing new. This was precisely the reason why it failed to fascinate me because personally I have already read much about these. For a newbie, it can strike to be extremely appealing, no doubt!Section Two deals with Transporter Beams, Warp Drives, Dilithium Crystals, Matter-Antimatter Engines, and the Holodeck. This was more interesting to read than the earlier, having comprised of subjects and ideas that fascinate me much.With transporter beams, the writer talks about the possibilities of transporting matter as information or as atoms themselves, and how could it be ever done if possible. The details of how ""dematerializing"" would work have been very nicely explained, along-with how much energy is required to perform the teleportation, how that can be attained, and its feasibility in real life. It also talks about the thought of how a presence of a soul has studiously been avoided in Star Trek, but that at the same time the notion of a ""life force"" has been embedded in its themes in various episodes.Its following chapter deals with Matter-Antimatter related problems, why matter should or is relatively lesser than antimatter in the universe, and how it can be produced and used for Warp Drives in real life perhaps in the twenty-third century for Space Travel.Section Three involved a complete chapter dealing with the possibility of various kinds of life in the universe. Its following chapter dealt with a selection of ten exotic physics possibilities including the Dark Matter, Neutron Stars, Cosmic Strings, Anyons, Other Dimensions, Quantum Measurements, Solitons, Quasars, and Neutrinos. The final chapter was based upon selection of ten errors in Star Trek.Upon reading, I felt more of a need to view more of the Trek Episodes, while also reading through a couple of their novels. Personally, I have never viewed a single episode from Deep Space Nine, Voyager and the Enterprise series and would like to do so soon. But their references were truly interesting anyway. Mr. Krauss has explained most of the ideas with good detailing and being as concise as possible for a layman's understanding of the various concepts.A 4-star rating from me, having read much of the topics in other Popular Science books before, the only fascination for me being in context with Star Trek, and a few of its relevant notions."
11,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1510959-william,4,"This is one of my favourite popular science books of all time. Unless of course time travel one day becomes possible and I travel back in time and discover a popular science book I like better before I read this one.Of course, The Physics of Star Trek is not really about Star Trek at all, and I was puzzled to see comments from reviewers who thought it was aimed at sci fi fans, or about what physicists like to watch on TV. Krauss is simply using the much loved (and often lovingly derided) series as a way of taking a fresh look at physics, at what might be possible: a starting point for an engaging and entertaining tour of some aspects of physics and cosmology.Everybody - sci fan or otherwise - knows what a transporter beam does. And nobody can have failed to notice the pace of technological progress - we live in a world where you can send a text message to your phone and have it reply with its spacial coordinates within minutes, using two separate satellite systems. Next year's model will do even more, faster and in 3D. So it's just a matter of time until we get transporter beams, many people think. Talking robots. Warp drive. We'll go to the stars one day.Some are even affronted at the very idea that there may be limits to technological progress - ""Good Technical detail, narrowminded author"" wrote one Amazon UK reviewer, adding ""All through the book he tells of the impossible energy requirements to accomplish many things, such as warpspeed, but they're only impossible according to current knowledge. Go back to BC times and ask their scientists about flying machines: impossible."" Many argue, like creationists, that since science has sometimes been wrong and all knowledge is essentially provisional, how dare some jumped-up eminent professor of physics suggest that we cannot make up any imaginary technology we like the sound of and boldly go anywhere we damn well want in the future, in anti-gravity boots if we feel like it. Anything is possible, given time and steady progress. Dream it and wait.But some of these things are more feasible than others, and there has to be a limit. Science is not magic, it is about discovering how our universe works, and it is constrained by what actually is. What would it actually take to make, say, a transporter beam (and what would it really do?) An interstellar spacecraft? What makes it impossible today and what breakthrough would make it possible in principle? As someone who grew up loving science fiction and fully expecting to be wearing a silver suit and going to work in a hovercar by 2000, I find this fascinating and a great way of approaching physics. We know what the technology of the future should be like, because we grew up with it - so where is it?Krauss attempts to answer some of these questions."
12,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83139-jennifer,3,"One could almost believe this book is contemporary, with the recent Star Trek reboot movie bringing Trek back into popular culture, but alas, this book is from 1995. (It would have been really interesting to see what Krauss would have done with all that black hole sloppiness in J.J. Abram's movie.) But I finally got around to reading this, partially thanks to the TBR pile and Science reading challenges. It's not good to let books sit ignored for so long!Reading this book, as with most popular science books, was an interesting experience. At one time, not so far distant, I had a really good grasp on most of the concepts explored in this book. But really, it's been years since I've thought of most of it in any sort of sustained way. So on one level, it was a light and interesting romp through some of the most profound concepts of physics, using the storytelling of the Trek universe to illustrate the implications. But on another level, I kept getting stuck, demanding my brain return to an earlier condition in which all of this was as native and easy to understand as my frivolous Facebook game strategies are now. But that state is hard to achieve when you're only getting to read the book in two-minute snatches, having to reread as much to remember where you were as you read new in any given sitting.Sigh.This book is dated and yet not. Engaging and easy one moment and mind-twisting the next. It would be very interesting to see an updated edition -- to bring into account the new movie as well as the detectors that Krauss mentions being built as he is writing that now have recently started producing interesting results. Amazon suggests there is a Kindle version revised in 2007, but the movie came out in 2009. I say another edition is due!Interesting, but I will probably be releasing into the wilds of paperbackswap, as I have plenty of other reference physics texts."
13,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209082-benjamin-thomas,4,"This book gives a good overview look at each of the major physics-oriented aspects of the Star Trek universe. Just how likely is it that we will develop transporters, food replicators, or (probably of greatest interest to most of us) holo suites? The answers are here in this well written layman's guide. This book is best suited for the curious, for those who wonder if these things will one day be possible. The authors take us down each path, sometimes determining that it will be possible, someday, and at other times, letting us down easy. I thank the authors for satisfying my curiosity as well as teaching me some theoretical aspects of physics at the same time."
14,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19662137-nonethousand-oberrhein,5,"Sciency FictionRetracing the hundreds of episodes of the TV series, the authors explain the science behind the big and small gizmos (from the warp engine to the tricoder) known to any Star Trek fan. More than a scientific legitimation of the show, this book finds the good excuse to talk and vulgarize hard science in a very accessible and enjoyable way. “Trekker” (or “Trekkie”) knowledge may be useful to get the hidden episode reference, but it is not a strict requirement: any Science enthusiast may find his happiness in reading how fiction may be built on solid scientific basis."
15,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13174155-clay-davis,4,I really enjoyed getting this book for Christmas. I learned a lot about physics and what is possible in the Star Trek universe.

17,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79558694-rod-murphy,5,"So many of us have grown up watching the Enterprise and crews explore planets, fight aliens, and have nail-biting escapes that we never question the science. How would transporters work? Photon torpedoes? How fast is Warp 9? This book examines the physics of space travel and our current state of the art (not even close). But theoretically….Yet as Krauss points out, that does not stop discussion of the latest ‘Trek’ over coffee the following day, such as this:‘ By the same token, not just light but all massless radiation must travel at the speed of light. This means that the many types of beings of “pure energy” encountered by the Enterprise, and later by the Voyager, would have difficulty existing as shown. In the first place, they wouldn’t be able to sit still. Light cannot be slowed down, let alone stopped in empty space. ‘Krauss, Lawrence M.. The Physics of Star Trek (p. 29). Basic Books. Kindle Edition.So, those Zetarians or Dal’Rok would have correspondingly slowed senses of time in comparison to ours. He gives credit to the writers for those concepts they do right, and mentions where our current theories could support such plot devices.This volume must be read by all scify buffs. 5 Stars."
18,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6974552-kent,4,"This is an interesting read. Krauss hits on a lot of the main science from the shows and whether those are plausible at all. It's refreshing to know that a lot of it isn't that far from possibility. Our technology is just not there yet and may not be for a long time, but it's interesting to know how these things may be put into effect. He touches on subjects like transporters, food replicators, warp-drive, anti-matter, phasers, alien life, and more. The only thing about this book is that it is over 20 years old now, so some of the physics theories may be more developed now or maybe even rebuked. Also, much of the book talks about semi-general cosmological ideas, so if you've read other pop-physics books like I have, some I had read many times before. Still worth reading, though."
19,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2607999-kevin,5,"I loved reading this book. It is perfect for a Trekkie who loves and appreciates science! Dr. Krauss (who we were fortunate to hear speak earlier this year) is an excellent writer and communicator of complex science to the casual ""armchair"" scientist. He covers many of the basic foundational technologies portrayed in the universe of Star Trek, and explains them and their implications in terms of proven laws and practices of physics and the the scientific method. A great read for even the casual Trekkie who loves science. I highly recommend this book! I am looking forward to reading Dr. Krauss's newest book ""The Greatest Story Ever Told--So Far: Why Are We Here?"" which my daughter got signed by him when we heard him speak. He is a great communicator and teacher."

But how does “Star Trek” stack up against the real universe? As readers explore the concepts, they will discover what science the creators of the series got right . . . and not so right . . . in the “Star Trek” future. Written by a theoretical physicist, readers will find much to ponder in the discussion of physics as it is known today and the suggestions of what it might one day become.For fans of the series as well as for those with an interest in physics, this is a voyage filled with fascination.Recommended."

Or require a black hole's worth of matter and energy to implement. Most interesting are perhaps the things one takes for granted: such as the crew not being crushed to strawberry jam when the Enterprise accelerates; or being able to scan someone on the planet surface with sufficient resolution to beam them back up again - as if sending them down in the first place were not hard enough. It also brings home just how big the galaxy is, when you discover how long the Enterprise, even at warp 9, would actually take to reach the galactic centre."

It's a deep read, and delves into, well, physics, and is not to be consumed in one sitting or even one weekend by the average human. Heavy in details, formulas, and facts, it's sure to change your perspective on which ever franchise you like - from TOS, TNG, VOY, ENT, or even DS9. "

The book took complicated physic problems and made them easy to understand in relation to how the Star Trek series uses them. The book also gave what it would take for things to happen the way that they did in the series/movies and how that plays into both the writing of the series and the way that the movies/series showed things in a certain order. If you are ""sciency"" and like to learn how the things in the show are done and if they were realistic then read this book. "
24,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732395-sarah,5,"This was great- Krauss weaves in a ton of information about real-world physics by discussing the fictional world of Star Trek- a must for any lover of both ST and physics! My 6 year old and I opened this up to discuss a bunch of things (he's been into black holes and wormholes lately) and it really interested him. Hm, maybe I can get him to be a Trekkie! Here's hoping! Oh, also I understand neutrinos now a tiny bit? And I had no clue what they were before, so...it's well-written for a physics novice reader!"

Krauss explains the physics of Star Trek in a way that people with little familiarity with physics can easily understand. He also incorporates that classic Star Trek spirit of wonder as he explains and speculates. The Physics of Star Trek was an engaging read and I highly suggest it if you have the slightest interest in physics or Star Trek :)"

Krauss provides clear and understandable evidence for both and that balanced portrayal made reading this book a pleasure for a non-physicist, Trek fan. I liked his tone and style of writing as well. Concepts were easy to grasp and it was fun to read."

I also like Lawrence Krauss, he's very good as a scientific communicator, so all was well with this, and this was done 20 years ago, so the way LC talks about data seems so naive and outdated that it might as well have been written 40 years ago."

I have really only seen the original series so I will definitely be reading this again after checking out the other installments of the show since a lot of the discussion is from the later series. Having some background in Physics helps, but is not needed."
30,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39525522-g-flood,3,"As someone who is a fan of the Star Trek series, I found this book at times amusing, mesmerizing but most often, completely dazed & confused by the physics lingo. I think I will leave the physics to the amazing physicists and continue my enjoyment of the Star Trek series and movies in oblivious bliss."
31,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27709171-steven,4,"This was a slightly more technical read than I had expected. I appreciate the author’s attempt to explain the physics errors in Star Trek while still being respectful of the franchise. I learned a lot from this read and greatly enjoyed the author’s perspective from the field of physics. I would recommend this read to any Star Trek fan, just have an open mind. "
32,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971031-katie,3,"This book was easier to read as it went on; the first few chapters were a bit of a slog. Perhaps they would be easier for someone more versed in the sciences but I'm afraid for me it is an interesting subject but not one of my strong suits past the basics. I enjoyed the last two chapters which focused on specific examples in quickfire style, I feel those chapters worked best."
33,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49158948-eugenio,4,"3.5 starsHard book to rate, but I rounded up since it does capture a sense of human achievement that Star Trek is all about. It does get very technical at times but the book isn't called ""Trek Physics for Dummies"""
34,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23237119-al-eden,3,"A bit dated, just because technology moves so fast these days. Although it is kind of fun to try to spot the areas where it is out of date and try to bring it forward to today yourself. Still an interesting book."
35,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80174801-daniel-pokr-vka,5,"Absolutely amazing how Lawrence combines his knowledge of physics with my favourite sci-fi TV series world. Also - one does (re-)learn a lot by reading this book. About universe, about special relativity .. "
36,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1583456-a-l,5,"Fantastic! But if you don't want to read a whole book on the physics of Star Trek, find a copy of this book just to read the chapter about the (un)reality and (im)possibility of transporters. #mindblown "
37,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36182728-rob,3,"I did like this book, and find that the physics is defiantly over my head, but I did get the point. I wish perhaps that some of the tech we have now even better that on Star Trek might also have been included. However, This was a good read."
38,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27660154-zoey,3,"This is a fun book if you love Star Trek and want to know how everything goes. The author has a funny, relaxed style which is really helpful considering the complex stuff discussed. Definitely an interesting and worthwhile read if you have the time."
39,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5840288-julie,4,Reading this book only brings up one question: Did Star Trek name things after Science or did Science name things after Start Trek? hmmmmm.....
40,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17410641-david,4,"I read it about ten years ago, but I'm still thinking about it. Especially the philosophical conundrums of the transporter."
41,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31781410-ole-damgaard,4,"This book takes a laymans-understandable look at physics, using various Star Trek examples as a frame for exploring how things work around us. Brilliant!"
42,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27383450-katerina,4,Super interesting and eye-opening.
43,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88975748-andrewkoldwell,5,"Read this in high school. It really gave me a way to apply physics to something I knew in Star Trek. Well written and thorough, but not too heavy."
44,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60568745-adina,5,"Exactly what it says on the tin. Enjoyable for a star trek and physics fan alike. The author has a congenial, entertaining tone that kept me turning pages. A fun read!"
45,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4644695-des,3,Not as interesting as it sounds.

47,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17469150-jeremy-carter,4,"I was interested in reading this book to see real-world applications of ""fictional"" physics. There were times I was lost. Overall though s good read."
48,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43094575-carolyn-page,3,"I'm as much of a Trekkie as the next person, probably a little more, so this was so very fun to read. "
49,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89827300-frank-singer,5,Krauss is great. Fun read.

51,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14459488-kenny-parnell,4,A fun listen.
52,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23276045-mel,4,"This is a fun book about physics and Star Trek and the interrelation, even if even my only mildly physics-saavy self can recognize that it's a bit dated, being from the mid-90s."
53,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106904407-kyla,5,Closer to 4.5/5.
54,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47780468-jack-sheppard,3,Nice fun book. Updated edition of course very quickly out-of-date. Nice ways of thinking about some things and a nice reminder of previous trips through the Star Trek universe. 
55,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119547679-j-p-kobel,1,Krauss does a terrible job of trying to appear intelligent. 
56,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,3,Pretty good balance of science and silliness.
57,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32093751-bjarne-siewertsen,4,You have to be a trekkie - but then it is a fun read

59,0060977108,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856247-david-sarkies,2,"A speculative text on Star Trek physics18 June 2010	This book is a complete and utter waste of time and space. While I like physics and while I enjoyed reading this book when it was given to me as a birthday present, when I think about it, and in fact the more I think about it, the more pointless it becomes. Granted, science fiction has been a vehicle for technological development in the past, and it still works in that way (just look at Gibson's prediction of the internet, or even the mobile phone). However, much of the ideas in Star Trek stretch from pure fantasy to downright idealistic. Star Trek is little more than a television franchise, or a cash cow that generates income simply through a name.	One thing Star Trek does is identify a problem that the laws of physics and then creates a device that will solve that problem. Okay, we do that today, but we require a lot more than a writer's pen to solve the problem of faster than light travel. Star Trek creates the warp engine, but the problem is that the faster one gets to light speed, the heavier one becomes, and of course when one becomes heavier, the amount of energy required to increase velocity increases. Thus, to get to light speed one needs an infinite amount of energy to push an object of infinite weight. Even then, compared to the distances between stars, light speed is pretty slow.	I could go through and look at all of the items the author explores, and he even has a chapter of alien life. The belief is that if life can evolve on Earth then life can evolve elsewhere, we just have to find it. Do we really want to find it? Well, all of the geeks do, but if this extra-terrestrial life turns out to be more like the predator and the alien as opposed to the Vulcan, then we are all in trouble.	The final thing that I must touch on when evaluating any Star Trek literature is the concept of a human utopia. To the Christian, this is not going to happen this side of the second coming. While we, while on Earth, can attempt to make life here as tolerable as possible for as many as possible, we are never going to get to that state, so we wait in longing for Christ to return. To the material secularist, it is possible, and usually the main thing holding us back from reaching that utopic state is religion.	I must disagree with that because all we need to do is to look at communist Russia to see what happens when one takes God out of the picture and puts man in his place. I'm am not going to mention Nazi Germany simply because the Nazi's weren't athiests."
