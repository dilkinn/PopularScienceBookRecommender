0,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Over millions of years, a few construction errors can accumulate. Especially when you first get up with difficulty and learn to walk on two legs and then suddenly are just sitting around all day.In the case of a machine, you need a lot of test models, prototypes and failed attempts until perfect functioning. And even then, an unknown factor in practice can lead to unexpected errors and chain reactions. In a real physical machine like a motor, this is still understandable, in software, however, almost too complex. Understanding how a decades-old program with thousands of programmers created a hierarchical family tree is very difficult to impossible.The same problem arises with the human source code. The physical manifestation of a design flaw such as an appendectomy, finding intervertebral discs, retina, superfluous bones and muscles, cecum, autoimmune diseases, paranasal sinuses, knees, breathing and eating through the same tube, poor nutritional utilization, etc., is simple. The evolutionary history of mammals in general and the ability to conduct direct research greatly facilitate this endeavor. But finding out how the not so obvious flaws originated in is a mammoth task.Not only the body but also the DNA is full of bugs, burdens, glitches and deactivated dormant gene sequences. As rare hereditary diseases, malformations, etc. show, the replication motor can start again at any time and it will get scary and interesting when epigenetic factors that are created by millions of environmental toxins or targeted gene manipulation begin forming new variations. Then the random errors become deliberate super mutations with unpredictable effects.The development of human physical defects is unique because we cause them through a complex interaction with the environment itself. No other animal has empowered itself to play such a massive role in its physique and both the physical steps to ""incarnation"" and the dark sides of civilization have set in motion two separate evolutions.Take for instance the upright walk with all his aches and pains and now, for just 50 to 75 years, the evolutionarily very short established, permanent sitting or moving very less. It is unimaginable how the environments of space and other planets will help evolving new adaptations and the final consequences in a million or billion years would be interesting and hopefully funny.The even bigger experiment is the epigenetic adaptation to new technologies. How the use of various input devices will affect the body and mind, hands and eyes and the brain. And subsequently, AR, VR, medicine and biological-digital-technological fusion in humans, be it fixed parts or updates that have to be renewed with doses of whatever. There is no lack of thought experiments and hypotheses and in the best case, the contentious breaking of the skin barrier is not necessary. This merging of man and machine into cyborgs as a step to immortality. It just takes time for nature to adapt to the new circumstances and integrated new, painful and entertaining mistakes in future designs.Extrapolating this development to millions of years into the future, pretty much all manifestations could come real. On other planets, on space stations or only in virtual worlds, different subspecies of humans would develop. It could reach the point where the original shape is no longer recognizable when looking at the own great-grandchild because it joined a group of extreme cyborgs, gene enhancers, hybrid breeders, etc.Nature has always been dealing with finding a compromise between optimization and sudden, new developments in the gene pool, climate change, etc. Therefore, evolution always tries to strike a balance between harm and benefit. Without mutation, there is no cancer and no progression. With too much mutation, the population dies of too frequent, fatal mistakes and illnesses. Save stagnation or insecure evolution.Just the use of the smartphone and computers have already left their mark on people's brains and even bodies and these will evolve into genetic adaptations to the new conditions to breed new, unique humans with unimaginable capabilities. A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigene...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_e...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"
1,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Having consumed many works on evolution and human biology, I was shocked at just how much I learned from this delightful book. In Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes, biology professor Nathan H. Lents presents a quick, conversational and nutrient-dense look at the various problems our bodies have inherited from of our evolutionary past. Even in discussions of features I knew about, such as our backwards-installed eyeballs and pointlessly-long-and-looping-through-the-heart laryngeal nerve, Lents manages to present new information or frame it with new insights. Our bodies are amazing, for sure... but they are riddled with many absurd and self-destructive flaws.One question that I had long pondered but never pursued was how animals can live on much simpler diets than we require. Cows can build their entire bodies by eating grass... why can't we? Why do we need so many ""essential"" nutrients from a wide variety of sources? As it turns out, most other mammals still have the genes to synthesize their own vitamin C, B vitamins, fatty acids and amino acids; not to mention absorption of nutrients like calcium and iron... whereas our varied diets allowed evolution to ignore the loss of our ability to do the same. The genes are still there, sitting dormant and error-ridden in our genome, and we can identify them. Ironically, we do produce B12 (a vitamin vegans must supplement because it typically comes from animal sources), but the bacteria who do so are in our lower intestine, and B12 is only ingested in the small intestine. So, we build up sufficient levels of B12, only to get rid of them as waste material.Speaking of dormant genes, our genome is riddled with copies of ancient viruses that inserted themselves at some point in our evolutionary past (we can identify roughly when based on which other animals have the same insertions). One in particular, called Alu, makes up 10 percent of our genome. Our coccyx, the vestige of a tail, serves no meaningful purpose. Our two-bone shins and fore-arms are needlessly complex. We lose our ability to absorb calcium as we age. The ACL ligaments in our knees are small and weak and tear easily, ending many sports careers. The conception process is needlessly wasteful (some half of pregnancies end in natural abortion, and ovaries aren't even connected to the fallopian tubes). The birthing process is also far more difficult and dangerous than it is for our primate cousins. Our immune systems can be triggered to attack us, deciding that the non-existent danger of a peanut or other allergen is sufficient cause to kill the entire body. The section on auto-immune diseases is particularly frustrating: sometimes the body just starts running rampant and treating itself as an enemy. Cancer is a similar perversion of what is in other contexts a healthy process (cell division).There is much more here, and all of it is brilliantly and engagingly explained. I recommend this for everyone, as an important insight into our bodies and how they work (and don't), and how the indifferent process of evolution got us here. It's a great collection of interesting facts about the body (some depressing, but all fascinating) that you'll want to share with anyone sitting near you."
2,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"(3.5) Lents is a biology professor at John Jay College, City University of New York, and in this, his second book, he explores the ways in which the human body is flawed. These errors come in three categories: adaptations to the way the world was for early humans (to take advantage of once-scarce nutrients, we gain weight quickly – but lose it only with difficulty); incomplete adaptations (our knees are still not fit for upright walking); and the basic limitations of our evolution (inefficient systems such as the throat handling both breath and food, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve being three times longer than necessary because it loops around the aorta). Consider that myopia rates are 30% or higher, the retina faces backward, sinuses drain upwards, there are 100+ autoimmune diseases, we have redundant bones in our wrist and ankle, and we can’t produce most of the vitamins we need. Put simply, we’re not a designer’s ideal. And yet this all makes a lot of sense for an evolved species.My favorite chapter was on the inefficiencies of human reproduction compared to that of other mammals. Infertility and miscarriage rates are notably high, and gestation is shorter than it really needs to be: because otherwise their heads would get too big to pass through the birth canal, all babies are effectively born premature, so are helpless for much longer than other newborn mammals. I also especially liked the short section on cancer, which would eventually get us all if we only lived long enough. As it is, “evolution has struck an uneasy balance with cancer. Mutations cause cancer, which kills individuals, but it also brings diversity and innovation, which is good for the population.”Lents writes in a good conversational style and usually avoids oversimplifying the science. In places his book reminded me of Kathryn Schulz’s Being Wrong and Mark O’Connell’s To Be a Machine. It’s a wry and gentle treatment of human weakness; the content never turns depressing or bitter. Recommended for all curious readers of popular science.Favorite lines:“While lithopedions [“stone babies”] and abdominal pregnancies are quite rare, they are also 100 percent the result of poor design. Any reasonable plumber would have attached the fallopian tube to the ovary, thereby preventing tragic and often fatal mishaps like these.”“to call our immune system perfectly designed would be equally inaccurate. There are millions of people who once happily walked this planet only to meet their demise because their bodies simply self-sabotaged. When bodies fight themselves, there can be no winner.”Originally published on my blog, Bookish Beck."
3,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3056629-jenn-jr,3,"I really enjoyed the first half to two thirds of this book -- it was a straight forward, conversational and highly accessible discussion of quirks of evolution such as human vision, overly long nerves, and sinuses that drain the wrong way -- along with explanations of how they came to be and the advantages or disadvantages. It's comprehensive enough and covers comparisons to other species (mammal and non) -- and extremely interesting.I especially enjoyed the chapter on diet and nutrition -- this is one of the most clear discussions around micronutrients I have read. I could actually hear this in my head like it was a seminar or an interview on ""Fresh Air."" The chapter on DNA and then disease were also interesting -- with particular focus on how autoimmune diseases are puzzling (esp lupus). Even the chapter on reproduction being a rather flawed process was interesting.Then, the book makes a bit of a switch into neuroscience and cognition -- talking about how humans carry certain errors with them (like gambler's fallacy) and the advantages of young people being reckless. Near the end -- the author turns more to a bit of an existential and philosophical discussion around the impending demise of humanity due to our selfishness and potential solutions. I can't help but feel that this is at once sincere but also a reaction to the usual charge of social science books not providing enough of a solution to the issues they raise. It's sort of general and helpful/not-helpful and doesn't really fit as a conclusion to the first 2/3 of the book: ""Our population growth, environmental destruction, and poor stewardship of natural resources threaten the prosperity that we have sought to create for ourselves.""I hope future editions have a more relevant conclusion or summary -- this conclusion seemed a bit disconnected."
4,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,4,"I came across this on NetGalley but as it had already been published I decided to purchase a copy for myself as I haven't bought a medical text for a few months. I am always drawn to books with a medical element to them and this sounded as though it would be incredibly interesting with the added benefit of learning more about myself.This intriguing non-fiction book details the design flaws us humans have and their advantages and disadvantages too. Sometimes purely fact driven writing can come across as both tedious and heavy but I didn't feel this at all here. I have mentioned before that I read quite a few books that I can learn something from and this fits perfectly into that category. Nathan H. Lents has ensured that the writing is straightforward and easy to follow so that it can be read and understood by those who are not part of the medical profession, and has excelled in penning a thoroughly engaging narrative for readers to appreciate.Highly recommended to everyone! I mean, who doesn't want to learn more about their own body and its evolution?"
5,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"A very interesting book that was well written & narrated. It's not dry at all considering the amount of data it contains, but it certainly isn't definitive just popular science which is enough for me. It gave me a lot of food for thought. I highly recommend it.Table of ContentsIntroduction: Behold the Blunders of Nature:  Evolution is a series of small, random changes that can slowly create some incredibly complex structures, but there are a lot of strange things left over. For instance, our retina points inward. That makes it fairly easy to detach, requires more light than it should, & gives us a blind spot. For all its similarity in appearance, the eyes of cephalopods such as the squid, managed to evolve with it right side out. The strange, long path left laryngeal nerve makes no sense except in context with how it evolved from fish. The superior laryngeal nerve does take the short route, though. Weird. Definitely no intelligence in that design. Pointless Bones and Other Anatomical Errors:  Wrists & ankles have a lot more bones than make sense, unless evolution is taken into account. Similarly, eating & breathing through the same tube, the trachea, makes no sense. He describes how it could be engineered better & is on some animals. It was 'good enough' for us, so has stuck around, though.Our Needy Diet:  We've lost the ability to make 9 of the 20 amino acids that are essential for life plus a host of other micronutrients. We can't even make our own vitamin C which most other animals can due to the GULO gene breaking. How & why did such a mutation not die off? It causes scurvy & was a bad mutation once we'd moved out of an area where we had access to foods with vitamin C, but until then, it didn't bother anyone. He lists a host of other such defects, all of which are interesting & are really important to people with odd diets like vegans. In our modern, First World society, they can buy supplements, but that's not the case for those in poor areas nor was it for most of our history. Some examples make me wonder how we survived.Junk in the Genome:  His explanations were pretty basic. For instance, he didn't mention that a lot of the 'junk' was noncoding DNA that actually does perform a function, controlling how coding genes are expressed, but he did get into some pretty wild territory with just how much baggage we've picked up & how often there are issues.Homo sterilis:  I had no idea how bad we were at reproducing ourselves. It's tough to swallow in this overcrowded world, but he makes a good case for it. Sperm can only turn right in ever widening circles & it takes something like 200 million of them for one to find the egg. Wow! I'd like everyone who thinks that life starts at conception to read this. If it does & God is involved then it is the biggest & best abortionist of all.Why God Invented Doctors:  As good as we are at fixing ourselves, we have a lot of issues to overcome, some lost genetically. Others are just due to poor evolution, such as our sinuses. He covered some before, but hits them from a new angle this time & adds in a bunch more.A Species of Suckers:  Our brains are a real mess. He does a good job hitting the main ones. I recommend Brain Bugs: How the Brain's Flaws Shape Our Lives for an even better look at some of these issues. Epilogue: The Future of Humanity:  He has some interesting thoughts & questions. Has humanity stopped evolving naturally? One was pretty awful, though. He said the current thinking on the Drake Equation shows there should be 75 million alien species around, so where are they? Even old estimates suggest there were about 200 billion galaxies & a few years ago that went up to 2 trillion. There are likely 100 billion planets just in the Milky Way. Why would we even think we could contact another civilization over those distances even if they lasted a million years each? He wonders if we'll last another century, at least at our present level of civilization. We might well knock ourselves back to the Stone Age, though. Depressing."
6,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55422230-amanja,4,"Human Errors is a nonfiction science book all about the mistakes of the human body and brain. It's a book about anatomy, psychology, biological science, and evolutionary history.Lents goes into detail about not just what is wrong with us but the likely evolutionary path that led to it. He explains the why, which is the best part about this book. He gives a lineage instead of just a list.For instance: humans are the only animals on Earth that don't produce their own vitamic C and require it through their diets.Human sperm cells can't turn left and therefore can take up to 3 days to travel what could be done in under an hour.Unlike humans, migrating birds can see magnetic fields and look directly into the sun without damaging their eyes.The book is full of fun tidbits of information like this but with the whole scientific backing of explanation that helps you actually remember it. This book could easily be longer but Lents kept it concise. Personally, I would've liked more of the physiological mistakes and fewer of the cognitive bias mistakes but that's just because I've read other books that go into much more detail of the latter and started to get bored toward the end of this book. An interesting note about the style of the book is that it's one of the few I've seen that has opted to use female pronouns as the default instead of the traditional male ones. Just wanted to point out that it did not go unnoticed and I appreciate shaking up the patriarchy. Overall this book was a nice science nonfiction book that actually taught me some new things and never once came off as condescending. It was refreshing to read a science book that knows its audience and teaches instead of dumbing down or swinging the other direction into dense technical jargon.for more reviews and content please visit my new blog amanjareads.com"

It was a page-turner, and a nonfiction book at that!Really entertaining, this book has a great conversational style that I think all biology teachers should strive for. It made learning 'fun'! But seriously, the amount of flaws in the human body is astounding.Crappy Vitamin C production? Why are there so many bones in your wrists? Why are our eyes weird?There's also some psychology sprinkled in there too because the brain is also weird.Really enjoyed this book!4.37 / 5 "
8,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28627991-gina,4,"If you believe human beings are the most evolved, perfect beings on Earth, this book will definitely make you think otherwise.The human being, it turns out, has evolved into a very imperfect living being. This book delves into the ways in which our bodies, while amazing and complicated, have some built-in weaknesses.Have you ever wondered why we tend to get head colds while other beings seem immune to them, or at least, get the viruses much less often? Why do we have such problems with our joints? Why do a majority of people need vision correction? Why do we still carry the DNA of ancient diseases in our cells?This book was very interesting and well-written and researched."
9,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31506695-david-wineberg,4,"To Err is HumanHuman Errors is a page-turner of a biology book. Nathan Lents focuses on mistakes, redundancies and weaknesses that make life a constant gamble for humans. From genetic code destruction to pointless bones, overtaxed muscles, meandering nerves and backward designs, the book combines a million years’ worth of wrong choices, errors, flukes and plain bad luck that is the human body. At several points, Lents ventures that no engineer would design such and such a system this way – it’s just wasteful, inefficient or crazy.The human body is the sum of all its travels through time. It has vestiges of other forms it took, corrupted DNA that was not immediately fatal (so it was able to be passed on) and evolutionary benefits that have outlived their usefulness. The result is a being that needs an outsized amount of care and feeding, technology and medicine. We are the only animal with this need. -Our sinus cavity drainage (from the top!) gives humans headcolds far more often than any other animal.-Our backs are optimized for four-legged living.-Human eyeballs are built backwards, causing a large blindspot in each eye that is more or less overcome by having two eyes and therefore stereo-vision. Cephalopods got our kind of eye right, among the two dozen totally different kinds of eyes, each adapted to the bearers’ environment.-Our procreation equipment is so inefficient, both mother and child are at risk of death from the act of birth, unlike any other primates. Lents says primates will continue to care for other offspring while giving birth, something unimaginable for women. Cows often barely notice they are giving birth.-There is an entire a la carte menu of autoimmune diseases unique to humans, and often only to women, for which we have no cures and no idea why they occur. Our own cells attack our systems until they kill us. Another unique feature of humans.One recurring theme is food. We are both blessed and cursed with the need for a variety of food. Most animals eat the same thing day in and day out all their lives, but have finely balanced metabolisms, because they produce whatever they need internally. Humans need constant interventions with different vitamins, minerals and meds. That humans could subsist and thrive on multiple foods started out as a giant Darwinian advantage. Now that we actually need that variety for a balanced diet, it is a liability. We are the only animal with this need, too. Our DNA is so corrupted we now require this variety and intervention – or die.Our failing DNA gets its own chapter. The GULO gene in humans is the stub of something that was once very useful. GULO produces vitamin C – just not in humans. Somewhere along the way, an ape had a gene mutation that disabled GULO. It must have lived in an environment filled with citrus, because it didn’t die off, but produced offspring that also had the gene disabled. As animals dispersed from those food sources, scurvy killed off those who had no access to citrus. Today, we have vitamin supplements and imported fruit all year. Lents says our bodies will simply never be able to accidentally repair and restore what’s left of GULO to active duty. There are now too many missing factors for such a complex mutation to occur.“You cannot have sexual reproductions, DNA and cellular life without also having cancer,” Lents says. It is a natural bug in our design. He says there is a 100% chance of developing cancer if something else doesn’t kill you first, because “cell division is dangerous game” and innumerable mutations can trigger uncontrollable tumors.As he says in the epilogue: “It’s survival of the fittest, not the perfect.”David Wineberg"
10,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,5,"Next time if a creationist or intelligent design proponent or a religious person who believes god created humans comes and tells me how perfect human body is, I exactly know what needs to be presented or more appropriately slammed on their faces. This book is precisely discussing most of the major flaws in the human body which is sometimes considered as the benchmark for excellency. The author indeed starts with the acknowledgement that our body is beautifully crafted and adapted for the best but yet it is not perfect as one would assume it to be. He starts with the complex structure of eye and covers the various lacuanes in the design of the organ. The first chapter addresses about the anatomical absurdities which no engineer would ever design. The discussion ranges from the pointless bones to uneven nerve connections to absurd supply routes. The mention of Achilles and ligament tears with respect to flawed design really explains the recurrence of these injuries in sports arena so frequently.The second chapter on the human diet is extremely insightful and informative. The need for obtaining vitamins and minerals and many other essentials is explained through evolutionary point of view. Also one would be amazed to know that lot of problems with respect to diet is unique to humans only. Other animals either manufacture eseentials internally or have other organisms within which take care of it. The third chapter deals with the human genome. This actually helps in understanding the evolution in a better way. The author has given ample examples to suggest how humans have traded off many things for a evolutionary cost. The discussion on fatal diseases like Huntington's or HIV is again very enlightening. The fourth chapter is the most counterintuitive. Given that humans have successfully outcompeted every other species on the planet, you might think that we’ve mastered this whole reproduction thing. But in fact, human reproduction is inefficient. Extremely inefficient. We are some of the most inefficient reproducers in the animal world because we have errors and flaws throughout almost the entire reproductive process, from the production of sperm and eggs to the survival of our children.The fifth chapter deals with the most threatening diseases we face as a species. The special focus is on autoimmune diseases. Along with it is the larger implications for the immune system as a whole. The chapter ends towards discussing about the elephant in the room which is the cancer. The last two chapters are bit philosophical with author discussing about his thoughts vis a vis the humanity as a whole. The most appropriate conclusion I can derive from the flaws in the human body is that "" ""Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution"" as rightly said by Theodosius Dobzhanksy."
11,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18909164-jigar,2,"I wanted to like this book more. But it has serious flaws. Lents neglects not only key personalities who shape his world view, but whole areas of research, e.g. palaeontology. It exercises hyperbole at the cost of accuracy, evident in the chapter on junk DNA. A more reasonable discussion would at least mention the huge amount of research in epigenetics; there is more to DNA than protein-encoding.Then there's the constant assertion that humans are considerably worse adapted than other animals. But there's no real attempt to justify this view; for this, you would also need to be sure that animals are extremely well adapted to their environments. Rare human diseases and disorders are given disproportionate attention, so to use this as an argument for ""human errors"" Lents should be pretty sure that other animals don't themselves suffer from rare diseases; of course, such logical analysis is blissfully omitted.As a positive, Lents does attempt to pull together many areas of scientific thought, although if you want to study these in more detail you're out of luck: there's no bibliography. We start with unneeded bones, then genes, the last chapter drifts off into psychology, the epilogue is more about survival of the human species. If you can spare the time, you will find it more rewarding to cover each area in more detail:-Palaeontology / evidence for evolution: Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human BodyHistory of genetics: The Gene: An Intimate HistoryEpigenetics: The Epigenetics Revolution [more technical, not covered by Lents, eye-opening nonetheless]Behavioural psychology: Thinking, Fast and SlowDevelopment of civilisation / scientific method: CosmosMy core problem is why this book and why now. There's nothing really groundbreaking, no layman's course on the cutting edge of genetic research, no new discoveries to share with the world. It's an amalgamation and simultaneous watering down of some of the earlier works listed above."

Backwards retinas? Incomplete adaptation to walking upright? Extra bones? Broken-down Vitamin C production? The flaws in our thinking were more familiar to anyone who's studied any psychology, but it was still interesting. My family was subjected to many, ""Did you know...?""-type comments out of the blue, so I'm sure they're relieved I'm done.This book is going next to my teenage son, and many thanks to the publisher for the opportunity to review it."

Or, to put it in a different way: Will our advanced intelligence prove to be our biggest asset or our biggest flaw? We already have the science that can save our species from itself. We are waiting only for the will. And if we can't muster it in time to prevent a global collapse, we will have the ultimate proof of our poor design.All in all, this was really enjoyable. Nicely accompanies The God Delusion. Also, definitely interesting enough to keep your mind off of saying shit like ""Uhh, you're already tired, please stop"" when going for a run. The only chapters that weren't as fascinating were the ones about genes and viruses, but that's on me, cause I know nothing about that. Well, I mean now I know that there are more weird virus particles in our bodies than genes. What are the implications of that? Don't remember. Still, a fun fact's a fun fact.It definitely ended with a bang though, that second to last chapter about cognitive biases was just perfect. And the last one about our potential future was interesting too.I've been accidentally bumping into evolutionary biology lately and it's pretty damn cool.

You don't need to know tons of human biology or physicality either. But it doesn't hurt. Lents' prose is friendly and the tone is rather fun filled in the ""eyes"" of the telling. Not always the case with any science based material, IMHO.The errors of poorly evolved systems (breathing and eating through the same tube is a HUGE one) are explained. And the author gives some mutation ""oops"" for other species, as well. Our extra bones, our infertility compared to other species, the poor mechanical designs that come from walking upright- all the inner and outer human body parts glitches (like our digestion system lacks for absorption etc.) - that's all 4 stars. What I thought was barely 3 stars were the last 2 or 3 chapters about human cognition and homo sapiens future. Most of that is his strongly educated opinion. 90% correct most probably but it's ""too easy"". Especially upon his summations of cognitive bias, anecdotal experience ""truth"" and all the rest of guessing upon the future of extinction or not. I learned some interesting things about nutrition, wrist and ankle bones, and nerves that help activate the voice box.

An Advanced Reader Copy (ARC) of this book was received free via Netgalley for an honest review. 
 Human Errors got burned badly by expectations. When I saw the title and blurb on Netgalley, it suggested a very specific and narrow focus to me. I was looking forward to some very medical discussions, even some interesting evolutionary discussions. Unfortunately, the bulk of this book did not focus on the things I was expecting.That's not to say that the opening chapters didn't have some fascinating medical and evolutionary discussions, because they did. I loved learning about the eye and its structure, for example. That was fascinating and even moreso because this eye type evolved twice and in wildly different animals. There was talk of our wrist and ankle bones and other structures that seem foolish or redundant or just poorly designed. Sometimes it was accompanied by discussions of evolution and why certain things might have been selected for even when they were bad (like sickle cell anemia and its relationship with malaria). These parts were my favorites.But, when the book began discussing things in terms of how an engineer might design and then arguing that something was an error because an engineer wouldn't design it that way, it gradually began to lose me. The curious discussions about the flaws in the human reproductive system were interesting, but the author never makes the kinds of intellectual jumps I would have expected. The discussion on out digestive tract, our diet needs, and how evolution ended up selecting things that could be considered detrimental (like that we can't make all the enzymes, proteins, etc that we need to survive) was interesting. But again, it lacked any real discussion about how or why this may have been selected for. He doesn't even explain why this is an error beyond the idea that it is just poorly engineered. And then he gets into ways the brain is fooled. It was at that point that I mostly checked out. That isn't a defect or wrong or whatever you want to call it unless you want to argue, as he does, that all humans should be perfectly logical at all times. And what exactly is the definition of perfectly logical, you might ask? Well, it appears to be what the author thinks is logical. In the end, it appears that the book was little more than a set up for his epilogue: a discussion on whether this is other life in the universe and whether we will adapt or kill ourselves. I was deeply disappointed because I wanted way more of those opening bits and way less of the judgmental and, in my opinion, arguable discussions in the lat roughly 2/3 of the book.I did learn some interesting things, notably about the eye, and am grateful for it. In that sense, the book was good. But the rest of it seemed difficult to accept at face value when so many value judgments were being put on it as opposed to just facts. I did like the illustrations that accompanied some of the examples.This review is ©May 2018 by Monique N. and has been posted to Netgalley."

19,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32535119-michelle,4,"From bad knees to backward retinas to autoimmune disease and the uptick in peanut allergies, Professor Nathan Lents' book Human Errors is told in a conversational tone that brings anatomy and physiology to the masses. Since the beginning of time we humans have been in awe of ourselves and what makes us especially unique creatures. Usually we emphasize that which makes us ""more complex"" or ""more highly evolved"" ignorant of the randomness of mutations and the misdirection of evolution. Here, Lents instead focuses on these evolutionary ""glitches"" and explains how they lead to different ailments and diseases that impact humans. I initially picked up this book to see if I would be able to incorporate any of the material into my own biology lectures. I especially liked some of the analogies Lents used: ~Pseudogenes likened to cars with missing spark plugs -- on the outside all appears in tip top shape but you will never get from Point A to Point B without that missing piece.  ~Dietary diseases described as the ""dystopian novels written by the human body""  ~Predisposition to developmental septal defects: odds of tripping -- both dependent on a variety of different factors (laces tied or untied, long vs. short laces, etc.) with a range of probability.Reminiscent of one of my all time favorite biology books, Why We Get Sick:The New Science of Darwinian Medicine by Randolph M. Nesse and George C. Williams, Human Errors definitely deserves a place on my physical bookshelf.I would like to thank NetGalley, Edelweiss, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Nathan Lents for the opportunity to review this book in exchange for an honest review."

21,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13555414-olga-miret,4,"Facts, anecdotes, some opinions, and a very engaging way of learning about the human body. Thanks to NetGalley and to the publishers (Weidenfeld & Nicolson) for providing me an ARC copy of this book that I freely chose to review.When I saw this book on offer, I could not resist. I studied Medicine and have been fascinated by Biology and the Natural Sciences for ages. I have also thought and often commented on our (mostly mine, but yes, most of the issues are general, not exclusive to me) flawed design, no matter how superior we feel to the rest of the species that share the planet with us. In a later chapter of the book, the author sums it up observing that if we participated in an Olympic Games-style contest that included all of the Earth’s species, we would not win at anything, apart from perhaps decathlon (or chess if it was included), as we are generalists. We might not be able to compete with the physical prowess shown by many other species (we are not the fastest, the strongest, the best hunters, the ones who jump higher or who can run for longer), but we can do many things to a reasonable level. And yes, we are pretty intelligent (however we choose to use our minds).There is enough material to fill several books under the general title of this book, and Lents chooses pretty interesting ones (although I guess some will appeal to some readers more than others). He talks about pointless bones and anatomical errors, our diet (here he talks about our tendency to obesity and our need to eat a varied diet due to the fact that our bodies have lost the ability to synthesise a number of vitamins, amino acids… while other species do),junk in the genome (issues to do with our DNA), homo sterilis (we are not very good at reproducing as a species), why God invented doctors (about our immune system and autoimmune diseases, cancer…), a species of suckers (about cognitive biases. The title of the chapter refers to P.T. Barnum’s edict ‘a sucker born every minute’ although as the author notes, this is an underestimate), and he discusses the possible future of humanity in the epilogue. There is a fair amount of information contained in this book, and that includes some useful illustrations, and notes at the end (I read an ARC copy, but it is possible that the final version contains even more documentation and resources). It is an educational read that I thoroughly enjoyed. I listened to the book thanks to the text-to-speech facility, and it suits it well, as it has a very conversational tone and manages to impart lots of information without being overbearing or obscure.  I read some reviews suggesting that it was so packed with facts that it was better to read it in small bites. Personally, I read it in a few days and never got bored of it, but it might depend on the reader’s interest in the subject.I was familiar with some of the content but I appreciated the author’s take and the way he organised the materials. Although I enjoyed the whole book, I was particularly interested in the chapters on genetics (the DNA analysis and the identification of specific genes have moved on remarkably since I completed my degree) and on cognitive biases. As a doctor, I also agreed with his comments about autoimmune diseases, the difficulties in their diagnosis, and how these illnesses can sometimes be confused with psychiatric illnesses (being a psychiatrist, I know only too well this can happen). Of course, as is to be expected from the topic, the book reflects on the development of the species and discusses natural selection and evolution, and I was fascinated by the reviews of people who took his arguments as personal attacks on their beliefs. I agree that some of his interpretations and his hypothesis of the reasons for some of these flaws can be debatable, but that does not apply to the facts, and I did not feel the book is intended as a provocation but as a source of information, and entertainment. As the writer notes, we remember better (and believe in) anecdotes and stories than we do dry data. (I am not an expert on the subject but was fascinated by the comments on his blog.)I found the book fascinating, and as a writer, I thought it was full of information useful to people thinking of writing in a variety of genres, from science-fiction (thoughts about how other species might evolve crossed my mind as I read it), historical fiction (if we go back many years), and any books with a focus on human beings and science.  I would recommend checking a sample of the book to see if the writer’s style suits the reader. I highlighted many lines (and was surprised when I learned that female Bluefin tunas don’t reach sexual maturity until they are twenty years old and was pleased to learn about the important roll old female orcas play in their society) but I particularly like this one:Scurvy is a dystopian novel written by the human body.A great read for those who prefer non-fiction and fact-packed books, perfect for people with little time, as it can be picked up and savoured in bite-size instalments, and a book that might pique our interest in and lead to further research on some of the topics. Experts are unlikely to find new information here, but other readers will come out enlightened and with plenty to think about. I strongly recommend it."
22,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1999358-rachel-noel,4,"*Book provided via NetGalley for an honest review.This book is clearly meant for lay people like myself. It is written at an accessible level and has plenty of humor to make the reading engaging. If my high school biology class had used this book, I would have learned a lot more. As it is, I feel a lot more informed about human anatomy than I used to be. From the structure of our eyes to the interconnections of the bones in our ankles and wrists. This is a very educational book that keeps your interest and is easy to read.And it's not just the physical aspects of humanity that are discussed. As interesting as it is to question why our ACL, even after all these years, is still better designed for a species that walks on four limbs, our brains are even more confounding! Lents doesn't have all the answers, but he is really good at explaining the problems and their theorized origins in our evolutionary history. And not just the physical stuff, either. The social and mental stuff gets discussed at length as well.I really liked this book and highly recommend it for anyone who needs a refresher on biology or has questions on anatomy. The book is very comprehensible for those of us without a lot of background on the topic. There is an excellent blend of information, theory and humor. "
23,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,5,"Caveat: for a book that’s supposed to be for lay people, it’s pretty detailed. I liked that for the most interesting topics to me (e.g. autoimmune diseases), but less so for some other topics. The book does live up to its title. And it brought up a memory from some time ago. Back in the 70’s, someone gave me an article to read from Christianity Today magazine which then, and still seems to be, THE evangelical magazine. The article was written by a surgeon and titled “Fearfully and Wonderfully Made,” a quote from Psalm 139. The purpose of the piece was to examine the body as further proof of “intelligent design.” I don’t think the author of this book would necessarily disagree with that, as far as it goes.But the details in his book, reflecting what we’ve learned about DNA, cellular biology and weird imperfections in the body, does better support the imperfections of evolution. In fact, at the beginning of the book the author discusses the inefficiency of the eye, it’s absurd design. The irony is that the eyeball used to be a favorite example of the intelligent design advocates."
24,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,4,"Part of the reason I was smiling so much while reading ‘Human Errors’ is knowing deeply religious people who believe evolution is bunk would probably think Mr. Lents is doing Satan’s work or is a woefully misguided soul. Unfortunately for their ilk, the author is a biology professor who knows how to explain evolution in layman terms. You do not need one of the big brains to understand what is written in his entertaining book. A long-term religious friend who does not believe in evolution once argued with me that he knew a science professor who said only God could have created such a perfect specimen as man. I am agnostic and not a scientist but even I knew that his “science professor” friend was speaking a big heaping mound of caca. Humans are far from perfect. If anything, like all living things on earth, we are a continual evolutionary work in progress. Maybe my religious friend misunderstood the guy and he had said he was a séance professor (if there’s such a thing.)‘Human Errors’ helps explain the many flaws that currently reside with the Homo-sapiens body. Sweet fancy Moses, it is quite the list, people. Mr. Lents gives a general overview of the most obvious quirks in our bodies. As he states the book would’ve been much bigger to include all the design flaws. Instead the author’s work is only 216-pages long. Its feet are firmly planted in science. What is known is explained. What is unknown, the author serves up the most common hypotheses. ‘Human Errors’ was published in 2018. It covers such areas as the less-than-perfect human eyes, nose, throat, neck, back, knee, superfluous bones, our need for nutrients, obesity, nonfunctional DNA, genetic diseases, human reproduction, autoimmune system, allergies, cancer, and the brain. The book compares how much more efficient the same elements are in other animals. In many cases, humans are the defective outliers. ‘Human Errors’ also includes helpful black-and-white illustrations which are scattered throughout the work. The Epilogue chapter takes a stab at explaining where we and the planet may be heading. Some of it is hopeful while other parts are darned right scary. Evolution is a continual random process and never quite complete. It’s neither good nor bad. Evolutionary innovations are a tradeoff. ‘Human Errors’ will help you understand why many everyday body functions occur. As Mr. Lents aptly states, “Lurking in our anatomy are some odd arrangements, inefficient designs, and even outright defects. Mostly these are fairly neutral; they don’t hinder our ability to live and thrive. If they did, evolution would have handled them by now.” For people who believe that we are the center of God’s great plan, ‘Human Errors’ may be unsettling. The author stresses that human evolution is more luck than anything. He is correct. The book is a fun, educational, quick read. I guess I’ll have to stop telling everyone that I, and ONLY I, am evolution's most perfect specimen. (If you are interested in a clear fun explanation of evolution, I wholeheartedly recommend ‘Why Evolution is True’ by Jerry A. Coyne.)"

29,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1483724-kate,4,"Anyone who knows me (or follows me on Instagram) knows I'm obsessed with anatomy (and by extension to a lesser extent, physiology). It borders on pathological. I have anatomical charts and skulls as decoration all over my apartment, and an entire bookshelf devoted to various anatomy texts across a lot of timespans. (But to be fair, I was a TA for college anatomy classes for five years, so it's not like it's a completely random interest). So when this showed up in my Netgalley options, I snagged it. I will read anything pertaining to anatomy.I was pleasantly surprised. Usually, I know 99% of information in these types of books. But, this one focused on the flaws of our anatomy and physiology, so it was a new spin and dove deeply into things I had certainly thought about in my years of biology coursework, but had never really investigated. I also like that this is generally accessible, but there were a few issues. It could have had better editing (I found myself rolling my eyes every time he said something to the extent of ""no engineer would design a structure this way"", because it happens at least three times per chapter). Early on in the book (chapter two-ish? or maybe the latter part of chapter one?) I was really annoyed by his sentence structure, too. It was overly simple, and reminded me a lot of the pre-meds I teach who are brilliant scientists but do admittedly struggle with the flow of their writing, particular non-academic/non-scientific writing. While this is a book about science, it's targeted to the average Joe, so there were opportunities for improvement. But, it got better as it went on (or I got used to it and blocked it out. Not sure which). There's also times where he gets a little more technical than I expected, particularly around some of the gene stuff. I've have my share of genetics courses and I was able to follow along, but there were some things that made me really think back to my college classwork to remember and understand, which for many readers may be bordering on too scientific. But generally, he does a nice job of explaining complex topics for the non-science reader. I also strangely found the section on behavioral economics, particularly the ""why we suck at managing currency and gamble away our money"" fascinating. I'm glad that was included. Generally, a solid read. I'd definitely recommend it to my students (and anyone with a passing interest in the human body), pre-meds and non-pre-meds alike. Thanks to Netgalley for the free review copy!"
30,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,4,"Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes by Nathan Lents admits from the get-go that there are more than enough books about how great and wondrous the human body is. Lents takes a whole different tack: how human bodies have huge design flaws, from big system like our bones to the DNA in every cell.  Why do we have a blind spot in each eye? It is because the retina is wired backwards. Why are the drains for our sinuses in the wrong place? To make room for our oversized brains. Is it really a good idea to take in food through the same opening that we use for breathing? Lents thinks definitely not. The wrist has way too many bones, grouped “...like a pile of rocks,” a turn of phrase that produces a vivid mental image. Human Errors brings up ideas about vitamins that I had never remotely considered. Why don’t dogs and other animals need vitamin C in their diets? Because they can make it themselves. Why can’t we? Because, through a genetic mutation, we lost that ability. Minerals, which always have to be consumed, cause us problems because we have trouble absorbing them. Calcium absorption gets worse as we age, and iron deficiency is the number one nutritional deficiency both in the US and in the world. Obesity is also a natural fallout from poor design.Focusing in on human DNA and running the numbers, Lents demonstrates that DNA are enormously wasteful, with 97% of DNA not “saying”anything. These include strings called pseudo genes, one of which causes us to not be able to generate our own vitamin C. Other strands of DNA are discarded bits of ancient viruses, and even pieces of our own genetic material, copied over and over like an office printer run amok. There are a myriad of problems with human reproductive systems, from the fact that the Fallopian tubes are not even connected to the ovaries (!) to the fact the sperm can only turn in one direction. Autoimmune diseases are just ongoing mistakes made by your body, plain and simple. Allergic reactions to poison ivy and bee stings fall in this same category. Memory is another area where we have big problems. Given only some information about an event, our brains try to fill in the gaps. In the case of gambling, our imperfect brains try to find patterns where there are none. Kudos to Human Errors for shining a light in dark places, providing me with new insights into how the body works (and doesn’t)."
31,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107567624-philip,3,"I'm a bit torn about this book. I want to like it more than I do.I love the idea of the book. How awesome isn't it to discover all our little inherited quirks and flaws compounded over hundreds of millions of years of evolution!? Brilliant, right!? To a degree, Lents delivers. However, it seems like he's cherry-picked the most commonly known oddities about our genetic make-up. If you already have some basic knowledge - or even familiarity - with our ""design"" flaws, you likely won't learn much. You may even stumble on a few things where he's apparently wrong - or, at least, where he's oversimplified something to the point of being wrong. Not to mention that - and, fyi, this may just be me - it makes my stomach churn when he illustrates something like our anecdotal bias and how it's so very wrong with - drum roll please... - yup, an anecdote! (I wish I had a pukey face emoji right about now). I'm also not stoked about the last part of the book where he ventures away from the actual topic into things like extraterrestrial life (or lack thereof), the Fermi paradox, and other things like that. Not that it isn't interesting, it is, but it just feels off in this book (also, same thing here, if you're reading a book like this, the Fermi paradox likely isn't a new concept to you... right?).Regardless, despite my little whine-fest above, I do like the book. It's a light read - which might actually be a positive to some (?), even if I would have preferred a little more substance - and it's fun to contemplate how things could end up so bonkers. I just wish there would have been more! I also think a lot of our problems today could be alleviated if more of humanity had the flaws he mentions, as well as others, in mind before going off half-cocked on each other!I also want to mention that my rating would have been different if Lents would have kept to the science of our evolutionary flaws (that s**t is awesome!). He could have then honed in a little more on each particular flaw and fleshed it out - as well as explored more of them. Had he done this I would say it's a solid 4-star, and we would probably have learned a ton more. But anyway... and in summary, if you happen to stumble on this quick little read, it's totally worth the half-day (or so) it takes to read :)."

43,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book through NetGalley.]I found this to be both an informative and entertaining read. While the author doesn’t delve very deep into details (each subject in each chapter would probably warrant a book of its own), and although I wish there had been more developed explanations at times, I’m also aware that one book couldn’t tackle everything in one go—and he nevertheless provides enough information for a reader to go on research some more later on a given topic.I already knew some of the ‘human errors’ presented in the book (such as junk DNA and mutations), but definitely not others, such as why we get so many headcolds (our sinuses placed the wrong way), why we do actually make our own B12 vitamin but can’t use it (same with other vitamins—and this is why we need a varied diet, with all the problems it entails), or why our ways of procreating are, in fact, very inefficient compared to those of other mammals. So, discovering all this was fascinating, and the explanations provided also satisfy the unavoidable ‘why’ questions that rose immediately after (I’m very much a why person; every physician who attended me since I’ve learnt to speak can testify to this). For instance, we lost the ability to make our own vitamin C, whose absence will lead to scorbut and kill us; but the mutation that led to this defect wasn’t erased through evolution because it happened in areas where fruit was easily available, and a diet of fruit would compensate for our rotten GULO gene… until the latter stuck, happily passed around to descendants.I liked that some explanations went a bit further: it’s not only about this or that physical defect, but also about how we’re still wired for survival techniques and reactions dating back to prehistoric times, and how some of our modern behaviours are thus impacted. An extended example would be gambling, and why people in general have irrational reactions such as ‘now that I’ve lost ten times in a row, I -must- win, there’s no other way’ (though statistically, you could lose an 11th time), or will bet more and more when they’re on winning streak, and risk losing it all or more, rather than save those earnings. Those would go back to the way we interpreted situations to learn from them and survive (man sees a lion in a bush, concludes bushes often hide a lion, and then avoids bushes). Same with optical illusions, due to our brains’ ability to ‘fill in the blanks’.On the side of actual errors, I noticed a few (redundant words or phrases, that a last editing pass would probably remove). Nothing too bad, though.Conclusion: Due to the lack of deeper details and general simple writing, this book is probably more for laypeople rather than people with a strong scientific background—but even then, there’s still a chance that some of the ‘human errors’ may still be of interest to them. "
44,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"We all know that the human body is not perfect. Any of us who wear glasses, get the flu, fall and land on our coccyx, take vitamins, or try to lose weight knows this first hand.In this book, Nathan Lents gives us a lot of scientific information about human development, how human systems work, and why our bodies evolved the way they did. What makes this book so special is that he presents all of this information in an easy to understand and entertaining fashion. He presents our faults and limitations clearly and in a way clever enough that you will often find yourself laughing at your own limitations.This is not to say that this book is all fun and games. Lents explains how poorly we deal with certain diseases, how the body often attacks itself, how errors occur when DNA replicates, the flaws in our reproductive system, and that all of us - if we live long enough- will get cancer. These are definitely not light topics but, again, he presents them in a way to help you understand the how and why they are part of our makeup.Many readers will have already heard of some of the ""glitches"" he mentions that are contained in the human body - such as the poor construction of the human eye or the pelvis being to small to all for easy births. However, many of the defects Lents presents are ones you haven't heard of or did not previously understand that they were ""built-in"" by evolution.Lent addresses how medical science has made major progress in learning about the human body and finding ways to deal with the ""blunders of nature"" but, also, how there are many that may be more than science can correct. He continues on to conjecture that if all of these problems can be addressed will we be able to live forever and, if so, what would that mean for our society and our planet?In the Epilogue, ""The Future of Humanity"", Lents moves from the daily glitches and moves into the areas of global warming, apocalyptic wars, space exploration, and the question of whether there is life elsewhere in the universe. While he does an excellent job of presenting his thoughts on these very important topics, I feel that they would have been better addressed in a different book than as an add-on to this one.Overall, I enjoyed reading Human Errors. I learned, I laughed, I cringed, and I came face to face with the many flaws that are a part of being a human being."
45,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,4,"Man was created by God. We are his perfect creation. Our perfection is evident in every detail of our design. Right? If you believe this, then you first need to Google Charles Darwin and evolution. Second, you need to take another look at the human body. Because we are full of defects. This book will give you a few examples of some of our most glaring flaws; flaws that can be found from head to toe, and in our body's architecture as well as in our DNA.What could possibly be wrong with having a shared channel for air and food? (This is a rhetorical question, but in case you really wonder, food gets stuck, and we die...). It has to be like that, you might argue. But that would be ignoring whales and dolphins. They eat with their mouth and breathe through a different hole on their back; they don’t risk choking. We also have genes for creating several vitamins, e.g., vitamin C – only they are broken. Usually, this doesn't matter because we get vitamin C in our diets and therefore natural selection has had not selected against this detect. But it is a defect nonetheless if we do not get any vitamin C for a while, as sailors crossing the Atlantic, we get sick and die – all because of our non-functional gene. The reason for our imperfections is that evolution cannot start over, it works by making small gradual changes. Evolution can only undo things partially, which is why we still have a tailbone which is by the way also useless – except for getting hurt...This book is a call for rationality. It provides a tiny grain of sand to balance the mountains of books glorifying the human body and its 'perfection.' To be sure the human body is impressive in many ways but perfect it is not. "
46,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8788163-yicheng-liu,4,"-Netgalley Review-This is a sharp and clear read; I have never read anything by this author before, but I was interested in medical writings, and tales of the human body intrigues me as a layman with no medical expertise. This book offers a broad look into the defect of the human body, the imperfect and haphazard nature of natural evolution, and what the future have in store for us as individuals and as a collective. The book describes humans as, to paraphrase lightly, imperfect creatures that are not exempt from evolution’s grasps. Just because of the efficiency in curing preexisting ailments and improving living conditions had skyrocketed, humanity has yet to reach past evolution as we are change with each passing generation. The author delivered on the premise and presented a well-reasoned conclusion that humanity have both the ability to better oneself and the ability to bring forth mutually assured destruction. The writing was not confusing nor is it filled with jargon, yet it conveys the point and delves deeply into analysing what exactly, biologically speaking, we are and whether we are truly the best evolution can do. Would recommend to readers interested in Medical sciences and and/or philosophy in relation humans especially with the advent of transhumanism and the influx of revolutionary medical techniques being developed at this very moment such as CRISPR or prothetic limbs that would ultimately be more powerful than our biological ones.. This is an easy read with simple and often humorous language that is bound to fascinate."
47,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18001516-kate-vane,4,"Evolution does not mean we are continually moving towards perfection. Mutations happen by chance, and they may or may not be good for us. If they don’t kill us and if they don’t stop us reproducing, they stick around.Human Errors details some of these ‘errors’ and includes some fascinating examples. Our dodgy knees are a hangover from our primate days, and were never meant to support us standing up. Our retinas are the wrong way round and we’d be much better off if we had the eyes of an octopus.There are chapters which focus on the more serious consequences of these errors – such as hereditary diseases and autoimmune conditions which lead the body to attack itself.I was fascinated by the chapter on reproduction and loved the image of menopausal orca whales leading hunting packs of young males, but when I thought about it later, I wasn’t clear whether the author thinks the menopause in humans is an error at all.There’s also an epilogue which is more speculative. Lents’ argument seems to be that the inventiveness of humans allows us to outpace our errors, or even turn them into strengths. However these strengths can also be weaknesses. He argues that selfishness and short-term thinking may well lead humanity to destroy itself and the planet. This seems to be more about philosophy than science.Overall though, this is an informative and entertaining read for a non-scientist like me and the quirky examples make the underlying facts more memorable.*I received a copy of Human Errors from the publisher via Netgalley."
48,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1619539-nancy,4,"Some Problems with Human EvolutionEvolution is a marvelous process. It allowed humans to reach status of the preeminent species on earth, but it came with a cost. Evolution is driven by mutations. They create new genes that allow for additional functionality, but it’s impossible to get rid of the old patterns. This leads to problems like backwards retinas, bad knees, swallowing and breathing through the same narrow channel and more. The book is witty and although it presents a great deal of technical information, the presentation is clear and amusing, suitable for a general audience. I enjoyed the book and learned about some problems with the human body I had never heard of before. I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that made the book more fun. The chapters are relatively short and the illustrations make it easy to understand some of the technical discussion. The notes section is extensive and whether you agree with his ideas or not provides references for future study. I recommend this book for anyone interested in biology or nutrition. There is a good chapter on why humans need such a varied diet based on some evolutionary problems.I received this book from Net Galley for this review."
49,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16203817-bartley-sharkey,5,"Ah yes, a book that doesn't appear to be a poorly disguised promotion for the author. Human Errors strikes a good balance between covering topics that most people will have heard of already and others that will be brand new. It may be described as a pretty dry topic but whether the bodily issues covered are relevant or not, I find them fascinating and feel like I've learned a little bit more about why our bodies are basically messed up and so prone to breaking down.Of course, this kind of book would be hopelessly boring if there wasn't any humour included so thankfully there is, although most of it would fit right in to a book of ""dad jokes"". Maybe the author could have consulted someone funny to help inject a little more, but at the same time it's by no means decisive in making the book pleasant to read.Having sped through this book in a week, I think it happened to be the kind of book I wanted to read at this moment and the main take away is not that of specific deficiencies of the human body, but the impression that not only is it incredible that evolution happened to bring us this far and that we are each somewhat akin to a soup of different cells and genes, somehow coordinating to keep us standing for long enough to enjoy this brief moment of consciousness!"
50,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8115180-jiny-s,5,"This book can be best described in three parts: anatomy, genetics, and psychology.Right from the start, reading the first few pages on the errors of human anatomy got me hooked. Learning about how the human eye is backwards, how our mucus has to travel upwards (its inefficiency and consequential prone to infections), how our nerves have to wind around our body (because of our evolutionary roots from fish), and so on, is like bringing the curious inner child inside of me to a candy store. Learning about all the weird but cool things about my own body is utterly fascinating.The second and third part was not as exciting for me, more of a reiteration of bio and psy 101, especially the last part, when the author describes biases, heuristics, and illusions. It was nonetheless interesting, but for me personally, I have already knew these things and thus the awe factor was removed.The author has a way of describing things (even technical) without being boring. I even enjoyed the long, meandering epilogue at the end, where the author contemplates about the future of humanity and so on."

It was quite enjoyable.All sorts of ""design flaws"" are discussed in detail in a conversational tone. Some examples are attributed to our adaptations to our environment and evolution. At times, I wondered how in the world humans survived. I could really relate to the sections about why humans have bad knees and a tendency to gain weight but difficulty in losing weight.I do think he could have included more ""errors,"" such as teeth. I have always thought we should be able to grow another tooth if we lose one, like sharks are able to do. Also, I think the author did get a little ""preachy"" at times when discussing war and the environment.

This can lead to all sorts of havoc, which Lents discusses in an enjoyable and clear way. His tone is conversational and he uses humor to good effect.

It’s an interesting and entertaining book, written in a lively and accessible style, but as other reviewers have pointed out errors in some of his conclusions I now doubt the accuracy of some of what I took as fact. Nevertheless it’s a good fun read and definitely provides food for thought. "

56,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Folks who think ‘intelligent design’ does a better job of describing the miracle of nature that is the human body than ‘evolution by means of natural selection’ have some explaining to do. That’s because the ‘intelligence’ behind our present form is, in many ways, very, very bad at its job. In fact, it’s safe to say that any engineering major worth their salt could make numerous design improvements to our bodies without breaking a sweat. Need some examples?-	We eat, drink and breath through the same hole in our face, which makes choking a real hazard. Thousands of people die each year due to this design flaw. In fact, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death.-	Unlike most other animals, humans can’t make their own vitamin C (we have to consume it in our food). Many sailors died of scurvy before this fact was realized.-	Baby’s heads are too big for women’s pelvises. Before the advent of modern medicine, human infant (and maternal) mortality rates were some of the highest in the entire animal kingdom.-	Some people (myself included) have life-threatening allergies to common foods because our immune systems can’t distinguish between safe and unsafe proteins. -	We have too many bones in our wrists and ankles making them prone to injury. Not to mention the prevalence of knee and back problems within our species thanks to bad design. -	Our eyes aren’t that great, which is why 60% of the population wears eyeglasses. We also have a blind spot thanks to a backwards retina.-	Our maxillary sinuses drain upwards (against the pull of gravity), making us more prone than other species to sinus infections. -	Men’s testicles are external to their bodies leaving them exposed and vulnerable to injury (as any male bicycle rider surely knows all too well). -	Our mouths are too crowded for our teeth, which is why many people have their wisdom teeth surgically removed. We also only have 1 set of adult teeth, which means dentures are required once those are lost. Anyone who thinks these design flaws are ‘intelligent’ is not thinking clearly, which of course is indicative of yet another system error … our brains, which are so very easy to fool we need a systematic procedure to reduce biases, sloppy rationalizations, and erroneous conclusions … it’s called the ‘scientific method’. Thanks the application of this process we’ve learned many things about the natural world that benefit us in our daily lives and enabled technologies such as cell phones, antibiotics, aircraft and computers. As if that weren’t enough, the scientific method has also definitively demonstrated that ‘intelligent design’ is what scientists refer to as a 'failed hypothesis', otherwise known as a cockeyed load of half-baked hogwash. Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes describes many of the myriad ways our bodies are an agglomeration of kludged together parts. Why? Because that’s the way evolution works. It doesn’t have any forethought or design plan in mind and mutational changes can only make small modifications to structures that already exist. Since it can’t redesign anatomy from the bottom up to make it more effective, we’re stuck with what we have (at least until gene editing technology improves). Fortunately, medical advances and technology enable us to overcome some, though not all, of our physical deficiencies. In the case of my own (a severe allergy to tree nuts), food safety labeling requirements and increased awareness within the restaurant industry have significantly reduced risks of exposure. As to the book, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Lents has an engaging writing style that that is both entertaining and informative. Although I thought the epilog went off in a rather strange and irrelevant direction in its discussion of the Fermi Paradox, the Drake equation and intelligent alien life in the universe (which not only has little to do with the topic of this book, but the reason we haven’t discovered it has a simple explanation … it doesn’t exist … but that’s a discussion for another time)."
57,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Nathan Lents gives us a lively and interesting look at some of the major flaws of the human body--starting with our eyes, and working downward. Our lenses are backwards. Our wrists and ankles have extra, unnecessary bones that serve no real function. We have a variety of genetic diseases, more than most other species, and they don't get effectively selected against for a variety of frustrating reasons. Once a gene acquires a mutation, it tends to accumulate more mutations. Once that happens, the problem can't be fixed by another single mutation of the kind that caused the original problem. The deletion of our ability to manufacture our own vitamin C, like most mammals, got deleted in a common ancestor of primate species long ago. It wasn't selected against because all the early primates lived in the midst of a vitamin C-rich food supply. That mutation has been accumulating more mutations since long before genus homo arose. We're not getting it back.Others are even more frustrating. The mutation that causes sickle cell anemia causes a devastating, painful, deadly disease--if you get two copies of that gene, one each from father and mother. It ought to have been selected against long ago! Oh, except for one inconvenient fact. If you get only one copy of the disease, you have a higher than normal resistance to malaria. Malaria can also debilitate and kill you. Someone who has one copy of the sickle cell gene doesn't get sickle cell, and is less likely to get malaria, and more likely to survive malaria if they do. In regions where malaria is a major problem, people with one copy of the sickle cell gene will be more likely to live long enough to have more offspring, and thus more descendants--even though some of them will have sickle cell anemia due to getting two copies of the gene.Nor are we really fully adapted to walking upright, or to giving birth to children with such large brains. Our babies are born several months earlier than they ""should"" be, based on the degree of development they have at birth, even compared to our closest relatives, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo.I can't do credit to Lents' writing of this, or to L.J. Ganser's reading of it. It's informative and enjoyable.Recommended.I bought this audiobook."
58,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2778499-midwest-geek,4,"This was a surprisingly entertaining read. Lents must be a very popular lecturer, for he has a very self-effacing, approachable style. For a good summary and evaluation similar to mine, I recommend the review by Rebecca. I would add that the main theme of how evolution can unwittingly produce inefficient organisms is something that seems not widely appreciated. In particualar, although I knew some of these facts, such as the preponderence of junk DNA, I developed a greater appreciation of human inefficiencies that result from the nature of evolution.An early example in the book is that the retina of the eye is so poorly designed as to have its light sensors pointing toward the back of the head instead of toward the lens of the eye, leaving humans and other vertebrates much less sensitive to light intensity than they could be and leading to the well-known blind spot. I had not known that an independent evolutionary path to vision followed by cephalopods (such as octopi and squid) led to a far more sensible design with the light sensors facing forward instead of backward and without a blind spot. They can see the light from a single photon (like our best electronic detectors), whereas our eyes typically require a minimum of about 5 or 6 photons of comparable intensity before provoking a response. The book could be used to bolster the case against ""intelligent design"" but that isn't its intention.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in how humans came to be as we are. I got it from the library, but I will keep it in mind as a present for certain grandchildren when they get a little older."
59,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23635526-john-haake,4,"My wife and I read this together ... which proved wonderful fodder for the two of us to make fun of each others bodies (none of the flaws we made fun of where ever mentioned in the book).As indicated from our joking -- this book merely scratches the surface of all the flaws built into our bodies -- but the glitches, errors and basically left-over junk in our bodies that the author does cover is very interesting and gave me a lot to think about, which is just what I want out of a pop-science, science-lite type book.This book clearly puts into question the whole ""intelligent design"" argument, as one would hope if there was some divine being in charge of design of His/Her ultimate creation that they would have been a bit more precise on the ""intelligent"" part of that design -- be a forewarned creationist reader, you will not be getting a dose of support for ""superior"" design of these human bodies over and above those of the rest of the animal kingdom -- indeed, there is quite a bit of evidence to the contrary and the ""sacrifices/compromises"" the human body had to take on as a product of our increasing intelligence over other species. --- interestingly described in a section of the book about how other animals don't need supplemental vitamins because they produce their own.Of course, my favorite part of the book was about the virus graveyard -- fascinating, those little creatures bordering the fine line between ""life"" and ""non-life""Enjoy this read!"
60,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,4,"Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes by Nathan Lents admits from the get-go that there are more than enough books about how great and wondrous the human body is. Lents takes a whole different tack: how human bodies have huge design flaws, from big system like our bones to the DNA in every cell.  Why do we have a blind spot in each eye? It is because the retina is wired backwards. Why are the drains for our sinuses in the wrong place? To make room for our oversized brains. Is it really a good idea to take in food through the same opening that we use for breathing? Lents thinks definitely not. The wrist has way too many bones, grouped “...like a pile of rocks,” a turn of phrase that produces a vivid mental image. Human Errors brings up ideas about vitamins that I had never remotely considered. Why don’t dogs and other animals need vitamin C in their diets? Because they can make it themselves. Why can’t we? Because, through a genetic mutation, we lost that ability. Minerals, which always have to be consumed, cause us problems because we have trouble absorbing them. Calcium absorption gets worse as we age, and iron deficiency is the number one nutritional deficiency both in the US and in the world. Obesity is also a natural fallout from poor design.Focusing in on human DNA and running the numbers, Lents demonstrates that DNA are enormously wasteful, with 97% of DNA not “saying”anything. These include strings called pseudo genes, one of which causes us to not be able to generate our own vitamin C. Other strands of DNA are discarded bits of ancient viruses, and even pieces of our own genetic material, copied over and over like an office printer run amok. There are a myriad of problems with human reproductive systems, from the fact that the Fallopian tubes are not even connected to the ovaries (!) to the fact the sperm can only turn in one direction. Autoimmune diseases are just ongoing mistakes made by your body, plain and simple. Allergic reactions to poison ivy and bee stings fall in this same category. Memory is another area where we have big problems. Given only some information about an event, our brains try to fill in the gaps. In the case of gambling, our imperfect brains try to find patterns where there are none. Kudos to Human Errors for shining a light in dark places, providing me with new insights into how the body works (and doesn’t)."
61,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107567624-philip,3,"I'm a bit torn about this book. I want to like it more than I do.I love the idea of the book. How awesome isn't it to discover all our little inherited quirks and flaws compounded over hundreds of millions of years of evolution!? Brilliant, right!? To a degree, Lents delivers. However, it seems like he's cherry-picked the most commonly known oddities about our genetic make-up. If you already have some basic knowledge - or even familiarity - with our ""design"" flaws, you likely won't learn much. You may even stumble on a few things where he's apparently wrong - or, at least, where he's oversimplified something to the point of being wrong. Not to mention that - and, fyi, this may just be me - it makes my stomach churn when he illustrates something like our anecdotal bias and how it's so very wrong with - drum roll please... - yup, an anecdote! (I wish I had a pukey face emoji right about now). I'm also not stoked about the last part of the book where he ventures away from the actual topic into things like extraterrestrial life (or lack thereof), the Fermi paradox, and other things like that. Not that it isn't interesting, it is, but it just feels off in this book (also, same thing here, if you're reading a book like this, the Fermi paradox likely isn't a new concept to you... right?).Regardless, despite my little whine-fest above, I do like the book. It's a light read - which might actually be a positive to some (?), even if I would have preferred a little more substance - and it's fun to contemplate how things could end up so bonkers. I just wish there would have been more! I also think a lot of our problems today could be alleviated if more of humanity had the flaws he mentions, as well as others, in mind before going off half-cocked on each other!I also want to mention that my rating would have been different if Lents would have kept to the science of our evolutionary flaws (that s**t is awesome!). He could have then honed in a little more on each particular flaw and fleshed it out - as well as explored more of them. Had he done this I would say it's a solid 4-star, and we would probably have learned a ton more. But anyway... and in summary, if you happen to stumble on this quick little read, it's totally worth the half-day (or so) it takes to read :)."

73,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book through NetGalley.]I found this to be both an informative and entertaining read. While the author doesn’t delve very deep into details (each subject in each chapter would probably warrant a book of its own), and although I wish there had been more developed explanations at times, I’m also aware that one book couldn’t tackle everything in one go—and he nevertheless provides enough information for a reader to go on research some more later on a given topic.I already knew some of the ‘human errors’ presented in the book (such as junk DNA and mutations), but definitely not others, such as why we get so many headcolds (our sinuses placed the wrong way), why we do actually make our own B12 vitamin but can’t use it (same with other vitamins—and this is why we need a varied diet, with all the problems it entails), or why our ways of procreating are, in fact, very inefficient compared to those of other mammals. So, discovering all this was fascinating, and the explanations provided also satisfy the unavoidable ‘why’ questions that rose immediately after (I’m very much a why person; every physician who attended me since I’ve learnt to speak can testify to this). For instance, we lost the ability to make our own vitamin C, whose absence will lead to scorbut and kill us; but the mutation that led to this defect wasn’t erased through evolution because it happened in areas where fruit was easily available, and a diet of fruit would compensate for our rotten GULO gene… until the latter stuck, happily passed around to descendants.I liked that some explanations went a bit further: it’s not only about this or that physical defect, but also about how we’re still wired for survival techniques and reactions dating back to prehistoric times, and how some of our modern behaviours are thus impacted. An extended example would be gambling, and why people in general have irrational reactions such as ‘now that I’ve lost ten times in a row, I -must- win, there’s no other way’ (though statistically, you could lose an 11th time), or will bet more and more when they’re on winning streak, and risk losing it all or more, rather than save those earnings. Those would go back to the way we interpreted situations to learn from them and survive (man sees a lion in a bush, concludes bushes often hide a lion, and then avoids bushes). Same with optical illusions, due to our brains’ ability to ‘fill in the blanks’.On the side of actual errors, I noticed a few (redundant words or phrases, that a last editing pass would probably remove). Nothing too bad, though.Conclusion: Due to the lack of deeper details and general simple writing, this book is probably more for laypeople rather than people with a strong scientific background—but even then, there’s still a chance that some of the ‘human errors’ may still be of interest to them.

Any of us who wear glasses, get the flu, fall and land on our coccyx, take vitamins, or try to lose weight knows this first hand.In this book, Nathan Lents gives us a lot of scientific information about human development, how human systems work, and why our bodies evolved the way they did. What makes this book so special is that he presents all of this information in an easy to understand and entertaining fashion. He presents our faults and limitations clearly and in a way clever enough that you will often find yourself laughing at your own limitations.This is not to say that this book is all fun and games. Lents explains how poorly we deal with certain diseases, how the body often attacks itself, how errors occur when DNA replicates, the flaws in our reproductive system, and that all of us - if we live long enough- will get cancer. These are definitely not light topics but, again, he presents them in a way to help you understand the how and why they are part of our makeup.Many readers will have already heard of some of the ""glitches"" he mentions that are contained in the human body - such as the poor construction of the human eye or the pelvis being to small to all for easy births. However, many of the defects Lents presents are ones you haven't heard of or did not previously understand that they were ""built-in"" by evolution.Lent addresses how medical science has made major progress in learning about the human body and finding ways to deal with the ""blunders of nature"" but, also, how there are many that may be more than science can correct. He continues on to conjecture that if all of these problems can be addressed will we be able to live forever and, if so, what would that mean for our society and our planet?In the Epilogue, ""The Future of Humanity"", Lents moves from the daily glitches and moves into the areas of global warming, apocalyptic wars, space exploration, and the question of whether there is life elsewhere in the universe. While he does an excellent job of presenting his thoughts on these very important topics, I feel that they would have been better addressed in a different book than as an add-on to this one.Overall, I enjoyed reading Human Errors. I learned, I laughed, I cringed, and I came face to face with the many flaws that are a part of being a human being."
75,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,4,"Man was created by God. We are his perfect creation. Our perfection is evident in every detail of our design. Right? If you believe this, then you first need to Google Charles Darwin and evolution. Second, you need to take another look at the human body. Because we are full of defects. This book will give you a few examples of some of our most glaring flaws; flaws that can be found from head to toe, and in our body's architecture as well as in our DNA.What could possibly be wrong with having a shared channel for air and food? (This is a rhetorical question, but in case you really wonder, food gets stuck, and we die...). It has to be like that, you might argue. But that would be ignoring whales and dolphins. They eat with their mouth and breathe through a different hole on their back; they don’t risk choking. We also have genes for creating several vitamins, e.g., vitamin C – only they are broken. Usually, this doesn't matter because we get vitamin C in our diets and therefore natural selection has had not selected against this detect. But it is a defect nonetheless if we do not get any vitamin C for a while, as sailors crossing the Atlantic, we get sick and die – all because of our non-functional gene. The reason for our imperfections is that evolution cannot start over, it works by making small gradual changes. Evolution can only undo things partially, which is why we still have a tailbone which is by the way also useless – except for getting hurt...This book is a call for rationality. It provides a tiny grain of sand to balance the mountains of books glorifying the human body and its 'perfection.' To be sure the human body is impressive in many ways but perfect it is not. "
76,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8788163-yicheng-liu,4,"-Netgalley Review-This is a sharp and clear read; I have never read anything by this author before, but I was interested in medical writings, and tales of the human body intrigues me as a layman with no medical expertise. This book offers a broad look into the defect of the human body, the imperfect and haphazard nature of natural evolution, and what the future have in store for us as individuals and as a collective. The book describes humans as, to paraphrase lightly, imperfect creatures that are not exempt from evolution’s grasps. Just because of the efficiency in curing preexisting ailments and improving living conditions had skyrocketed, humanity has yet to reach past evolution as we are change with each passing generation. The author delivered on the premise and presented a well-reasoned conclusion that humanity have both the ability to better oneself and the ability to bring forth mutually assured destruction. The writing was not confusing nor is it filled with jargon, yet it conveys the point and delves deeply into analysing what exactly, biologically speaking, we are and whether we are truly the best evolution can do. Would recommend to readers interested in Medical sciences and and/or philosophy in relation humans especially with the advent of transhumanism and the influx of revolutionary medical techniques being developed at this very moment such as CRISPR or prothetic limbs that would ultimately be more powerful than our biological ones.. This is an easy read with simple and often humorous language that is bound to fascinate."
77,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18001516-kate-vane,4,"Evolution does not mean we are continually moving towards perfection. Mutations happen by chance, and they may or may not be good for us. If they don’t kill us and if they don’t stop us reproducing, they stick around.Human Errors details some of these ‘errors’ and includes some fascinating examples. Our dodgy knees are a hangover from our primate days, and were never meant to support us standing up. Our retinas are the wrong way round and we’d be much better off if we had the eyes of an octopus.There are chapters which focus on the more serious consequences of these errors – such as hereditary diseases and autoimmune conditions which lead the body to attack itself.I was fascinated by the chapter on reproduction and loved the image of menopausal orca whales leading hunting packs of young males, but when I thought about it later, I wasn’t clear whether the author thinks the menopause in humans is an error at all.There’s also an epilogue which is more speculative. Lents’ argument seems to be that the inventiveness of humans allows us to outpace our errors, or even turn them into strengths. However these strengths can also be weaknesses. He argues that selfishness and short-term thinking may well lead humanity to destroy itself and the planet. This seems to be more about philosophy than science.Overall though, this is an informative and entertaining read for a non-scientist like me and the quirky examples make the underlying facts more memorable.*I received a copy of Human Errors from the publisher via Netgalley."
78,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1619539-nancy,4,"Some Problems with Human EvolutionEvolution is a marvelous process. It allowed humans to reach status of the preeminent species on earth, but it came with a cost. Evolution is driven by mutations. They create new genes that allow for additional functionality, but it’s impossible to get rid of the old patterns. This leads to problems like backwards retinas, bad knees, swallowing and breathing through the same narrow channel and more. The book is witty and although it presents a great deal of technical information, the presentation is clear and amusing, suitable for a general audience. I enjoyed the book and learned about some problems with the human body I had never heard of before. I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that made the book more fun. The chapters are relatively short and the illustrations make it easy to understand some of the technical discussion. The notes section is extensive and whether you agree with his ideas or not provides references for future study. I recommend this book for anyone interested in biology or nutrition. There is a good chapter on why humans need such a varied diet based on some evolutionary problems.I received this book from Net Galley for this review."
79,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16203817-bartley-sharkey,5,"Ah yes, a book that doesn't appear to be a poorly disguised promotion for the author. Human Errors strikes a good balance between covering topics that most people will have heard of already and others that will be brand new. It may be described as a pretty dry topic but whether the bodily issues covered are relevant or not, I find them fascinating and feel like I've learned a little bit more about why our bodies are basically messed up and so prone to breaking down.Of course, this kind of book would be hopelessly boring if there wasn't any humour included so thankfully there is, although most of it would fit right in to a book of ""dad jokes"". Maybe the author could have consulted someone funny to help inject a little more, but at the same time it's by no means decisive in making the book pleasant to read.Having sped through this book in a week, I think it happened to be the kind of book I wanted to read at this moment and the main take away is not that of specific deficiencies of the human body, but the impression that not only is it incredible that evolution happened to bring us this far and that we are each somewhat akin to a soup of different cells and genes, somehow coordinating to keep us standing for long enough to enjoy this brief moment of consciousness!"
80,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8115180-jiny-s,5,"This book can be best described in three parts: anatomy, genetics, and psychology.Right from the start, reading the first few pages on the errors of human anatomy got me hooked. Learning about how the human eye is backwards, how our mucus has to travel upwards (its inefficiency and consequential prone to infections), how our nerves have to wind around our body (because of our evolutionary roots from fish), and so on, is like bringing the curious inner child inside of me to a candy store. Learning about all the weird but cool things about my own body is utterly fascinating.The second and third part was not as exciting for me, more of a reiteration of bio and psy 101, especially the last part, when the author describes biases, heuristics, and illusions. It was nonetheless interesting, but for me personally, I have already knew these things and thus the awe factor was removed.The author has a way of describing things (even technical) without being boring. I even enjoyed the long, meandering epilogue at the end, where the author contemplates about the future of humanity and so on."

At times, I wondered how in the world humans survived. I could really relate to the sections about why humans have bad knees and a tendency to gain weight but difficulty in losing weight.I do think he could have included more ""errors,"" such as teeth. I have always thought we should be able to grow another tooth if we lose one, like sharks are able to do.

This can lead to all sorts of havoc, which Lents discusses in an enjoyable and clear way. His tone is conversational and he uses humor to good effect.

86,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Folks who think ‘intelligent design’ does a better job of describing the miracle of nature that is the human body than ‘evolution by means of natural selection’ have some explaining to do. That’s because the ‘intelligence’ behind our present form is, in many ways, very, very bad at its job. In fact, it’s safe to say that any engineering major worth their salt could make numerous design improvements to our bodies without breaking a sweat. Need some examples?-	We eat, drink and breath through the same hole in our face, which makes choking a real hazard. Thousands of people die each year due to this design flaw. In fact, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death.-	Unlike most other animals, humans can’t make their own vitamin C (we have to consume it in our food). Many sailors died of scurvy before this fact was realized.-	Baby’s heads are too big for women’s pelvises. Before the advent of modern medicine, human infant (and maternal) mortality rates were some of the highest in the entire animal kingdom.-	Some people (myself included) have life-threatening allergies to common foods because our immune systems can’t distinguish between safe and unsafe proteins. -	We have too many bones in our wrists and ankles making them prone to injury. Not to mention the prevalence of knee and back problems within our species thanks to bad design. -	Our eyes aren’t that great, which is why 60% of the population wears eyeglasses. We also have a blind spot thanks to a backwards retina.-	Our maxillary sinuses drain upwards (against the pull of gravity), making us more prone than other species to sinus infections. -	Men’s testicles are external to their bodies leaving them exposed and vulnerable to injury (as any male bicycle rider surely knows all too well). -	Our mouths are too crowded for our teeth, which is why many people have their wisdom teeth surgically removed. We also only have 1 set of adult teeth, which means dentures are required once those are lost. Anyone who thinks these design flaws are ‘intelligent’ is not thinking clearly, which of course is indicative of yet another system error … our brains, which are so very easy to fool we need a systematic procedure to reduce biases, sloppy rationalizations, and erroneous conclusions … it’s called the ‘scientific method’. Thanks the application of this process we’ve learned many things about the natural world that benefit us in our daily lives and enabled technologies such as cell phones, antibiotics, aircraft and computers. As if that weren’t enough, the scientific method has also definitively demonstrated that ‘intelligent design’ is what scientists refer to as a 'failed hypothesis', otherwise known as a cockeyed load of half-baked hogwash. Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes describes many of the myriad ways our bodies are an agglomeration of kludged together parts. Why? Because that’s the way evolution works. It doesn’t have any forethought or design plan in mind and mutational changes can only make small modifications to structures that already exist. Since it can’t redesign anatomy from the bottom up to make it more effective, we’re stuck with what we have (at least until gene editing technology improves). Fortunately, medical advances and technology enable us to overcome some, though not all, of our physical deficiencies. In the case of my own (a severe allergy to tree nuts), food safety labeling requirements and increased awareness within the restaurant industry have significantly reduced risks of exposure. As to the book, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Lents has an engaging writing style that that is both entertaining and informative. Although I thought the epilog went off in a rather strange and irrelevant direction in its discussion of the Fermi Paradox, the Drake equation and intelligent alien life in the universe (which not only has little to do with the topic of this book, but the reason we haven’t discovered it has a simple explanation … it doesn’t exist … but that’s a discussion for another time)."
87,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Nathan Lents gives us a lively and interesting look at some of the major flaws of the human body--starting with our eyes, and working downward. Our lenses are backwards. Our wrists and ankles have extra, unnecessary bones that serve no real function. We have a variety of genetic diseases, more than most other species, and they don't get effectively selected against for a variety of frustrating reasons. Once a gene acquires a mutation, it tends to accumulate more mutations. Once that happens, the problem can't be fixed by another single mutation of the kind that caused the original problem. The deletion of our ability to manufacture our own vitamin C, like most mammals, got deleted in a common ancestor of primate species long ago. It wasn't selected against because all the early primates lived in the midst of a vitamin C-rich food supply. That mutation has been accumulating more mutations since long before genus homo arose. We're not getting it back.Others are even more frustrating. The mutation that causes sickle cell anemia causes a devastating, painful, deadly disease--if you get two copies of that gene, one each from father and mother. It ought to have been selected against long ago! Oh, except for one inconvenient fact. If you get only one copy of the disease, you have a higher than normal resistance to malaria. Malaria can also debilitate and kill you. Someone who has one copy of the sickle cell gene doesn't get sickle cell, and is less likely to get malaria, and more likely to survive malaria if they do. In regions where malaria is a major problem, people with one copy of the sickle cell gene will be more likely to live long enough to have more offspring, and thus more descendants--even though some of them will have sickle cell anemia due to getting two copies of the gene.Nor are we really fully adapted to walking upright, or to giving birth to children with such large brains. Our babies are born several months earlier than they ""should"" be, based on the degree of development they have at birth, even compared to our closest relatives, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo.I can't do credit to Lents' writing of this, or to L.J. Ganser's reading of it. It's informative and enjoyable.Recommended.I bought this audiobook."
88,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2778499-midwest-geek,4,"This was a surprisingly entertaining read. Lents must be a very popular lecturer, for he has a very self-effacing, approachable style. For a good summary and evaluation similar to mine, I recommend the review by Rebecca. I would add that the main theme of how evolution can unwittingly produce inefficient organisms is something that seems not widely appreciated. In particualar, although I knew some of these facts, such as the preponderence of junk DNA, I developed a greater appreciation of human inefficiencies that result from the nature of evolution.An early example in the book is that the retina of the eye is so poorly designed as to have its light sensors pointing toward the back of the head instead of toward the lens of the eye, leaving humans and other vertebrates much less sensitive to light intensity than they could be and leading to the well-known blind spot. I had not known that an independent evolutionary path to vision followed by cephalopods (such as octopi and squid) led to a far more sensible design with the light sensors facing forward instead of backward and without a blind spot. They can see the light from a single photon (like our best electronic detectors), whereas our eyes typically require a minimum of about 5 or 6 photons of comparable intensity before provoking a response. The book could be used to bolster the case against ""intelligent design"" but that isn't its intention.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in how humans came to be as we are. I got it from the library, but I will keep it in mind as a present for certain grandchildren when they get a little older."
89,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23635526-john-haake,4,"My wife and I read this together ... which proved wonderful fodder for the two of us to make fun of each others bodies (none of the flaws we made fun of where ever mentioned in the book).As indicated from our joking -- this book merely scratches the surface of all the flaws built into our bodies -- but the glitches, errors and basically left-over junk in our bodies that the author does cover is very interesting and gave me a lot to think about, which is just what I want out of a pop-science, science-lite type book.This book clearly puts into question the whole ""intelligent design"" argument, as one would hope if there was some divine being in charge of design of His/Her ultimate creation that they would have been a bit more precise on the ""intelligent"" part of that design -- be a forewarned creationist reader, you will not be getting a dose of support for ""superior"" design of these human bodies over and above those of the rest of the animal kingdom -- indeed, there is quite a bit of evidence to the contrary and the ""sacrifices/compromises"" the human body had to take on as a product of our increasing intelligence over other species. --- interestingly described in a section of the book about how other animals don't need supplemental vitamins because they produce their own.Of course, my favorite part of the book was about the virus graveyard -- fascinating, those little creatures bordering the fine line between ""life"" and ""non-life""Enjoy this read!"
90,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,4,"Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes by Nathan Lents admits from the get-go that there are more than enough books about how great and wondrous the human body is. Lents takes a whole different tack: how human bodies have huge design flaws, from big system like our bones to the DNA in every cell.  Why do we have a blind spot in each eye? It is because the retina is wired backwards. Why are the drains for our sinuses in the wrong place? To make room for our oversized brains. Is it really a good idea to take in food through the same opening that we use for breathing? Lents thinks definitely not. The wrist has way too many bones, grouped “...like a pile of rocks,” a turn of phrase that produces a vivid mental image. Human Errors brings up ideas about vitamins that I had never remotely considered. Why don’t dogs and other animals need vitamin C in their diets? Because they can make it themselves. Why can’t we? Because, through a genetic mutation, we lost that ability. Minerals, which always have to be consumed, cause us problems because we have trouble absorbing them. Calcium absorption gets worse as we age, and iron deficiency is the number one nutritional deficiency both in the US and in the world. Obesity is also a natural fallout from poor design.Focusing in on human DNA and running the numbers, Lents demonstrates that DNA are enormously wasteful, with 97% of DNA not “saying”anything. These include strings called pseudo genes, one of which causes us to not be able to generate our own vitamin C. Other strands of DNA are discarded bits of ancient viruses, and even pieces of our own genetic material, copied over and over like an office printer run amok. There are a myriad of problems with human reproductive systems, from the fact that the Fallopian tubes are not even connected to the ovaries (!) to the fact the sperm can only turn in one direction. Autoimmune diseases are just ongoing mistakes made by your body, plain and simple. Allergic reactions to poison ivy and bee stings fall in this same category. Memory is another area where we have big problems. Given only some information about an event, our brains try to fill in the gaps. In the case of gambling, our imperfect brains try to find patterns where there are none. Kudos to Human Errors for shining a light in dark places, providing me with new insights into how the body works (and doesn’t)."
91,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107567624-philip,3,"I'm a bit torn about this book. I want to like it more than I do.I love the idea of the book. How awesome isn't it to discover all our little inherited quirks and flaws compounded over hundreds of millions of years of evolution!? Brilliant, right!? To a degree, Lents delivers. However, it seems like he's cherry-picked the most commonly known oddities about our genetic make-up. If you already have some basic knowledge - or even familiarity - with our ""design"" flaws, you likely won't learn much. You may even stumble on a few things where he's apparently wrong - or, at least, where he's oversimplified something to the point of being wrong. Not to mention that - and, fyi, this may just be me - it makes my stomach churn when he illustrates something like our anecdotal bias and how it's so very wrong with - drum roll please... - yup, an anecdote! (I wish I had a pukey face emoji right about now). I'm also not stoked about the last part of the book where he ventures away from the actual topic into things like extraterrestrial life (or lack thereof), the Fermi paradox, and other things like that. Not that it isn't interesting, it is, but it just feels off in this book (also, same thing here, if you're reading a book like this, the Fermi paradox likely isn't a new concept to you... right?).Regardless, despite my little whine-fest above, I do like the book. It's a light read - which might actually be a positive to some (?), even if I would have preferred a little more substance - and it's fun to contemplate how things could end up so bonkers. I just wish there would have been more! I also think a lot of our problems today could be alleviated if more of humanity had the flaws he mentions, as well as others, in mind before going off half-cocked on each other!I also want to mention that my rating would have been different if Lents would have kept to the science of our evolutionary flaws (that s**t is awesome!). He could have then honed in a little more on each particular flaw and fleshed it out - as well as explored more of them. Had he done this I would say it's a solid 4-star, and we would probably have learned a ton more. But anyway... and in summary, if you happen to stumble on this quick little read, it's totally worth the half-day (or so) it takes to read :)."

I lost interest in last few chapters as they switched to more human behavior errors rather than anatomy. The evolution of the human compared to other mammals is very interesting. This book touches on a wide variety of errors our body has but is still so functional.
102,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1823965-valarie,5,"I enjoyed this book so much I’m probably going to buy a physical copy. The narration was entertaining and fascinating. The facts were well explained but sufficiently science-y that I wasn’t bored at all. The author clearly has a great sense of humor. If you want to learn more about how natural selection could have done better, I highly recommend this. Towards the end the book diverges a bit, in my opinion, from its original premise but is still engaging. Nathan Lents is no Mary Roach, but when I buy this book it will go on the same shelf. "
103,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book through NetGalley.]I found this to be both an informative and entertaining read. While the author doesn’t delve very deep into details (each subject in each chapter would probably warrant a book of its own), and although I wish there had been more developed explanations at times, I’m also aware that one book couldn’t tackle everything in one go—and he nevertheless provides enough information for a reader to go on research some more later on a given topic.I already knew some of the ‘human errors’ presented in the book (such as junk DNA and mutations), but definitely not others, such as why we get so many headcolds (our sinuses placed the wrong way), why we do actually make our own B12 vitamin but can’t use it (same with other vitamins—and this is why we need a varied diet, with all the problems it entails), or why our ways of procreating are, in fact, very inefficient compared to those of other mammals. So, discovering all this was fascinating, and the explanations provided also satisfy the unavoidable ‘why’ questions that rose immediately after (I’m very much a why person; every physician who attended me since I’ve learnt to speak can testify to this). For instance, we lost the ability to make our own vitamin C, whose absence will lead to scorbut and kill us; but the mutation that led to this defect wasn’t erased through evolution because it happened in areas where fruit was easily available, and a diet of fruit would compensate for our rotten GULO gene… until the latter stuck, happily passed around to descendants.I liked that some explanations went a bit further: it’s not only about this or that physical defect, but also about how we’re still wired for survival techniques and reactions dating back to prehistoric times, and how some of our modern behaviours are thus impacted. An extended example would be gambling, and why people in general have irrational reactions such as ‘now that I’ve lost ten times in a row, I -must- win, there’s no other way’ (though statistically, you could lose an 11th time), or will bet more and more when they’re on winning streak, and risk losing it all or more, rather than save those earnings. Those would go back to the way we interpreted situations to learn from them and survive (man sees a lion in a bush, concludes bushes often hide a lion, and then avoids bushes). Same with optical illusions, due to our brains’ ability to ‘fill in the blanks’.On the side of actual errors, I noticed a few (redundant words or phrases, that a last editing pass would probably remove). Nothing too bad, though.Conclusion: Due to the lack of deeper details and general simple writing, this book is probably more for laypeople rather than people with a strong scientific background—but even then, there’s still a chance that some of the ‘human errors’ may still be of interest to them.

104,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"We all know that the human body is not perfect. Any of us who wear glasses, get the flu, fall and land on our coccyx, take vitamins, or try to lose weight knows this first hand.In this book, Nathan Lents gives us a lot of scientific information about human development, how human systems work, and why our bodies evolved the way they did. What makes this book so special is that he presents all of this information in an easy to understand and entertaining fashion. He presents our faults and limitations clearly and in a way clever enough that you will often find yourself laughing at your own limitations.This is not to say that this book is all fun and games. Lents explains how poorly we deal with certain diseases, how the body often attacks itself, how errors occur when DNA replicates, the flaws in our reproductive system, and that all of us - if we live long enough- will get cancer. These are definitely not light topics but, again, he presents them in a way to help you understand the how and why they are part of our makeup.Many readers will have already heard of some of the ""glitches"" he mentions that are contained in the human body - such as the poor construction of the human eye or the pelvis being to small to all for easy births. However, many of the defects Lents presents are ones you haven't heard of or did not previously understand that they were ""built-in"" by evolution.Lent addresses how medical science has made major progress in learning about the human body and finding ways to deal with the ""blunders of nature"" but, also, how there are many that may be more than science can correct. He continues on to conjecture that if all of these problems can be addressed will we be able to live forever and, if so, what would that mean for our society and our planet?In the Epilogue, ""The Future of Humanity"", Lents moves from the daily glitches and moves into the areas of global warming, apocalyptic wars, space exploration, and the question of whether there is life elsewhere in the universe. While he does an excellent job of presenting his thoughts on these very important topics, I feel that they would have been better addressed in a different book than as an add-on to this one.Overall, I enjoyed reading Human Errors. I learned, I laughed, I cringed, and I came face to face with the many flaws that are a part of being a human being."
105,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,4,"Man was created by God. We are his perfect creation. Our perfection is evident in every detail of our design. Right? If you believe this, then you first need to Google Charles Darwin and evolution. Second, you need to take another look at the human body. Because we are full of defects. This book will give you a few examples of some of our most glaring flaws; flaws that can be found from head to toe, and in our body's architecture as well as in our DNA.What could possibly be wrong with having a shared channel for air and food? (This is a rhetorical question, but in case you really wonder, food gets stuck, and we die...). It has to be like that, you might argue. But that would be ignoring whales and dolphins. They eat with their mouth and breathe through a different hole on their back; they don’t risk choking. We also have genes for creating several vitamins, e.g., vitamin C – only they are broken. Usually, this doesn't matter because we get vitamin C in our diets and therefore natural selection has had not selected against this detect. But it is a defect nonetheless if we do not get any vitamin C for a while, as sailors crossing the Atlantic, we get sick and die – all because of our non-functional gene. The reason for our imperfections is that evolution cannot start over, it works by making small gradual changes. Evolution can only undo things partially, which is why we still have a tailbone which is by the way also useless – except for getting hurt...This book is a call for rationality. It provides a tiny grain of sand to balance the mountains of books glorifying the human body and its 'perfection.' To be sure the human body is impressive in many ways but perfect it is not. "
106,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8788163-yicheng-liu,4,"-Netgalley Review-This is a sharp and clear read; I have never read anything by this author before, but I was interested in medical writings, and tales of the human body intrigues me as a layman with no medical expertise. This book offers a broad look into the defect of the human body, the imperfect and haphazard nature of natural evolution, and what the future have in store for us as individuals and as a collective. The book describes humans as, to paraphrase lightly, imperfect creatures that are not exempt from evolution’s grasps. Just because of the efficiency in curing preexisting ailments and improving living conditions had skyrocketed, humanity has yet to reach past evolution as we are change with each passing generation. The author delivered on the premise and presented a well-reasoned conclusion that humanity have both the ability to better oneself and the ability to bring forth mutually assured destruction. The writing was not confusing nor is it filled with jargon, yet it conveys the point and delves deeply into analysing what exactly, biologically speaking, we are and whether we are truly the best evolution can do. Would recommend to readers interested in Medical sciences and and/or philosophy in relation humans especially with the advent of transhumanism and the influx of revolutionary medical techniques being developed at this very moment such as CRISPR or prothetic limbs that would ultimately be more powerful than our biological ones.. This is an easy read with simple and often humorous language that is bound to fascinate."
107,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18001516-kate-vane,4,"Evolution does not mean we are continually moving towards perfection. Mutations happen by chance, and they may or may not be good for us. If they don’t kill us and if they don’t stop us reproducing, they stick around.Human Errors details some of these ‘errors’ and includes some fascinating examples. Our dodgy knees are a hangover from our primate days, and were never meant to support us standing up. Our retinas are the wrong way round and we’d be much better off if we had the eyes of an octopus.There are chapters which focus on the more serious consequences of these errors – such as hereditary diseases and autoimmune conditions which lead the body to attack itself.I was fascinated by the chapter on reproduction and loved the image of menopausal orca whales leading hunting packs of young males, but when I thought about it later, I wasn’t clear whether the author thinks the menopause in humans is an error at all.There’s also an epilogue which is more speculative. Lents’ argument seems to be that the inventiveness of humans allows us to outpace our errors, or even turn them into strengths. However these strengths can also be weaknesses. He argues that selfishness and short-term thinking may well lead humanity to destroy itself and the planet. This seems to be more about philosophy than science.Overall though, this is an informative and entertaining read for a non-scientist like me and the quirky examples make the underlying facts more memorable.*I received a copy of Human Errors from the publisher via Netgalley."
108,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1619539-nancy,4,"Some Problems with Human EvolutionEvolution is a marvelous process. It allowed humans to reach status of the preeminent species on earth, but it came with a cost. Evolution is driven by mutations. They create new genes that allow for additional functionality, but it’s impossible to get rid of the old patterns. This leads to problems like backwards retinas, bad knees, swallowing and breathing through the same narrow channel and more. The book is witty and although it presents a great deal of technical information, the presentation is clear and amusing, suitable for a general audience. I enjoyed the book and learned about some problems with the human body I had never heard of before. I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that made the book more fun. The chapters are relatively short and the illustrations make it easy to understand some of the technical discussion. The notes section is extensive and whether you agree with his ideas or not provides references for future study. I recommend this book for anyone interested in biology or nutrition. There is a good chapter on why humans need such a varied diet based on some evolutionary problems.I received this book from Net Galley for this review."
109,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16203817-bartley-sharkey,5,"Ah yes, a book that doesn't appear to be a poorly disguised promotion for the author. Human Errors strikes a good balance between covering topics that most people will have heard of already and others that will be brand new. It may be described as a pretty dry topic but whether the bodily issues covered are relevant or not, I find them fascinating and feel like I've learned a little bit more about why our bodies are basically messed up and so prone to breaking down.Of course, this kind of book would be hopelessly boring if there wasn't any humour included so thankfully there is, although most of it would fit right in to a book of ""dad jokes"". Maybe the author could have consulted someone funny to help inject a little more, but at the same time it's by no means decisive in making the book pleasant to read.Having sped through this book in a week, I think it happened to be the kind of book I wanted to read at this moment and the main take away is not that of specific deficiencies of the human body, but the impression that not only is it incredible that evolution happened to bring us this far and that we are each somewhat akin to a soup of different cells and genes, somehow coordinating to keep us standing for long enough to enjoy this brief moment of consciousness!"
110,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8115180-jiny-s,5,"This book can be best described in three parts: anatomy, genetics, and psychology.Right from the start, reading the first few pages on the errors of human anatomy got me hooked. Learning about how the human eye is backwards, how our mucus has to travel upwards (its inefficiency and consequential prone to infections), how our nerves have to wind around our body (because of our evolutionary roots from fish), and so on, is like bringing the curious inner child inside of me to a candy store. Learning about all the weird but cool things about my own body is utterly fascinating.The second and third part was not as exciting for me, more of a reiteration of bio and psy 101, especially the last part, when the author describes biases, heuristics, and illusions. It was nonetheless interesting, but for me personally, I have already knew these things and thus the awe factor was removed.The author has a way of describing things (even technical) without being boring. I even enjoyed the long, meandering epilogue at the end, where the author contemplates about the future of humanity and so on."

I could really relate to the sections about why humans have bad knees and a tendency to gain weight but difficulty in losing weight.I do think he could have included more ""errors,"" such as teeth. I have always thought we should be able to grow another tooth if we lose one, like sharks are able to do. Also, I think the author did get a little ""preachy"" at times when discussing war and the environment.

This can lead to all sorts of havoc, which Lents discusses in an enjoyable and clear way. His tone is conversational and he uses humor to good effect.

116,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Folks who think ‘intelligent design’ does a better job of describing the miracle of nature that is the human body than ‘evolution by means of natural selection’ have some explaining to do. That’s because the ‘intelligence’ behind our present form is, in many ways, very, very bad at its job. In fact, it’s safe to say that any engineering major worth their salt could make numerous design improvements to our bodies without breaking a sweat. Need some examples?-	We eat, drink and breath through the same hole in our face, which makes choking a real hazard. Thousands of people die each year due to this design flaw. In fact, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death.-	Unlike most other animals, humans can’t make their own vitamin C (we have to consume it in our food). Many sailors died of scurvy before this fact was realized.-	Baby’s heads are too big for women’s pelvises. Before the advent of modern medicine, human infant (and maternal) mortality rates were some of the highest in the entire animal kingdom.-	Some people (myself included) have life-threatening allergies to common foods because our immune systems can’t distinguish between safe and unsafe proteins. -	We have too many bones in our wrists and ankles making them prone to injury. Not to mention the prevalence of knee and back problems within our species thanks to bad design. -	Our eyes aren’t that great, which is why 60% of the population wears eyeglasses. We also have a blind spot thanks to a backwards retina.-	Our maxillary sinuses drain upwards (against the pull of gravity), making us more prone than other species to sinus infections. -	Men’s testicles are external to their bodies leaving them exposed and vulnerable to injury (as any male bicycle rider surely knows all too well). -	Our mouths are too crowded for our teeth, which is why many people have their wisdom teeth surgically removed. We also only have 1 set of adult teeth, which means dentures are required once those are lost. Anyone who thinks these design flaws are ‘intelligent’ is not thinking clearly, which of course is indicative of yet another system error … our brains, which are so very easy to fool we need a systematic procedure to reduce biases, sloppy rationalizations, and erroneous conclusions … it’s called the ‘scientific method’. Thanks the application of this process we’ve learned many things about the natural world that benefit us in our daily lives and enabled technologies such as cell phones, antibiotics, aircraft and computers. As if that weren’t enough, the scientific method has also definitively demonstrated that ‘intelligent design’ is what scientists refer to as a 'failed hypothesis', otherwise known as a cockeyed load of half-baked hogwash. Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes describes many of the myriad ways our bodies are an agglomeration of kludged together parts. Why? Because that’s the way evolution works. It doesn’t have any forethought or design plan in mind and mutational changes can only make small modifications to structures that already exist. Since it can’t redesign anatomy from the bottom up to make it more effective, we’re stuck with what we have (at least until gene editing technology improves). Fortunately, medical advances and technology enable us to overcome some, though not all, of our physical deficiencies. In the case of my own (a severe allergy to tree nuts), food safety labeling requirements and increased awareness within the restaurant industry have significantly reduced risks of exposure. As to the book, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Lents has an engaging writing style that that is both entertaining and informative. Although I thought the epilog went off in a rather strange and irrelevant direction in its discussion of the Fermi Paradox, the Drake equation and intelligent alien life in the universe (which not only has little to do with the topic of this book, but the reason we haven’t discovered it has a simple explanation … it doesn’t exist … but that’s a discussion for another time)."
117,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Nathan Lents gives us a lively and interesting look at some of the major flaws of the human body--starting with our eyes, and working downward. Our lenses are backwards. Our wrists and ankles have extra, unnecessary bones that serve no real function. We have a variety of genetic diseases, more than most other species, and they don't get effectively selected against for a variety of frustrating reasons. Once a gene acquires a mutation, it tends to accumulate more mutations. Once that happens, the problem can't be fixed by another single mutation of the kind that caused the original problem. The deletion of our ability to manufacture our own vitamin C, like most mammals, got deleted in a common ancestor of primate species long ago. It wasn't selected against because all the early primates lived in the midst of a vitamin C-rich food supply. That mutation has been accumulating more mutations since long before genus homo arose. We're not getting it back.Others are even more frustrating. The mutation that causes sickle cell anemia causes a devastating, painful, deadly disease--if you get two copies of that gene, one each from father and mother. It ought to have been selected against long ago! Oh, except for one inconvenient fact. If you get only one copy of the disease, you have a higher than normal resistance to malaria. Malaria can also debilitate and kill you. Someone who has one copy of the sickle cell gene doesn't get sickle cell, and is less likely to get malaria, and more likely to survive malaria if they do. In regions where malaria is a major problem, people with one copy of the sickle cell gene will be more likely to live long enough to have more offspring, and thus more descendants--even though some of them will have sickle cell anemia due to getting two copies of the gene.Nor are we really fully adapted to walking upright, or to giving birth to children with such large brains. Our babies are born several months earlier than they ""should"" be, based on the degree of development they have at birth, even compared to our closest relatives, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo.I can't do credit to Lents' writing of this, or to L.J. Ganser's reading of it. It's informative and enjoyable.Recommended.I bought this audiobook."
118,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2778499-midwest-geek,4,"This was a surprisingly entertaining read. Lents must be a very popular lecturer, for he has a very self-effacing, approachable style. For a good summary and evaluation similar to mine, I recommend the review by Rebecca. I would add that the main theme of how evolution can unwittingly produce inefficient organisms is something that seems not widely appreciated. In particualar, although I knew some of these facts, such as the preponderence of junk DNA, I developed a greater appreciation of human inefficiencies that result from the nature of evolution.An early example in the book is that the retina of the eye is so poorly designed as to have its light sensors pointing toward the back of the head instead of toward the lens of the eye, leaving humans and other vertebrates much less sensitive to light intensity than they could be and leading to the well-known blind spot. I had not known that an independent evolutionary path to vision followed by cephalopods (such as octopi and squid) led to a far more sensible design with the light sensors facing forward instead of backward and without a blind spot. They can see the light from a single photon (like our best electronic detectors), whereas our eyes typically require a minimum of about 5 or 6 photons of comparable intensity before provoking a response. The book could be used to bolster the case against ""intelligent design"" but that isn't its intention.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in how humans came to be as we are. I got it from the library, but I will keep it in mind as a present for certain grandchildren when they get a little older."

120,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,4,"Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes by Nathan Lents admits from the get-go that there are more than enough books about how great and wondrous the human body is. Lents takes a whole different tack: how human bodies have huge design flaws, from big system like our bones to the DNA in every cell.  Why do we have a blind spot in each eye? It is because the retina is wired backwards. Why are the drains for our sinuses in the wrong place? To make room for our oversized brains. Is it really a good idea to take in food through the same opening that we use for breathing? Lents thinks definitely not. The wrist has way too many bones, grouped “...like a pile of rocks,” a turn of phrase that produces a vivid mental image. Human Errors brings up ideas about vitamins that I had never remotely considered. Why don’t dogs and other animals need vitamin C in their diets? Because they can make it themselves. Why can’t we? Because, through a genetic mutation, we lost that ability. Minerals, which always have to be consumed, cause us problems because we have trouble absorbing them. Calcium absorption gets worse as we age, and iron deficiency is the number one nutritional deficiency both in the US and in the world. Obesity is also a natural fallout from poor design.Focusing in on human DNA and running the numbers, Lents demonstrates that DNA are enormously wasteful, with 97% of DNA not “saying”anything. These include strings called pseudo genes, one of which causes us to not be able to generate our own vitamin C. Other strands of DNA are discarded bits of ancient viruses, and even pieces of our own genetic material, copied over and over like an office printer run amok. There are a myriad of problems with human reproductive systems, from the fact that the Fallopian tubes are not even connected to the ovaries (!) to the fact the sperm can only turn in one direction. Autoimmune diseases are just ongoing mistakes made by your body, plain and simple. Allergic reactions to poison ivy and bee stings fall in this same category. Memory is another area where we have big problems. Given only some information about an event, our brains try to fill in the gaps. In the case of gambling, our imperfect brains try to find patterns where there are none. Kudos to Human Errors for shining a light in dark places, providing me with new insights into how the body works (and doesn’t)."
121,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107567624-philip,3,"I'm a bit torn about this book. I want to like it more than I do.I love the idea of the book. How awesome isn't it to discover all our little inherited quirks and flaws compounded over hundreds of millions of years of evolution!? Brilliant, right!? To a degree, Lents delivers. However, it seems like he's cherry-picked the most commonly known oddities about our genetic make-up. If you already have some basic knowledge - or even familiarity - with our ""design"" flaws, you likely won't learn much. You may even stumble on a few things where he's apparently wrong - or, at least, where he's oversimplified something to the point of being wrong. Not to mention that - and, fyi, this may just be me - it makes my stomach churn when he illustrates something like our anecdotal bias and how it's so very wrong with - drum roll please... - yup, an anecdote! (I wish I had a pukey face emoji right about now). I'm also not stoked about the last part of the book where he ventures away from the actual topic into things like extraterrestrial life (or lack thereof), the Fermi paradox, and other things like that. Not that it isn't interesting, it is, but it just feels off in this book (also, same thing here, if you're reading a book like this, the Fermi paradox likely isn't a new concept to you... right?).Regardless, despite my little whine-fest above, I do like the book. It's a light read - which might actually be a positive to some (?), even if I would have preferred a little more substance - and it's fun to contemplate how things could end up so bonkers. I just wish there would have been more! I also think a lot of our problems today could be alleviated if more of humanity had the flaws he mentions, as well as others, in mind before going off half-cocked on each other!I also want to mention that my rating would have been different if Lents would have kept to the science of our evolutionary flaws (that s**t is awesome!). He could have then honed in a little more on each particular flaw and fleshed it out - as well as explored more of them. Had he done this I would say it's a solid 4-star, and we would probably have learned a ton more. But anyway... and in summary, if you happen to stumble on this quick little read, it's totally worth the half-day (or so) it takes to read :)."

Your point of view might be based on science: evolution isn't an end-game, or based on faith: we already know we're not perfect. Plus, it's a little pretentious, in my opinion, to base an entire book on what's wrong the human body; who are you complaining to?"

Brings up all of the issues inherent in human biology (both physiological and psychological) that make great sense from an evolutionary standpoint, but very little in a modern context. I definitely recommend it!"
131,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67762255-brooke,4,For anatomy nerds like myself the first 3/4 of this book is excellent. I lost interest in last few chapters as they switched to more human behavior errors rather than anatomy. The evolution of the human compared to other mammals is very interesting. This book touches on a wide variety of errors our body has but is still so functional.
132,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1823965-valarie,5,"I enjoyed this book so much I’m probably going to buy a physical copy. The narration was entertaining and fascinating. The facts were well explained but sufficiently science-y that I wasn’t bored at all. The author clearly has a great sense of humor. If you want to learn more about how natural selection could have done better, I highly recommend this. Towards the end the book diverges a bit, in my opinion, from its original premise but is still engaging. Nathan Lents is no Mary Roach, but when I buy this book it will go on the same shelf. "
133,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book through NetGalley.]I found this to be both an informative and entertaining read. While the author doesn’t delve very deep into details (each subject in each chapter would probably warrant a book of its own), and although I wish there had been more developed explanations at times, I’m also aware that one book couldn’t tackle everything in one go—and he nevertheless provides enough information for a reader to go on research some more later on a given topic.I already knew some of the ‘human errors’ presented in the book (such as junk DNA and mutations), but definitely not others, such as why we get so many headcolds (our sinuses placed the wrong way), why we do actually make our own B12 vitamin but can’t use it (same with other vitamins—and this is why we need a varied diet, with all the problems it entails), or why our ways of procreating are, in fact, very inefficient compared to those of other mammals. So, discovering all this was fascinating, and the explanations provided also satisfy the unavoidable ‘why’ questions that rose immediately after (I’m very much a why person; every physician who attended me since I’ve learnt to speak can testify to this). For instance, we lost the ability to make our own vitamin C, whose absence will lead to scorbut and kill us; but the mutation that led to this defect wasn’t erased through evolution because it happened in areas where fruit was easily available, and a diet of fruit would compensate for our rotten GULO gene… until the latter stuck, happily passed around to descendants.I liked that some explanations went a bit further: it’s not only about this or that physical defect, but also about how we’re still wired for survival techniques and reactions dating back to prehistoric times, and how some of our modern behaviours are thus impacted. An extended example would be gambling, and why people in general have irrational reactions such as ‘now that I’ve lost ten times in a row, I -must- win, there’s no other way’ (though statistically, you could lose an 11th time), or will bet more and more when they’re on winning streak, and risk losing it all or more, rather than save those earnings. Those would go back to the way we interpreted situations to learn from them and survive (man sees a lion in a bush, concludes bushes often hide a lion, and then avoids bushes). Same with optical illusions, due to our brains’ ability to ‘fill in the blanks’.On the side of actual errors, I noticed a few (redundant words or phrases, that a last editing pass would probably remove). Nothing too bad, though.Conclusion: Due to the lack of deeper details and general simple writing, this book is probably more for laypeople rather than people with a strong scientific background—but even then, there’s still a chance that some of the ‘human errors’ may still be of interest to them. "
134,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"We all know that the human body is not perfect. Any of us who wear glasses, get the flu, fall and land on our coccyx, take vitamins, or try to lose weight knows this first hand.In this book, Nathan Lents gives us a lot of scientific information about human development, how human systems work, and why our bodies evolved the way they did. What makes this book so special is that he presents all of this information in an easy to understand and entertaining fashion. He presents our faults and limitations clearly and in a way clever enough that you will often find yourself laughing at your own limitations.This is not to say that this book is all fun and games. Lents explains how poorly we deal with certain diseases, how the body often attacks itself, how errors occur when DNA replicates, the flaws in our reproductive system, and that all of us - if we live long enough- will get cancer. These are definitely not light topics but, again, he presents them in a way to help you understand the how and why they are part of our makeup.Many readers will have already heard of some of the ""glitches"" he mentions that are contained in the human body - such as the poor construction of the human eye or the pelvis being to small to all for easy births. However, many of the defects Lents presents are ones you haven't heard of or did not previously understand that they were ""built-in"" by evolution.Lent addresses how medical science has made major progress in learning about the human body and finding ways to deal with the ""blunders of nature"" but, also, how there are many that may be more than science can correct. He continues on to conjecture that if all of these problems can be addressed will we be able to live forever and, if so, what would that mean for our society and our planet?In the Epilogue, ""The Future of Humanity"", Lents moves from the daily glitches and moves into the areas of global warming, apocalyptic wars, space exploration, and the question of whether there is life elsewhere in the universe. While he does an excellent job of presenting his thoughts on these very important topics, I feel that they would have been better addressed in a different book than as an add-on to this one.Overall, I enjoyed reading Human Errors. I learned, I laughed, I cringed, and I came face to face with the many flaws that are a part of being a human being."
135,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,4,"Man was created by God. We are his perfect creation. Our perfection is evident in every detail of our design. Right? If you believe this, then you first need to Google Charles Darwin and evolution. Second, you need to take another look at the human body. Because we are full of defects. This book will give you a few examples of some of our most glaring flaws; flaws that can be found from head to toe, and in our body's architecture as well as in our DNA.What could possibly be wrong with having a shared channel for air and food? (This is a rhetorical question, but in case you really wonder, food gets stuck, and we die...). It has to be like that, you might argue. But that would be ignoring whales and dolphins. They eat with their mouth and breathe through a different hole on their back; they don’t risk choking. We also have genes for creating several vitamins, e.g., vitamin C – only they are broken. Usually, this doesn't matter because we get vitamin C in our diets and therefore natural selection has had not selected against this detect. But it is a defect nonetheless if we do not get any vitamin C for a while, as sailors crossing the Atlantic, we get sick and die – all because of our non-functional gene. The reason for our imperfections is that evolution cannot start over, it works by making small gradual changes. Evolution can only undo things partially, which is why we still have a tailbone which is by the way also useless – except for getting hurt...This book is a call for rationality. It provides a tiny grain of sand to balance the mountains of books glorifying the human body and its 'perfection.' To be sure the human body is impressive in many ways but perfect it is not. "

This book offers a broad look into the defect of the human body, the imperfect and haphazard nature of natural evolution, and what the future have in store for us as individuals and as a collective. The book describes humans as, to paraphrase lightly, imperfect creatures that are not exempt from evolution’s grasps. Just because of the efficiency in curing preexisting ailments and improving living conditions had skyrocketed, humanity has yet to reach past evolution as we are change with each passing generation. The author delivered on the premise and presented a well-reasoned conclusion that humanity have both the ability to better oneself and the ability to bring forth mutually assured destruction. The writing was not confusing nor is it filled with jargon, yet it conveys the point and delves deeply into analysing what exactly, biologically speaking, we are and whether we are truly the best evolution can do. Would recommend to readers interested in Medical sciences and and/or philosophy in relation humans especially with the advent of transhumanism and the influx of revolutionary medical techniques being developed at this very moment such as CRISPR or prothetic limbs that would ultimately be more powerful than our biological ones.. This is an easy read with simple and often humorous language that is bound to fascinate."
137,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18001516-kate-vane,4,"Evolution does not mean we are continually moving towards perfection. Mutations happen by chance, and they may or may not be good for us. If they don’t kill us and if they don’t stop us reproducing, they stick around.Human Errors details some of these ‘errors’ and includes some fascinating examples. Our dodgy knees are a hangover from our primate days, and were never meant to support us standing up. Our retinas are the wrong way round and we’d be much better off if we had the eyes of an octopus.There are chapters which focus on the more serious consequences of these errors – such as hereditary diseases and autoimmune conditions which lead the body to attack itself.I was fascinated by the chapter on reproduction and loved the image of menopausal orca whales leading hunting packs of young males, but when I thought about it later, I wasn’t clear whether the author thinks the menopause in humans is an error at all.There’s also an epilogue which is more speculative. Lents’ argument seems to be that the inventiveness of humans allows us to outpace our errors, or even turn them into strengths. However these strengths can also be weaknesses. He argues that selfishness and short-term thinking may well lead humanity to destroy itself and the planet. This seems to be more about philosophy than science.Overall though, this is an informative and entertaining read for a non-scientist like me and the quirky examples make the underlying facts more memorable.*I received a copy of Human Errors from the publisher via Netgalley."
138,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1619539-nancy,4,"Some Problems with Human EvolutionEvolution is a marvelous process. It allowed humans to reach status of the preeminent species on earth, but it came with a cost. Evolution is driven by mutations. They create new genes that allow for additional functionality, but it’s impossible to get rid of the old patterns. This leads to problems like backwards retinas, bad knees, swallowing and breathing through the same narrow channel and more. The book is witty and although it presents a great deal of technical information, the presentation is clear and amusing, suitable for a general audience. I enjoyed the book and learned about some problems with the human body I had never heard of before. I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that made the book more fun. The chapters are relatively short and the illustrations make it easy to understand some of the technical discussion. The notes section is extensive and whether you agree with his ideas or not provides references for future study. I recommend this book for anyone interested in biology or nutrition. There is a good chapter on why humans need such a varied diet based on some evolutionary problems.I received this book from Net Galley for this review."
139,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16203817-bartley-sharkey,5,"Ah yes, a book that doesn't appear to be a poorly disguised promotion for the author. Human Errors strikes a good balance between covering topics that most people will have heard of already and others that will be brand new. It may be described as a pretty dry topic but whether the bodily issues covered are relevant or not, I find them fascinating and feel like I've learned a little bit more about why our bodies are basically messed up and so prone to breaking down.Of course, this kind of book would be hopelessly boring if there wasn't any humour included so thankfully there is, although most of it would fit right in to a book of ""dad jokes"". Maybe the author could have consulted someone funny to help inject a little more, but at the same time it's by no means decisive in making the book pleasant to read.Having sped through this book in a week, I think it happened to be the kind of book I wanted to read at this moment and the main take away is not that of specific deficiencies of the human body, but the impression that not only is it incredible that evolution happened to bring us this far and that we are each somewhat akin to a soup of different cells and genes, somehow coordinating to keep us standing for long enough to enjoy this brief moment of consciousness!"
140,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8115180-jiny-s,5,"This book can be best described in three parts: anatomy, genetics, and psychology.Right from the start, reading the first few pages on the errors of human anatomy got me hooked. Learning about how the human eye is backwards, how our mucus has to travel upwards (its inefficiency and consequential prone to infections), how our nerves have to wind around our body (because of our evolutionary roots from fish), and so on, is like bringing the curious inner child inside of me to a candy store. Learning about all the weird but cool things about my own body is utterly fascinating.The second and third part was not as exciting for me, more of a reiteration of bio and psy 101, especially the last part, when the author describes biases, heuristics, and illusions. It was nonetheless interesting, but for me personally, I have already knew these things and thus the awe factor was removed.The author has a way of describing things (even technical) without being boring.

I could really relate to the sections about why humans have bad knees and a tendency to gain weight but difficulty in losing weight.I do think he could have included more ""errors,"" such as teeth. I have always thought we should be able to grow another tooth if we lose one, like sharks are able to do.

146,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Folks who think ‘intelligent design’ does a better job of describing the miracle of nature that is the human body than ‘evolution by means of natural selection’ have some explaining to do. That’s because the ‘intelligence’ behind our present form is, in many ways, very, very bad at its job. In fact, it’s safe to say that any engineering major worth their salt could make numerous design improvements to our bodies without breaking a sweat. Need some examples?-	We eat, drink and breath through the same hole in our face, which makes choking a real hazard. Thousands of people die each year due to this design flaw. In fact, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death.-	Unlike most other animals, humans can’t make their own vitamin C (we have to consume it in our food). Many sailors died of scurvy before this fact was realized.-	Baby’s heads are too big for women’s pelvises. Before the advent of modern medicine, human infant (and maternal) mortality rates were some of the highest in the entire animal kingdom.-	Some people (myself included) have life-threatening allergies to common foods because our immune systems can’t distinguish between safe and unsafe proteins. -	We have too many bones in our wrists and ankles making them prone to injury. Not to mention the prevalence of knee and back problems within our species thanks to bad design. -	Our eyes aren’t that great, which is why 60% of the population wears eyeglasses. We also have a blind spot thanks to a backwards retina.-	Our maxillary sinuses drain upwards (against the pull of gravity), making us more prone than other species to sinus infections. -	Men’s testicles are external to their bodies leaving them exposed and vulnerable to injury (as any male bicycle rider surely knows all too well). -	Our mouths are too crowded for our teeth, which is why many people have their wisdom teeth surgically removed. We also only have 1 set of adult teeth, which means dentures are required once those are lost. Anyone who thinks these design flaws are ‘intelligent’ is not thinking clearly, which of course is indicative of yet another system error … our brains, which are so very easy to fool we need a systematic procedure to reduce biases, sloppy rationalizations, and erroneous conclusions … it’s called the ‘scientific method’. Thanks the application of this process we’ve learned many things about the natural world that benefit us in our daily lives and enabled technologies such as cell phones, antibiotics, aircraft and computers. As if that weren’t enough, the scientific method has also definitively demonstrated that ‘intelligent design’ is what scientists refer to as a 'failed hypothesis', otherwise known as a cockeyed load of half-baked hogwash. Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes describes many of the myriad ways our bodies are an agglomeration of kludged together parts. Why? Because that’s the way evolution works. It doesn’t have any forethought or design plan in mind and mutational changes can only make small modifications to structures that already exist. Since it can’t redesign anatomy from the bottom up to make it more effective, we’re stuck with what we have (at least until gene editing technology improves). Fortunately, medical advances and technology enable us to overcome some, though not all, of our physical deficiencies. In the case of my own (a severe allergy to tree nuts), food safety labeling requirements and increased awareness within the restaurant industry have significantly reduced risks of exposure. As to the book, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Lents has an engaging writing style that that is both entertaining and informative. Although I thought the epilog went off in a rather strange and irrelevant direction in its discussion of the Fermi Paradox, the Drake equation and intelligent alien life in the universe (which not only has little to do with the topic of this book, but the reason we haven’t discovered it has a simple explanation … it doesn’t exist … but that’s a discussion for another time)."
147,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Nathan Lents gives us a lively and interesting look at some of the major flaws of the human body--starting with our eyes, and working downward. Our lenses are backwards. Our wrists and ankles have extra, unnecessary bones that serve no real function. We have a variety of genetic diseases, more than most other species, and they don't get effectively selected against for a variety of frustrating reasons. Once a gene acquires a mutation, it tends to accumulate more mutations. Once that happens, the problem can't be fixed by another single mutation of the kind that caused the original problem. The deletion of our ability to manufacture our own vitamin C, like most mammals, got deleted in a common ancestor of primate species long ago. It wasn't selected against because all the early primates lived in the midst of a vitamin C-rich food supply. That mutation has been accumulating more mutations since long before genus homo arose. We're not getting it back.Others are even more frustrating. The mutation that causes sickle cell anemia causes a devastating, painful, deadly disease--if you get two copies of that gene, one each from father and mother. It ought to have been selected against long ago! Oh, except for one inconvenient fact. If you get only one copy of the disease, you have a higher than normal resistance to malaria. Malaria can also debilitate and kill you. Someone who has one copy of the sickle cell gene doesn't get sickle cell, and is less likely to get malaria, and more likely to survive malaria if they do. In regions where malaria is a major problem, people with one copy of the sickle cell gene will be more likely to live long enough to have more offspring, and thus more descendants--even though some of them will have sickle cell anemia due to getting two copies of the gene.Nor are we really fully adapted to walking upright, or to giving birth to children with such large brains. Our babies are born several months earlier than they ""should"" be, based on the degree of development they have at birth, even compared to our closest relatives, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo.I can't do credit to Lents' writing of this, or to L.J. Ganser's reading of it. It's informative and enjoyable.Recommended.I bought this audiobook."
148,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2778499-midwest-geek,4,"This was a surprisingly entertaining read. Lents must be a very popular lecturer, for he has a very self-effacing, approachable style. For a good summary and evaluation similar to mine, I recommend the review by Rebecca. I would add that the main theme of how evolution can unwittingly produce inefficient organisms is something that seems not widely appreciated. In particualar, although I knew some of these facts, such as the preponderence of junk DNA, I developed a greater appreciation of human inefficiencies that result from the nature of evolution.An early example in the book is that the retina of the eye is so poorly designed as to have its light sensors pointing toward the back of the head instead of toward the lens of the eye, leaving humans and other vertebrates much less sensitive to light intensity than they could be and leading to the well-known blind spot. I had not known that an independent evolutionary path to vision followed by cephalopods (such as octopi and squid) led to a far more sensible design with the light sensors facing forward instead of backward and without a blind spot. They can see the light from a single photon (like our best electronic detectors), whereas our eyes typically require a minimum of about 5 or 6 photons of comparable intensity before provoking a response. The book could be used to bolster the case against ""intelligent design"" but that isn't its intention.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in how humans came to be as we are. I got it from the library, but I will keep it in mind as a present for certain grandchildren when they get a little older."

150,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,4,"Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes by Nathan Lents admits from the get-go that there are more than enough books about how great and wondrous the human body is. Lents takes a whole different tack: how human bodies have huge design flaws, from big system like our bones to the DNA in every cell.  Why do we have a blind spot in each eye? It is because the retina is wired backwards. Why are the drains for our sinuses in the wrong place? To make room for our oversized brains. Is it really a good idea to take in food through the same opening that we use for breathing? Lents thinks definitely not. The wrist has way too many bones, grouped “...like a pile of rocks,” a turn of phrase that produces a vivid mental image. Human Errors brings up ideas about vitamins that I had never remotely considered. Why don’t dogs and other animals need vitamin C in their diets? Because they can make it themselves. Why can’t we? Because, through a genetic mutation, we lost that ability. Minerals, which always have to be consumed, cause us problems because we have trouble absorbing them. Calcium absorption gets worse as we age, and iron deficiency is the number one nutritional deficiency both in the US and in the world. Obesity is also a natural fallout from poor design.Focusing in on human DNA and running the numbers, Lents demonstrates that DNA are enormously wasteful, with 97% of DNA not “saying”anything. These include strings called pseudo genes, one of which causes us to not be able to generate our own vitamin C. Other strands of DNA are discarded bits of ancient viruses, and even pieces of our own genetic material, copied over and over like an office printer run amok. There are a myriad of problems with human reproductive systems, from the fact that the Fallopian tubes are not even connected to the ovaries (!) to the fact the sperm can only turn in one direction. Autoimmune diseases are just ongoing mistakes made by your body, plain and simple. Allergic reactions to poison ivy and bee stings fall in this same category. Memory is another area where we have big problems. Given only some information about an event, our brains try to fill in the gaps. In the case of gambling, our imperfect brains try to find patterns where there are none. Kudos to Human Errors for shining a light in dark places, providing me with new insights into how the body works (and doesn’t)."
151,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107567624-philip,3,"I'm a bit torn about this book. I want to like it more than I do.I love the idea of the book. How awesome isn't it to discover all our little inherited quirks and flaws compounded over hundreds of millions of years of evolution!? Brilliant, right!? To a degree, Lents delivers. However, it seems like he's cherry-picked the most commonly known oddities about our genetic make-up. If you already have some basic knowledge - or even familiarity - with our ""design"" flaws, you likely won't learn much. You may even stumble on a few things where he's apparently wrong - or, at least, where he's oversimplified something to the point of being wrong. Not to mention that - and, fyi, this may just be me - it makes my stomach churn when he illustrates something like our anecdotal bias and how it's so very wrong with - drum roll please... - yup, an anecdote! (I wish I had a pukey face emoji right about now). I'm also not stoked about the last part of the book where he ventures away from the actual topic into things like extraterrestrial life (or lack thereof), the Fermi paradox, and other things like that. Not that it isn't interesting, it is, but it just feels off in this book (also, same thing here, if you're reading a book like this, the Fermi paradox likely isn't a new concept to you... right?).Regardless, despite my little whine-fest above, I do like the book. It's a light read - which might actually be a positive to some (?), even if I would have preferred a little more substance - and it's fun to contemplate how things could end up so bonkers. I just wish there would have been more! I also think a lot of our problems today could be alleviated if more of humanity had the flaws he mentions, as well as others, in mind before going off half-cocked on each other!I also want to mention that my rating would have been different if Lents would have kept to the science of our evolutionary flaws (that s**t is awesome!). He could have then honed in a little more on each particular flaw and fleshed it out - as well as explored more of them. Had he done this I would say it's a solid 4-star, and we would probably have learned a ton more.

It was with the understanding that I would post a review on Net Galley, Goodreads, Amazon, Barnes and Noble and my fiction book review blog. I also posted it to my Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google Plus pages.I requested this book as the desription sounded fascinating. It is the first book by Nathan H. Lents that I have read.This book is a very good read. The subtitle of the book provides a good synopsis - a panorama of our glitches, from pointless bones to broken genes. The author presents the subjects in an easy to understand and read fashion. While it addresses how hard it is for evolution to correct itself once a change has been made (whether purposeful or by accident), a little more of the science and/or research behind it would have been helpful.That said, I do recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in why our bodies are not the perfect biological machine (and far from it)."
153,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157556-lucas-h-golding,5,"A Wonderful Evolution bookThis is a fantastic science book. It’s focus is on the flaws of the human body, anatomically, physiologically and genetically. But the genius of the book is that it really makes the reader understand evolution so much clearer. Our genes do there best to prepare us for life but there are some very odd peculiarities that just don’t make sense from a “intelligent designer” perspective. From allergies to auto immune diseases such as lupus, our bodies aren’t always looking out for our best interest. Read this book, it’s entertaining and well written and you will definitely learn some valuable information."
154,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3476302-jeanette-blain,4,"Our bodies are amazing. Even more so given the impersonal and imperfect processes of evolution. It's interesting to read how we came to be stuck with some unfortunate limitations, yet still, dominate as a species. For a book about science facts,  Human Errors shines in that it's not super technical, but not dumbed-down to a childish level. I think this book hits the sweet spot for what it is. I've read books in the (what I'll call) rundown-of-interesting-facts genre that are far less satisfying.Thanks to NetGalley and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for a digital ARC. All views are my own."

Your point of view might be based on science: evolution isn't an end-game, or based on faith: we already know we're not perfect. Plus, it's a little pretentious, in my opinion, to base an entire book on what's wrong the human body; who are you complaining to?"

I lost interest in last few chapters as they switched to more human behavior errors rather than anatomy. The evolution of the human compared to other mammals is very interesting. This book touches on a wide variety of errors our body has but is still so functional.

If you want to learn more about how natural selection could have done better, I highly recommend this. Towards the end the book diverges a bit, in my opinion, from its original premise but is still engaging. Nathan Lents is no Mary Roach, but when I buy this book it will go on the same shelf. "
163,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book through NetGalley.]I found this to be both an informative and entertaining read. While the author doesn’t delve very deep into details (each subject in each chapter would probably warrant a book of its own), and although I wish there had been more developed explanations at times, I’m also aware that one book couldn’t tackle everything in one go—and he nevertheless provides enough information for a reader to go on research some more later on a given topic.I already knew some of the ‘human errors’ presented in the book (such as junk DNA and mutations), but definitely not others, such as why we get so many headcolds (our sinuses placed the wrong way), why we do actually make our own B12 vitamin but can’t use it (same with other vitamins—and this is why we need a varied diet, with all the problems it entails), or why our ways of procreating are, in fact, very inefficient compared to those of other mammals. So, discovering all this was fascinating, and the explanations provided also satisfy the unavoidable ‘why’ questions that rose immediately after (I’m very much a why person; every physician who attended me since I’ve learnt to speak can testify to this). For instance, we lost the ability to make our own vitamin C, whose absence will lead to scorbut and kill us; but the mutation that led to this defect wasn’t erased through evolution because it happened in areas where fruit was easily available, and a diet of fruit would compensate for our rotten GULO gene… until the latter stuck, happily passed around to descendants.I liked that some explanations went a bit further: it’s not only about this or that physical defect, but also about how we’re still wired for survival techniques and reactions dating back to prehistoric times, and how some of our modern behaviours are thus impacted. An extended example would be gambling, and why people in general have irrational reactions such as ‘now that I’ve lost ten times in a row, I -must- win, there’s no other way’ (though statistically, you could lose an 11th time), or will bet more and more when they’re on winning streak, and risk losing it all or more, rather than save those earnings. Those would go back to the way we interpreted situations to learn from them and survive (man sees a lion in a bush, concludes bushes often hide a lion, and then avoids bushes). Same with optical illusions, due to our brains’ ability to ‘fill in the blanks’.On the side of actual errors, I noticed a few (redundant words or phrases, that a last editing pass would probably remove). Nothing too bad, though.Conclusion: Due to the lack of deeper details and general simple writing, this book is probably more for laypeople rather than people with a strong scientific background—but even then, there’s still a chance that some of the ‘human errors’ may still be of interest to them. "
164,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"We all know that the human body is not perfect. Any of us who wear glasses, get the flu, fall and land on our coccyx, take vitamins, or try to lose weight knows this first hand.In this book, Nathan Lents gives us a lot of scientific information about human development, how human systems work, and why our bodies evolved the way they did. What makes this book so special is that he presents all of this information in an easy to understand and entertaining fashion. He presents our faults and limitations clearly and in a way clever enough that you will often find yourself laughing at your own limitations.This is not to say that this book is all fun and games. Lents explains how poorly we deal with certain diseases, how the body often attacks itself, how errors occur when DNA replicates, the flaws in our reproductive system, and that all of us - if we live long enough- will get cancer. These are definitely not light topics but, again, he presents them in a way to help you understand the how and why they are part of our makeup.Many readers will have already heard of some of the ""glitches"" he mentions that are contained in the human body - such as the poor construction of the human eye or the pelvis being to small to all for easy births. However, many of the defects Lents presents are ones you haven't heard of or did not previously understand that they were ""built-in"" by evolution.Lent addresses how medical science has made major progress in learning about the human body and finding ways to deal with the ""blunders of nature"" but, also, how there are many that may be more than science can correct. He continues on to conjecture that if all of these problems can be addressed will we be able to live forever and, if so, what would that mean for our society and our planet?In the Epilogue, ""The Future of Humanity"", Lents moves from the daily glitches and moves into the areas of global warming, apocalyptic wars, space exploration, and the question of whether there is life elsewhere in the universe. While he does an excellent job of presenting his thoughts on these very important topics, I feel that they would have been better addressed in a different book than as an add-on to this one.Overall, I enjoyed reading Human Errors. I learned, I laughed, I cringed, and I came face to face with the many flaws that are a part of being a human being."
165,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,4,"Man was created by God. We are his perfect creation. Our perfection is evident in every detail of our design. Right? If you believe this, then you first need to Google Charles Darwin and evolution. Second, you need to take another look at the human body. Because we are full of defects. This book will give you a few examples of some of our most glaring flaws; flaws that can be found from head to toe, and in our body's architecture as well as in our DNA.What could possibly be wrong with having a shared channel for air and food? (This is a rhetorical question, but in case you really wonder, food gets stuck, and we die...). It has to be like that, you might argue. But that would be ignoring whales and dolphins. They eat with their mouth and breathe through a different hole on their back; they don’t risk choking. We also have genes for creating several vitamins, e.g., vitamin C – only they are broken. Usually, this doesn't matter because we get vitamin C in our diets and therefore natural selection has had not selected against this detect. But it is a defect nonetheless if we do not get any vitamin C for a while, as sailors crossing the Atlantic, we get sick and die – all because of our non-functional gene. The reason for our imperfections is that evolution cannot start over, it works by making small gradual changes. Evolution can only undo things partially, which is why we still have a tailbone which is by the way also useless – except for getting hurt...This book is a call for rationality. It provides a tiny grain of sand to balance the mountains of books glorifying the human body and its 'perfection.' To be sure the human body is impressive in many ways but perfect it is not. "

This book offers a broad look into the defect of the human body, the imperfect and haphazard nature of natural evolution, and what the future have in store for us as individuals and as a collective. The book describes humans as, to paraphrase lightly, imperfect creatures that are not exempt from evolution’s grasps. Just because of the efficiency in curing preexisting ailments and improving living conditions had skyrocketed, humanity has yet to reach past evolution as we are change with each passing generation. The author delivered on the premise and presented a well-reasoned conclusion that humanity have both the ability to better oneself and the ability to bring forth mutually assured destruction. The writing was not confusing nor is it filled with jargon, yet it conveys the point and delves deeply into analysing what exactly, biologically speaking, we are and whether we are truly the best evolution can do. Would recommend to readers interested in Medical sciences and and/or philosophy in relation humans especially with the advent of transhumanism and the influx of revolutionary medical techniques being developed at this very moment such as CRISPR or prothetic limbs that would ultimately be more powerful than our biological ones.. This is an easy read with simple and often humorous language that is bound to fascinate."
167,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18001516-kate-vane,4,"Evolution does not mean we are continually moving towards perfection. Mutations happen by chance, and they may or may not be good for us. If they don’t kill us and if they don’t stop us reproducing, they stick around.Human Errors details some of these ‘errors’ and includes some fascinating examples. Our dodgy knees are a hangover from our primate days, and were never meant to support us standing up. Our retinas are the wrong way round and we’d be much better off if we had the eyes of an octopus.There are chapters which focus on the more serious consequences of these errors – such as hereditary diseases and autoimmune conditions which lead the body to attack itself.I was fascinated by the chapter on reproduction and loved the image of menopausal orca whales leading hunting packs of young males, but when I thought about it later, I wasn’t clear whether the author thinks the menopause in humans is an error at all.There’s also an epilogue which is more speculative. Lents’ argument seems to be that the inventiveness of humans allows us to outpace our errors, or even turn them into strengths. However these strengths can also be weaknesses. He argues that selfishness and short-term thinking may well lead humanity to destroy itself and the planet. This seems to be more about philosophy than science.Overall though, this is an informative and entertaining read for a non-scientist like me and the quirky examples make the underlying facts more memorable.*I received a copy of Human Errors from the publisher via Netgalley."
168,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1619539-nancy,4,"Some Problems with Human EvolutionEvolution is a marvelous process. It allowed humans to reach status of the preeminent species on earth, but it came with a cost. Evolution is driven by mutations. They create new genes that allow for additional functionality, but it’s impossible to get rid of the old patterns. This leads to problems like backwards retinas, bad knees, swallowing and breathing through the same narrow channel and more. The book is witty and although it presents a great deal of technical information, the presentation is clear and amusing, suitable for a general audience. I enjoyed the book and learned about some problems with the human body I had never heard of before. I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that made the book more fun. The chapters are relatively short and the illustrations make it easy to understand some of the technical discussion. The notes section is extensive and whether you agree with his ideas or not provides references for future study. I recommend this book for anyone interested in biology or nutrition. There is a good chapter on why humans need such a varied diet based on some evolutionary problems.I received this book from Net Galley for this review."
169,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16203817-bartley-sharkey,5,"Ah yes, a book that doesn't appear to be a poorly disguised promotion for the author. Human Errors strikes a good balance between covering topics that most people will have heard of already and others that will be brand new. It may be described as a pretty dry topic but whether the bodily issues covered are relevant or not, I find them fascinating and feel like I've learned a little bit more about why our bodies are basically messed up and so prone to breaking down.Of course, this kind of book would be hopelessly boring if there wasn't any humour included so thankfully there is, although most of it would fit right in to a book of ""dad jokes"". Maybe the author could have consulted someone funny to help inject a little more, but at the same time it's by no means decisive in making the book pleasant to read.Having sped through this book in a week, I think it happened to be the kind of book I wanted to read at this moment and the main take away is not that of specific deficiencies of the human body, but the impression that not only is it incredible that evolution happened to bring us this far and that we are each somewhat akin to a soup of different cells and genes, somehow coordinating to keep us standing for long enough to enjoy this brief moment of consciousness!"
170,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8115180-jiny-s,5,"This book can be best described in three parts: anatomy, genetics, and psychology.Right from the start, reading the first few pages on the errors of human anatomy got me hooked. Learning about how the human eye is backwards, how our mucus has to travel upwards (its inefficiency and consequential prone to infections), how our nerves have to wind around our body (because of our evolutionary roots from fish), and so on, is like bringing the curious inner child inside of me to a candy store. Learning about all the weird but cool things about my own body is utterly fascinating.The second and third part was not as exciting for me, more of a reiteration of bio and psy 101, especially the last part, when the author describes biases, heuristics, and illusions. It was nonetheless interesting, but for me personally, I have already knew these things and thus the awe factor was removed.The author has a way of describing things (even technical) without being boring.

176,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Folks who think ‘intelligent design’ does a better job of describing the miracle of nature that is the human body than ‘evolution by means of natural selection’ have some explaining to do. That’s because the ‘intelligence’ behind our present form is, in many ways, very, very bad at its job. In fact, it’s safe to say that any engineering major worth their salt could make numerous design improvements to our bodies without breaking a sweat. Need some examples?-	We eat, drink and breath through the same hole in our face, which makes choking a real hazard. Thousands of people die each year due to this design flaw. In fact, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death.-	Unlike most other animals, humans can’t make their own vitamin C (we have to consume it in our food). Many sailors died of scurvy before this fact was realized.-	Baby’s heads are too big for women’s pelvises. Before the advent of modern medicine, human infant (and maternal) mortality rates were some of the highest in the entire animal kingdom.-	Some people (myself included) have life-threatening allergies to common foods because our immune systems can’t distinguish between safe and unsafe proteins. -	We have too many bones in our wrists and ankles making them prone to injury. Not to mention the prevalence of knee and back problems within our species thanks to bad design. -	Our eyes aren’t that great, which is why 60% of the population wears eyeglasses. We also have a blind spot thanks to a backwards retina.-	Our maxillary sinuses drain upwards (against the pull of gravity), making us more prone than other species to sinus infections. -	Men’s testicles are external to their bodies leaving them exposed and vulnerable to injury (as any male bicycle rider surely knows all too well). -	Our mouths are too crowded for our teeth, which is why many people have their wisdom teeth surgically removed. We also only have 1 set of adult teeth, which means dentures are required once those are lost. Anyone who thinks these design flaws are ‘intelligent’ is not thinking clearly, which of course is indicative of yet another system error … our brains, which are so very easy to fool we need a systematic procedure to reduce biases, sloppy rationalizations, and erroneous conclusions … it’s called the ‘scientific method’. Thanks the application of this process we’ve learned many things about the natural world that benefit us in our daily lives and enabled technologies such as cell phones, antibiotics, aircraft and computers. As if that weren’t enough, the scientific method has also definitively demonstrated that ‘intelligent design’ is what scientists refer to as a 'failed hypothesis', otherwise known as a cockeyed load of half-baked hogwash. Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes describes many of the myriad ways our bodies are an agglomeration of kludged together parts. Why? Because that’s the way evolution works. It doesn’t have any forethought or design plan in mind and mutational changes can only make small modifications to structures that already exist. Since it can’t redesign anatomy from the bottom up to make it more effective, we’re stuck with what we have (at least until gene editing technology improves). Fortunately, medical advances and technology enable us to overcome some, though not all, of our physical deficiencies. In the case of my own (a severe allergy to tree nuts), food safety labeling requirements and increased awareness within the restaurant industry have significantly reduced risks of exposure. As to the book, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Lents has an engaging writing style that that is both entertaining and informative. Although I thought the epilog went off in a rather strange and irrelevant direction in its discussion of the Fermi Paradox, the Drake equation and intelligent alien life in the universe (which not only has little to do with the topic of this book, but the reason we haven’t discovered it has a simple explanation … it doesn’t exist … but that’s a discussion for another time)."
177,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Nathan Lents gives us a lively and interesting look at some of the major flaws of the human body--starting with our eyes, and working downward. Our lenses are backwards. Our wrists and ankles have extra, unnecessary bones that serve no real function. We have a variety of genetic diseases, more than most other species, and they don't get effectively selected against for a variety of frustrating reasons. Once a gene acquires a mutation, it tends to accumulate more mutations. Once that happens, the problem can't be fixed by another single mutation of the kind that caused the original problem. The deletion of our ability to manufacture our own vitamin C, like most mammals, got deleted in a common ancestor of primate species long ago. It wasn't selected against because all the early primates lived in the midst of a vitamin C-rich food supply. That mutation has been accumulating more mutations since long before genus homo arose. We're not getting it back.Others are even more frustrating. The mutation that causes sickle cell anemia causes a devastating, painful, deadly disease--if you get two copies of that gene, one each from father and mother. It ought to have been selected against long ago! Oh, except for one inconvenient fact. If you get only one copy of the disease, you have a higher than normal resistance to malaria. Malaria can also debilitate and kill you. Someone who has one copy of the sickle cell gene doesn't get sickle cell, and is less likely to get malaria, and more likely to survive malaria if they do. In regions where malaria is a major problem, people with one copy of the sickle cell gene will be more likely to live long enough to have more offspring, and thus more descendants--even though some of them will have sickle cell anemia due to getting two copies of the gene.Nor are we really fully adapted to walking upright, or to giving birth to children with such large brains. Our babies are born several months earlier than they ""should"" be, based on the degree of development they have at birth, even compared to our closest relatives, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo.I can't do credit to Lents' writing of this, or to L.J. Ganser's reading of it. It's informative and enjoyable.Recommended.I bought this audiobook."
178,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2778499-midwest-geek,4,"This was a surprisingly entertaining read. Lents must be a very popular lecturer, for he has a very self-effacing, approachable style. For a good summary and evaluation similar to mine, I recommend the review by Rebecca. I would add that the main theme of how evolution can unwittingly produce inefficient organisms is something that seems not widely appreciated. In particualar, although I knew some of these facts, such as the preponderence of junk DNA, I developed a greater appreciation of human inefficiencies that result from the nature of evolution.An early example in the book is that the retina of the eye is so poorly designed as to have its light sensors pointing toward the back of the head instead of toward the lens of the eye, leaving humans and other vertebrates much less sensitive to light intensity than they could be and leading to the well-known blind spot. I had not known that an independent evolutionary path to vision followed by cephalopods (such as octopi and squid) led to a far more sensible design with the light sensors facing forward instead of backward and without a blind spot. They can see the light from a single photon (like our best electronic detectors), whereas our eyes typically require a minimum of about 5 or 6 photons of comparable intensity before provoking a response. The book could be used to bolster the case against ""intelligent design"" but that isn't its intention.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in how humans came to be as we are. I got it from the library, but I will keep it in mind as a present for certain grandchildren when they get a little older."

180,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,4,"Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes by Nathan Lents admits from the get-go that there are more than enough books about how great and wondrous the human body is. Lents takes a whole different tack: how human bodies have huge design flaws, from big system like our bones to the DNA in every cell.  Why do we have a blind spot in each eye? It is because the retina is wired backwards. Why are the drains for our sinuses in the wrong place? To make room for our oversized brains. Is it really a good idea to take in food through the same opening that we use for breathing? Lents thinks definitely not. The wrist has way too many bones, grouped “...like a pile of rocks,” a turn of phrase that produces a vivid mental image. Human Errors brings up ideas about vitamins that I had never remotely considered. Why don’t dogs and other animals need vitamin C in their diets? Because they can make it themselves. Why can’t we? Because, through a genetic mutation, we lost that ability. Minerals, which always have to be consumed, cause us problems because we have trouble absorbing them. Calcium absorption gets worse as we age, and iron deficiency is the number one nutritional deficiency both in the US and in the world. Obesity is also a natural fallout from poor design.Focusing in on human DNA and running the numbers, Lents demonstrates that DNA are enormously wasteful, with 97% of DNA not “saying”anything. These include strings called pseudo genes, one of which causes us to not be able to generate our own vitamin C. Other strands of DNA are discarded bits of ancient viruses, and even pieces of our own genetic material, copied over and over like an office printer run amok. There are a myriad of problems with human reproductive systems, from the fact that the Fallopian tubes are not even connected to the ovaries (!) to the fact the sperm can only turn in one direction. Autoimmune diseases are just ongoing mistakes made by your body, plain and simple. Allergic reactions to poison ivy and bee stings fall in this same category. Memory is another area where we have big problems. Given only some information about an event, our brains try to fill in the gaps. In the case of gambling, our imperfect brains try to find patterns where there are none.

How awesome isn't it to discover all our little inherited quirks and flaws compounded over hundreds of millions of years of evolution!? Brilliant, right!? To a degree, Lents delivers. However, it seems like he's cherry-picked the most commonly known oddities about our genetic make-up. If you already have some basic knowledge - or even familiarity - with our ""design"" flaws, you likely won't learn much. You may even stumble on a few things where he's apparently wrong - or, at least, where he's oversimplified something to the point of being wrong. Not to mention that - and, fyi, this may just be me - it makes my stomach churn when he illustrates something like our anecdotal bias and how it's so very wrong with - drum roll please... - yup, an anecdote! (I wish I had a pukey face emoji right about now). I'm also not stoked about the last part of the book where he ventures away from the actual topic into things like extraterrestrial life (or lack thereof), the Fermi paradox, and other things like that. Not that it isn't interesting, it is, but it just feels off in this book (also, same thing here, if you're reading a book like this, the Fermi paradox likely isn't a new concept to you... right?).Regardless, despite my little whine-fest above, I do like the book. It's a light read - which might actually be a positive to some (?), even if I would have preferred a little more substance - and it's fun to contemplate how things could end up so bonkers. I just wish there would have been more! I also think a lot of our problems today could be alleviated if more of humanity had the flaws he mentions, as well as others, in mind before going off half-cocked on each other!I also want to mention that my rating would have been different if Lents would have kept to the science of our evolutionary flaws (that s**t is awesome!). He could have then honed in a little more on each particular flaw and fleshed it out - as well as explored more of them. Had he done this I would say it's a solid 4-star, and we would probably have learned a ton more. But anyway... and in summary, if you happen to stumble on this quick little read, it's totally worth the half-day (or so) it takes to read :)."

It was with the understanding that I would post a review on Net Galley, Goodreads, Amazon, Barnes and Noble and my fiction book review blog. I also posted it to my Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google Plus pages.I requested this book as the desription sounded fascinating. It is the first book by Nathan H. Lents that I have read.This book is a very good read. The subtitle of the book provides a good synopsis - a panorama of our glitches, from pointless bones to broken genes. The author presents the subjects in an easy to understand and read fashion. While it addresses how hard it is for evolution to correct itself once a change has been made (whether purposeful or by accident), a little more of the science and/or research behind it would have been helpful.That said, I do recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in why our bodies are not the perfect biological machine (and far from it)."
183,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157556-lucas-h-golding,5,"A Wonderful Evolution bookThis is a fantastic science book. It’s focus is on the flaws of the human body, anatomically, physiologically and genetically. But the genius of the book is that it really makes the reader understand evolution so much clearer. Our genes do there best to prepare us for life but there are some very odd peculiarities that just don’t make sense from a “intelligent designer” perspective. From allergies to auto immune diseases such as lupus, our bodies aren’t always looking out for our best interest. Read this book, it’s entertaining and well written and you will definitely learn some valuable information."

It's interesting to read how we came to be stuck with some unfortunate limitations, yet still, dominate as a species. For a book about science facts,  Human Errors shines in that it's not super technical, but not dumbed-down to a childish level. I think this book hits the sweet spot for what it is. I've read books in the (what I'll call) rundown-of-interesting-facts genre that are far less satisfying.Thanks to NetGalley and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for a digital ARC. All views are my own."

Your point of view might be based on science: evolution isn't an end-game, or based on faith: we already know we're not perfect.

191,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67762255-brooke,4,For anatomy nerds like myself the first 3/4 of this book is excellent. I lost interest in last few chapters as they switched to more human behavior errors rather than anatomy. The evolution of the human compared to other mammals is very interesting. This book touches on a wide variety of errors our body has but is still so functional.

If you want to learn more about how natural selection could have done better, I highly recommend this. Towards the end the book diverges a bit, in my opinion, from its original premise but is still engaging. Nathan Lents is no Mary Roach, but when I buy this book it will go on the same shelf. "
193,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book through NetGalley.]I found this to be both an informative and entertaining read. While the author doesn’t delve very deep into details (each subject in each chapter would probably warrant a book of its own), and although I wish there had been more developed explanations at times, I’m also aware that one book couldn’t tackle everything in one go—and he nevertheless provides enough information for a reader to go on research some more later on a given topic.I already knew some of the ‘human errors’ presented in the book (such as junk DNA and mutations), but definitely not others, such as why we get so many headcolds (our sinuses placed the wrong way), why we do actually make our own B12 vitamin but can’t use it (same with other vitamins—and this is why we need a varied diet, with all the problems it entails), or why our ways of procreating are, in fact, very inefficient compared to those of other mammals. So, discovering all this was fascinating, and the explanations provided also satisfy the unavoidable ‘why’ questions that rose immediately after (I’m very much a why person; every physician who attended me since I’ve learnt to speak can testify to this). For instance, we lost the ability to make our own vitamin C, whose absence will lead to scorbut and kill us; but the mutation that led to this defect wasn’t erased through evolution because it happened in areas where fruit was easily available, and a diet of fruit would compensate for our rotten GULO gene… until the latter stuck, happily passed around to descendants.I liked that some explanations went a bit further: it’s not only about this or that physical defect, but also about how we’re still wired for survival techniques and reactions dating back to prehistoric times, and how some of our modern behaviours are thus impacted. An extended example would be gambling, and why people in general have irrational reactions such as ‘now that I’ve lost ten times in a row, I -must- win, there’s no other way’ (though statistically, you could lose an 11th time), or will bet more and more when they’re on winning streak, and risk losing it all or more, rather than save those earnings. Those would go back to the way we interpreted situations to learn from them and survive (man sees a lion in a bush, concludes bushes often hide a lion, and then avoids bushes). Same with optical illusions, due to our brains’ ability to ‘fill in the blanks’.On the side of actual errors, I noticed a few (redundant words or phrases, that a last editing pass would probably remove). Nothing too bad, though.Conclusion: Due to the lack of deeper details and general simple writing, this book is probably more for laypeople rather than people with a strong scientific background—but even then, there’s still a chance that some of the ‘human errors’ may still be of interest to them. "
194,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"We all know that the human body is not perfect. Any of us who wear glasses, get the flu, fall and land on our coccyx, take vitamins, or try to lose weight knows this first hand.In this book, Nathan Lents gives us a lot of scientific information about human development, how human systems work, and why our bodies evolved the way they did. What makes this book so special is that he presents all of this information in an easy to understand and entertaining fashion. He presents our faults and limitations clearly and in a way clever enough that you will often find yourself laughing at your own limitations.This is not to say that this book is all fun and games. Lents explains how poorly we deal with certain diseases, how the body often attacks itself, how errors occur when DNA replicates, the flaws in our reproductive system, and that all of us - if we live long enough- will get cancer. These are definitely not light topics but, again, he presents them in a way to help you understand the how and why they are part of our makeup.Many readers will have already heard of some of the ""glitches"" he mentions that are contained in the human body - such as the poor construction of the human eye or the pelvis being to small to all for easy births. However, many of the defects Lents presents are ones you haven't heard of or did not previously understand that they were ""built-in"" by evolution.Lent addresses how medical science has made major progress in learning about the human body and finding ways to deal with the ""blunders of nature"" but, also, how there are many that may be more than science can correct. He continues on to conjecture that if all of these problems can be addressed will we be able to live forever and, if so, what would that mean for our society and our planet?In the Epilogue, ""The Future of Humanity"", Lents moves from the daily glitches and moves into the areas of global warming, apocalyptic wars, space exploration, and the question of whether there is life elsewhere in the universe. While he does an excellent job of presenting his thoughts on these very important topics, I feel that they would have been better addressed in a different book than as an add-on to this one.Overall, I enjoyed reading Human Errors. I learned, I laughed, I cringed, and I came face to face with the many flaws that are a part of being a human being."
195,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,4,"Man was created by God. We are his perfect creation. Our perfection is evident in every detail of our design. Right? If you believe this, then you first need to Google Charles Darwin and evolution. Second, you need to take another look at the human body. Because we are full of defects. This book will give you a few examples of some of our most glaring flaws; flaws that can be found from head to toe, and in our body's architecture as well as in our DNA.What could possibly be wrong with having a shared channel for air and food? (This is a rhetorical question, but in case you really wonder, food gets stuck, and we die...). It has to be like that, you might argue. But that would be ignoring whales and dolphins. They eat with their mouth and breathe through a different hole on their back; they don’t risk choking. We also have genes for creating several vitamins, e.g., vitamin C – only they are broken. Usually, this doesn't matter because we get vitamin C in our diets and therefore natural selection has had not selected against this detect. But it is a defect nonetheless if we do not get any vitamin C for a while, as sailors crossing the Atlantic, we get sick and die – all because of our non-functional gene. The reason for our imperfections is that evolution cannot start over, it works by making small gradual changes. Evolution can only undo things partially, which is why we still have a tailbone which is by the way also useless – except for getting hurt...This book is a call for rationality. It provides a tiny grain of sand to balance the mountains of books glorifying the human body and its 'perfection.' To be sure the human body is impressive in many ways but perfect it is not. "

This book offers a broad look into the defect of the human body, the imperfect and haphazard nature of natural evolution, and what the future have in store for us as individuals and as a collective. The book describes humans as, to paraphrase lightly, imperfect creatures that are not exempt from evolution’s grasps. Just because of the efficiency in curing preexisting ailments and improving living conditions had skyrocketed, humanity has yet to reach past evolution as we are change with each passing generation. The author delivered on the premise and presented a well-reasoned conclusion that humanity have both the ability to better oneself and the ability to bring forth mutually assured destruction. The writing was not confusing nor is it filled with jargon, yet it conveys the point and delves deeply into analysing what exactly, biologically speaking, we are and whether we are truly the best evolution can do. Would recommend to readers interested in Medical sciences and and/or philosophy in relation humans especially with the advent of transhumanism and the influx of revolutionary medical techniques being developed at this very moment such as CRISPR or prothetic limbs that would ultimately be more powerful than our biological ones.. This is an easy read with simple and often humorous language that is bound to fascinate."
197,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18001516-kate-vane,4,"Evolution does not mean we are continually moving towards perfection. Mutations happen by chance, and they may or may not be good for us. If they don’t kill us and if they don’t stop us reproducing, they stick around.Human Errors details some of these ‘errors’ and includes some fascinating examples. Our dodgy knees are a hangover from our primate days, and were never meant to support us standing up. Our retinas are the wrong way round and we’d be much better off if we had the eyes of an octopus.There are chapters which focus on the more serious consequences of these errors – such as hereditary diseases and autoimmune conditions which lead the body to attack itself.I was fascinated by the chapter on reproduction and loved the image of menopausal orca whales leading hunting packs of young males, but when I thought about it later, I wasn’t clear whether the author thinks the menopause in humans is an error at all.There’s also an epilogue which is more speculative. Lents’ argument seems to be that the inventiveness of humans allows us to outpace our errors, or even turn them into strengths. However these strengths can also be weaknesses. He argues that selfishness and short-term thinking may well lead humanity to destroy itself and the planet. This seems to be more about philosophy than science.Overall though, this is an informative and entertaining read for a non-scientist like me and the quirky examples make the underlying facts more memorable.*I received a copy of Human Errors from the publisher via Netgalley."
198,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1619539-nancy,4,"Some Problems with Human EvolutionEvolution is a marvelous process. It allowed humans to reach status of the preeminent species on earth, but it came with a cost. Evolution is driven by mutations. They create new genes that allow for additional functionality, but it’s impossible to get rid of the old patterns. This leads to problems like backwards retinas, bad knees, swallowing and breathing through the same narrow channel and more. The book is witty and although it presents a great deal of technical information, the presentation is clear and amusing, suitable for a general audience. I enjoyed the book and learned about some problems with the human body I had never heard of before. I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that made the book more fun. The chapters are relatively short and the illustrations make it easy to understand some of the technical discussion. The notes section is extensive and whether you agree with his ideas or not provides references for future study. I recommend this book for anyone interested in biology or nutrition. There is a good chapter on why humans need such a varied diet based on some evolutionary problems.I received this book from Net Galley for this review."
199,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16203817-bartley-sharkey,5,"Ah yes, a book that doesn't appear to be a poorly disguised promotion for the author. Human Errors strikes a good balance between covering topics that most people will have heard of already and others that will be brand new. It may be described as a pretty dry topic but whether the bodily issues covered are relevant or not, I find them fascinating and feel like I've learned a little bit more about why our bodies are basically messed up and so prone to breaking down.Of course, this kind of book would be hopelessly boring if there wasn't any humour included so thankfully there is, although most of it would fit right in to a book of ""dad jokes"". Maybe the author could have consulted someone funny to help inject a little more, but at the same time it's by no means decisive in making the book pleasant to read.Having sped through this book in a week, I think it happened to be the kind of book I wanted to read at this moment and the main take away is not that of specific deficiencies of the human body, but the impression that not only is it incredible that evolution happened to bring us this far and that we are each somewhat akin to a soup of different cells and genes, somehow coordinating to keep us standing for long enough to enjoy this brief moment of consciousness!"
200,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8115180-jiny-s,5,"This book can be best described in three parts: anatomy, genetics, and psychology.Right from the start, reading the first few pages on the errors of human anatomy got me hooked. Learning about how the human eye is backwards, how our mucus has to travel upwards (its inefficiency and consequential prone to infections), how our nerves have to wind around our body (because of our evolutionary roots from fish), and so on, is like bringing the curious inner child inside of me to a candy store. Learning about all the weird but cool things about my own body is utterly fascinating.The second and third part was not as exciting for me, more of a reiteration of bio and psy 101, especially the last part, when the author describes biases, heuristics, and illusions. It was nonetheless interesting, but for me personally, I have already knew these things and thus the awe factor was removed.The author has a way of describing things (even technical) without being boring.

206,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Folks who think ‘intelligent design’ does a better job of describing the miracle of nature that is the human body than ‘evolution by means of natural selection’ have some explaining to do. That’s because the ‘intelligence’ behind our present form is, in many ways, very, very bad at its job. In fact, it’s safe to say that any engineering major worth their salt could make numerous design improvements to our bodies without breaking a sweat. Need some examples?-	We eat, drink and breath through the same hole in our face, which makes choking a real hazard. Thousands of people die each year due to this design flaw. In fact, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death.-	Unlike most other animals, humans can’t make their own vitamin C (we have to consume it in our food). Many sailors died of scurvy before this fact was realized.-	Baby’s heads are too big for women’s pelvises. Before the advent of modern medicine, human infant (and maternal) mortality rates were some of the highest in the entire animal kingdom.-	Some people (myself included) have life-threatening allergies to common foods because our immune systems can’t distinguish between safe and unsafe proteins. -	We have too many bones in our wrists and ankles making them prone to injury. Not to mention the prevalence of knee and back problems within our species thanks to bad design. -	Our eyes aren’t that great, which is why 60% of the population wears eyeglasses. We also have a blind spot thanks to a backwards retina.-	Our maxillary sinuses drain upwards (against the pull of gravity), making us more prone than other species to sinus infections. -	Men’s testicles are external to their bodies leaving them exposed and vulnerable to injury (as any male bicycle rider surely knows all too well). -	Our mouths are too crowded for our teeth, which is why many people have their wisdom teeth surgically removed. We also only have 1 set of adult teeth, which means dentures are required once those are lost. Anyone who thinks these design flaws are ‘intelligent’ is not thinking clearly, which of course is indicative of yet another system error … our brains, which are so very easy to fool we need a systematic procedure to reduce biases, sloppy rationalizations, and erroneous conclusions … it’s called the ‘scientific method’. Thanks the application of this process we’ve learned many things about the natural world that benefit us in our daily lives and enabled technologies such as cell phones, antibiotics, aircraft and computers. As if that weren’t enough, the scientific method has also definitively demonstrated that ‘intelligent design’ is what scientists refer to as a 'failed hypothesis', otherwise known as a cockeyed load of half-baked hogwash. Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes describes many of the myriad ways our bodies are an agglomeration of kludged together parts. Why? Because that’s the way evolution works. It doesn’t have any forethought or design plan in mind and mutational changes can only make small modifications to structures that already exist. Since it can’t redesign anatomy from the bottom up to make it more effective, we’re stuck with what we have (at least until gene editing technology improves). Fortunately, medical advances and technology enable us to overcome some, though not all, of our physical deficiencies. In the case of my own (a severe allergy to tree nuts), food safety labeling requirements and increased awareness within the restaurant industry have significantly reduced risks of exposure. As to the book, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Lents has an engaging writing style that that is both entertaining and informative. Although I thought the epilog went off in a rather strange and irrelevant direction in its discussion of the Fermi Paradox, the Drake equation and intelligent alien life in the universe (which not only has little to do with the topic of this book, but the reason we haven’t discovered it has a simple explanation … it doesn’t exist … but that’s a discussion for another time)."
207,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Nathan Lents gives us a lively and interesting look at some of the major flaws of the human body--starting with our eyes, and working downward. Our lenses are backwards. Our wrists and ankles have extra, unnecessary bones that serve no real function. We have a variety of genetic diseases, more than most other species, and they don't get effectively selected against for a variety of frustrating reasons. Once a gene acquires a mutation, it tends to accumulate more mutations. Once that happens, the problem can't be fixed by another single mutation of the kind that caused the original problem. The deletion of our ability to manufacture our own vitamin C, like most mammals, got deleted in a common ancestor of primate species long ago. It wasn't selected against because all the early primates lived in the midst of a vitamin C-rich food supply. That mutation has been accumulating more mutations since long before genus homo arose. We're not getting it back.Others are even more frustrating. The mutation that causes sickle cell anemia causes a devastating, painful, deadly disease--if you get two copies of that gene, one each from father and mother. It ought to have been selected against long ago! Oh, except for one inconvenient fact. If you get only one copy of the disease, you have a higher than normal resistance to malaria. Malaria can also debilitate and kill you. Someone who has one copy of the sickle cell gene doesn't get sickle cell, and is less likely to get malaria, and more likely to survive malaria if they do. In regions where malaria is a major problem, people with one copy of the sickle cell gene will be more likely to live long enough to have more offspring, and thus more descendants--even though some of them will have sickle cell anemia due to getting two copies of the gene.Nor are we really fully adapted to walking upright, or to giving birth to children with such large brains. Our babies are born several months earlier than they ""should"" be, based on the degree of development they have at birth, even compared to our closest relatives, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo.I can't do credit to Lents' writing of this, or to L.J. Ganser's reading of it. It's informative and enjoyable.Recommended.I bought this audiobook."
208,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2778499-midwest-geek,4,"This was a surprisingly entertaining read. Lents must be a very popular lecturer, for he has a very self-effacing, approachable style. For a good summary and evaluation similar to mine, I recommend the review by Rebecca. I would add that the main theme of how evolution can unwittingly produce inefficient organisms is something that seems not widely appreciated. In particualar, although I knew some of these facts, such as the preponderence of junk DNA, I developed a greater appreciation of human inefficiencies that result from the nature of evolution.An early example in the book is that the retina of the eye is so poorly designed as to have its light sensors pointing toward the back of the head instead of toward the lens of the eye, leaving humans and other vertebrates much less sensitive to light intensity than they could be and leading to the well-known blind spot. I had not known that an independent evolutionary path to vision followed by cephalopods (such as octopi and squid) led to a far more sensible design with the light sensors facing forward instead of backward and without a blind spot. They can see the light from a single photon (like our best electronic detectors), whereas our eyes typically require a minimum of about 5 or 6 photons of comparable intensity before provoking a response. The book could be used to bolster the case against ""intelligent design"" but that isn't its intention.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in how humans came to be as we are.

210,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,4,"Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes by Nathan Lents admits from the get-go that there are more than enough books about how great and wondrous the human body is. Lents takes a whole different tack: how human bodies have huge design flaws, from big system like our bones to the DNA in every cell.  Why do we have a blind spot in each eye? It is because the retina is wired backwards. Why are the drains for our sinuses in the wrong place? To make room for our oversized brains. Is it really a good idea to take in food through the same opening that we use for breathing? Lents thinks definitely not. The wrist has way too many bones, grouped “...like a pile of rocks,” a turn of phrase that produces a vivid mental image. Human Errors brings up ideas about vitamins that I had never remotely considered. Why don’t dogs and other animals need vitamin C in their diets? Because they can make it themselves. Why can’t we? Because, through a genetic mutation, we lost that ability. Minerals, which always have to be consumed, cause us problems because we have trouble absorbing them. Calcium absorption gets worse as we age, and iron deficiency is the number one nutritional deficiency both in the US and in the world. Obesity is also a natural fallout from poor design.Focusing in on human DNA and running the numbers, Lents demonstrates that DNA are enormously wasteful, with 97% of DNA not “saying”anything. These include strings called pseudo genes, one of which causes us to not be able to generate our own vitamin C. Other strands of DNA are discarded bits of ancient viruses, and even pieces of our own genetic material, copied over and over like an office printer run amok. There are a myriad of problems with human reproductive systems, from the fact that the Fallopian tubes are not even connected to the ovaries (!) to the fact the sperm can only turn in one direction. Autoimmune diseases are just ongoing mistakes made by your body, plain and simple. Allergic reactions to poison ivy and bee stings fall in this same category. Memory is another area where we have big problems. Given only some information about an event, our brains try to fill in the gaps. In the case of gambling, our imperfect brains try to find patterns where there are none. Kudos to Human Errors for shining a light in dark places, providing me with new insights into how the body works (and doesn’t)."
211,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107567624-philip,3,"I'm a bit torn about this book. I want to like it more than I do.I love the idea of the book. How awesome isn't it to discover all our little inherited quirks and flaws compounded over hundreds of millions of years of evolution!? Brilliant, right!? To a degree, Lents delivers. However, it seems like he's cherry-picked the most commonly known oddities about our genetic make-up. If you already have some basic knowledge - or even familiarity - with our ""design"" flaws, you likely won't learn much. You may even stumble on a few things where he's apparently wrong - or, at least, where he's oversimplified something to the point of being wrong. Not to mention that - and, fyi, this may just be me - it makes my stomach churn when he illustrates something like our anecdotal bias and how it's so very wrong with - drum roll please... - yup, an anecdote! (I wish I had a pukey face emoji right about now). I'm also not stoked about the last part of the book where he ventures away from the actual topic into things like extraterrestrial life (or lack thereof), the Fermi paradox, and other things like that. Not that it isn't interesting, it is, but it just feels off in this book (also, same thing here, if you're reading a book like this, the Fermi paradox likely isn't a new concept to you... right?).Regardless, despite my little whine-fest above, I do like the book. It's a light read - which might actually be a positive to some (?), even if I would have preferred a little more substance - and it's fun to contemplate how things could end up so bonkers. I just wish there would have been more! I also think a lot of our problems today could be alleviated if more of humanity had the flaws he mentions, as well as others, in mind before going off half-cocked on each other!I also want to mention that my rating would have been different if Lents would have kept to the science of our evolutionary flaws (that s**t is awesome!). He could have then honed in a little more on each particular flaw and fleshed it out - as well as explored more of them. Had he done this I would say it's a solid 4-star, and we would probably have learned a ton more. But anyway... and in summary, if you happen to stumble on this quick little read, it's totally worth the half-day (or so) it takes to read :)."

It was with the understanding that I would post a review on Net Galley, Goodreads, Amazon, Barnes and Noble and my fiction book review blog. I also posted it to my Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google Plus pages.I requested this book as the desription sounded fascinating. It is the first book by Nathan H. Lents that I have read.This book is a very good read. The subtitle of the book provides a good synopsis - a panorama of our glitches, from pointless bones to broken genes. The author presents the subjects in an easy to understand and read fashion. While it addresses how hard it is for evolution to correct itself once a change has been made (whether purposeful or by accident), a little more of the science and/or research behind it would have been helpful.That said, I do recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in why our bodies are not the perfect biological machine (and far from it)."

It’s focus is on the flaws of the human body, anatomically, physiologically and genetically. But the genius of the book is that it really makes the reader understand evolution so much clearer. Our genes do there best to prepare us for life but there are some very odd peculiarities that just don’t make sense from a “intelligent designer” perspective. From allergies to auto immune diseases such as lupus, our bodies aren’t always looking out for our best interest.

For a book about science facts,  Human Errors shines in that it's not super technical, but not dumbed-down to a childish level. I think this book hits the sweet spot for what it is.

If you want to learn more about how natural selection could have done better, I highly recommend this.

223,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book through NetGalley.]I found this to be both an informative and entertaining read. While the author doesn’t delve very deep into details (each subject in each chapter would probably warrant a book of its own), and although I wish there had been more developed explanations at times, I’m also aware that one book couldn’t tackle everything in one go—and he nevertheless provides enough information for a reader to go on research some more later on a given topic.I already knew some of the ‘human errors’ presented in the book (such as junk DNA and mutations), but definitely not others, such as why we get so many headcolds (our sinuses placed the wrong way), why we do actually make our own B12 vitamin but can’t use it (same with other vitamins—and this is why we need a varied diet, with all the problems it entails), or why our ways of procreating are, in fact, very inefficient compared to those of other mammals. So, discovering all this was fascinating, and the explanations provided also satisfy the unavoidable ‘why’ questions that rose immediately after (I’m very much a why person; every physician who attended me since I’ve learnt to speak can testify to this). For instance, we lost the ability to make our own vitamin C, whose absence will lead to scorbut and kill us; but the mutation that led to this defect wasn’t erased through evolution because it happened in areas where fruit was easily available, and a diet of fruit would compensate for our rotten GULO gene… until the latter stuck, happily passed around to descendants.I liked that some explanations went a bit further: it’s not only about this or that physical defect, but also about how we’re still wired for survival techniques and reactions dating back to prehistoric times, and how some of our modern behaviours are thus impacted. An extended example would be gambling, and why people in general have irrational reactions such as ‘now that I’ve lost ten times in a row, I -must- win, there’s no other way’ (though statistically, you could lose an 11th time), or will bet more and more when they’re on winning streak, and risk losing it all or more, rather than save those earnings. Those would go back to the way we interpreted situations to learn from them and survive (man sees a lion in a bush, concludes bushes often hide a lion, and then avoids bushes). Same with optical illusions, due to our brains’ ability to ‘fill in the blanks’.On the side of actual errors, I noticed a few (redundant words or phrases, that a last editing pass would probably remove). Nothing too bad, though.Conclusion: Due to the lack of deeper details and general simple writing, this book is probably more for laypeople rather than people with a strong scientific background—but even then, there’s still a chance that some of the ‘human errors’ may still be of interest to them. "
224,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"We all know that the human body is not perfect. Any of us who wear glasses, get the flu, fall and land on our coccyx, take vitamins, or try to lose weight knows this first hand.In this book, Nathan Lents gives us a lot of scientific information about human development, how human systems work, and why our bodies evolved the way they did. What makes this book so special is that he presents all of this information in an easy to understand and entertaining fashion. He presents our faults and limitations clearly and in a way clever enough that you will often find yourself laughing at your own limitations.This is not to say that this book is all fun and games. Lents explains how poorly we deal with certain diseases, how the body often attacks itself, how errors occur when DNA replicates, the flaws in our reproductive system, and that all of us - if we live long enough- will get cancer. These are definitely not light topics but, again, he presents them in a way to help you understand the how and why they are part of our makeup.Many readers will have already heard of some of the ""glitches"" he mentions that are contained in the human body - such as the poor construction of the human eye or the pelvis being to small to all for easy births. However, many of the defects Lents presents are ones you haven't heard of or did not previously understand that they were ""built-in"" by evolution.Lent addresses how medical science has made major progress in learning about the human body and finding ways to deal with the ""blunders of nature"" but, also, how there are many that may be more than science can correct. He continues on to conjecture that if all of these problems can be addressed will we be able to live forever and, if so, what would that mean for our society and our planet?In the Epilogue, ""The Future of Humanity"", Lents moves from the daily glitches and moves into the areas of global warming, apocalyptic wars, space exploration, and the question of whether there is life elsewhere in the universe. While he does an excellent job of presenting his thoughts on these very important topics, I feel that they would have been better addressed in a different book than as an add-on to this one.Overall, I enjoyed reading Human Errors. I learned, I laughed, I cringed, and I came face to face with the many flaws that are a part of being a human being."
225,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,4,"Man was created by God. We are his perfect creation. Our perfection is evident in every detail of our design. Right? If you believe this, then you first need to Google Charles Darwin and evolution. Second, you need to take another look at the human body. Because we are full of defects. This book will give you a few examples of some of our most glaring flaws; flaws that can be found from head to toe, and in our body's architecture as well as in our DNA.What could possibly be wrong with having a shared channel for air and food? (This is a rhetorical question, but in case you really wonder, food gets stuck, and we die...). It has to be like that, you might argue. But that would be ignoring whales and dolphins. They eat with their mouth and breathe through a different hole on their back; they don’t risk choking. We also have genes for creating several vitamins, e.g., vitamin C – only they are broken. Usually, this doesn't matter because we get vitamin C in our diets and therefore natural selection has had not selected against this detect. But it is a defect nonetheless if we do not get any vitamin C for a while, as sailors crossing the Atlantic, we get sick and die – all because of our non-functional gene. The reason for our imperfections is that evolution cannot start over, it works by making small gradual changes. Evolution can only undo things partially, which is why we still have a tailbone which is by the way also useless – except for getting hurt...This book is a call for rationality. It provides a tiny grain of sand to balance the mountains of books glorifying the human body and its 'perfection.' To be sure the human body is impressive in many ways but perfect it is not. "

This book offers a broad look into the defect of the human body, the imperfect and haphazard nature of natural evolution, and what the future have in store for us as individuals and as a collective. The book describes humans as, to paraphrase lightly, imperfect creatures that are not exempt from evolution’s grasps. Just because of the efficiency in curing preexisting ailments and improving living conditions had skyrocketed, humanity has yet to reach past evolution as we are change with each passing generation. The author delivered on the premise and presented a well-reasoned conclusion that humanity have both the ability to better oneself and the ability to bring forth mutually assured destruction. The writing was not confusing nor is it filled with jargon, yet it conveys the point and delves deeply into analysing what exactly, biologically speaking, we are and whether we are truly the best evolution can do. Would recommend to readers interested in Medical sciences and and/or philosophy in relation humans especially with the advent of transhumanism and the influx of revolutionary medical techniques being developed at this very moment such as CRISPR or prothetic limbs that would ultimately be more powerful than our biological ones.. This is an easy read with simple and often humorous language that is bound to fascinate."
227,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18001516-kate-vane,4,"Evolution does not mean we are continually moving towards perfection. Mutations happen by chance, and they may or may not be good for us. If they don’t kill us and if they don’t stop us reproducing, they stick around.Human Errors details some of these ‘errors’ and includes some fascinating examples. Our dodgy knees are a hangover from our primate days, and were never meant to support us standing up. Our retinas are the wrong way round and we’d be much better off if we had the eyes of an octopus.There are chapters which focus on the more serious consequences of these errors – such as hereditary diseases and autoimmune conditions which lead the body to attack itself.I was fascinated by the chapter on reproduction and loved the image of menopausal orca whales leading hunting packs of young males, but when I thought about it later, I wasn’t clear whether the author thinks the menopause in humans is an error at all.There’s also an epilogue which is more speculative. Lents’ argument seems to be that the inventiveness of humans allows us to outpace our errors, or even turn them into strengths. However these strengths can also be weaknesses. He argues that selfishness and short-term thinking may well lead humanity to destroy itself and the planet. This seems to be more about philosophy than science.Overall though, this is an informative and entertaining read for a non-scientist like me and the quirky examples make the underlying facts more memorable.*I received a copy of Human Errors from the publisher via Netgalley."
228,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1619539-nancy,4,"Some Problems with Human EvolutionEvolution is a marvelous process. It allowed humans to reach status of the preeminent species on earth, but it came with a cost. Evolution is driven by mutations. They create new genes that allow for additional functionality, but it’s impossible to get rid of the old patterns. This leads to problems like backwards retinas, bad knees, swallowing and breathing through the same narrow channel and more. The book is witty and although it presents a great deal of technical information, the presentation is clear and amusing, suitable for a general audience. I enjoyed the book and learned about some problems with the human body I had never heard of before. I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that made the book more fun. The chapters are relatively short and the illustrations make it easy to understand some of the technical discussion. The notes section is extensive and whether you agree with his ideas or not provides references for future study. I recommend this book for anyone interested in biology or nutrition. There is a good chapter on why humans need such a varied diet based on some evolutionary problems.I received this book from Net Galley for this review."

Human Errors strikes a good balance between covering topics that most people will have heard of already and others that will be brand new. It may be described as a pretty dry topic but whether the bodily issues covered are relevant or not, I find them fascinating and feel like I've learned a little bit more about why our bodies are basically messed up and so prone to breaking down.Of course, this kind of book would be hopelessly boring if there wasn't any humour included so thankfully there is, although most of it would fit right in to a book of ""dad jokes"". Maybe the author could have consulted someone funny to help inject a little more, but at the same time it's by no means decisive in making the book pleasant to read.Having sped through this book in a week, I think it happened to be the kind of book I wanted to read at this moment and the main take away is not that of specific deficiencies of the human body, but the impression that not only is it incredible that evolution happened to bring us this far and that we are each somewhat akin to a soup of different cells and genes, somehow coordinating to keep us standing for long enough to enjoy this brief moment of consciousness!"

Learning about how the human eye is backwards, how our mucus has to travel upwards (its inefficiency and consequential prone to infections), how our nerves have to wind around our body (because of our evolutionary roots from fish), and so on, is like bringing the curious inner child inside of me to a candy store. Learning about all the weird but cool things about my own body is utterly fascinating.The second and third part was not as exciting for me, more of a reiteration of bio and psy 101, especially the last part, when the author describes biases, heuristics, and illusions. It was nonetheless interesting, but for me personally, I have already knew these things and thus the awe factor was removed.The author has a way of describing things (even technical) without being boring.

236,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Folks who think ‘intelligent design’ does a better job of describing the miracle of nature that is the human body than ‘evolution by means of natural selection’ have some explaining to do. That’s because the ‘intelligence’ behind our present form is, in many ways, very, very bad at its job. In fact, it’s safe to say that any engineering major worth their salt could make numerous design improvements to our bodies without breaking a sweat. Need some examples?-	We eat, drink and breath through the same hole in our face, which makes choking a real hazard. Thousands of people die each year due to this design flaw. In fact, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death.-	Unlike most other animals, humans can’t make their own vitamin C (we have to consume it in our food). Many sailors died of scurvy before this fact was realized.-	Baby’s heads are too big for women’s pelvises. Before the advent of modern medicine, human infant (and maternal) mortality rates were some of the highest in the entire animal kingdom.-	Some people (myself included) have life-threatening allergies to common foods because our immune systems can’t distinguish between safe and unsafe proteins. -	We have too many bones in our wrists and ankles making them prone to injury. Not to mention the prevalence of knee and back problems within our species thanks to bad design. -	Our eyes aren’t that great, which is why 60% of the population wears eyeglasses. We also have a blind spot thanks to a backwards retina.-	Our maxillary sinuses drain upwards (against the pull of gravity), making us more prone than other species to sinus infections. -	Men’s testicles are external to their bodies leaving them exposed and vulnerable to injury (as any male bicycle rider surely knows all too well). -	Our mouths are too crowded for our teeth, which is why many people have their wisdom teeth surgically removed. We also only have 1 set of adult teeth, which means dentures are required once those are lost. Anyone who thinks these design flaws are ‘intelligent’ is not thinking clearly, which of course is indicative of yet another system error … our brains, which are so very easy to fool we need a systematic procedure to reduce biases, sloppy rationalizations, and erroneous conclusions … it’s called the ‘scientific method’. Thanks the application of this process we’ve learned many things about the natural world that benefit us in our daily lives and enabled technologies such as cell phones, antibiotics, aircraft and computers. As if that weren’t enough, the scientific method has also definitively demonstrated that ‘intelligent design’ is what scientists refer to as a 'failed hypothesis', otherwise known as a cockeyed load of half-baked hogwash. Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes describes many of the myriad ways our bodies are an agglomeration of kludged together parts. Why? Because that’s the way evolution works. It doesn’t have any forethought or design plan in mind and mutational changes can only make small modifications to structures that already exist. Since it can’t redesign anatomy from the bottom up to make it more effective, we’re stuck with what we have (at least until gene editing technology improves). Fortunately, medical advances and technology enable us to overcome some, though not all, of our physical deficiencies. In the case of my own (a severe allergy to tree nuts), food safety labeling requirements and increased awareness within the restaurant industry have significantly reduced risks of exposure. As to the book, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Lents has an engaging writing style that that is both entertaining and informative. Although I thought the epilog went off in a rather strange and irrelevant direction in its discussion of the Fermi Paradox, the Drake equation and intelligent alien life in the universe (which not only has little to do with the topic of this book, but the reason we haven’t discovered it has a simple explanation … it doesn’t exist … but that’s a discussion for another time)."
237,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Nathan Lents gives us a lively and interesting look at some of the major flaws of the human body--starting with our eyes, and working downward. Our lenses are backwards. Our wrists and ankles have extra, unnecessary bones that serve no real function. We have a variety of genetic diseases, more than most other species, and they don't get effectively selected against for a variety of frustrating reasons. Once a gene acquires a mutation, it tends to accumulate more mutations. Once that happens, the problem can't be fixed by another single mutation of the kind that caused the original problem. The deletion of our ability to manufacture our own vitamin C, like most mammals, got deleted in a common ancestor of primate species long ago. It wasn't selected against because all the early primates lived in the midst of a vitamin C-rich food supply. That mutation has been accumulating more mutations since long before genus homo arose. We're not getting it back.Others are even more frustrating. The mutation that causes sickle cell anemia causes a devastating, painful, deadly disease--if you get two copies of that gene, one each from father and mother. It ought to have been selected against long ago! Oh, except for one inconvenient fact. If you get only one copy of the disease, you have a higher than normal resistance to malaria. Malaria can also debilitate and kill you. Someone who has one copy of the sickle cell gene doesn't get sickle cell, and is less likely to get malaria, and more likely to survive malaria if they do. In regions where malaria is a major problem, people with one copy of the sickle cell gene will be more likely to live long enough to have more offspring, and thus more descendants--even though some of them will have sickle cell anemia due to getting two copies of the gene.Nor are we really fully adapted to walking upright, or to giving birth to children with such large brains. Our babies are born several months earlier than they ""should"" be, based on the degree of development they have at birth, even compared to our closest relatives, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo.I can't do credit to Lents' writing of this, or to L.J. Ganser's reading of it. It's informative and enjoyable.Recommended.I bought this audiobook."
238,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2778499-midwest-geek,4,"This was a surprisingly entertaining read. Lents must be a very popular lecturer, for he has a very self-effacing, approachable style. For a good summary and evaluation similar to mine, I recommend the review by Rebecca. I would add that the main theme of how evolution can unwittingly produce inefficient organisms is something that seems not widely appreciated. In particualar, although I knew some of these facts, such as the preponderence of junk DNA, I developed a greater appreciation of human inefficiencies that result from the nature of evolution.An early example in the book is that the retina of the eye is so poorly designed as to have its light sensors pointing toward the back of the head instead of toward the lens of the eye, leaving humans and other vertebrates much less sensitive to light intensity than they could be and leading to the well-known blind spot. I had not known that an independent evolutionary path to vision followed by cephalopods (such as octopi and squid) led to a far more sensible design with the light sensors facing forward instead of backward and without a blind spot. They can see the light from a single photon (like our best electronic detectors), whereas our eyes typically require a minimum of about 5 or 6 photons of comparable intensity before provoking a response. The book could be used to bolster the case against ""intelligent design"" but that isn't its intention.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in how humans came to be as we are. I got it from the library, but I will keep it in mind as a present for certain grandchildren when they get a little older."

240,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,4,"Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes by Nathan Lents admits from the get-go that there are more than enough books about how great and wondrous the human body is. Lents takes a whole different tack: how human bodies have huge design flaws, from big system like our bones to the DNA in every cell.  Why do we have a blind spot in each eye? It is because the retina is wired backwards. Why are the drains for our sinuses in the wrong place? To make room for our oversized brains. Is it really a good idea to take in food through the same opening that we use for breathing? Lents thinks definitely not. The wrist has way too many bones, grouped “...like a pile of rocks,” a turn of phrase that produces a vivid mental image. Human Errors brings up ideas about vitamins that I had never remotely considered. Why don’t dogs and other animals need vitamin C in their diets? Because they can make it themselves. Why can’t we? Because, through a genetic mutation, we lost that ability. Minerals, which always have to be consumed, cause us problems because we have trouble absorbing them. Calcium absorption gets worse as we age, and iron deficiency is the number one nutritional deficiency both in the US and in the world. Obesity is also a natural fallout from poor design.Focusing in on human DNA and running the numbers, Lents demonstrates that DNA are enormously wasteful, with 97% of DNA not “saying”anything. These include strings called pseudo genes, one of which causes us to not be able to generate our own vitamin C. Other strands of DNA are discarded bits of ancient viruses, and even pieces of our own genetic material, copied over and over like an office printer run amok. There are a myriad of problems with human reproductive systems, from the fact that the Fallopian tubes are not even connected to the ovaries (!) to the fact the sperm can only turn in one direction. Autoimmune diseases are just ongoing mistakes made by your body, plain and simple. Allergic reactions to poison ivy and bee stings fall in this same category. Memory is another area where we have big problems. Given only some information about an event, our brains try to fill in the gaps. In the case of gambling, our imperfect brains try to find patterns where there are none. Kudos to Human Errors for shining a light in dark places, providing me with new insights into how the body works (and doesn’t)."
241,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107567624-philip,3,"I'm a bit torn about this book. I want to like it more than I do.I love the idea of the book. How awesome isn't it to discover all our little inherited quirks and flaws compounded over hundreds of millions of years of evolution!? Brilliant, right!? To a degree, Lents delivers. However, it seems like he's cherry-picked the most commonly known oddities about our genetic make-up. If you already have some basic knowledge - or even familiarity - with our ""design"" flaws, you likely won't learn much. You may even stumble on a few things where he's apparently wrong - or, at least, where he's oversimplified something to the point of being wrong. Not to mention that - and, fyi, this may just be me - it makes my stomach churn when he illustrates something like our anecdotal bias and how it's so very wrong with - drum roll please... - yup, an anecdote! (I wish I had a pukey face emoji right about now). I'm also not stoked about the last part of the book where he ventures away from the actual topic into things like extraterrestrial life (or lack thereof), the Fermi paradox, and other things like that. Not that it isn't interesting, it is, but it just feels off in this book (also, same thing here, if you're reading a book like this, the Fermi paradox likely isn't a new concept to you... right?).Regardless, despite my little whine-fest above, I do like the book. It's a light read - which might actually be a positive to some (?), even if I would have preferred a little more substance - and it's fun to contemplate how things could end up so bonkers. I just wish there would have been more! I also think a lot of our problems today could be alleviated if more of humanity had the flaws he mentions, as well as others, in mind before going off half-cocked on each other!I also want to mention that my rating would have been different if Lents would have kept to the science of our evolutionary flaws (that s**t is awesome!). He could have then honed in a little more on each particular flaw and fleshed it out - as well as explored more of them. Had he done this I would say it's a solid 4-star, and we would probably have learned a ton more. But anyway... and in summary, if you happen to stumble on this quick little read, it's totally worth the half-day (or so) it takes to read :)."

The author presents the subjects in an easy to understand and read fashion. While it addresses how hard it is for evolution to correct itself once a change has been made (whether purposeful or by accident), a little more of the science and/or research behind it would have been helpful.That said, I do recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in why our bodies are not the perfect biological machine (and far from it)."

It’s focus is on the flaws of the human body, anatomically, physiologically and genetically. But the genius of the book is that it really makes the reader understand evolution so much clearer. Our genes do there best to prepare us for life but there are some very odd peculiarities that just don’t make sense from a “intelligent designer” perspective. From allergies to auto immune diseases such as lupus, our bodies aren’t always looking out for our best interest.

For a book about science facts,  Human Errors shines in that it's not super technical, but not dumbed-down to a childish level. I think this book hits the sweet spot for what it is.

251,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67762255-brooke,4,For anatomy nerds like myself the first 3/4 of this book is excellent. I lost interest in last few chapters as they switched to more human behavior errors rather than anatomy. The evolution of the human compared to other mammals is very interesting. This book touches on a wide variety of errors our body has but is still so functional.

If you want to learn more about how natural selection could have done better, I highly recommend this. Towards the end the book diverges a bit, in my opinion, from its original premise but is still engaging. Nathan Lents is no Mary Roach, but when I buy this book it will go on the same shelf. "
253,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book through NetGalley.]I found this to be both an informative and entertaining read. While the author doesn’t delve very deep into details (each subject in each chapter would probably warrant a book of its own), and although I wish there had been more developed explanations at times, I’m also aware that one book couldn’t tackle everything in one go—and he nevertheless provides enough information for a reader to go on research some more later on a given topic.I already knew some of the ‘human errors’ presented in the book (such as junk DNA and mutations), but definitely not others, such as why we get so many headcolds (our sinuses placed the wrong way), why we do actually make our own B12 vitamin but can’t use it (same with other vitamins—and this is why we need a varied diet, with all the problems it entails), or why our ways of procreating are, in fact, very inefficient compared to those of other mammals. So, discovering all this was fascinating, and the explanations provided also satisfy the unavoidable ‘why’ questions that rose immediately after (I’m very much a why person; every physician who attended me since I’ve learnt to speak can testify to this). For instance, we lost the ability to make our own vitamin C, whose absence will lead to scorbut and kill us; but the mutation that led to this defect wasn’t erased through evolution because it happened in areas where fruit was easily available, and a diet of fruit would compensate for our rotten GULO gene… until the latter stuck, happily passed around to descendants.I liked that some explanations went a bit further: it’s not only about this or that physical defect, but also about how we’re still wired for survival techniques and reactions dating back to prehistoric times, and how some of our modern behaviours are thus impacted. An extended example would be gambling, and why people in general have irrational reactions such as ‘now that I’ve lost ten times in a row, I -must- win, there’s no other way’ (though statistically, you could lose an 11th time), or will bet more and more when they’re on winning streak, and risk losing it all or more, rather than save those earnings. Those would go back to the way we interpreted situations to learn from them and survive (man sees a lion in a bush, concludes bushes often hide a lion, and then avoids bushes). Same with optical illusions, due to our brains’ ability to ‘fill in the blanks’.On the side of actual errors, I noticed a few (redundant words or phrases, that a last editing pass would probably remove). Nothing too bad, though.Conclusion: Due to the lack of deeper details and general simple writing, this book is probably more for laypeople rather than people with a strong scientific background—but even then, there’s still a chance that some of the ‘human errors’ may still be of interest to them. "
254,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"We all know that the human body is not perfect. Any of us who wear glasses, get the flu, fall and land on our coccyx, take vitamins, or try to lose weight knows this first hand.In this book, Nathan Lents gives us a lot of scientific information about human development, how human systems work, and why our bodies evolved the way they did. What makes this book so special is that he presents all of this information in an easy to understand and entertaining fashion. He presents our faults and limitations clearly and in a way clever enough that you will often find yourself laughing at your own limitations.This is not to say that this book is all fun and games. Lents explains how poorly we deal with certain diseases, how the body often attacks itself, how errors occur when DNA replicates, the flaws in our reproductive system, and that all of us - if we live long enough- will get cancer. These are definitely not light topics but, again, he presents them in a way to help you understand the how and why they are part of our makeup.Many readers will have already heard of some of the ""glitches"" he mentions that are contained in the human body - such as the poor construction of the human eye or the pelvis being to small to all for easy births. However, many of the defects Lents presents are ones you haven't heard of or did not previously understand that they were ""built-in"" by evolution.Lent addresses how medical science has made major progress in learning about the human body and finding ways to deal with the ""blunders of nature"" but, also, how there are many that may be more than science can correct. He continues on to conjecture that if all of these problems can be addressed will we be able to live forever and, if so, what would that mean for our society and our planet?In the Epilogue, ""The Future of Humanity"", Lents moves from the daily glitches and moves into the areas of global warming, apocalyptic wars, space exploration, and the question of whether there is life elsewhere in the universe. While he does an excellent job of presenting his thoughts on these very important topics, I feel that they would have been better addressed in a different book than as an add-on to this one.Overall, I enjoyed reading Human Errors. I learned, I laughed, I cringed, and I came face to face with the many flaws that are a part of being a human being."

If you believe this, then you first need to Google Charles Darwin and evolution. Second, you need to take another look at the human body. Because we are full of defects. This book will give you a few examples of some of our most glaring flaws; flaws that can be found from head to toe, and in our body's architecture as well as in our DNA.What could possibly be wrong with having a shared channel for air and food? (This is a rhetorical question, but in case you really wonder, food gets stuck, and we die...). It has to be like that, you might argue. But that would be ignoring whales and dolphins. They eat with their mouth and breathe through a different hole on their back; they don’t risk choking. We also have genes for creating several vitamins, e.g., vitamin C – only they are broken. Usually, this doesn't matter because we get vitamin C in our diets and therefore natural selection has had not selected against this detect. But it is a defect nonetheless if we do not get any vitamin C for a while, as sailors crossing the Atlantic, we get sick and die – all because of our non-functional gene. The reason for our imperfections is that evolution cannot start over, it works by making small gradual changes. Evolution can only undo things partially, which is why we still have a tailbone which is by the way also useless – except for getting hurt...This book is a call for rationality. It provides a tiny grain of sand to balance the mountains of books glorifying the human body and its 'perfection.' To be sure the human body is impressive in many ways but perfect it is not. "

This book offers a broad look into the defect of the human body, the imperfect and haphazard nature of natural evolution, and what the future have in store for us as individuals and as a collective. The book describes humans as, to paraphrase lightly, imperfect creatures that are not exempt from evolution’s grasps. Just because of the efficiency in curing preexisting ailments and improving living conditions had skyrocketed, humanity has yet to reach past evolution as we are change with each passing generation. The author delivered on the premise and presented a well-reasoned conclusion that humanity have both the ability to better oneself and the ability to bring forth mutually assured destruction. The writing was not confusing nor is it filled with jargon, yet it conveys the point and delves deeply into analysing what exactly, biologically speaking, we are and whether we are truly the best evolution can do. Would recommend to readers interested in Medical sciences and and/or philosophy in relation humans especially with the advent of transhumanism and the influx of revolutionary medical techniques being developed at this very moment such as CRISPR or prothetic limbs that would ultimately be more powerful than our biological ones.. This is an easy read with simple and often humorous language that is bound to fascinate."
257,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18001516-kate-vane,4,"Evolution does not mean we are continually moving towards perfection. Mutations happen by chance, and they may or may not be good for us. If they don’t kill us and if they don’t stop us reproducing, they stick around.Human Errors details some of these ‘errors’ and includes some fascinating examples. Our dodgy knees are a hangover from our primate days, and were never meant to support us standing up. Our retinas are the wrong way round and we’d be much better off if we had the eyes of an octopus.There are chapters which focus on the more serious consequences of these errors – such as hereditary diseases and autoimmune conditions which lead the body to attack itself.I was fascinated by the chapter on reproduction and loved the image of menopausal orca whales leading hunting packs of young males, but when I thought about it later, I wasn’t clear whether the author thinks the menopause in humans is an error at all.There’s also an epilogue which is more speculative. Lents’ argument seems to be that the inventiveness of humans allows us to outpace our errors, or even turn them into strengths. However these strengths can also be weaknesses. He argues that selfishness and short-term thinking may well lead humanity to destroy itself and the planet. This seems to be more about philosophy than science.Overall though, this is an informative and entertaining read for a non-scientist like me and the quirky examples make the underlying facts more memorable.*I received a copy of Human Errors from the publisher via Netgalley."

It allowed humans to reach status of the preeminent species on earth, but it came with a cost. Evolution is driven by mutations. They create new genes that allow for additional functionality, but it’s impossible to get rid of the old patterns. This leads to problems like backwards retinas, bad knees, swallowing and breathing through the same narrow channel and more. The book is witty and although it presents a great deal of technical information, the presentation is clear and amusing, suitable for a general audience. I enjoyed the book and learned about some problems with the human body I had never heard of before. I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that made the book more fun. The chapters are relatively short and the illustrations make it easy to understand some of the technical discussion. The notes section is extensive and whether you agree with his ideas or not provides references for future study. I recommend this book for anyone interested in biology or nutrition. There is a good chapter on why humans need such a varied diet based on some evolutionary problems.I received this book from Net Galley for this review."

Human Errors strikes a good balance between covering topics that most people will have heard of already and others that will be brand new. It may be described as a pretty dry topic but whether the bodily issues covered are relevant or not, I find them fascinating and feel like I've learned a little bit more about why our bodies are basically messed up and so prone to breaking down.Of course, this kind of book would be hopelessly boring if there wasn't any humour included so thankfully there is, although most of it would fit right in to a book of ""dad jokes"". Maybe the author could have consulted someone funny to help inject a little more, but at the same time it's by no means decisive in making the book pleasant to read.Having sped through this book in a week, I think it happened to be the kind of book I wanted to read at this moment and the main take away is not that of specific deficiencies of the human body, but the impression that not only is it incredible that evolution happened to bring us this far and that we are each somewhat akin to a soup of different cells and genes, somehow coordinating to keep us standing for long enough to enjoy this brief moment of consciousness!"

Learning about all the weird but cool things about my own body is utterly fascinating.The second and third part was not as exciting for me, more of a reiteration of bio and psy 101, especially the last part, when the author describes biases, heuristics, and illusions. It was nonetheless interesting, but for me personally, I have already knew these things and thus the awe factor was removed.The author has a way of describing things (even technical) without being boring.

266,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Folks who think ‘intelligent design’ does a better job of describing the miracle of nature that is the human body than ‘evolution by means of natural selection’ have some explaining to do. That’s because the ‘intelligence’ behind our present form is, in many ways, very, very bad at its job. In fact, it’s safe to say that any engineering major worth their salt could make numerous design improvements to our bodies without breaking a sweat. Need some examples?-	We eat, drink and breath through the same hole in our face, which makes choking a real hazard. Thousands of people die each year due to this design flaw. In fact, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death.-	Unlike most other animals, humans can’t make their own vitamin C (we have to consume it in our food). Many sailors died of scurvy before this fact was realized.-	Baby’s heads are too big for women’s pelvises. Before the advent of modern medicine, human infant (and maternal) mortality rates were some of the highest in the entire animal kingdom.-	Some people (myself included) have life-threatening allergies to common foods because our immune systems can’t distinguish between safe and unsafe proteins. -	We have too many bones in our wrists and ankles making them prone to injury. Not to mention the prevalence of knee and back problems within our species thanks to bad design. -	Our eyes aren’t that great, which is why 60% of the population wears eyeglasses. We also have a blind spot thanks to a backwards retina.-	Our maxillary sinuses drain upwards (against the pull of gravity), making us more prone than other species to sinus infections. -	Men’s testicles are external to their bodies leaving them exposed and vulnerable to injury (as any male bicycle rider surely knows all too well). -	Our mouths are too crowded for our teeth, which is why many people have their wisdom teeth surgically removed. We also only have 1 set of adult teeth, which means dentures are required once those are lost. Anyone who thinks these design flaws are ‘intelligent’ is not thinking clearly, which of course is indicative of yet another system error … our brains, which are so very easy to fool we need a systematic procedure to reduce biases, sloppy rationalizations, and erroneous conclusions … it’s called the ‘scientific method’. Thanks the application of this process we’ve learned many things about the natural world that benefit us in our daily lives and enabled technologies such as cell phones, antibiotics, aircraft and computers. As if that weren’t enough, the scientific method has also definitively demonstrated that ‘intelligent design’ is what scientists refer to as a 'failed hypothesis', otherwise known as a cockeyed load of half-baked hogwash. Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes describes many of the myriad ways our bodies are an agglomeration of kludged together parts. Why? Because that’s the way evolution works. It doesn’t have any forethought or design plan in mind and mutational changes can only make small modifications to structures that already exist. Since it can’t redesign anatomy from the bottom up to make it more effective, we’re stuck with what we have (at least until gene editing technology improves). Fortunately, medical advances and technology enable us to overcome some, though not all, of our physical deficiencies. In the case of my own (a severe allergy to tree nuts), food safety labeling requirements and increased awareness within the restaurant industry have significantly reduced risks of exposure. As to the book, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Lents has an engaging writing style that that is both entertaining and informative. Although I thought the epilog went off in a rather strange and irrelevant direction in its discussion of the Fermi Paradox, the Drake equation and intelligent alien life in the universe (which not only has little to do with the topic of this book, but the reason we haven’t discovered it has a simple explanation … it doesn’t exist … but that’s a discussion for another time)."
267,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Nathan Lents gives us a lively and interesting look at some of the major flaws of the human body--starting with our eyes, and working downward. Our lenses are backwards. Our wrists and ankles have extra, unnecessary bones that serve no real function. We have a variety of genetic diseases, more than most other species, and they don't get effectively selected against for a variety of frustrating reasons. Once a gene acquires a mutation, it tends to accumulate more mutations. Once that happens, the problem can't be fixed by another single mutation of the kind that caused the original problem. The deletion of our ability to manufacture our own vitamin C, like most mammals, got deleted in a common ancestor of primate species long ago. It wasn't selected against because all the early primates lived in the midst of a vitamin C-rich food supply. That mutation has been accumulating more mutations since long before genus homo arose. We're not getting it back.Others are even more frustrating. The mutation that causes sickle cell anemia causes a devastating, painful, deadly disease--if you get two copies of that gene, one each from father and mother. It ought to have been selected against long ago! Oh, except for one inconvenient fact. If you get only one copy of the disease, you have a higher than normal resistance to malaria. Malaria can also debilitate and kill you. Someone who has one copy of the sickle cell gene doesn't get sickle cell, and is less likely to get malaria, and more likely to survive malaria if they do. In regions where malaria is a major problem, people with one copy of the sickle cell gene will be more likely to live long enough to have more offspring, and thus more descendants--even though some of them will have sickle cell anemia due to getting two copies of the gene.Nor are we really fully adapted to walking upright, or to giving birth to children with such large brains. Our babies are born several months earlier than they ""should"" be, based on the degree of development they have at birth, even compared to our closest relatives, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo.I can't do credit to Lents' writing of this, or to L.J. Ganser's reading of it. It's informative and enjoyable.Recommended.I bought this audiobook."
268,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2778499-midwest-geek,4,"This was a surprisingly entertaining read. Lents must be a very popular lecturer, for he has a very self-effacing, approachable style. For a good summary and evaluation similar to mine, I recommend the review by Rebecca. I would add that the main theme of how evolution can unwittingly produce inefficient organisms is something that seems not widely appreciated. In particualar, although I knew some of these facts, such as the preponderence of junk DNA, I developed a greater appreciation of human inefficiencies that result from the nature of evolution.An early example in the book is that the retina of the eye is so poorly designed as to have its light sensors pointing toward the back of the head instead of toward the lens of the eye, leaving humans and other vertebrates much less sensitive to light intensity than they could be and leading to the well-known blind spot. I had not known that an independent evolutionary path to vision followed by cephalopods (such as octopi and squid) led to a far more sensible design with the light sensors facing forward instead of backward and without a blind spot. They can see the light from a single photon (like our best electronic detectors), whereas our eyes typically require a minimum of about 5 or 6 photons of comparable intensity before provoking a response. The book could be used to bolster the case against ""intelligent design"" but that isn't its intention.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in how humans came to be as we are. I got it from the library, but I will keep it in mind as a present for certain grandchildren when they get a little older."
269,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23635526-john-haake,4,"My wife and I read this together ... which proved wonderful fodder for the two of us to make fun of each others bodies (none of the flaws we made fun of where ever mentioned in the book).As indicated from our joking -- this book merely scratches the surface of all the flaws built into our bodies -- but the glitches, errors and basically left-over junk in our bodies that the author does cover is very interesting and gave me a lot to think about, which is just what I want out of a pop-science, science-lite type book.This book clearly puts into question the whole ""intelligent design"" argument, as one would hope if there was some divine being in charge of design of His/Her ultimate creation that they would have been a bit more precise on the ""intelligent"" part of that design -- be a forewarned creationist reader, you will not be getting a dose of support for ""superior"" design of these human bodies over and above those of the rest of the animal kingdom -- indeed, there is quite a bit of evidence to the contrary and the ""sacrifices/compromises"" the human body had to take on as a product of our increasing intelligence over other species. --- interestingly described in a section of the book about how other animals don't need supplemental vitamins because they produce their own.Of course, my favorite part of the book was about the virus graveyard -- fascinating, those little creatures bordering the fine line between ""life"" and ""non-life""Enjoy this read!"
270,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534347-phil-smith,4,"Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes by Nathan Lents admits from the get-go that there are more than enough books about how great and wondrous the human body is. Lents takes a whole different tack: how human bodies have huge design flaws, from big system like our bones to the DNA in every cell.  Why do we have a blind spot in each eye? It is because the retina is wired backwards. Why are the drains for our sinuses in the wrong place? To make room for our oversized brains. Is it really a good idea to take in food through the same opening that we use for breathing? Lents thinks definitely not. The wrist has way too many bones, grouped “...like a pile of rocks,” a turn of phrase that produces a vivid mental image. Human Errors brings up ideas about vitamins that I had never remotely considered. Why don’t dogs and other animals need vitamin C in their diets? Because they can make it themselves. Why can’t we? Because, through a genetic mutation, we lost that ability. Minerals, which always have to be consumed, cause us problems because we have trouble absorbing them. Calcium absorption gets worse as we age, and iron deficiency is the number one nutritional deficiency both in the US and in the world. Obesity is also a natural fallout from poor design.Focusing in on human DNA and running the numbers, Lents demonstrates that DNA are enormously wasteful, with 97% of DNA not “saying”anything. These include strings called pseudo genes, one of which causes us to not be able to generate our own vitamin C. Other strands of DNA are discarded bits of ancient viruses, and even pieces of our own genetic material, copied over and over like an office printer run amok. There are a myriad of problems with human reproductive systems, from the fact that the Fallopian tubes are not even connected to the ovaries (!) to the fact the sperm can only turn in one direction. Autoimmune diseases are just ongoing mistakes made by your body, plain and simple. Allergic reactions to poison ivy and bee stings fall in this same category. Memory is another area where we have big problems. Given only some information about an event, our brains try to fill in the gaps. In the case of gambling, our imperfect brains try to find patterns where there are none. Kudos to Human Errors for shining a light in dark places, providing me with new insights into how the body works (and doesn’t)."
271,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107567624-philip,3,"I'm a bit torn about this book. I want to like it more than I do.I love the idea of the book. How awesome isn't it to discover all our little inherited quirks and flaws compounded over hundreds of millions of years of evolution!? Brilliant, right!? To a degree, Lents delivers. However, it seems like he's cherry-picked the most commonly known oddities about our genetic make-up. If you already have some basic knowledge - or even familiarity - with our ""design"" flaws, you likely won't learn much. You may even stumble on a few things where he's apparently wrong - or, at least, where he's oversimplified something to the point of being wrong. Not to mention that - and, fyi, this may just be me - it makes my stomach churn when he illustrates something like our anecdotal bias and how it's so very wrong with - drum roll please... - yup, an anecdote! (I wish I had a pukey face emoji right about now). I'm also not stoked about the last part of the book where he ventures away from the actual topic into things like extraterrestrial life (or lack thereof), the Fermi paradox, and other things like that. Not that it isn't interesting, it is, but it just feels off in this book (also, same thing here, if you're reading a book like this, the Fermi paradox likely isn't a new concept to you... right?).Regardless, despite my little whine-fest above, I do like the book. It's a light read - which might actually be a positive to some (?), even if I would have preferred a little more substance - and it's fun to contemplate how things could end up so bonkers. I just wish there would have been more! I also think a lot of our problems today could be alleviated if more of humanity had the flaws he mentions, as well as others, in mind before going off half-cocked on each other!I also want to mention that my rating would have been different if Lents would have kept to the science of our evolutionary flaws (that s**t is awesome!). He could have then honed in a little more on each particular flaw and fleshed it out - as well as explored more of them. Had he done this I would say it's a solid 4-star, and we would probably have learned a ton more. But anyway... and in summary, if you happen to stumble on this quick little read, it's totally worth the half-day (or so) it takes to read :)."

It was with the understanding that I would post a review on Net Galley, Goodreads, Amazon, Barnes and Noble and my fiction book review blog. I also posted it to my Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google Plus pages.I requested this book as the desription sounded fascinating. It is the first book by Nathan H. Lents that I have read.This book is a very good read. The subtitle of the book provides a good synopsis - a panorama of our glitches, from pointless bones to broken genes. The author presents the subjects in an easy to understand and read fashion. While it addresses how hard it is for evolution to correct itself once a change has been made (whether purposeful or by accident), a little more of the science and/or research behind it would have been helpful.That said, I do recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in why our bodies are not the perfect biological machine (and far from it)."
273,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157556-lucas-h-golding,5,"A Wonderful Evolution bookThis is a fantastic science book. It’s focus is on the flaws of the human body, anatomically, physiologically and genetically. But the genius of the book is that it really makes the reader understand evolution so much clearer. Our genes do there best to prepare us for life but there are some very odd peculiarities that just don’t make sense from a “intelligent designer” perspective. From allergies to auto immune diseases such as lupus, our bodies aren’t always looking out for our best interest. Read this book, it’s entertaining and well written and you will definitely learn some valuable information."

It's interesting to read how we came to be stuck with some unfortunate limitations, yet still, dominate as a species. For a book about science facts,  Human Errors shines in that it's not super technical, but not dumbed-down to a childish level. I think this book hits the sweet spot for what it is. I've read books in the (what I'll call) rundown-of-interesting-facts genre that are far less satisfying.Thanks to NetGalley and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for a digital ARC. All views are my own."

Your point of view might be based on science: evolution isn't an end-game, or based on faith: we already know we're not perfect.

281,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67762255-brooke,4,For anatomy nerds like myself the first 3/4 of this book is excellent. I lost interest in last few chapters as they switched to more human behavior errors rather than anatomy. The evolution of the human compared to other mammals is very interesting. This book touches on a wide variety of errors our body has but is still so functional.

The facts were well explained but sufficiently science-y that I wasn’t bored at all. The author clearly has a great sense of humor. If you want to learn more about how natural selection could have done better, I highly recommend this. Towards the end the book diverges a bit, in my opinion, from its original premise but is still engaging. Nathan Lents is no Mary Roach, but when I buy this book it will go on the same shelf. "
283,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,4,"[I received a copy of this book through NetGalley.]I found this to be both an informative and entertaining read. While the author doesn’t delve very deep into details (each subject in each chapter would probably warrant a book of its own), and although I wish there had been more developed explanations at times, I’m also aware that one book couldn’t tackle everything in one go—and he nevertheless provides enough information for a reader to go on research some more later on a given topic.I already knew some of the ‘human errors’ presented in the book (such as junk DNA and mutations), but definitely not others, such as why we get so many headcolds (our sinuses placed the wrong way), why we do actually make our own B12 vitamin but can’t use it (same with other vitamins—and this is why we need a varied diet, with all the problems it entails), or why our ways of procreating are, in fact, very inefficient compared to those of other mammals. So, discovering all this was fascinating, and the explanations provided also satisfy the unavoidable ‘why’ questions that rose immediately after (I’m very much a why person; every physician who attended me since I’ve learnt to speak can testify to this). For instance, we lost the ability to make our own vitamin C, whose absence will lead to scorbut and kill us; but the mutation that led to this defect wasn’t erased through evolution because it happened in areas where fruit was easily available, and a diet of fruit would compensate for our rotten GULO gene… until the latter stuck, happily passed around to descendants.I liked that some explanations went a bit further: it’s not only about this or that physical defect, but also about how we’re still wired for survival techniques and reactions dating back to prehistoric times, and how some of our modern behaviours are thus impacted. An extended example would be gambling, and why people in general have irrational reactions such as ‘now that I’ve lost ten times in a row, I -must- win, there’s no other way’ (though statistically, you could lose an 11th time), or will bet more and more when they’re on winning streak, and risk losing it all or more, rather than save those earnings. Those would go back to the way we interpreted situations to learn from them and survive (man sees a lion in a bush, concludes bushes often hide a lion, and then avoids bushes). Same with optical illusions, due to our brains’ ability to ‘fill in the blanks’.On the side of actual errors, I noticed a few (redundant words or phrases, that a last editing pass would probably remove). Nothing too bad, though.Conclusion: Due to the lack of deeper details and general simple writing, this book is probably more for laypeople rather than people with a strong scientific background—but even then, there’s still a chance that some of the ‘human errors’ may still be of interest to them. "
284,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"We all know that the human body is not perfect. Any of us who wear glasses, get the flu, fall and land on our coccyx, take vitamins, or try to lose weight knows this first hand.In this book, Nathan Lents gives us a lot of scientific information about human development, how human systems work, and why our bodies evolved the way they did. What makes this book so special is that he presents all of this information in an easy to understand and entertaining fashion. He presents our faults and limitations clearly and in a way clever enough that you will often find yourself laughing at your own limitations.This is not to say that this book is all fun and games. Lents explains how poorly we deal with certain diseases, how the body often attacks itself, how errors occur when DNA replicates, the flaws in our reproductive system, and that all of us - if we live long enough- will get cancer. These are definitely not light topics but, again, he presents them in a way to help you understand the how and why they are part of our makeup.Many readers will have already heard of some of the ""glitches"" he mentions that are contained in the human body - such as the poor construction of the human eye or the pelvis being to small to all for easy births. However, many of the defects Lents presents are ones you haven't heard of or did not previously understand that they were ""built-in"" by evolution.Lent addresses how medical science has made major progress in learning about the human body and finding ways to deal with the ""blunders of nature"" but, also, how there are many that may be more than science can correct. He continues on to conjecture that if all of these problems can be addressed will we be able to live forever and, if so, what would that mean for our society and our planet?In the Epilogue, ""The Future of Humanity"", Lents moves from the daily glitches and moves into the areas of global warming, apocalyptic wars, space exploration, and the question of whether there is life elsewhere in the universe. While he does an excellent job of presenting his thoughts on these very important topics, I feel that they would have been better addressed in a different book than as an add-on to this one.Overall, I enjoyed reading Human Errors. I learned, I laughed, I cringed, and I came face to face with the many flaws that are a part of being a human being."
285,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,4,"Man was created by God. We are his perfect creation. Our perfection is evident in every detail of our design. Right? If you believe this, then you first need to Google Charles Darwin and evolution. Second, you need to take another look at the human body. Because we are full of defects. This book will give you a few examples of some of our most glaring flaws; flaws that can be found from head to toe, and in our body's architecture as well as in our DNA.What could possibly be wrong with having a shared channel for air and food? (This is a rhetorical question, but in case you really wonder, food gets stuck, and we die...). It has to be like that, you might argue. But that would be ignoring whales and dolphins. They eat with their mouth and breathe through a different hole on their back; they don’t risk choking. We also have genes for creating several vitamins, e.g., vitamin C – only they are broken. Usually, this doesn't matter because we get vitamin C in our diets and therefore natural selection has had not selected against this detect. But it is a defect nonetheless if we do not get any vitamin C for a while, as sailors crossing the Atlantic, we get sick and die – all because of our non-functional gene. The reason for our imperfections is that evolution cannot start over, it works by making small gradual changes. Evolution can only undo things partially, which is why we still have a tailbone which is by the way also useless – except for getting hurt...This book is a call for rationality. It provides a tiny grain of sand to balance the mountains of books glorifying the human body and its 'perfection.' To be sure the human body is impressive in many ways but perfect it is not. "

This book offers a broad look into the defect of the human body, the imperfect and haphazard nature of natural evolution, and what the future have in store for us as individuals and as a collective. The book describes humans as, to paraphrase lightly, imperfect creatures that are not exempt from evolution’s grasps. Just because of the efficiency in curing preexisting ailments and improving living conditions had skyrocketed, humanity has yet to reach past evolution as we are change with each passing generation. The author delivered on the premise and presented a well-reasoned conclusion that humanity have both the ability to better oneself and the ability to bring forth mutually assured destruction. The writing was not confusing nor is it filled with jargon, yet it conveys the point and delves deeply into analysing what exactly, biologically speaking, we are and whether we are truly the best evolution can do. Would recommend to readers interested in Medical sciences and and/or philosophy in relation humans especially with the advent of transhumanism and the influx of revolutionary medical techniques being developed at this very moment such as CRISPR or prothetic limbs that would ultimately be more powerful than our biological ones.. This is an easy read with simple and often humorous language that is bound to fascinate."
287,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18001516-kate-vane,4,"Evolution does not mean we are continually moving towards perfection. Mutations happen by chance, and they may or may not be good for us. If they don’t kill us and if they don’t stop us reproducing, they stick around.Human Errors details some of these ‘errors’ and includes some fascinating examples. Our dodgy knees are a hangover from our primate days, and were never meant to support us standing up. Our retinas are the wrong way round and we’d be much better off if we had the eyes of an octopus.There are chapters which focus on the more serious consequences of these errors – such as hereditary diseases and autoimmune conditions which lead the body to attack itself.I was fascinated by the chapter on reproduction and loved the image of menopausal orca whales leading hunting packs of young males, but when I thought about it later, I wasn’t clear whether the author thinks the menopause in humans is an error at all.There’s also an epilogue which is more speculative. Lents’ argument seems to be that the inventiveness of humans allows us to outpace our errors, or even turn them into strengths. However these strengths can also be weaknesses. He argues that selfishness and short-term thinking may well lead humanity to destroy itself and the planet. This seems to be more about philosophy than science.Overall though, this is an informative and entertaining read for a non-scientist like me and the quirky examples make the underlying facts more memorable.*I received a copy of Human Errors from the publisher via Netgalley."

It allowed humans to reach status of the preeminent species on earth, but it came with a cost. Evolution is driven by mutations. They create new genes that allow for additional functionality, but it’s impossible to get rid of the old patterns. This leads to problems like backwards retinas, bad knees, swallowing and breathing through the same narrow channel and more. The book is witty and although it presents a great deal of technical information, the presentation is clear and amusing, suitable for a general audience. I enjoyed the book and learned about some problems with the human body I had never heard of before. I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that made the book more fun. The chapters are relatively short and the illustrations make it easy to understand some of the technical discussion. The notes section is extensive and whether you agree with his ideas or not provides references for future study. I recommend this book for anyone interested in biology or nutrition. There is a good chapter on why humans need such a varied diet based on some evolutionary problems.I received this book from Net Galley for this review."

Human Errors strikes a good balance between covering topics that most people will have heard of already and others that will be brand new. It may be described as a pretty dry topic but whether the bodily issues covered are relevant or not, I find them fascinating and feel like I've learned a little bit more about why our bodies are basically messed up and so prone to breaking down.Of course, this kind of book would be hopelessly boring if there wasn't any humour included so thankfully there is, although most of it would fit right in to a book of ""dad jokes"". Maybe the author could have consulted someone funny to help inject a little more, but at the same time it's by no means decisive in making the book pleasant to read.Having sped through this book in a week, I think it happened to be the kind of book I wanted to read at this moment and the main take away is not that of specific deficiencies of the human body, but the impression that not only is it incredible that evolution happened to bring us this far and that we are each somewhat akin to a soup of different cells and genes, somehow coordinating to keep us standing for long enough to enjoy this brief moment of consciousness!"

Learning about how the human eye is backwards, how our mucus has to travel upwards (its inefficiency and consequential prone to infections), how our nerves have to wind around our body (because of our evolutionary roots from fish), and so on, is like bringing the curious inner child inside of me to a candy store. Learning about all the weird but cool things about my own body is utterly fascinating.The second and third part was not as exciting for me, more of a reiteration of bio and psy 101, especially the last part, when the author describes biases, heuristics, and illusions. It was nonetheless interesting, but for me personally, I have already knew these things and thus the awe factor was removed.The author has a way of describing things (even technical) without being boring.

That’s because the ‘intelligence’ behind our present form is, in many ways, very, very bad at its job. In fact, it’s safe to say that any engineering major worth their salt could make numerous design improvements to our bodies without breaking a sweat. Need some examples?-	We eat, drink and breath through the same hole in our face, which makes choking a real hazard. Thousands of people die each year due to this design flaw. In fact, choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death.-	Unlike most other animals, humans can’t make their own vitamin C (we have to consume it in our food). Many sailors died of scurvy before this fact was realized.-	Baby’s heads are too big for women’s pelvises. Before the advent of modern medicine, human infant (and maternal) mortality rates were some of the highest in the entire animal kingdom.-	Some people (myself included) have life-threatening allergies to common foods because our immune systems can’t distinguish between safe and unsafe proteins. -	We have too many bones in our wrists and ankles making them prone to injury. Not to mention the prevalence of knee and back problems within our species thanks to bad design. -	Our eyes aren’t that great, which is why 60% of the population wears eyeglasses. We also have a blind spot thanks to a backwards retina.-	Our maxillary sinuses drain upwards (against the pull of gravity), making us more prone than other species to sinus infections. -	Men’s testicles are external to their bodies leaving them exposed and vulnerable to injury (as any male bicycle rider surely knows all too well). -	Our mouths are too crowded for our teeth, which is why many people have their wisdom teeth surgically removed. We also only have 1 set of adult teeth, which means dentures are required once those are lost. Anyone who thinks these design flaws are ‘intelligent’ is not thinking clearly, which of course is indicative of yet another system error … our brains, which are so very easy to fool we need a systematic procedure to reduce biases, sloppy rationalizations, and erroneous conclusions … it’s called the ‘scientific method’. Thanks the application of this process we’ve learned many things about the natural world that benefit us in our daily lives and enabled technologies such as cell phones, antibiotics, aircraft and computers. As if that weren’t enough, the scientific method has also definitively demonstrated that ‘intelligent design’ is what scientists refer to as a 'failed hypothesis', otherwise known as a cockeyed load of half-baked hogwash. Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes describes many of the myriad ways our bodies are an agglomeration of kludged together parts. Why? Because that’s the way evolution works. It doesn’t have any forethought or design plan in mind and mutational changes can only make small modifications to structures that already exist. Since it can’t redesign anatomy from the bottom up to make it more effective, we’re stuck with what we have (at least until gene editing technology improves). Fortunately, medical advances and technology enable us to overcome some, though not all, of our physical deficiencies. In the case of my own (a severe allergy to tree nuts), food safety labeling requirements and increased awareness within the restaurant industry have significantly reduced risks of exposure. As to the book, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Lents has an engaging writing style that that is both entertaining and informative. Although I thought the epilog went off in a rather strange and irrelevant direction in its discussion of the Fermi Paradox, the Drake equation and intelligent alien life in the universe (which not only has little to do with the topic of this book, but the reason we haven’t discovered it has a simple explanation … it doesn’t exist … but that’s a discussion for another time)."
297,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Nathan Lents gives us a lively and interesting look at some of the major flaws of the human body--starting with our eyes, and working downward. Our lenses are backwards. Our wrists and ankles have extra, unnecessary bones that serve no real function. We have a variety of genetic diseases, more than most other species, and they don't get effectively selected against for a variety of frustrating reasons. Once a gene acquires a mutation, it tends to accumulate more mutations. Once that happens, the problem can't be fixed by another single mutation of the kind that caused the original problem. The deletion of our ability to manufacture our own vitamin C, like most mammals, got deleted in a common ancestor of primate species long ago. It wasn't selected against because all the early primates lived in the midst of a vitamin C-rich food supply. That mutation has been accumulating more mutations since long before genus homo arose. We're not getting it back.Others are even more frustrating. The mutation that causes sickle cell anemia causes a devastating, painful, deadly disease--if you get two copies of that gene, one each from father and mother. It ought to have been selected against long ago! Oh, except for one inconvenient fact. If you get only one copy of the disease, you have a higher than normal resistance to malaria. Malaria can also debilitate and kill you. Someone who has one copy of the sickle cell gene doesn't get sickle cell, and is less likely to get malaria, and more likely to survive malaria if they do. In regions where malaria is a major problem, people with one copy of the sickle cell gene will be more likely to live long enough to have more offspring, and thus more descendants--even though some of them will have sickle cell anemia due to getting two copies of the gene.Nor are we really fully adapted to walking upright, or to giving birth to children with such large brains. Our babies are born several months earlier than they ""should"" be, based on the degree of development they have at birth, even compared to our closest relatives, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo.I can't do credit to Lents' writing of this, or to L.J. Ganser's reading of it. It's informative and enjoyable.Recommended.I bought this audiobook."
298,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2778499-midwest-geek,4,"This was a surprisingly entertaining read. Lents must be a very popular lecturer, for he has a very self-effacing, approachable style. For a good summary and evaluation similar to mine, I recommend the review by Rebecca. I would add that the main theme of how evolution can unwittingly produce inefficient organisms is something that seems not widely appreciated. In particualar, although I knew some of these facts, such as the preponderence of junk DNA, I developed a greater appreciation of human inefficiencies that result from the nature of evolution.An early example in the book is that the retina of the eye is so poorly designed as to have its light sensors pointing toward the back of the head instead of toward the lens of the eye, leaving humans and other vertebrates much less sensitive to light intensity than they could be and leading to the well-known blind spot. I had not known that an independent evolutionary path to vision followed by cephalopods (such as octopi and squid) led to a far more sensible design with the light sensors facing forward instead of backward and without a blind spot. They can see the light from a single photon (like our best electronic detectors), whereas our eyes typically require a minimum of about 5 or 6 photons of comparable intensity before provoking a response. The book could be used to bolster the case against ""intelligent design"" but that isn't its intention.I highly recommend this to anyone interested in how humans came to be as we are. I got it from the library, but I will keep it in mind as a present for certain grandchildren when they get a little older."
299,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23635526-john-haake,4,"My wife and I read this together ... which proved wonderful fodder for the two of us to make fun of each others bodies (none of the flaws we made fun of where ever mentioned in the book).As indicated from our joking -- this book merely scratches the surface of all the flaws built into our bodies -- but the glitches, errors and basically left-over junk in our bodies that the author does cover is very interesting and gave me a lot to think about, which is just what I want out of a pop-science, science-lite type book.This book clearly puts into question the whole ""intelligent design"" argument, as one would hope if there was some divine being in charge of design of His/Her ultimate creation that they would have been a bit more precise on the ""intelligent"" part of that design -- be a forewarned creationist reader, you will not be getting a dose of support for ""superior"" design of these human bodies over and above those of the rest of the animal kingdom -- indeed, there is quite a bit of evidence to the contrary and the ""sacrifices/compromises"" the human body had to take on as a product of our increasing intelligence over other species. --- interestingly described in a section of the book about how other animals don't need supplemental vitamins because they produce their own.Of course, my favorite part of the book was about the virus graveyard -- fascinating, those little creatures bordering the fine line between ""life"" and ""non-life""Enjoy this read!"
