0,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31378222-dr-godot,1,"The readers who will love this book are those who prefer their history presented as fictionalized adventure starring a hero who triumphs over a villain and becomes a Great Man. Such readers will not mind that a great deal of this “true tale” derives from Aptowicz’s imagination: the long description of Mütter’s imagined seasickness during his first ocean voyage, the imagined half-eaten Parisian meals right down to the imagined menu, the imagined smiles exchanged by doctor and patient following surgery to repair a cleft palate. (If I had just had my cleft palate repaired without being anesthetized, I don’t think I’d be smiling right after the operation—but this is Aptowicz’s imagination, not mine.)The readers who will not love this book are those who prefer their history based on thorough research and intelligent scholarship. Here’s why.Aptowicz admits that she found Mütter a difficult subject to research. What few primary sources exist —19th-century anecdotes, panegyrics upon Mütter’s death, one speech, a medical notebook—are not numerous or objective enough to compose anything like a complete picture of the man. Aptowicz’s next step should have been to look at scholarly secondary sources that could have helped her determine what might logically fill in the gaps in her narrative. An example of such a source is Sickness and Health in America: Readings in the History and Medicine and Public Health, published by the University of Wisconsin Press, a standard university text. This step would have helped the author understand the cultural and intellectual context in which Mütter lived and worked.But this was not her next step. She cites no academic article, no book published by a university press, nothing written by an authoritative historian. Her single scholarly resource was a Norton anthology of historical excerpts. This book is the only source listed for Aptowicz’s entire Chapter Eleven, but we never learn the authors or the titles of the excerpted works because the book is cited 23 times only by editor. Clearly, scholarly research is not Aptowicz’s forte. (Her website advertises her as a poet and performer.) With the exception of this anthology, Aptowicz’s sources are not scholarly. She relies heavily on a mysterious unpublished biographical sketch of Mütter by an associate professor of dentistry. She also cites a couple of coffee-table picture books, a 19th-century student’s romanticized recollections of Paris, and so on. (Sources are presented only in notes. There’s no bibliography.) As a result of not consulting modern scholarship, Aptowicz attributes to Mütter attitudes and opinions that are simply not credible given his time and education. For instance, she says that Mütter “did not believe there was any biological difference between the races past the superficial,” defining race as “all the different skin colors that humans can possess” (page 248 of the advance proof). Aptowicz’s assertion ignores that fact that medical practitioners of the mid-19th century did not define race as merely variation in skin color. Educated people of Mütter’s time defined race to encompass variations in intelligence, family and community structure, “moral character,” group behavior, religious and artistic tendencies, temperament, and many other factors that we now categorize as cultural rather than biological. A video released by Mütter’s own museum explains that the white medical establishment’s understanding of African American bodies began only during the Civil War (years after Mütter’s death), when army surgeons learned to treat the diseases and wounds of black soldiers (http://muttermuseum.org/videos/broken...).Mütter’s best memorial is still his museum, not this book. Visit the museum or its website (http://muttermuseum.org/)."

This should be required reading material for anyone intersted in pursuing a career in medicine, or just intersted in history - because it's truly immersing and eye-opening.Though the novel is called ""Dr. Mutters Marvels"", it's not only about him - but also about the many other doctors whom he'd worked with and had been inspired by throughout his life. Mainly, however, it was about his story and his rise in fame (obviously), and how medicine and surgery progressed (and how many of those progresses were because of him!). But it's such a shame Dr. Mutter passed away so young - to think of how much more he could have accomplished had he not been sick!Overall, this should be a novel read by everyone - especially those who love medicine, history, or work in Healthcare. It exhibits how much medicine has advanced in America - and you'll especially be shocked with how surgeries were handled 150 years ago! It's almost disturbing to read in detail - yet, truly fascinating!"

Aptowicz's work is sensitive, informative, and enchanting - a work of elegant prose and loving research. A beautiful book about a beautiful man who, thanks to Aptowicz, is now further protected from obscurity."
3,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3829694-mlpmom-book-reviewer,4,"I can honestly say I have never read a book quite like this one before. Fiction and fact, blended together so seamlessly that it is sometimes hard to tell them apart. To know when something was fictionalized from dramatic sake or because it really happened.Either way, this book was quite interesting. No, quite fascinating and dare I say, even fun?Once again I find myself in unfamiliar territory with this read. Something I never would have picked up on my own but truly enjoyed. I confess that I knew nothing about Dr. Thomas Mutter but am now quite curious about his life work and all the medical advances he made throughout his career. In fact, I would love to visit Philadelphia and see the museum that was erected in his honor and all the oddities that live there. The author did a fabulous job blended the fact with the fiction and making this read not only somewhat mesmerizing, but entertaining as well. I truly had fun learning about this remarkable professor and doctor and all that he had to offer the world, some of which, is still practiced today.If you are looking for a different kind of historical read, then this is the read for you. *A review copy of this was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*"

Despite this, he would become a fantastic surgeon and although dying early, he would leave a lasting legacy.Wonderfully told, entertainingly written, the is a story of a man ahead of his time. He believed in cleanliness of supplies, room and person, at a time when doctors would routine pass germs from one person to the next. He would discover the use of ether as a pain reliever, at. Time when surgery was performed giving the patient only wine. In fact hospitals kept use supplies of wine for just this person.

But it was the empathy he ha for his patients that impressed me the most.A look at the medical schools and doctor's training in the 1800's. Once again so glad I live now and not then, though I think a few doctors could still learn empathy from Dr. Mutter. "
5,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4482441-shappy-seasholtz,5,"If you have ever been to the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia, which houses one of the largest collections of medical oddities in America, it is more likely you will walk out of the museum with your head full of questions such as ""Why did that woman turn into soap?"" and ""How did that guy walk around with a 300 pound colon?"" However, you might not ask yourself, ""Who collected all of this weird, freaky stuff and why?"" and that's what Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz's new book seeks to answer.Who was Thomas Dent Mutter?Turns out he was one of the most innovative characters in early medical history who revolutionized the practice of plastic surgery, the use of ether and clean instruments during surgery and pretty much the concept of outpatient care!The author does a great job taking us back to the pre-Civil War era of medicine in Philadelphia and to the founding of the Jefferson Medical College where Mutter lectured and performed his surgeries. It's amazing how crude and primitive seems compared to the state of the medical advances we have today.I don't want to spoil too much of the book here, but I found it to be a very engaging read. If you like David McCullough or Erik Larson's books, you are going to enjoy the fascinating story of Mutter!Also, there are lots of pictures scattered throughout the book and most chapters start with words of wisdom from Mutter himself! A very well-designed book!"
6,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"A few years back, the hubs (then boyfriend) and I visited the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia, because I'm kind of morbid and curious like that, and it was something to do. For such a small museum, it was packed with interesting bones and tools and casts and molds, as well as the stories behind them. It was fascinating, as well as somewhat sad, to think that these were artifacts from real people who existed... and were considered ""monsters"" because of a fluke of biology, or an accident, or simply a side-effect of being poor and so desperate for work that you'll work in literally toxic factories. I bought this cute tote bag: At the time, I didn't realize that the Mutter Museum was literally the life's work and collection of a man. I suppose, had I thought about it at all, the most museums are created and endowed by individuals... but I didn't think about it until I read this book and had my ""Ohhhhhh!"" moment. I think that I probably would have picked up this book regardless of my previously having been to the Mutter Museum (morbid and curious, remember?) because who could pass up this cover, and this title? It's creepy and intriguing. And I'm glad that I did not pass it up, because the story told here was truly fascinating and awesome. Within this book, we are granted a glimpse into the life of a man that would help shape the course of modern medicine, a man who seemingly invented ""bedside manner"" - at least in the US - and one who took pride in putting the care and comfort and decision-making power in the hands of his patients, rather than assuming that their knowledge and comfort was unnecessary. This biography not only tells about Dr. Mutter himself, but also the environment that he existed within - Philadelphia in the mid-19th century was a crazy place, full of people, illnesses, accidents, and ignorance. Science had not yet discovered microbes, so we're talking about the kind of ignorance that thinks that illness is caused by ""breathing bad air"" or ""too much blood"". Medicine was often brutal, and often was riskier than just dealing with the illness itself. When you're sick with cholera from drinking from dirty river water, and shitting your guts out, the last thing that you want is some ""doctor"" bleeding you dry to try to draw out the illness via your blood. Seems counter-intuitive to me... but I live in a modern era, thankfully, which has benefited from a century's worth of science since then. But this is the kind of environment that Mutter was working in, and his ideas regarding the spread of illness via dirty tools and hands was... unwelcome. Many were insulted by the mere thought. These were DOCTORS. They don't SPREAD disease, they CURE it. (Or the patient dies trying. Six of one, half a dozen of the other.)But thankfully, in the end he was vindicated, as it was proven that failing to clean up after one's self and tools after touching or performing surgery on someone with an illness DOES actually contribute to the spread of said illness in subsequent people treated. Cray cray, I know. He was also an early adopter of using ether anesthesia while performing surgeries, though this too was unpopular at the time. Some thought that pain was necessary for healing, and others thought that pain was ""God ordained"" and shouldn't be meddled with. (Though how they reckoned this with the fact that they were going against the ""God ordained"" illness or injury or malady or whatever and trying to heal it... I don't know.) This ""God wills it"" pain argument was popular with Charles Meigs, obstetrician, who was a colleague of Dr. Mutter, and one that he bumped ideological heads with often. He (Meigs) was delightful... If you enjoy condescension and cruelty with your malpractice and closed-minded ""I am a MAN, so of course I know what's best for WOMEN"" misogyny. Yup. The guy who was supposed to help women with their pregnancies, deliveries, and general lady part health... was a raging boastful misogynist, who thought that eternal childbearing pain as punishment for original sin was totally valid as an argument against anesthesia for women. Bet he was just a HOOT at parties. Anywho... This book covers a lot of ground, considering that Mutter's life was actually pretty short. He died at 47, but managed to accomplish so much during that time, and help so many people, that the end of the book, where his students and colleagues and friends were memorializing him, it brought a tear to my eye. This was a man who wanted to help people who were hopeless and optionless, and he did just that. He was smart, daring, willing to try new techniques and treatments... but most importantly, he was honest and empathetic with his patients. He didn't treat them as though they were lesser beings just because they were ill or disfigured or disabled. He treated everyone with dignity and respect. And if that is not the kind of message that I think we all need right now, I don't know what is."
7,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3528864-darryl,5,"I was somewhat familiar with Dr. Thomas Mütter, the famed 19th century Professor of Surgery at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, whose personal collection and funding led to the creation of The Mütter Museum of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, which is my favorite museum of medical history. However, after reading Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz's fascinating and compulsively readable biography of Mütter I realized how little I knew about him, and how influential he was to the development of modern surgery, the advancement of medicine as a science, and the reformation of medical education in Philadelphia and the United States.Thomas Dent Mutter (1811-1859) was born to a mother from an established Virginia family and a father who was a hard working first generation Scottish immigrant. Although the Mutters were happy and modestly successful at the time of Thom's birth the family of four was quickly struck down by illness, and by 1818 he was an orphan with no surviving close relatives. Fortune did shine on young Thomas, as he was soon adopted by Robert Wormelely Carter, a wealthy Virginia landowner who was a distant cousin of his mother. Carter supported Thomas's educational endeavors, and after he realized that medicine was his calling he graduated from the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania at the age of 20.After graduation Mutter (who changed his name to Mütter, in keeping with his flamboyant lifestyle and dress) sailed to Paris, where he learned the latest surgical techniques under the leading practitioners there, including the legendary Guillaume Dupuytren. He returned to Philadelphia, but he was unable to establish a successful practice as a general surgeon despite his clinical skill and growing reputation in the city's medical community. Mütter began teaching at the Medical Institute in Philadelphia, and soon afterward he joined the faculty at the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia's second medical college after the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. There he quickly became a revered instructor who was noted for his active engagement of his students during his lectures, along with his skill in the operating theater and the compassion he showed to his patients before and especially during surgery, at a time when anesthesia was limited to wine and other spirits.Mütter was closely linked to several advancements and innovations in 19th century surgery and medicine, including the use of a patient's own skin to form surgical grafts; the utilization of ether as an effective anesthetic agent during surgery; the adoption of antiseptic techniques to reduce the likelihood of postoperative infections and puerperal (childbed) fever; and the creation of postoperative hospital wards, where patients would be closely and compassionately cared for under his watchful eye.Sadly, Mütter suffered from ill health throughout his life, which curtailed his brilliant career as a surgeon and teacher. Fortunately he ensured his legacy with the creation of the Mütter Museum, which opened in 1863 and moved to its current location on 22nd Street between Market and Chestnut Streets in Center City Philadelphia in 1909. The museum is open to the general public seven days per week.Aptowicz does a superb job in her portrayal of Mütter, as her interest in and enthusiasm for the surgeon shines on every page. The book is written for a general audience, and it is filled with rich detail about the history of early and mid 19th century medicine, medical education and surgery. Dr. Mütter's Marvels is a captivating study of one of the most interesting and influential physicians in American history, and I cannot recommend this book highly enough."
8,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6984286-rachel,5,"Most excellent book!Written in a way that draws in the reader, as with a beloved mystery, this non-fiction book compels the reader forward with brilliant use of language and creates an accessibility for the laymen that isn't in any way ""dumbed-down"".While having been fascinated by the Mutter Museum and its treasures, I had no idea how many contributions Thomas Mutter made to modern medicine, including the most basic hygiene in an era where germs had yet to be discovered and contagions were considered superstition; pre- and post-operative patient care (including recovery rooms!); and an empathetic approach to dealing with patients as humans with lives rather than simply cases to be logged.A brilliant, fascinating read, I highly recommend it."
9,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8024272-kasia,4,This should be a mandatory reading for anyone in medical profession. Wonderful story of a man whose determination and talent created and transformed field of surgery and medicine. Now I want to go to Philadelphia to see his museum. 
10,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25472523-jim,5,"WOW!!! This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. Cristin's writing style is unsurpassed. Filled with stories and facts that can easily boggle the mind, Cristin lays it out so fluidly and effortlessly. Easily followed and understood, the reader is captivated by each and every page that follows the life of Dr. Mutter and those around him. Definitely a book that deserves to be on everyone's shelf! "
11,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4939131-joanne-moyer,4,"Extremely interesting story of a man not many have probably heard of. Dr. Mutter practiced medicine, or practiced what was called 'medicine' in his time, during the mid to late 1800s. This was a time when cleanliness apparently was not considered close to godliness, doctors saw no reason in washing their hands between treating patients, or cleaning their instruments between surgeries, which not surprisingly, caused a lot of pain and death of patients rather than healing them. Dr Mutter was one of the first to proclaim the merits of cleanliness and anesthesia, which at this time was not used. He became most famous for his work in plastic surgery for people with facial deformities, cleft palates, and especially burns, in which he created the 'Mutter flap' which is still used in burn surgery today. Very interesting look at the times and the ways doctors worked. I was reminded of Taylor Caldwell's Testimony of Two Men which is about a young doctor in the 1800s trying to get doctors to wash hands and their instruments. She has said the story was based on a real doctor who she would not name, but someone her father, a doctor in the Philadelphia area which is where Dr Mutter practiced, knew. I can't help but wonder if the 'hero' in her book is him."
12,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/761281-mike,4,"This was an enjoyable read. Mutter's career saw many big changes in medical theory and practice, and the author celebrates his role in championing plastic surgery for the deformed and burn victims, the use of anesthesia, germ theory, and the importance cleanliness; the author also argues that his compassion and insistence that patients be treated with dignity and decency were perhaps his greatest legacy, for many of his students went on to great things. Today he is best remembered for the surgical technique that bears his name (using a flap of skin to repair or replace damaged tissue) and for Philadelphia's famous Mutter Museum, which houses a massive collection of medical specimens and oddities.Because of his pioneering work in plastic/restorative surgery, and perhaps because of the museum, the book does include a number of illustrations and descriptions that make this something you won't want to read while eating. This is probably to be expected in any book about 19th century medicine, though.*full disclosure, I won a free copy of this book via the Goodreads ""first-reads"" program and was asked to post a review.*"
13,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7897151-amanda,4,"A highly readable biography of the seemingly kindest doctor I've ever heard about. This is also a great overview of innovation in early American medicine. If you can't handle descriptions of surgeries, then I wouldn't recommend this. I found them harrowing at times, but appropriate and helpful in understanding what early medicine looked like. I wanted to visit the Mutter Museum before, but I want to see it even more now!"
14,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32642-kate,4,"I've said it before and I'll say it again - thank goodness for modern medicine! I visited Dr. Mutter's museum in Philadelphia years ago and would love to revisit it now that I know more about his life, contributions, and philosophies."
15,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6881951-lisa-shafer,4,"Disclaimer: I received a free ARC of this book in a Goodreads giveaway.This is very good narrative non-fiction.Before my copy arrived, I read a couple of the negative reviews posted on Goodreads, and I was concerned. However, now that I have read Aptowicz's book, I find I disagree with most of what these negative reviews say.I really enjoy narrative non-fiction done right. But that is what this is: narrative. If you want only historical facts presented textbook-style (which I also enjoy, by the way), then you might not like this book. But if you enjoyed books such as Larson's The Devil In The White City or Johnson's The Ghost Map, then Dr. Mutter's Marvels is probably a good choice.This book tells the story of a remarkable genius who is not well known outside of Philadelphia and/or the medical community. Thomas Dent Mütter was fabulous, flamboyant, controversial, and way ahead of his time in the field of plastic surgery -- and also in progressive ideas such as cleanliness, treating patients with respect, and using ether to make surgeries easier for both patients and doctors.I was pleased with the amount of notes available for me to check the research, as I am always suspicious of authors' claims when notes and references are not included. Those who wish to check facts or read more will find that Aptowicz has included plentiful resources. As I had an ARC, the fact that the index was not yet in the book disappointed me, but I'm quite sure that the ""real"" book will not have that problem.So why did I give this four stars instead of five? Well, the author does jump around quite a bit, taking several sections of this chronological narrative out of order in a way that can be rather confusing. She's also a bit inconsistent with her treatment of other doctors/medical researchers at the time. Some of them get plenty of coverage, but others are not even named when she discusses the effects of their discoveries on Mütter and his work. She also praises the medical community in Paris at the time but ignores the tremendous influence of the medical world in Edinburgh -- including the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, which had been in existence for over 100 years before Mütter got his ""original"" idea of creating a similar museum. I have a hard time believing that Mütter would have heard NOTHING of the medical advancements in Scotland when he was supposedly so very influenced by Europeans and the community in Paris. Surely the Europeans would have been discussing the hot topics of the day from the medical communities in other large cities! But this is ignored in the book, except for one brief mention of Edinburgh. Thus, I wonder about the thoroughness of some parts of the research, however much I enjoyed -- and I DID enjoy -- the research which is included.But on the whole, I found this to be a very good and fascinating read. I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in American history, medical history, women's history (there is must on women's health here), or general gruesomeness (surgery required a very strong stomach)."
16,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27855323-allen-murphey,4,"Exhaustively researched and fifteen years in the making, Cristin Aptowicz’s biography of Dr. Thomas Dent Muller, 1840s and 1850s Philadelphia surgeon and teacher, is much more than a narrow biography. Aptowicz paints detailed portraits of Philadelphia society, of the early state of American medical training, and of the conditions of Western medicine before the Civil War. Mutter began his surgical career before anesthesia, before the infectious causes of disease were even guessed at, and when 20% of American children died before their first birthday. From his training, continuing study, and lively intellect Mutter initiated both surgical and teaching techniques that put him at the forefront of American – even European – medicine. Tragically, the ravages of then-untreatable diseases took Muller at the age of forty-seven.In Aptowicz’s hands Mutter’s desires and demons are both forceful and clear, and the changes he introduced to medicine and medical teaching are understood as the groundbreaking moves they were at the time. At least one surgical procedure named for him is still in use.The writing is smooth and appealing and the characters and society are deftly and clearly rendered. We learn as much about mid-nineteenth century Philadelphia and America as we do about Mutter and his colleagues. Aptowicz’s years of research and effort to bring Mutter’s story to life are rewarded by the fluidity and rich content of Dr. Mutter’s Marvels. It’s a story to be read and a life to be celebrated.>>Support independent bookstores by buying real books from real stores where you can talk with real booksellers.<<"
17,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5687551-josh-caporale,4,"4.5 starsI visited the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia twice, both when I was in the eighth grade. The area where I had the most interest was an exhibit titled ""When the President is the Patient,"" which had to do with abnormal medicine pertaining to the U.S. Presidents and contained such features as a tumor removed from Grover Cleveland's jaw and a piece of Charles Guiteau (who shot James Garfield)'s brain. The museum itself is a collection of anatomical items, keepsakes, and other related items that Dr. Thomas Dent Mutter collected from his surgeries and experiences during his tenure as a surgeon and surgeon administration and instructor at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, where he taught for 16 years. Approaching this book, I thought that the area of concentration would be placed on the abnormal medicine that was connected to Dr. Mutter's experiences and thus his collection of what he accumulated over the years, but this book turned out being much more and much more fulfilling at that. This book served as a biography for Dr. Mutter, the impact he made on medicine and the way we treat patients, and also the people around him that had an impact on his world and on medicine in general.Dr. Mutter was born in 1811 and orphaned by the time he was seven. He ultimately went to live with a relative of the family, who was not much older than he was. While he was given his basic needs, such as food and shelter and nothing more, his guardian was supportive of his pursuit to enter medicine. While the University of Pennsylvania was the premiere college for medical prospects, a doctor by the name of George McClellan (not to be mixed up with the Civil War general) did not agree with their methodologies and went on to find his own college, Jefferson Medical College. Dr. Mutter was struggling to find footing in the United States and went to Paris to develop some training before returning to the United States. He did not achieve success until he was able to make his way through Jefferson Medical College as an instructor and then ultimately the chief surgeon of the college.Dr. Mutter stood out, because he keep a good eye on the attire that he wore, taught with compassion and demonstrated compassion as he performed his surgeries, and perhaps the most important trait of his was that he was able to accept and embrace the forward progress that came with medicine. Where as many of his peers and colleagues remained stubborn and held more concern for their reputation than they did for the best that medical advancements had to offer, Mutter encouraged it, even if it meant that his articles, texts, and statements were to become immediately irrelevant. The greatest examples pertained to the use of ether and anesthetics in surgery and how colleagues like gynecological surgeon Dr. Charles D. Meigs not only detested it, but preached against it and attempted to demonstrate its negative effects in classes.Unfortunately, Dr. Mutter's health declined very quickly due to health issues he picked up early on in life that forced him into early retirement and he died in 1859. The book does explore his efforts into having his collection be made accessible for the general public to view which would eventually become the Mutter Museum, where the general individual(s) would pay an accessible fee for entry while medical students would receive free entry.""Dr. Mutter's Marvels"" is an important piece for anyone that is getting into or is merely interested in learning more about medicine. This book gives us a better idea of how brutal society was in 19th century America as far as illness was concerned and how dysentery, measles, yellow fever, and other conditions could lead to death. Even something as simple as a common cold could lead to early death and children was especially vulnerable. This book is incredibly accessible, has chapters that are no more than 15 pages long and even those chapters are split up by ideas. We get to explore some of Dr. Mutter's major surgeries, such as a pioneer to plastic surgery that takes healthy skin to replace burnt or damaged facial skin in what we know today as ""The Mutter Flap"" and there are visuals that help us develop a clearer image of what is taking place.Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz is straightforward with how acquiring information about Dr. Mutter proved to be a challenge, as there was not too many primary information about him. He was married, but never had children, and there is no information pertaining to why he never had children, which she brings up. She does introduce several people into the story that hold some relevance in some way, shape, or form, and the closure could have been a bit better for most of them and for most of the others introduced in this book. I do, however, find this to be a very small gripe compared to all of the feats and accomplishments that this book provides for readers.I feel that this book will make readers better people. It will make them more aware of the history of medicine, it will make them smarter, and it will make them more understanding and empathetic of one another. While I first associated Dr. Mutter as being an eccentric surgeon and collector, I now see him as being a revolutionary, compassionate surgeon that desired mostly to make the world a better place with his strengths and what he had to offer. I was looking to get into the history of medicine and learn more about medicine in general and this book was a great way to spark my curiosity and quench my desires to learn even more. "
18,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2830383-jeff,4,"I got this book thru the Early Review program on LibraryThing and Gotham Books. It is generally the biography of 19th Century plastic surgeon Dr. Thomas Mutter, but it is also a history of the dawn of modern medical schools in Philadelphia.I had never really heard of Dr. Mutter, except for the museum that bears his name. (A very eclectic medical collection that I would like one day to visit). The book documents his quick rise at the Jefferson Medical College as both a professor and wunderkind of surgery. He pioneered techniques that still hold his name today, was a early advocate of ether and nitrous oxide in surgery (around the mid 1840s). It was amazing both the resistance that the medical community had to anesthesia and the surgeries that they were able to accomplish WITHOUT it.The story is also about those around him, including Charles Meigs (one of the most famous obstetricians at the time), who was one of Mutter's main foes against the use of anesthesia, as well as how life in the 19th century affected how medicine was taught and practiced. Disease, overcrowding in the cities and working conditions being chief among them.No spoilers here, cause its on the back of the book, but Mutter died very young at 48 (ironically, for me, I just turned 48 this week) due to chronic ill health. He was just hitting his stride and I wonder what more he could have accomplished if he had lived. I think its telling that a lot of the ""characters"" in the book have wikipedia pages, but Mutter does not. Except for the museum, he doesn't seem to be well known in modern times. This book might help remedy this for some. A fascinating book about a fascinating man.Some interesting passages that struck me when I was reading:""I think anesthesia is of the devil,"" William Atkinson, the first president of the American Dental Association said, ""and I cannot give my sanction to any Satanic influence which deprives a man of the capacity to recognize law! I wish there were no such thing as anesthesia! I do not think men should be prevented from passing through what God intended them to endure!"" (yikes, and I hate going to the dentist in the 21st Century)(As Mutter began to recognize his mortality...) ""Before, Mutter had felt it was his role to lead by example, to show his students the heights they should strive to reach, even though their own talents and abilities would likely never match his own. But now, Mutter realized his task was to create doctors who could replace him.""S: 8/9/14 F: 8/17/14 (9 Days)"
19,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,5,"A lot of people, especially ones with a bit of a macabre turn of mind, have heard of Philadelphia’s Mutter Museum. It’s a medical museum, filled with skeletons, body parts in jars, and engravings of surgeries. But collection was not meant to be some sensationalist tourist stop; Mutter’s collection was for teaching medical students by showing them what diseases looked like in the body so they could recognize it. He felt it was vital that specimens like these be available. Dr. Thomas Dent Mutter was an amazing man. He became a doctor while young (there wasn’t as much schooling required in that era to become a doctor), studying in France where surgical techniques were far advanced from those in the US. He not only became a remarkable surgeon- he was ambidextrous- but he brought to America the practice of actually washing his hands and tools in between patients and was an early adopter of the use of anesthesia for operations. He performed a lot of reconstructive surgeries on victims of fires and accidents. He convinced the medical college to purchase some rooms that could be used for patient recovery- previously patients were put out in a cart and taken home as soon as the surgery was over. He thought of patients as actual people instead of just the operation performed on them. He instituted a lot of things we take for granted in hospitals today. Sadly, he died young. The author has consulted many primary sources for this biography. Descriptions of the surgeries Mutter performed are taken from his own writings. It’s not just a biography of Mutter, but in many ways a biography of surgical practices in America. Very interesting and a fast read. "

I particularly enjoyed the tracing of his effects upon the lives of his students and how they, in turn, fathered institutions and practices that further cemented Mutter's impact on medical history, not just in his lifetime, but changes that still ripple through how we view medicine, and the practice thereof, today. A great read, and one that I can recommend without a moment's hesitation."

Aptowicz creates a story that is not only riddled with facts and insights about 19th century Philadelphia and its medical community but entertaining and spirited.As someone who has visited the Mutter Museum and was enthralled with the rather extensive morbid collection of diseased bones and unusual tissue samples, I came into the book expecting a rather Gothic tale but was pleased to find a well-crafted tale about the museum's namesake and his influence on the Philadelphia medical community. Aptowicz traces Mutter's life from dandified orphan to medical legend, and from there, she examines not only his influences in Paris but how he affected an entire generation of doctors through his time at Jefferson College. Her affection for Mutter is evident, and while some may mention his lack of negative traits throughout the narrative, I would argue that a great man who contributed so much to science and the treatment of patients as human beings rather than cases and dollar signs, can be forgiven for being portrayed as rather perfect. It would also be difficult to portray Mutter's negative side as there is little left that was written by his own hand, and without personal letters or diaries, it would be hard to stipulate how the man was outside of the classroom or hospital where he would be his ""true"" self. My only other quibble with the text also stems from a lack of personal letters. The reader learns very little about Mary Mutter, and while she pops up several times during the text, she is nearly forgotten for most of the story. I would love to see Mary given a voice, but I do understand that without a diary or personal letters, portraying her role in his life would be difficult.Overall, Dr. Mutter;s Marvels was entertaining, enlightening, and a fascinating read for anyone who is interested in medical history, especially during a time when modern medicine was rapidly evolving yet still in its infancy."
22,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4265436-nicole,5,"I'm going to Philadelphia at the end of the month, and already planned on visiting the Mutter Museum - so when I saw this in the nonfiction new releases section of the library, I knew I had to read it! I'm very glad I did. This is exactly in my wheelhouse - narrative nonfiction (think Devil in the White City) - and I was enraptured from page 1. This book does a fantastic job of presenting a living, breathing historical figure, while also fleshing out the times and places through which he moved. I knew little of Mutter before I started the book - just that his collection of ""medical oddities"" could be found in his namesake museum - and that's not exactly the nicest thing to know about someone. If anything, the idea of someone collecting these mementos of suffering and deformity seemed a little ghoulish or exploitative. But now that I've read the book, I see it in an entirely new light. Mutter lived in a time of tremendous scientific upheaval in the medical community, and was often a champion of progressive medical ideals - promoting an antiseptic environment before germ theory was understood, embracing anesthesia when so many doctors were originally against it, promoting round-the-clock care for surgical patients at a time when they were usually simply put into a carriage and sent home after their procedures - but his greatest gift was his compassion for his patients. He sought out the most difficult cases, and despite how they appeared physically, he saw them as human beings who deserved honesty and compassionate care. His collection is a reflection of that - reminders of human suffering, but also human endurance and capability, and overall a testament to the progress made in the field of medicine.Annual Popsugar Reading Challenge: a book with alliteration in the title"
23,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15072306-dennis-mitton,5,"Buy this book now. If you have any interest in science, medicine, oddities, or general woo and weirdness you will love this book. Thos. Mutter has been quietly hailed by medical types for years as a forward thinking and flamboyant early practitioner. Born in 1811 when there was little difference between medicine and manning the butcher shop Mutter got his license and then sailed to France to watch the best for a year. He returned to Pennsylvania with an umlaut in his surname and a swagger in his step. He was both reviled and revered. Considered eccentric he left he put many colleagues at odds with insistence on innovation and leaning from live subjects or cadavers. He was one of the first to imagine surgery as something more than a last chance before death and his work correcting congenital deformities has earned him a place as a father of plastic surgery. He amassed a unique collection in his efforts to understand the human body. His collection is the basis of the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia and his work with deformities was seminal in a more modern view of medicine and humanity.The book is well written and reads easily. There are interesting pictures throughout. Dr. Mutter’s Marvels It is the best kind of historical biography that weaves history, personality, science, and culture into one seamless narrative. There is creative license here that will bother purists. The author, in an effort to make the plot more vibrant I assume, ascribes experiences and thoughts to Mutter that we cannot know if. If read as a boisterous and broad overview of the man and his times it is nothing but fun but this is no academic treatise on medical history. I don’t give many five star reviews but this one earns it hands down. "
24,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32535119-michelle,3,"Let me start off by saying that I received this book as an ARC Goodreads Giveaway. Aptowicz's biography proved to be a delightful read. In Dr. Mutter's Marvels she examines the life of Thomas Dent Mutter, a brilliant plastic surgeon in 1800's Philadelphia. Besides innovating the Mutter flap that would be used for over a hundred years after his death he also was among the first to successfully use anesthesia during surgery. Most importantly for his patients he understood the concept of cleanliness and practiced sterilization protocols long before Koch postulated his germ theory. It is evident that Aptowicz did an abundance of research for this book. In some portions it reads more as a biography of Jefferson Medical College's Faculty of '41, including such prominent doctors as Dr. Joseph Pancoast, Dr. Charles Meigs, and Dr. John Kearsley Mitchell. But sometimes in order to put someone's life into perspective you need to see them in the light of both their friends and adversaries. I've read some reviews on here and I recognize the frustration some academics and historians had with how Aptowicz deals with references. Typically if one were to use notes pages they would also have in text citations that refer the reader from their place within the prose to the corresponding notes at the back of the book. Alternatively one could do as Mary Roach has done and include the notes right there on the page. I found this approach aided in my understanding of the subject matter and allowed me to enjoy her book even more."
25,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19547206-meredith-allady,4,"This was not what I expected--it was much better! From the cover and the description I went in thinking it would probably be vaguely creepy (and that I probably wouldn't finish it). Then I started it and was surprised again by the format--lots of illustrations and ""filler"" pages that looked attractive but mainly added bulk but no text, so that I began to feel as if I was reading ""biography lite."" Fortunately, the writing itself is so good that I was sucked into the narrative despite my preconceived notions and prejudices, and ended up thoroughly enjoying this early look at medical practices--and particularly plastic surgery--in the U.S. Entertaining as well as informative, it inescapably makes one regret 1. that Dr. Mutter died so young, when there were still so many people he could have helped; and 2. that plastic surgery, which is seen here as a truly noble profession, has turning into the Hollywood joke that it largely is today. (I know that it must also be frequently practiced on behalf of those who truly need it as a result of burns, accidents, or birth defects: but, honestly, who hears about those cases nowadays?) As for the ""lite"" effect, the reason for this was explained by the author at the end, in citing the absence of diaries and personal letters left by the principle characters. Given this lack, I think she did a masterful job of pulling together what sources were available to fashion a complete narrative. And I want to go see the Mutter Museum!"
26,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874018-diana,4,"I loved this biography of Dr. Mutter and his medical discoveries, mainly in the surgical aspect of medicine. Prior to this, I had only known of the museum that the College of Physicians of Philadelphia opened when bequeathed Mutter's specimens prior to his death. He was actually a very compassionate doctor, championing the use of anesthetics when others in his college were against them and actively campaigned against them. He did facial reconstruction in those who would be forgotten or maligned without the surgery, doing his best to lower the risk and make the surgery easier to endure. Unfortunately, he died young and left much of what he considered his life's work unfulfilled. "

34,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,1,"I received Dr. Mutter’s Marvels free as a Good Reads First Read Book. The blurb promised the book to be fascinating and riveting, giving a good glimpse into American medicine in the 19th Century and how Doctor Thomas Mutter impacted it.First, the book starts off with a medical oddity that Mutter encounters while aboard ship to France. It’s a good hook to get you interested but medical oddities were far more common at that time then they are today. You get a bit of Mutter’s biography, which is what I thought the book would be about, but the author skips parts or starts with one thing and then goes off on something completely different. And other individuals get introduced but their introduction seems out of place.Many chapters could have been combined. A better history of medicine and the medical profession in America would have helped, which could have easily been a chapter unto itself. Plus, a general history of Philadelphia and a quick history of medicine in England and France would also have been beneficial. The text didn’t seem to flow chronologically but rather meandered wherever the author wanted it to. Dr. Mutter may have had a big impact on 19th Century American medicine but you don’t get that impression from the book.I felt rather cheated. I was promised a biography of a game changer and what I got was just another biography. You could almost have made it a history of the Faculty of ’41 (Jefferson School of Medicine, 1841) which would have been much more interesting and would have made much more sense. Things would have been more tied together, events would have flowed more smoothly, and a lot more material could have been added.Overall, it wasn’t a bad book. It just needed more work to make it better."
35,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1352540-bert,5,"This compelling story leaves readers wondering why Mutter is not a household name. Beyond his surgical innovation, he was a pioneer when it came to developing physician-patient relationships. Cristin O’Keefe Aptowicz doesn’t use the term, but she paints Mutter as a doctor who was among the first to understand the role of a good bedside manner. Mutter’s curiosity led to the advancement of the science to which he dedicated his life, but his compassion for humanity fueled those innovations. He deflected rivalry and skepticism – and even personal suffering – and dedicated himself to alleviating the suffering of others. Mutter’s teaching methods were equally influential. In fact it’s hard to accurately map how far his influence extends given the achievements of the countless students who benefited from his amiable lessons. It’s curious how names like Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Hawking and others form a group that seems to carry greater name recognition than those pioneers in the life sciences. I don't know why this is the case, but surely Mutter’s name belongs in that latter group as surely as Aptowicz’s latest work belongs on your reading list."
36,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6389813-maddie-barton,1,"What a deeply frustrating book. Aptowicz is an engaging writer, however I am not sure she is an engaging historical writer, and feel her talent may be more suited to fiction. I struggled with this book considerably, and feel it relies too much upon conjecture - especially upon emotional conjecture. I have no doubt that there was a great deal of primary source material available for Aptowicz to draw from, however there is little presented for the reader. At times Dr Mutter simply disappears for chapters, and the constant referral to his supposed rivalry with Dr Meigs, seems, well, supposed more than substantiated. The contextualising of Dr Mutter's time is all over the place, and every chapter ends of a cliffhanger, which seems unnecessary. Overall, I felt the book was flimsy, and that much more could have been explored in a much more sophisticated manner, with a more intelligent narrative structure. I suppose that if you are after a fairly superficial read about one of America's pioneering surgeons, then this would do the trick. If, however, you are genuinely interested in medical and museum history, I would not reach for this book. "
37,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela,3,"If you're looking for something creepy, freaky, bizarre or macabre, this isn't it. What it is, is a studious look into the history of medicine in relation to Dr. Thomas Dent Mutter and his fellow associates.Aptowicz, fascinated by a field-trip to the Mutter Museum, spent the next ten years digging and mining for any and all information into Dr. Mutter's life and his accomplishments. Of which, there isn't a whole lot of information to be had. Mutter didn't keep a personal or professional journal. Due to the lack of detailed data, Aptowicz filled these voids with other related (and not so related) tidbits surrounding medical practices of the era, culture nuances, gender/race qualms, bios of Mutter's associates, and educational mindsets. Overall, the book is interesting though a bit dry and lackluster. I found myself skimming here and there, losing interest. The cover being much more compelling than the actually book. However, I applaud Aptowicz's dedication to research and time passionately invested. From poet to scholarly author. A solid effort and worthy leap into the world of non-fiction writing.Three Stars "
38,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855683-josephine,4,"A little too purple and adjective-laden to rate a five, and the book as a whole struck me as being almost more about the state of medicine in Philadelphia in the early nineteenth century than as about Mutter himself. (The umlaut was an affectation.)Otherwise it's an interesting book. There's more conjecture and interpolation than I'd like in a biography, but honestly: Mutter would have disappeared from the attention of all but avid historians of medicine, were it not for the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia. (No, I've never gone, but I wouldn't mind.) In any case, most people's lives go so poorly documented that few of us would rate more than a couple of lines in Who's Who. When and where were we born? Did we serve in the military? Graduate college? ...and that's about it, a century later. Mutter did at least leave a record of publications, and a teaching career."

The author does an amazing job in sharing Dr. Mutter's life by explaining how life was in the 1800's Philadelphia (and particularly the medical practices/beliefs) and exploring the people who he interacted with while he was alive and the legacy of his students' lives after his death. It was shocking to know that dedicated healers unintentionally caused so much harm to patients and how difficult it was to advance medicine. A fascinating read!"

The tragedy in his youth that left him without his parents through til the end of his life and all his accomplishments in between. Dr. Mutter did so much to change medicine with sterilization of instruments to helping the severely deformed patients including burn victims. Thomas Mutter was sickly most of his life and died way too early at the age of forty eight. His museum is still open to this day in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I highly recommend this book. It is written so very well that I just flew through the pages. "
41,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23644033-jerry-book,4,"Before the US Civil War medicine in the USA was very primitive. Dr. Mutter enters the picture wanting to be the best surgeon he can be. He studies in France and brings back the latest surgical techniques. He is an early advocate of anesthesia and a sterile operating room. I found it quite amazing how other physicians fought these practical reforms. It was horrifying to learn that most surgeons at the time operated without anesthesia. Even more horrifying, other physicians resisted his advocacy for a sterile operating room. Nonetheless, his skill and brilliance was recognized. He was appointed chair of the department of surgery at Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Tragically, he dies at the early age of 44 due to tuberculosis. Dr. Mutter left the world a much better place. He was a true hero of medicine. Dr. Mutter left us his Museum of Medical Marvels in Philadelphia which is composed of the medical oddities Dr. Mutter encountered in his career. One critic has commented much of Dr. Mutter's career has been imagined by the author. This is because Dr. Mutter left very little writings. Nonetheless, his achievements are real as I have mentioned. Also, it is a Great Read!"
42,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1473665-christine,5,"Thomas Dent Mutter was born to a fairly affluent family but illness and death left him an orphan with limited means. An uncle agreed to become his guardian and although not emotionally supportive he did ensure that young Thomas received a good education. Thomas’ creativity showed early when he learned to indulge his love of quality (and somewhat flamboyant) clothing.As Ms. Aptowicz writes:	“Over the years, he grew practiced in the art of finessing opportunities so that he could live something approximate to the life he desired. At boarding school, he was known to charge his clothing bills to the institution and then earn scholarships to pay off the resulting debts. When he wanted to travel, he secured just enough money to get him to his destination and then relied on his wits to get him back home.”This creativity served him well after he graduated from medical school and wanted to go to Paris, the epicentre of medical achievement at the time. Mutter was always fascinated by and drawn to surgery. He “loved the daringness of the surgeries attempted during this time”. Aside from the procedures themselves he enjoyed the fact that surgeons did not depend on class and family to acquire patients and, thereby, success … “surgeons earned their place through hard work, study and skill”. He knew surgery was his calling and in Paris Dr. Mutter was inspired by some of the best. He returned to American with not only the knowledge of the new “les operations plastiques” but a wax sculpture of a woman with a horn growing out of her forehead (which was subsequently surgically removed). Thus began his collection of “marvels” and also his lifelong determination to help the “monsters”, those people whose deformities made their lives unbearable. His abilities were awe-inspiring, especially in the early 19th century when aesthetic was not available. Doctors were often favoured as much because of their speed with the scalpel as for their medical prowess.Mutters hands were his most valuable asset, 	“Swift and nimble, quick and precise, they were one of the reasons he was able to do the work he did. It was rare blessing enough to be ambidextrous. But to be skilled as Mutter was with both his hand was seen as near miraculous (Few can boast of [being ambidextrous] … and often, many who can have in fact only two left hands” a fellow doctor once quipped).Being presented the position of Chair of Surgery at Philadelphia newest and soon most prestigious Jefferson College of Medicine Dr. Mutter was instrumental in so many medical innovations and influencing more than a few students who went on to become the leaders of the future medical community.This book was an astounding recounting of this man’s remarkable life and achievements. It is written in a conversational style and smoothly incorporates the politics, the medical practices and social beliefs of the time. Ms. Aptowicz does a remarkable job. I have no practical knowledge of medicine or surgical practices, and very little about Philadelphia during the late 1800’s yet I found this book easy to read and understand. There is no other way to describe it other than utterly fascinating. I believe it would appeal equally to fans of non-fiction historical accounts and those who may not read a lot of non-fiction but enjoy a fascinating story. I find myself wondering why Dr. Mutter’s story is not more well-known? Definitely five stars.On a personal note: There are some spine tingling surgical descriptions in this book, which makes me so grateful to Dr. Mutter, his contemporaries and students who persevered so I now live in a time when we have anaesthesia, antiseptics, painkillers and doctors who wash their hands.The museum does have website to visit at www.Muttermuseum.org"
43,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239462-kevin,1,"I love the Mütter Museum in Philly, I love medical oddities, I like reading about medical advances (and the accompanying horror of ""Oh god I can't believe that the doctors used to think [x] instead of [y] - I'm so glad I didn't live back then"") and so on and so on.But man, this book sure did bore me to death. Dr. Mütter was clearly a good man as well as brilliant, but I think that maybe when the author realized ""Mütter was rather an elusive character to research"" she should have called off the project. I'm fine with biographies and I'm fine with historical fiction but this sat somewhere in-between without sufficient pull in either direction.The title directly promises 'intrigue' but I missed it somewhere. The title also makes it sound like this would be more about the museum (Dr. Mütter's Marvels) and that was not the case in the slightest.Towards the end I stuck a bookmark in at page 281 (chapter 26) so that I could remind myself, ""This is where it gets interesting - where the museum itself is actually established - so if you loan this out to your friends you can tell them that if they get as bored as you did to just skip ahead to here."" Then the book came to an end at page 305. I hadn't realized the last ~60 pages of the book would be acknowledgements and source notes and all that.Here's the thing: I never buy books when they first come out. I never buy new releases in hardcover. But ... the Mütter Museum! and its history! How could I not have bought this? I think the majority of my disappointment here is that this book is not at all what I thought it was, nor how I saw it billed in the few bits of information available to me before it was released. I wish I had waited a while, read some reader reviews, and realized that it would never fulfill my desires, and saved my money."

I thoroughly enjoyed her new book, Dr. M�tter's Marvels: A True Tale of Intrigue and Innovation at the Dawn of Modern Medicine, an excellent example of narrative non-fiction. lthough well-known in his time, I had never heard of Dr M�tter before reading this book. Aptowicz's story, however, made him jump off the pages. She followed the familiar pattern of short chapters with punchy endings that make you want to jump to the next chapter as quickly as possible. While many others have tried this formula and can make it seem tiring, Aptowicz really nailed it. The cliffhangers never seemed contrived and really did move the story along. I'm not sure I would characterize this story as one of ""intrigue,"" but ""innovation"" definitely! And though mentioned briefly at the beginning, the ""Marvels"" of the title aren't really discussed until the end, but I enjoyed Aptowicz's narrative in her acknowledgements as she described how she learned about M�tter and his marvels.

Thomas Dent Mutter's contributions to medicine proved lasting and significant. And though he didn't live long enough to accomplish all he'd hoped, his compassion and his passion for the work of healing those in need sent out ripples that affected later generations of doctors and their patients. If you know someone who's had reconstructive surgery, you have Mutter to thank. Needed anesthesia for an operation? Mutter was one of the early champions--and one of his students went on to design a method of purifying ether and a mask to provide safer delivery for patients. Moms, if your obstetrician and nurses washed their hands and tools so you didn't get puerperal fever, again, Mutter was on the forefront of establishing germ theory and preventing contamination. And the list goes on. A potent reminder that sometime success lies farther down the road than we can see in our brief human lives. "

64,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,1,"I received Dr. Mutter’s Marvels free as a Good Reads First Read Book. The blurb promised the book to be fascinating and riveting, giving a good glimpse into American medicine in the 19th Century and how Doctor Thomas Mutter impacted it.First, the book starts off with a medical oddity that Mutter encounters while aboard ship to France. It’s a good hook to get you interested but medical oddities were far more common at that time then they are today. You get a bit of Mutter’s biography, which is what I thought the book would be about, but the author skips parts or starts with one thing and then goes off on something completely different. And other individuals get introduced but their introduction seems out of place.Many chapters could have been combined. A better history of medicine and the medical profession in America would have helped, which could have easily been a chapter unto itself. Plus, a general history of Philadelphia and a quick history of medicine in England and France would also have been beneficial. The text didn’t seem to flow chronologically but rather meandered wherever the author wanted it to. Dr. Mutter may have had a big impact on 19th Century American medicine but you don’t get that impression from the book.I felt rather cheated. I was promised a biography of a game changer and what I got was just another biography. You could almost have made it a history of the Faculty of ’41 (Jefferson School of Medicine, 1841) which would have been much more interesting and would have made much more sense. Things would have been more tied together, events would have flowed more smoothly, and a lot more material could have been added.Overall, it wasn’t a bad book. It just needed more work to make it better."
65,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1352540-bert,5,"This compelling story leaves readers wondering why Mutter is not a household name. Beyond his surgical innovation, he was a pioneer when it came to developing physician-patient relationships. Cristin O’Keefe Aptowicz doesn’t use the term, but she paints Mutter as a doctor who was among the first to understand the role of a good bedside manner. Mutter’s curiosity led to the advancement of the science to which he dedicated his life, but his compassion for humanity fueled those innovations. He deflected rivalry and skepticism – and even personal suffering – and dedicated himself to alleviating the suffering of others. Mutter’s teaching methods were equally influential. In fact it’s hard to accurately map how far his influence extends given the achievements of the countless students who benefited from his amiable lessons. It’s curious how names like Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Hawking and others form a group that seems to carry greater name recognition than those pioneers in the life sciences. I don't know why this is the case, but surely Mutter’s name belongs in that latter group as surely as Aptowicz’s latest work belongs on your reading list."
66,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6389813-maddie-barton,1,"What a deeply frustrating book. Aptowicz is an engaging writer, however I am not sure she is an engaging historical writer, and feel her talent may be more suited to fiction. I struggled with this book considerably, and feel it relies too much upon conjecture - especially upon emotional conjecture. I have no doubt that there was a great deal of primary source material available for Aptowicz to draw from, however there is little presented for the reader. At times Dr Mutter simply disappears for chapters, and the constant referral to his supposed rivalry with Dr Meigs, seems, well, supposed more than substantiated. The contextualising of Dr Mutter's time is all over the place, and every chapter ends of a cliffhanger, which seems unnecessary. Overall, I felt the book was flimsy, and that much more could have been explored in a much more sophisticated manner, with a more intelligent narrative structure. I suppose that if you are after a fairly superficial read about one of America's pioneering surgeons, then this would do the trick. If, however, you are genuinely interested in medical and museum history, I would not reach for this book. "
67,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela,3,"If you're looking for something creepy, freaky, bizarre or macabre, this isn't it. What it is, is a studious look into the history of medicine in relation to Dr. Thomas Dent Mutter and his fellow associates.Aptowicz, fascinated by a field-trip to the Mutter Museum, spent the next ten years digging and mining for any and all information into Dr. Mutter's life and his accomplishments. Of which, there isn't a whole lot of information to be had. Mutter didn't keep a personal or professional journal. Due to the lack of detailed data, Aptowicz filled these voids with other related (and not so related) tidbits surrounding medical practices of the era, culture nuances, gender/race qualms, bios of Mutter's associates, and educational mindsets. Overall, the book is interesting though a bit dry and lackluster. I found myself skimming here and there, losing interest. The cover being much more compelling than the actually book. However, I applaud Aptowicz's dedication to research and time passionately invested. From poet to scholarly author. A solid effort and worthy leap into the world of non-fiction writing.Three Stars "
68,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855683-josephine,4,"A little too purple and adjective-laden to rate a five, and the book as a whole struck me as being almost more about the state of medicine in Philadelphia in the early nineteenth century than as about Mutter himself. (The umlaut was an affectation.)Otherwise it's an interesting book. There's more conjecture and interpolation than I'd like in a biography, but honestly: Mutter would have disappeared from the attention of all but avid historians of medicine, were it not for the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia. (No, I've never gone, but I wouldn't mind.) In any case, most people's lives go so poorly documented that few of us would rate more than a couple of lines in Who's Who. When and where were we born? Did we serve in the military? Graduate college? ...and that's about it, a century later. Mutter did at least leave a record of publications, and a teaching career."
69,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5928435-jessie,5,"If you need a reminder to appreciate your health care access, this is the book for you! The author does an amazing job in sharing Dr. Mutter's life by explaining how life was in the 1800's Philadelphia (and particularly the medical practices/beliefs) and exploring the people who he interacted with while he was alive and the legacy of his students' lives after his death. It was shocking to know that dedicated healers unintentionally caused so much harm to patients and how difficult it was to advance medicine. A fascinating read!"
70,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58122957-mortisha-cassavetes,5,"Wow! I really enjoyed this book. The book follows the life of Dr. Thomas Mutter. The tragedy in his youth that left him without his parents through til the end of his life and all his accomplishments in between. Dr. Mutter did so much to change medicine with sterilization of instruments to helping the severely deformed patients including burn victims. Thomas Mutter was sickly most of his life and died way too early at the age of forty eight. His museum is still open to this day in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I highly recommend this book. It is written so very well that I just flew through the pages. "
71,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23644033-jerry-book,4,"Before the US Civil War medicine in the USA was very primitive. Dr. Mutter enters the picture wanting to be the best surgeon he can be. He studies in France and brings back the latest surgical techniques. He is an early advocate of anesthesia and a sterile operating room. I found it quite amazing how other physicians fought these practical reforms. It was horrifying to learn that most surgeons at the time operated without anesthesia. Even more horrifying, other physicians resisted his advocacy for a sterile operating room. Nonetheless, his skill and brilliance was recognized. He was appointed chair of the department of surgery at Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Tragically, he dies at the early age of 44 due to tuberculosis. Dr. Mutter left the world a much better place. He was a true hero of medicine. Dr. Mutter left us his Museum of Medical Marvels in Philadelphia which is composed of the medical oddities Dr. Mutter encountered in his career. One critic has commented much of Dr. Mutter's career has been imagined by the author. This is because Dr. Mutter left very little writings. Nonetheless, his achievements are real as I have mentioned. Also, it is a Great Read!"
72,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1473665-christine,5,"Thomas Dent Mutter was born to a fairly affluent family but illness and death left him an orphan with limited means. An uncle agreed to become his guardian and although not emotionally supportive he did ensure that young Thomas received a good education. Thomas’ creativity showed early when he learned to indulge his love of quality (and somewhat flamboyant) clothing.As Ms. Aptowicz writes:	“Over the years, he grew practiced in the art of finessing opportunities so that he could live something approximate to the life he desired. At boarding school, he was known to charge his clothing bills to the institution and then earn scholarships to pay off the resulting debts. When he wanted to travel, he secured just enough money to get him to his destination and then relied on his wits to get him back home.”This creativity served him well after he graduated from medical school and wanted to go to Paris, the epicentre of medical achievement at the time. Mutter was always fascinated by and drawn to surgery. He “loved the daringness of the surgeries attempted during this time”. Aside from the procedures themselves he enjoyed the fact that surgeons did not depend on class and family to acquire patients and, thereby, success … “surgeons earned their place through hard work, study and skill”. He knew surgery was his calling and in Paris Dr. Mutter was inspired by some of the best. He returned to American with not only the knowledge of the new “les operations plastiques” but a wax sculpture of a woman with a horn growing out of her forehead (which was subsequently surgically removed). Thus began his collection of “marvels” and also his lifelong determination to help the “monsters”, those people whose deformities made their lives unbearable. His abilities were awe-inspiring, especially in the early 19th century when aesthetic was not available. Doctors were often favoured as much because of their speed with the scalpel as for their medical prowess.Mutters hands were his most valuable asset, 	“Swift and nimble, quick and precise, they were one of the reasons he was able to do the work he did. It was rare blessing enough to be ambidextrous. But to be skilled as Mutter was with both his hand was seen as near miraculous (Few can boast of [being ambidextrous] … and often, many who can have in fact only two left hands” a fellow doctor once quipped).Being presented the position of Chair of Surgery at Philadelphia newest and soon most prestigious Jefferson College of Medicine Dr. Mutter was instrumental in so many medical innovations and influencing more than a few students who went on to become the leaders of the future medical community.This book was an astounding recounting of this man’s remarkable life and achievements. It is written in a conversational style and smoothly incorporates the politics, the medical practices and social beliefs of the time. Ms. Aptowicz does a remarkable job. I have no practical knowledge of medicine or surgical practices, and very little about Philadelphia during the late 1800’s yet I found this book easy to read and understand. There is no other way to describe it other than utterly fascinating. I believe it would appeal equally to fans of non-fiction historical accounts and those who may not read a lot of non-fiction but enjoy a fascinating story. I find myself wondering why Dr. Mutter’s story is not more well-known? Definitely five stars.On a personal note: There are some spine tingling surgical descriptions in this book, which makes me so grateful to Dr. Mutter, his contemporaries and students who persevered so I now live in a time when we have anaesthesia, antiseptics, painkillers and doctors who wash their hands.The museum does have website to visit at www.Muttermuseum.org"
73,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239462-kevin,1,"I love the Mütter Museum in Philly, I love medical oddities, I like reading about medical advances (and the accompanying horror of ""Oh god I can't believe that the doctors used to think [x] instead of [y] - I'm so glad I didn't live back then"") and so on and so on.But man, this book sure did bore me to death. Dr. Mütter was clearly a good man as well as brilliant, but I think that maybe when the author realized ""Mütter was rather an elusive character to research"" she should have called off the project. I'm fine with biographies and I'm fine with historical fiction but this sat somewhere in-between without sufficient pull in either direction.The title directly promises 'intrigue' but I missed it somewhere. The title also makes it sound like this would be more about the museum (Dr. Mütter's Marvels) and that was not the case in the slightest.Towards the end I stuck a bookmark in at page 281 (chapter 26) so that I could remind myself, ""This is where it gets interesting - where the museum itself is actually established - so if you loan this out to your friends you can tell them that if they get as bored as you did to just skip ahead to here."" Then the book came to an end at page 305. I hadn't realized the last ~60 pages of the book would be acknowledgements and source notes and all that.Here's the thing: I never buy books when they first come out. I never buy new releases in hardcover. But ... the Mütter Museum! and its history! How could I not have bought this? I think the majority of my disappointment here is that this book is not at all what I thought it was, nor how I saw it billed in the few bits of information available to me before it was released. I wish I had waited a while, read some reader reviews, and realized that it would never fulfill my desires, and saved my money."
74,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17255022-stephanie-pounds,5,"Watch out Erik Larson, you've got some serious competition in Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz. I thoroughly enjoyed her new book, Dr. M�tter's Marvels: A True Tale of Intrigue and Innovation at the Dawn of Modern Medicine, an excellent example of narrative non-fiction. lthough well-known in his time, I had never heard of Dr M�tter before reading this book. Aptowicz's story, however, made him jump off the pages. She followed the familiar pattern of short chapters with punchy endings that make you want to jump to the next chapter as quickly as possible. While many others have tried this formula and can make it seem tiring, Aptowicz really nailed it. The cliffhangers never seemed contrived and really did move the story along. I'm not sure I would characterize this story as one of ""intrigue,"" but ""innovation"" definitely! And though mentioned briefly at the beginning, the ""Marvels"" of the title aren't really discussed until the end, but I enjoyed Aptowicz's narrative in her acknowledgements as she described how she learned about M�tter and his marvels. Now I think I'd like to see them, too--and that's how you know you've found a really good author. I'm looking forward to more, Ms Aptowicz!"
75,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924321-jennifer,5,"I was intrigued by the cover copy of this book; I wasn't prepared for how inspiring and moving I would find it. Thomas Dent Mutter's contributions to medicine proved lasting and significant. And though he didn't live long enough to accomplish all he'd hoped, his compassion and his passion for the work of healing those in need sent out ripples that affected later generations of doctors and their patients. If you know someone who's had reconstructive surgery, you have Mutter to thank. Needed anesthesia for an operation? Mutter was one of the early champions--and one of his students went on to design a method of purifying ether and a mask to provide safer delivery for patients. Moms, if your obstetrician and nurses washed their hands and tools so you didn't get puerperal fever, again, Mutter was on the forefront of establishing germ theory and preventing contamination. And the list goes on. A potent reminder that sometime success lies farther down the road than we can see in our brief human lives. "
76,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/752423-alisa,5,"A lovingly rendered biography if an ambitious yet deeply humane surgeon, and more importantly, teacher. Mütter taught thousands af medical students in his tenure at Jefferson Medical College, battling for changes we still consider vital in today's medical profession and education - clinical experience, bedside manner, thorough anatomical knowledge, and continuous learning. Enjoyed this book completely and recommend it as a way to study medicine, mid-19th century history, and even the rise of urbanism in the antebellum period. *Rounded up from 4.5 stars. "

I rarely read acknowledgements and notes, but I did here (and it was worth it!), because I didn't want the book to end. This is an elegant and emotional story of a colorful and brilliant man. The author intersperses history and commentary on the age throughout, and it felt very real as I read. I also loved the pictures and illustrations; they were both interesting and added to the story. Loved it!"

Can't wait to visit the Mütter Museum next week as my fortieth birthday present, and so glad that I'll be doing so with the perspective gained through reading this lovely work."
79,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32690537-sam,5,"I am always amazed that so much of medicine is truly modern: the use of anesthesia, the discovery and acceptance of viruses as a means of transmitting illness and the acceptance of cleanliness as important to the treatment of the patient, all happened within the last 150 years or so. It is equally amazing that some of these advancements were met with so much resistance and occurred due to the persistence of a very few physicians, Dr. Mutter being one of them. A very enjoyable read. "

103,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239462-kevin,1,"I love the Mütter Museum in Philly, I love medical oddities, I like reading about medical advances (and the accompanying horror of ""Oh god I can't believe that the doctors used to think [x] instead of [y] - I'm so glad I didn't live back then"") and so on and so on.But man, this book sure did bore me to death. Dr. Mütter was clearly a good man as well as brilliant, but I think that maybe when the author realized ""Mütter was rather an elusive character to research"" she should have called off the project. I'm fine with biographies and I'm fine with historical fiction but this sat somewhere in-between without sufficient pull in either direction.The title directly promises 'intrigue' but I missed it somewhere. The title also makes it sound like this would be more about the museum (Dr. Mütter's Marvels) and that was not the case in the slightest.Towards the end I stuck a bookmark in at page 281 (chapter 26) so that I could remind myself, ""This is where it gets interesting - where the museum itself is actually established - so if you loan this out to your friends you can tell them that if they get as bored as you did to just skip ahead to here."" Then the book came to an end at page 305. I hadn't realized the last ~60 pages of the book would be acknowledgements and source notes and all that.Here's the thing: I never buy books when they first come out. I never buy new releases in hardcover. But ... the Mütter Museum! and its history! How could I not have bought this? I think the majority of my disappointment here is that this book is not at all what I thought it was, nor how I saw it billed in the few bits of information available to me before it was released. I wish I had waited a while, read some reader reviews, and realized that it would never fulfill my desires, and saved my money."
104,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17255022-stephanie-pounds,5,"Watch out Erik Larson, you've got some serious competition in Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz. I thoroughly enjoyed her new book, Dr. M�tter's Marvels: A True Tale of Intrigue and Innovation at the Dawn of Modern Medicine, an excellent example of narrative non-fiction. lthough well-known in his time, I had never heard of Dr M�tter before reading this book. Aptowicz's story, however, made him jump off the pages. She followed the familiar pattern of short chapters with punchy endings that make you want to jump to the next chapter as quickly as possible. While many others have tried this formula and can make it seem tiring, Aptowicz really nailed it. The cliffhangers never seemed contrived and really did move the story along. I'm not sure I would characterize this story as one of ""intrigue,"" but ""innovation"" definitely! And though mentioned briefly at the beginning, the ""Marvels"" of the title aren't really discussed until the end, but I enjoyed Aptowicz's narrative in her acknowledgements as she described how she learned about M�tter and his marvels. Now I think I'd like to see them, too--and that's how you know you've found a really good author. I'm looking forward to more, Ms Aptowicz!"
105,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924321-jennifer,5,"I was intrigued by the cover copy of this book; I wasn't prepared for how inspiring and moving I would find it. Thomas Dent Mutter's contributions to medicine proved lasting and significant. And though he didn't live long enough to accomplish all he'd hoped, his compassion and his passion for the work of healing those in need sent out ripples that affected later generations of doctors and their patients. If you know someone who's had reconstructive surgery, you have Mutter to thank. Needed anesthesia for an operation? Mutter was one of the early champions--and one of his students went on to design a method of purifying ether and a mask to provide safer delivery for patients. Moms, if your obstetrician and nurses washed their hands and tools so you didn't get puerperal fever, again, Mutter was on the forefront of establishing germ theory and preventing contamination. And the list goes on. A potent reminder that sometime success lies farther down the road than we can see in our brief human lives. "

Mütter taught thousands af medical students in his tenure at Jefferson Medical College, battling for changes we still consider vital in today's medical profession and education - clinical experience, bedside manner, thorough anatomical knowledge, and continuous learning. Enjoyed this book completely and recommend it as a way to study medicine, mid-19th century history, and even the rise of urbanism in the antebellum period. *Rounded up from 4.5 stars. "

I rarely read acknowledgements and notes, but I did here (and it was worth it!), because I didn't want the book to end. This is an elegant and emotional story of a colorful and brilliant man. The author intersperses history and commentary on the age throughout, and it felt very real as I read. I also loved the pictures and illustrations; they were both interesting and added to the story. Loved it!"

It is equally amazing that some of these advancements were met with so much resistance and occurred due to the persistence of a very few physicians, Dr. Mutter being one of them. A very enjoyable read. "

124,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,1,"I received Dr. Mutter’s Marvels free as a Good Reads First Read Book. The blurb promised the book to be fascinating and riveting, giving a good glimpse into American medicine in the 19th Century and how Doctor Thomas Mutter impacted it.First, the book starts off with a medical oddity that Mutter encounters while aboard ship to France. It’s a good hook to get you interested but medical oddities were far more common at that time then they are today. You get a bit of Mutter’s biography, which is what I thought the book would be about, but the author skips parts or starts with one thing and then goes off on something completely different. And other individuals get introduced but their introduction seems out of place.Many chapters could have been combined. A better history of medicine and the medical profession in America would have helped, which could have easily been a chapter unto itself. Plus, a general history of Philadelphia and a quick history of medicine in England and France would also have been beneficial. The text didn’t seem to flow chronologically but rather meandered wherever the author wanted it to. Dr. Mutter may have had a big impact on 19th Century American medicine but you don’t get that impression from the book.I felt rather cheated. I was promised a biography of a game changer and what I got was just another biography. You could almost have made it a history of the Faculty of ’41 (Jefferson School of Medicine, 1841) which would have been much more interesting and would have made much more sense. Things would have been more tied together, events would have flowed more smoothly, and a lot more material could have been added.Overall, it wasn’t a bad book. It just needed more work to make it better."
125,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1352540-bert,5,"This compelling story leaves readers wondering why Mutter is not a household name. Beyond his surgical innovation, he was a pioneer when it came to developing physician-patient relationships. Cristin O’Keefe Aptowicz doesn’t use the term, but she paints Mutter as a doctor who was among the first to understand the role of a good bedside manner. Mutter’s curiosity led to the advancement of the science to which he dedicated his life, but his compassion for humanity fueled those innovations. He deflected rivalry and skepticism – and even personal suffering – and dedicated himself to alleviating the suffering of others. Mutter’s teaching methods were equally influential. In fact it’s hard to accurately map how far his influence extends given the achievements of the countless students who benefited from his amiable lessons. It’s curious how names like Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Hawking and others form a group that seems to carry greater name recognition than those pioneers in the life sciences. I don't know why this is the case, but surely Mutter’s name belongs in that latter group as surely as Aptowicz’s latest work belongs on your reading list."

154,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,1,"I received Dr. Mutter’s Marvels free as a Good Reads First Read Book. The blurb promised the book to be fascinating and riveting, giving a good glimpse into American medicine in the 19th Century and how Doctor Thomas Mutter impacted it.First, the book starts off with a medical oddity that Mutter encounters while aboard ship to France. It’s a good hook to get you interested but medical oddities were far more common at that time then they are today. You get a bit of Mutter’s biography, which is what I thought the book would be about, but the author skips parts or starts with one thing and then goes off on something completely different. And other individuals get introduced but their introduction seems out of place.Many chapters could have been combined. A better history of medicine and the medical profession in America would have helped, which could have easily been a chapter unto itself. Plus, a general history of Philadelphia and a quick history of medicine in England and France would also have been beneficial. The text didn’t seem to flow chronologically but rather meandered wherever the author wanted it to. Dr. Mutter may have had a big impact on 19th Century American medicine but you don’t get that impression from the book.I felt rather cheated. I was promised a biography of a game changer and what I got was just another biography. You could almost have made it a history of the Faculty of ’41 (Jefferson School of Medicine, 1841) which would have been much more interesting and would have made much more sense. Things would have been more tied together, events would have flowed more smoothly, and a lot more material could have been added.Overall, it wasn’t a bad book. It just needed more work to make it better."
155,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1352540-bert,5,"This compelling story leaves readers wondering why Mutter is not a household name. Beyond his surgical innovation, he was a pioneer when it came to developing physician-patient relationships. Cristin O’Keefe Aptowicz doesn’t use the term, but she paints Mutter as a doctor who was among the first to understand the role of a good bedside manner. Mutter’s curiosity led to the advancement of the science to which he dedicated his life, but his compassion for humanity fueled those innovations. He deflected rivalry and skepticism – and even personal suffering – and dedicated himself to alleviating the suffering of others. Mutter’s teaching methods were equally influential. In fact it’s hard to accurately map how far his influence extends given the achievements of the countless students who benefited from his amiable lessons. It’s curious how names like Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Hawking and others form a group that seems to carry greater name recognition than those pioneers in the life sciences. I don't know why this is the case, but surely Mutter’s name belongs in that latter group as surely as Aptowicz’s latest work belongs on your reading list."
156,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6389813-maddie-barton,1,"What a deeply frustrating book. Aptowicz is an engaging writer, however I am not sure she is an engaging historical writer, and feel her talent may be more suited to fiction. I struggled with this book considerably, and feel it relies too much upon conjecture - especially upon emotional conjecture. I have no doubt that there was a great deal of primary source material available for Aptowicz to draw from, however there is little presented for the reader. At times Dr Mutter simply disappears for chapters, and the constant referral to his supposed rivalry with Dr Meigs, seems, well, supposed more than substantiated. The contextualising of Dr Mutter's time is all over the place, and every chapter ends of a cliffhanger, which seems unnecessary. Overall, I felt the book was flimsy, and that much more could have been explored in a much more sophisticated manner, with a more intelligent narrative structure. I suppose that if you are after a fairly superficial read about one of America's pioneering surgeons, then this would do the trick. If, however, you are genuinely interested in medical and museum history, I would not reach for this book. "
157,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela,3,"If you're looking for something creepy, freaky, bizarre or macabre, this isn't it. What it is, is a studious look into the history of medicine in relation to Dr. Thomas Dent Mutter and his fellow associates.Aptowicz, fascinated by a field-trip to the Mutter Museum, spent the next ten years digging and mining for any and all information into Dr. Mutter's life and his accomplishments. Of which, there isn't a whole lot of information to be had. Mutter didn't keep a personal or professional journal. Due to the lack of detailed data, Aptowicz filled these voids with other related (and not so related) tidbits surrounding medical practices of the era, culture nuances, gender/race qualms, bios of Mutter's associates, and educational mindsets. Overall, the book is interesting though a bit dry and lackluster. I found myself skimming here and there, losing interest. The cover being much more compelling than the actually book. However, I applaud Aptowicz's dedication to research and time passionately invested. From poet to scholarly author. A solid effort and worthy leap into the world of non-fiction writing.Three Stars "
158,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855683-josephine,4,"A little too purple and adjective-laden to rate a five, and the book as a whole struck me as being almost more about the state of medicine in Philadelphia in the early nineteenth century than as about Mutter himself. (The umlaut was an affectation.)Otherwise it's an interesting book. There's more conjecture and interpolation than I'd like in a biography, but honestly: Mutter would have disappeared from the attention of all but avid historians of medicine, were it not for the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia. (No, I've never gone, but I wouldn't mind.) In any case, most people's lives go so poorly documented that few of us would rate more than a couple of lines in Who's Who. When and where were we born? Did we serve in the military? Graduate college? ...and that's about it, a century later. Mutter did at least leave a record of publications, and a teaching career."

The author does an amazing job in sharing Dr. Mutter's life by explaining how life was in the 1800's Philadelphia (and particularly the medical practices/beliefs) and exploring the people who he interacted with while he was alive and the legacy of his students' lives after his death. It was shocking to know that dedicated healers unintentionally caused so much harm to patients and how difficult it was to advance medicine. A fascinating read!"

The tragedy in his youth that left him without his parents through til the end of his life and all his accomplishments in between. Dr. Mutter did so much to change medicine with sterilization of instruments to helping the severely deformed patients including burn victims. Thomas Mutter was sickly most of his life and died way too early at the age of forty eight. His museum is still open to this day in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I highly recommend this book. It is written so very well that I just flew through the pages. "
161,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23644033-jerry-book,4,"Before the US Civil War medicine in the USA was very primitive. Dr. Mutter enters the picture wanting to be the best surgeon he can be. He studies in France and brings back the latest surgical techniques. He is an early advocate of anesthesia and a sterile operating room. I found it quite amazing how other physicians fought these practical reforms. It was horrifying to learn that most surgeons at the time operated without anesthesia. Even more horrifying, other physicians resisted his advocacy for a sterile operating room. Nonetheless, his skill and brilliance was recognized. He was appointed chair of the department of surgery at Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Tragically, he dies at the early age of 44 due to tuberculosis. Dr. Mutter left the world a much better place. He was a true hero of medicine. Dr. Mutter left us his Museum of Medical Marvels in Philadelphia which is composed of the medical oddities Dr. Mutter encountered in his career. One critic has commented much of Dr. Mutter's career has been imagined by the author. This is because Dr. Mutter left very little writings. Nonetheless, his achievements are real as I have mentioned. Also, it is a Great Read!"
162,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1473665-christine,5,"Thomas Dent Mutter was born to a fairly affluent family but illness and death left him an orphan with limited means. An uncle agreed to become his guardian and although not emotionally supportive he did ensure that young Thomas received a good education. Thomas’ creativity showed early when he learned to indulge his love of quality (and somewhat flamboyant) clothing.As Ms. Aptowicz writes:	“Over the years, he grew practiced in the art of finessing opportunities so that he could live something approximate to the life he desired. At boarding school, he was known to charge his clothing bills to the institution and then earn scholarships to pay off the resulting debts. When he wanted to travel, he secured just enough money to get him to his destination and then relied on his wits to get him back home.”This creativity served him well after he graduated from medical school and wanted to go to Paris, the epicentre of medical achievement at the time. Mutter was always fascinated by and drawn to surgery. He “loved the daringness of the surgeries attempted during this time”. Aside from the procedures themselves he enjoyed the fact that surgeons did not depend on class and family to acquire patients and, thereby, success … “surgeons earned their place through hard work, study and skill”. He knew surgery was his calling and in Paris Dr. Mutter was inspired by some of the best. He returned to American with not only the knowledge of the new “les operations plastiques” but a wax sculpture of a woman with a horn growing out of her forehead (which was subsequently surgically removed). Thus began his collection of “marvels” and also his lifelong determination to help the “monsters”, those people whose deformities made their lives unbearable. His abilities were awe-inspiring, especially in the early 19th century when aesthetic was not available. Doctors were often favoured as much because of their speed with the scalpel as for their medical prowess.Mutters hands were his most valuable asset, 	“Swift and nimble, quick and precise, they were one of the reasons he was able to do the work he did. It was rare blessing enough to be ambidextrous. But to be skilled as Mutter was with both his hand was seen as near miraculous (Few can boast of [being ambidextrous] … and often, many who can have in fact only two left hands” a fellow doctor once quipped).Being presented the position of Chair of Surgery at Philadelphia newest and soon most prestigious Jefferson College of Medicine Dr. Mutter was instrumental in so many medical innovations and influencing more than a few students who went on to become the leaders of the future medical community.This book was an astounding recounting of this man’s remarkable life and achievements. It is written in a conversational style and smoothly incorporates the politics, the medical practices and social beliefs of the time. Ms. Aptowicz does a remarkable job. I have no practical knowledge of medicine or surgical practices, and very little about Philadelphia during the late 1800’s yet I found this book easy to read and understand. There is no other way to describe it other than utterly fascinating. I believe it would appeal equally to fans of non-fiction historical accounts and those who may not read a lot of non-fiction but enjoy a fascinating story. I find myself wondering why Dr. Mutter’s story is not more well-known?

184,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,1,"I received Dr. Mutter’s Marvels free as a Good Reads First Read Book. The blurb promised the book to be fascinating and riveting, giving a good glimpse into American medicine in the 19th Century and how Doctor Thomas Mutter impacted it.First, the book starts off with a medical oddity that Mutter encounters while aboard ship to France. It’s a good hook to get you interested but medical oddities were far more common at that time then they are today. You get a bit of Mutter’s biography, which is what I thought the book would be about, but the author skips parts or starts with one thing and then goes off on something completely different. And other individuals get introduced but their introduction seems out of place.Many chapters could have been combined. A better history of medicine and the medical profession in America would have helped, which could have easily been a chapter unto itself. Plus, a general history of Philadelphia and a quick history of medicine in England and France would also have been beneficial. The text didn’t seem to flow chronologically but rather meandered wherever the author wanted it to. Dr. Mutter may have had a big impact on 19th Century American medicine but you don’t get that impression from the book.I felt rather cheated. I was promised a biography of a game changer and what I got was just another biography. You could almost have made it a history of the Faculty of ’41 (Jefferson School of Medicine, 1841) which would have been much more interesting and would have made much more sense. Things would have been more tied together, events would have flowed more smoothly, and a lot more material could have been added.Overall, it wasn’t a bad book. It just needed more work to make it better."
185,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1352540-bert,5,"This compelling story leaves readers wondering why Mutter is not a household name. Beyond his surgical innovation, he was a pioneer when it came to developing physician-patient relationships. Cristin O’Keefe Aptowicz doesn’t use the term, but she paints Mutter as a doctor who was among the first to understand the role of a good bedside manner. Mutter’s curiosity led to the advancement of the science to which he dedicated his life, but his compassion for humanity fueled those innovations. He deflected rivalry and skepticism – and even personal suffering – and dedicated himself to alleviating the suffering of others. Mutter’s teaching methods were equally influential. In fact it’s hard to accurately map how far his influence extends given the achievements of the countless students who benefited from his amiable lessons. It’s curious how names like Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Hawking and others form a group that seems to carry greater name recognition than those pioneers in the life sciences. I don't know why this is the case, but surely Mutter’s name belongs in that latter group as surely as Aptowicz’s latest work belongs on your reading list."
186,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6389813-maddie-barton,1,"What a deeply frustrating book. Aptowicz is an engaging writer, however I am not sure she is an engaging historical writer, and feel her talent may be more suited to fiction. I struggled with this book considerably, and feel it relies too much upon conjecture - especially upon emotional conjecture. I have no doubt that there was a great deal of primary source material available for Aptowicz to draw from, however there is little presented for the reader. At times Dr Mutter simply disappears for chapters, and the constant referral to his supposed rivalry with Dr Meigs, seems, well, supposed more than substantiated. The contextualising of Dr Mutter's time is all over the place, and every chapter ends of a cliffhanger, which seems unnecessary. Overall, I felt the book was flimsy, and that much more could have been explored in a much more sophisticated manner, with a more intelligent narrative structure. I suppose that if you are after a fairly superficial read about one of America's pioneering surgeons, then this would do the trick. If, however, you are genuinely interested in medical and museum history, I would not reach for this book. "
187,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela,3,"If you're looking for something creepy, freaky, bizarre or macabre, this isn't it. What it is, is a studious look into the history of medicine in relation to Dr. Thomas Dent Mutter and his fellow associates.Aptowicz, fascinated by a field-trip to the Mutter Museum, spent the next ten years digging and mining for any and all information into Dr. Mutter's life and his accomplishments. Of which, there isn't a whole lot of information to be had. Mutter didn't keep a personal or professional journal. Due to the lack of detailed data, Aptowicz filled these voids with other related (and not so related) tidbits surrounding medical practices of the era, culture nuances, gender/race qualms, bios of Mutter's associates, and educational mindsets. Overall, the book is interesting though a bit dry and lackluster. I found myself skimming here and there, losing interest. The cover being much more compelling than the actually book. However, I applaud Aptowicz's dedication to research and time passionately invested. From poet to scholarly author. A solid effort and worthy leap into the world of non-fiction writing.Three Stars "
188,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855683-josephine,4,"A little too purple and adjective-laden to rate a five, and the book as a whole struck me as being almost more about the state of medicine in Philadelphia in the early nineteenth century than as about Mutter himself. (The umlaut was an affectation.)Otherwise it's an interesting book. There's more conjecture and interpolation than I'd like in a biography, but honestly: Mutter would have disappeared from the attention of all but avid historians of medicine, were it not for the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia. (No, I've never gone, but I wouldn't mind.) In any case, most people's lives go so poorly documented that few of us would rate more than a couple of lines in Who's Who. When and where were we born? Did we serve in the military? Graduate college? ...and that's about it, a century later. Mutter did at least leave a record of publications, and a teaching career."
189,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5928435-jessie,5,"If you need a reminder to appreciate your health care access, this is the book for you! The author does an amazing job in sharing Dr. Mutter's life by explaining how life was in the 1800's Philadelphia (and particularly the medical practices/beliefs) and exploring the people who he interacted with while he was alive and the legacy of his students' lives after his death. It was shocking to know that dedicated healers unintentionally caused so much harm to patients and how difficult it was to advance medicine. A fascinating read!"
190,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58122957-mortisha-cassavetes,5,"Wow! I really enjoyed this book. The book follows the life of Dr. Thomas Mutter. The tragedy in his youth that left him without his parents through til the end of his life and all his accomplishments in between. Dr. Mutter did so much to change medicine with sterilization of instruments to helping the severely deformed patients including burn victims. Thomas Mutter was sickly most of his life and died way too early at the age of forty eight. His museum is still open to this day in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I highly recommend this book. It is written so very well that I just flew through the pages. "
191,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23644033-jerry-book,4,"Before the US Civil War medicine in the USA was very primitive. Dr. Mutter enters the picture wanting to be the best surgeon he can be. He studies in France and brings back the latest surgical techniques. He is an early advocate of anesthesia and a sterile operating room. I found it quite amazing how other physicians fought these practical reforms. It was horrifying to learn that most surgeons at the time operated without anesthesia. Even more horrifying, other physicians resisted his advocacy for a sterile operating room. Nonetheless, his skill and brilliance was recognized. He was appointed chair of the department of surgery at Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Tragically, he dies at the early age of 44 due to tuberculosis. Dr. Mutter left the world a much better place. He was a true hero of medicine. Dr. Mutter left us his Museum of Medical Marvels in Philadelphia which is composed of the medical oddities Dr. Mutter encountered in his career. One critic has commented much of Dr. Mutter's career has been imagined by the author. This is because Dr. Mutter left very little writings. Nonetheless, his achievements are real as I have mentioned. Also, it is a Great Read!"
192,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1473665-christine,5,"Thomas Dent Mutter was born to a fairly affluent family but illness and death left him an orphan with limited means. An uncle agreed to become his guardian and although not emotionally supportive he did ensure that young Thomas received a good education. Thomas’ creativity showed early when he learned to indulge his love of quality (and somewhat flamboyant) clothing.As Ms. Aptowicz writes:	“Over the years, he grew practiced in the art of finessing opportunities so that he could live something approximate to the life he desired. At boarding school, he was known to charge his clothing bills to the institution and then earn scholarships to pay off the resulting debts. When he wanted to travel, he secured just enough money to get him to his destination and then relied on his wits to get him back home.”This creativity served him well after he graduated from medical school and wanted to go to Paris, the epicentre of medical achievement at the time. Mutter was always fascinated by and drawn to surgery. He “loved the daringness of the surgeries attempted during this time”. Aside from the procedures themselves he enjoyed the fact that surgeons did not depend on class and family to acquire patients and, thereby, success … “surgeons earned their place through hard work, study and skill”. He knew surgery was his calling and in Paris Dr. Mutter was inspired by some of the best. He returned to American with not only the knowledge of the new “les operations plastiques” but a wax sculpture of a woman with a horn growing out of her forehead (which was subsequently surgically removed). Thus began his collection of “marvels” and also his lifelong determination to help the “monsters”, those people whose deformities made their lives unbearable. His abilities were awe-inspiring, especially in the early 19th century when aesthetic was not available. Doctors were often favoured as much because of their speed with the scalpel as for their medical prowess.Mutters hands were his most valuable asset, 	“Swift and nimble, quick and precise, they were one of the reasons he was able to do the work he did. It was rare blessing enough to be ambidextrous. But to be skilled as Mutter was with both his hand was seen as near miraculous (Few can boast of [being ambidextrous] … and often, many who can have in fact only two left hands” a fellow doctor once quipped).Being presented the position of Chair of Surgery at Philadelphia newest and soon most prestigious Jefferson College of Medicine Dr. Mutter was instrumental in so many medical innovations and influencing more than a few students who went on to become the leaders of the future medical community.This book was an astounding recounting of this man’s remarkable life and achievements. It is written in a conversational style and smoothly incorporates the politics, the medical practices and social beliefs of the time. Ms. Aptowicz does a remarkable job. I have no practical knowledge of medicine or surgical practices, and very little about Philadelphia during the late 1800’s yet I found this book easy to read and understand. There is no other way to describe it other than utterly fascinating. I believe it would appeal equally to fans of non-fiction historical accounts and those who may not read a lot of non-fiction but enjoy a fascinating story. I find myself wondering why Dr. Mutter’s story is not more well-known? Definitely five stars.On a personal note: There are some spine tingling surgical descriptions in this book, which makes me so grateful to Dr. Mutter, his contemporaries and students who persevered so I now live in a time when we have anaesthesia, antiseptics, painkillers and doctors who wash their hands.The museum does have website to visit at www.Muttermuseum.org"
193,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239462-kevin,1,"I love the Mütter Museum in Philly, I love medical oddities, I like reading about medical advances (and the accompanying horror of ""Oh god I can't believe that the doctors used to think [x] instead of [y] - I'm so glad I didn't live back then"") and so on and so on.But man, this book sure did bore me to death. Dr. Mütter was clearly a good man as well as brilliant, but I think that maybe when the author realized ""Mütter was rather an elusive character to research"" she should have called off the project. I'm fine with biographies and I'm fine with historical fiction but this sat somewhere in-between without sufficient pull in either direction.The title directly promises 'intrigue' but I missed it somewhere. The title also makes it sound like this would be more about the museum (Dr. Mütter's Marvels) and that was not the case in the slightest.Towards the end I stuck a bookmark in at page 281 (chapter 26) so that I could remind myself, ""This is where it gets interesting - where the museum itself is actually established - so if you loan this out to your friends you can tell them that if they get as bored as you did to just skip ahead to here."" Then the book came to an end at page 305. I hadn't realized the last ~60 pages of the book would be acknowledgements and source notes and all that.Here's the thing: I never buy books when they first come out. I never buy new releases in hardcover. But ... the Mütter Museum! and its history! How could I not have bought this? I think the majority of my disappointment here is that this book is not at all what I thought it was, nor how I saw it billed in the few bits of information available to me before it was released. I wish I had waited a while, read some reader reviews, and realized that it would never fulfill my desires, and saved my money."
194,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17255022-stephanie-pounds,5,"Watch out Erik Larson, you've got some serious competition in Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz. I thoroughly enjoyed her new book, Dr. M�tter's Marvels: A True Tale of Intrigue and Innovation at the Dawn of Modern Medicine, an excellent example of narrative non-fiction. lthough well-known in his time, I had never heard of Dr M�tter before reading this book. Aptowicz's story, however, made him jump off the pages. She followed the familiar pattern of short chapters with punchy endings that make you want to jump to the next chapter as quickly as possible. While many others have tried this formula and can make it seem tiring, Aptowicz really nailed it. The cliffhangers never seemed contrived and really did move the story along. I'm not sure I would characterize this story as one of ""intrigue,"" but ""innovation"" definitely! And though mentioned briefly at the beginning, the ""Marvels"" of the title aren't really discussed until the end, but I enjoyed Aptowicz's narrative in her acknowledgements as she described how she learned about M�tter and his marvels. Now I think I'd like to see them, too--and that's how you know you've found a really good author. I'm looking forward to more, Ms Aptowicz!"
195,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924321-jennifer,5,"I was intrigued by the cover copy of this book; I wasn't prepared for how inspiring and moving I would find it. Thomas Dent Mutter's contributions to medicine proved lasting and significant. And though he didn't live long enough to accomplish all he'd hoped, his compassion and his passion for the work of healing those in need sent out ripples that affected later generations of doctors and their patients. If you know someone who's had reconstructive surgery, you have Mutter to thank. Needed anesthesia for an operation? Mutter was one of the early champions--and one of his students went on to design a method of purifying ether and a mask to provide safer delivery for patients. Moms, if your obstetrician and nurses washed their hands and tools so you didn't get puerperal fever, again, Mutter was on the forefront of establishing germ theory and preventing contamination. And the list goes on. A potent reminder that sometime success lies farther down the road than we can see in our brief human lives. "
196,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/752423-alisa,5,"A lovingly rendered biography if an ambitious yet deeply humane surgeon, and more importantly, teacher. Mütter taught thousands af medical students in his tenure at Jefferson Medical College, battling for changes we still consider vital in today's medical profession and education - clinical experience, bedside manner, thorough anatomical knowledge, and continuous learning. Enjoyed this book completely and recommend it as a way to study medicine, mid-19th century history, and even the rise of urbanism in the antebellum period. *Rounded up from 4.5 stars. "

I rarely read acknowledgements and notes, but I did here (and it was worth it!), because I didn't want the book to end. This is an elegant and emotional story of a colorful and brilliant man. The author intersperses history and commentary on the age throughout, and it felt very real as I read. I also loved the pictures and illustrations; they were both interesting and added to the story. Loved it!"

Can't wait to visit the Mütter Museum next week as my fortieth birthday present, and so glad that I'll be doing so with the perspective gained through reading this lovely work."
199,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32690537-sam,5,"I am always amazed that so much of medicine is truly modern: the use of anesthesia, the discovery and acceptance of viruses as a means of transmitting illness and the acceptance of cleanliness as important to the treatment of the patient, all happened within the last 150 years or so. It is equally amazing that some of these advancements were met with so much resistance and occurred due to the persistence of a very few physicians, Dr. Mutter being one of them. A very enjoyable read. "

It's really hard to read this book and not get a bit of a crush on this guy.

Dr. Mütter was clearly a good man as well as brilliant, but I think that maybe when the author realized ""Mütter was rather an elusive character to research"" she should have called off the project. I'm fine with biographies and I'm fine with historical fiction but this sat somewhere in-between without sufficient pull in either direction.The title directly promises 'intrigue' but I missed it somewhere. The title also makes it sound like this would be more about the museum (Dr. Mütter's Marvels) and that was not the case in the slightest.Towards the end I stuck a bookmark in at page 281 (chapter 26) so that I could remind myself, ""This is where it gets interesting - where the museum itself is actually established - so if you loan this out to your friends you can tell them that if they get as bored as you did to just skip ahead to here."" Then the book came to an end at page 305. I hadn't realized the last ~60 pages of the book would be acknowledgements and source notes and all that.Here's the thing: I never buy books when they first come out. I never buy new releases in hardcover. But ... the Mütter Museum! and its history! How could I not have bought this? I think the majority of my disappointment here is that this book is not at all what I thought it was, nor how I saw it billed in the few bits of information available to me before it was released. I wish I had waited a while, read some reader reviews, and realized that it would never fulfill my desires, and saved my money."
224,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17255022-stephanie-pounds,5,"Watch out Erik Larson, you've got some serious competition in Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz. I thoroughly enjoyed her new book, Dr. M�tter's Marvels: A True Tale of Intrigue and Innovation at the Dawn of Modern Medicine, an excellent example of narrative non-fiction. lthough well-known in his time, I had never heard of Dr M�tter before reading this book. Aptowicz's story, however, made him jump off the pages. She followed the familiar pattern of short chapters with punchy endings that make you want to jump to the next chapter as quickly as possible. While many others have tried this formula and can make it seem tiring, Aptowicz really nailed it. The cliffhangers never seemed contrived and really did move the story along. I'm not sure I would characterize this story as one of ""intrigue,"" but ""innovation"" definitely! And though mentioned briefly at the beginning, the ""Marvels"" of the title aren't really discussed until the end, but I enjoyed Aptowicz's narrative in her acknowledgements as she described how she learned about M�tter and his marvels. Now I think I'd like to see them, too--and that's how you know you've found a really good author. I'm looking forward to more, Ms Aptowicz!"
225,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924321-jennifer,5,"I was intrigued by the cover copy of this book; I wasn't prepared for how inspiring and moving I would find it. Thomas Dent Mutter's contributions to medicine proved lasting and significant. And though he didn't live long enough to accomplish all he'd hoped, his compassion and his passion for the work of healing those in need sent out ripples that affected later generations of doctors and their patients. If you know someone who's had reconstructive surgery, you have Mutter to thank. Needed anesthesia for an operation? Mutter was one of the early champions--and one of his students went on to design a method of purifying ether and a mask to provide safer delivery for patients. Moms, if your obstetrician and nurses washed their hands and tools so you didn't get puerperal fever, again, Mutter was on the forefront of establishing germ theory and preventing contamination. And the list goes on. A potent reminder that sometime success lies farther down the road than we can see in our brief human lives. "

Mütter taught thousands af medical students in his tenure at Jefferson Medical College, battling for changes we still consider vital in today's medical profession and education - clinical experience, bedside manner, thorough anatomical knowledge, and continuous learning. Enjoyed this book completely and recommend it as a way to study medicine, mid-19th century history, and even the rise of urbanism in the antebellum period. *Rounded up from 4.5 stars. "

The author intersperses history and commentary on the age throughout, and it felt very real as I read. I also loved the pictures and illustrations; they were both interesting and added to the story. Loved it!"

244,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,1,"I received Dr. Mutter’s Marvels free as a Good Reads First Read Book. The blurb promised the book to be fascinating and riveting, giving a good glimpse into American medicine in the 19th Century and how Doctor Thomas Mutter impacted it.First, the book starts off with a medical oddity that Mutter encounters while aboard ship to France. It’s a good hook to get you interested but medical oddities were far more common at that time then they are today. You get a bit of Mutter’s biography, which is what I thought the book would be about, but the author skips parts or starts with one thing and then goes off on something completely different. And other individuals get introduced but their introduction seems out of place.Many chapters could have been combined. A better history of medicine and the medical profession in America would have helped, which could have easily been a chapter unto itself. Plus, a general history of Philadelphia and a quick history of medicine in England and France would also have been beneficial. The text didn’t seem to flow chronologically but rather meandered wherever the author wanted it to. Dr. Mutter may have had a big impact on 19th Century American medicine but you don’t get that impression from the book.I felt rather cheated. I was promised a biography of a game changer and what I got was just another biography. You could almost have made it a history of the Faculty of ’41 (Jefferson School of Medicine, 1841) which would have been much more interesting and would have made much more sense. Things would have been more tied together, events would have flowed more smoothly, and a lot more material could have been added.Overall, it wasn’t a bad book. It just needed more work to make it better."
245,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1352540-bert,5,"This compelling story leaves readers wondering why Mutter is not a household name. Beyond his surgical innovation, he was a pioneer when it came to developing physician-patient relationships. Cristin O’Keefe Aptowicz doesn’t use the term, but she paints Mutter as a doctor who was among the first to understand the role of a good bedside manner. Mutter’s curiosity led to the advancement of the science to which he dedicated his life, but his compassion for humanity fueled those innovations. He deflected rivalry and skepticism – and even personal suffering – and dedicated himself to alleviating the suffering of others. Mutter’s teaching methods were equally influential. In fact it’s hard to accurately map how far his influence extends given the achievements of the countless students who benefited from his amiable lessons. It’s curious how names like Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Hawking and others form a group that seems to carry greater name recognition than those pioneers in the life sciences. I don't know why this is the case, but surely Mutter’s name belongs in that latter group as surely as Aptowicz’s latest work belongs on your reading list."
246,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6389813-maddie-barton,1,"What a deeply frustrating book. Aptowicz is an engaging writer, however I am not sure she is an engaging historical writer, and feel her talent may be more suited to fiction. I struggled with this book considerably, and feel it relies too much upon conjecture - especially upon emotional conjecture. I have no doubt that there was a great deal of primary source material available for Aptowicz to draw from, however there is little presented for the reader. At times Dr Mutter simply disappears for chapters, and the constant referral to his supposed rivalry with Dr Meigs, seems, well, supposed more than substantiated. The contextualising of Dr Mutter's time is all over the place, and every chapter ends of a cliffhanger, which seems unnecessary. Overall, I felt the book was flimsy, and that much more could have been explored in a much more sophisticated manner, with a more intelligent narrative structure. I suppose that if you are after a fairly superficial read about one of America's pioneering surgeons, then this would do the trick.

274,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737552-elizabeth,1,"I received Dr. Mutter’s Marvels free as a Good Reads First Read Book. The blurb promised the book to be fascinating and riveting, giving a good glimpse into American medicine in the 19th Century and how Doctor Thomas Mutter impacted it.First, the book starts off with a medical oddity that Mutter encounters while aboard ship to France. It’s a good hook to get you interested but medical oddities were far more common at that time then they are today. You get a bit of Mutter’s biography, which is what I thought the book would be about, but the author skips parts or starts with one thing and then goes off on something completely different. And other individuals get introduced but their introduction seems out of place.Many chapters could have been combined. A better history of medicine and the medical profession in America would have helped, which could have easily been a chapter unto itself. Plus, a general history of Philadelphia and a quick history of medicine in England and France would also have been beneficial. The text didn’t seem to flow chronologically but rather meandered wherever the author wanted it to. Dr. Mutter may have had a big impact on 19th Century American medicine but you don’t get that impression from the book.I felt rather cheated. I was promised a biography of a game changer and what I got was just another biography. You could almost have made it a history of the Faculty of ’41 (Jefferson School of Medicine, 1841) which would have been much more interesting and would have made much more sense. Things would have been more tied together, events would have flowed more smoothly, and a lot more material could have been added.Overall, it wasn’t a bad book. It just needed more work to make it better."
275,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1352540-bert,5,"This compelling story leaves readers wondering why Mutter is not a household name. Beyond his surgical innovation, he was a pioneer when it came to developing physician-patient relationships. Cristin O’Keefe Aptowicz doesn’t use the term, but she paints Mutter as a doctor who was among the first to understand the role of a good bedside manner. Mutter’s curiosity led to the advancement of the science to which he dedicated his life, but his compassion for humanity fueled those innovations. He deflected rivalry and skepticism – and even personal suffering – and dedicated himself to alleviating the suffering of others. Mutter’s teaching methods were equally influential. In fact it’s hard to accurately map how far his influence extends given the achievements of the countless students who benefited from his amiable lessons. It’s curious how names like Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Hawking and others form a group that seems to carry greater name recognition than those pioneers in the life sciences. I don't know why this is the case, but surely Mutter’s name belongs in that latter group as surely as Aptowicz’s latest work belongs on your reading list."
276,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6389813-maddie-barton,1,"What a deeply frustrating book. Aptowicz is an engaging writer, however I am not sure she is an engaging historical writer, and feel her talent may be more suited to fiction. I struggled with this book considerably, and feel it relies too much upon conjecture - especially upon emotional conjecture. I have no doubt that there was a great deal of primary source material available for Aptowicz to draw from, however there is little presented for the reader. At times Dr Mutter simply disappears for chapters, and the constant referral to his supposed rivalry with Dr Meigs, seems, well, supposed more than substantiated. The contextualising of Dr Mutter's time is all over the place, and every chapter ends of a cliffhanger, which seems unnecessary. Overall, I felt the book was flimsy, and that much more could have been explored in a much more sophisticated manner, with a more intelligent narrative structure. I suppose that if you are after a fairly superficial read about one of America's pioneering surgeons, then this would do the trick. If, however, you are genuinely interested in medical and museum history, I would not reach for this book. "
277,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela,3,"If you're looking for something creepy, freaky, bizarre or macabre, this isn't it. What it is, is a studious look into the history of medicine in relation to Dr. Thomas Dent Mutter and his fellow associates.Aptowicz, fascinated by a field-trip to the Mutter Museum, spent the next ten years digging and mining for any and all information into Dr. Mutter's life and his accomplishments. Of which, there isn't a whole lot of information to be had. Mutter didn't keep a personal or professional journal. Due to the lack of detailed data, Aptowicz filled these voids with other related (and not so related) tidbits surrounding medical practices of the era, culture nuances, gender/race qualms, bios of Mutter's associates, and educational mindsets. Overall, the book is interesting though a bit dry and lackluster. I found myself skimming here and there, losing interest. The cover being much more compelling than the actually book. However, I applaud Aptowicz's dedication to research and time passionately invested. From poet to scholarly author. A solid effort and worthy leap into the world of non-fiction writing.Three Stars "
278,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855683-josephine,4,"A little too purple and adjective-laden to rate a five, and the book as a whole struck me as being almost more about the state of medicine in Philadelphia in the early nineteenth century than as about Mutter himself. (The umlaut was an affectation.)Otherwise it's an interesting book. There's more conjecture and interpolation than I'd like in a biography, but honestly: Mutter would have disappeared from the attention of all but avid historians of medicine, were it not for the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia. (No, I've never gone, but I wouldn't mind.) In any case, most people's lives go so poorly documented that few of us would rate more than a couple of lines in Who's Who. When and where were we born? Did we serve in the military? Graduate college? ...and that's about it, a century later. Mutter did at least leave a record of publications, and a teaching career."

The author does an amazing job in sharing Dr. Mutter's life by explaining how life was in the 1800's Philadelphia (and particularly the medical practices/beliefs) and exploring the people who he interacted with while he was alive and the legacy of his students' lives after his death. It was shocking to know that dedicated healers unintentionally caused so much harm to patients and how difficult it was to advance medicine. A fascinating read!"

The tragedy in his youth that left him without his parents through til the end of his life and all his accomplishments in between. Dr. Mutter did so much to change medicine with sterilization of instruments to helping the severely deformed patients including burn victims. Thomas Mutter was sickly most of his life and died way too early at the age of forty eight. His museum is still open to this day in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I highly recommend this book. It is written so very well that I just flew through the pages. "
281,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23644033-jerry-book,4,"Before the US Civil War medicine in the USA was very primitive. Dr. Mutter enters the picture wanting to be the best surgeon he can be. He studies in France and brings back the latest surgical techniques. He is an early advocate of anesthesia and a sterile operating room. I found it quite amazing how other physicians fought these practical reforms. It was horrifying to learn that most surgeons at the time operated without anesthesia. Even more horrifying, other physicians resisted his advocacy for a sterile operating room. Nonetheless, his skill and brilliance was recognized. He was appointed chair of the department of surgery at Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Tragically, he dies at the early age of 44 due to tuberculosis. Dr. Mutter left the world a much better place. He was a true hero of medicine. Dr. Mutter left us his Museum of Medical Marvels in Philadelphia which is composed of the medical oddities Dr. Mutter encountered in his career. One critic has commented much of Dr. Mutter's career has been imagined by the author. This is because Dr. Mutter left very little writings. Nonetheless, his achievements are real as I have mentioned. Also, it is a Great Read!"
282,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1473665-christine,5,"Thomas Dent Mutter was born to a fairly affluent family but illness and death left him an orphan with limited means. An uncle agreed to become his guardian and although not emotionally supportive he did ensure that young Thomas received a good education. Thomas’ creativity showed early when he learned to indulge his love of quality (and somewhat flamboyant) clothing.As Ms. Aptowicz writes:	“Over the years, he grew practiced in the art of finessing opportunities so that he could live something approximate to the life he desired. At boarding school, he was known to charge his clothing bills to the institution and then earn scholarships to pay off the resulting debts. When he wanted to travel, he secured just enough money to get him to his destination and then relied on his wits to get him back home.”This creativity served him well after he graduated from medical school and wanted to go to Paris, the epicentre of medical achievement at the time. Mutter was always fascinated by and drawn to surgery. He “loved the daringness of the surgeries attempted during this time”. Aside from the procedures themselves he enjoyed the fact that surgeons did not depend on class and family to acquire patients and, thereby, success … “surgeons earned their place through hard work, study and skill”. He knew surgery was his calling and in Paris Dr. Mutter was inspired by some of the best. He returned to American with not only the knowledge of the new “les operations plastiques” but a wax sculpture of a woman with a horn growing out of her forehead (which was subsequently surgically removed). Thus began his collection of “marvels” and also his lifelong determination to help the “monsters”, those people whose deformities made their lives unbearable. His abilities were awe-inspiring, especially in the early 19th century when aesthetic was not available. Doctors were often favoured as much because of their speed with the scalpel as for their medical prowess.Mutters hands were his most valuable asset, 	“Swift and nimble, quick and precise, they were one of the reasons he was able to do the work he did. It was rare blessing enough to be ambidextrous. But to be skilled as Mutter was with both his hand was seen as near miraculous (Few can boast of [being ambidextrous] … and often, many who can have in fact only two left hands” a fellow doctor once quipped).Being presented the position of Chair of Surgery at Philadelphia newest and soon most prestigious Jefferson College of Medicine Dr. Mutter was instrumental in so many medical innovations and influencing more than a few students who went on to become the leaders of the future medical community.This book was an astounding recounting of this man’s remarkable life and achievements. It is written in a conversational style and smoothly incorporates the politics, the medical practices and social beliefs of the time. Ms. Aptowicz does a remarkable job. I have no practical knowledge of medicine or surgical practices, and very little about Philadelphia during the late 1800’s yet I found this book easy to read and understand. There is no other way to describe it other than utterly fascinating. I believe it would appeal equally to fans of non-fiction historical accounts and those who may not read a lot of non-fiction but enjoy a fascinating story. I find myself wondering why Dr. Mutter’s story is not more well-known? Definitely five stars.On a personal note: There are some spine tingling surgical descriptions in this book, which makes me so grateful to Dr. Mutter, his contemporaries and students who persevered so I now live in a time when we have anaesthesia, antiseptics, painkillers and doctors who wash their hands.The museum does have website to visit at www.Muttermuseum.org"

The book focuses mostly on his teaching and surgical innovations as a doctor in Philadelphia, and I would have been interested in more information in how Mutter collected his ""marvels"" and similar details. "

I live in the area and never knew the impact Philadelphia made on modernizing medicine. It's not a light read, there is some repetition of facts throughout, but does not read like a text book and I really enjoyed it. I need to head back to the museum this weekend!"

Although not presented in an entirely historically factual manner, the book was written in a way that made me gasp, laugh, frown, pout, and even tear up at some parts. Great read. "

Absolutely fascinating look at the state of medicine in the 19th century and very inspiring for me as a physician myself. I would highly recommend it."

However, for whatever reason, the title possibly, I'd expected the book to be more about the museum and not the man. But it ended up being interesting one way or another. If for nothing else, just getting an idea of how medicine was practiced at this time. Really pretty good."

Certainly learned things I didn't know, but not quite certain I would visit the Mutter Museum as I'm not a fan of deformed body parts. Still, the writing was clear and easy for a non-medical type to follow. Interesting twist on the characters of the doctors and certainly enjoyed the sheep story."
299,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/681762-kimberly,5,Loved this book! I don't usually read non-fiction but this book intrigued me. It's a fantastic story of the crossroads to modern medicine. The characters are engaging and it is an extremely well written and well researched book. Very accessible to the lay person. Highly recommend.
