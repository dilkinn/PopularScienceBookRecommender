0,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Reading this quite good book, caused me to realize how much we owe to James Watson, he of the famous ""Watson and Crick"" duo who became famous by discovering the structure of DNA.But, not because of that. As Ramakrishnan tells so well in this book, once an idea is discoverable, whether the structure of DNA or electricity or radio or the internal combustion engine or even evolution by natural selection, there will be multiple people who will have the potential to discover it. If Watson and Crick had not discovered DNA's structure, Rosalind Franklin or Maurice Wilkins or Linus Pauling or someone else would have published an article doing so, not long after they in fact did. Ramakrishnan's target was the ribosome, that factory that actually uses the genetic code to assemble proteins, and he was most definitely in a race with others to figure out how it was made and how it functioned.Also, not because he wrote an excellent book explaining how the structure of DNA came to be. Many scientists, before and after, have written essays or books about how they came to the ideas that made them famous. It's well worth reading, just for that, but that is not what was special about James Watson, and if he had not existed then whoever else took his place would likely have told the story somewhere, just as Ramakrishnan has told his story here.No, the real debt we owe to James Watson is the part that would not have happened if someone else had taken his place, and that is the fact that ""The Double Helix"" is such a gossipy, snarky, utterly human tale. No other scientist before him, that I am aware of, wrote for popular consumption such an unabashedly human tale of how science actually gets done, full of rivalries and mistakes and emotional conflict and non-scientific concerns intruding into the lives of the people trying to figure out how the world works. But, once Watson had written his book, it appears to me that it made it more acceptable, expected even, that if a great scientist is going to tell their story, they should admit to all of the gossipy, political, emotional, irrational pushing and pulling that can both impede and occasionally propel them on their path to discovery. Ramakrishnan is not, I think, by nature the sort to do that, but he has given us a great tale here, and I think a great part of why is that Watson has made it acceptable to tell a story about science in a way that fills it with humans.There are rivalries and disappointments and fears and exuberance in Ramakrishnan's tale, and he takes us through it with an excellent mix of science and oh-so-human scientists. There are other scientists on the hunt for the same prize he is, and despite his best efforts to be even-handed you can tell which ones got on his nerves the most. He is quite candid about the role that luck, politics, the ""Matthew effect"" (success brings you opportunities which brings success which brings...), and all the other things besides being talented, that allow a person to end up in Stockholm accepting a Nobel Prize. He discusses the quite problematic restriction that no more than 3 people can share a prize, and how utterly out of step this is with the way science gets done, often with hundreds and usually with dozens of people involved in an integral way with any truly important discovery.In a way, that highlights the importance of books like these. The idea of the Scientist Discoverer, like Albert Einstein working nearly alone and figuring it out, is still the impression most people have about how science happens. It is as if we thought Elon Musk was designing and assembling the Tesla car himself, or that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were busy in their garage assembling every Macintosh computer ever sold. We know that the CEO whose face appears on the cover of the magazine is more the surfer perched atop the wave than the actual force propelling the surfboard forward, but with scientists one gets the impression this is not as well understood. Ramakrishnan manages to relate his tale in an enjoyable way, even to a reader like me who could not quite recall what it is that the ribosome was about before I started reading his book. Well done."
1,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"I remember reading Craig Ventner's book about racing to sequence the human genome. It read like a novel. I couldn't look away as Ventner spilled all the secrets about his personal life as well as all the nasty, behind the scenes antics that arise when scientists compete. I remember thinking he seemed a bit bitter, but I didn't care because I wanted to know everything I could about this usually hidden side of scientific discovery. Ramakrishnan's book is very similar in that it allows the reader to witness the arguments, insecurities, and questionable tactics scientists engage in when trying to outdo each other. This book was a little lighter on the science than I was expecting, which usually annoys me, but I didn't care. I loved every bit of this book, which recounted the harried race to discover the structure of the 30 subunit - and to a lesser extent, the 50 subunit structure. Ramakrishnan's journey through grad school to winning the Nobel was incredibly interesting, fraught with with fear of making the wrong decisions, the desire to follow his passions, the desire to not get caught up in pursuits of money or fame, the confusion about how to handle difficult colleagues, and more than anything else fraught with his angst over his own possible misunderstandings. He often jumped to conclusions that ended up being ill conceived. I loved how frank he was when self-reflecting. Most people tend to try to paint themselves in a better light. Of course, he did end up looking better than his rival Ada Yonath, who shared the Nobel with him. I should like to read her side of the story...."
2,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,2,"I seldom read biographies or memoirs. By me, the world is best understood by those who are not at the center of the story being told because a solipsism seeps through otherwise. Within the story is the real nature of how science progresses with its messiness, competition and sometimes luck ('chance favors the prepared mind'). A wonderful quote from Blake 'the fool in his persistent folly becomes wise'. That quote is applicable for all of us who are thrown into this world without certainty and who want to know and understand. What often appears as folly to others can lead to a Noble Prize. All of us in our 'persistent folly' can seek our own meaning by our own search for wisdom. For a memoir or biography to be meaningful to me, the author needs to remove the main character in such a way that the thought takes over. Issacson's biography of Einstein was such a book for me, and I seldom get that otherwise and therefore I stay away from this genre. "
3,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,2,"This is 90% boring auto-biography and 10% interesting molecular biology. If nothing else, it's great to hear science straight from the scientist.And the race to decipher the ribosome is quite interesting. It reminds me of the race to decode the human genome.I just wish the author had gone into more detail on the whole ribosome. Instead, we get his perspective on the piece he worked on, and even then it's only doled out as relevant to the narrative of competitiveness, which I couldn't care less about."
4,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4482895-shabbeer-hassan,4,"An amazing, honest and humbling look into the race to discover the structure of the 30 subunit and 50 subunit structure of the ribosome. Venki's journey from grad school to the foremost of science, his struggles in the cut-throat, competitive world of academia, frustration with troublesome colleagues are presented quite well here. A fast-paced read!My Rating - 4.5/5"
5,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58970842-fenil,5,"A thoroughly sublime read. Dr. Venki's humility and honesty shines through in each chapter. His perseverance in his work despite failure and competition is a true testimony to the nature and spirit of science. Here are some of the quotes I highlighted while reading the book:""But that wasn’t all. Over the course of a single night, Brian had located one protein after another, until he had located all seven previously known protein structures in the 30S maps. Actually, although he knew where it was, he had left S5 for me to place since he knew it was the first protein structure I had ever solved and had a particular affection for it. Placing a protein in the 30S subunit had been so exciting that Brian said it had been like eating crisps. Once he did the first one, he couldn’t stop.""""What Malvolio said in Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night equally applies to Nobels: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.""""Like Ditlev, the other Scandinavian I’ve had in the lab, she was intelligent, organized, pleasant, and cheerful and just generally well rounded. It made me wonder if Scandinavians are doing something right in the way they bring up their children, or whether taking them from dark Scandinavia and placing them farther south, even if only as far south as Cambridge, made them particularly cheerful and free of any Bergman-like angst.""""I was fed up with the politics of the ribosome, so I began my talk by being uncharacteristically blunt in my assessment of our 70S structure compared to the one from Harry’s lab published around the same time, by pointing out some of the differences. I also felt that going all the way back to our 30S structure, people had failed to appreciate how much our structures had been used not only to interpret biochemical data but also to correct other structures. To make a point of this, I suddenly showed a picture of an Ordnance Survey map of my village of Grantchester. I could feel the audience wondering what on earth this had to do with the ribosome. Perhaps they thought I had lost my mind. I went on to point out that the Ordnance Survey is thought to sprinkle a few spurious features in their maps so that if other map makers merely copied them rather than doing their own surveys, they would be found out. As scientists, I continued, we don’t deliberately introduce bogus features, but we do make mistakes. I added that by using a new detector we had recently collected much higher-resolution data, which allowed us to correct some mistakes in our original 30S structure, and sarcastically said that it was odd how those exact same mistakes had appeared in other people’s structures too.""""After the celebration, Vera and I walked my bicycle home in the rain.""""A contrite clarification partly mollified some but further infuriated others because I had said nationality was an accident of birth. Some Hindu nationalists had already been annoyed with me because they had learned from news reports that in the aftermath of the Gujarat riots in 2002, I had supported a scholarship to help poor Muslim girls, partly as a gesture from someone who was of Hindu ancestry and partly because the education of girls lifts society as a whole everywhere. Now they had further reason to think I was a traitor to their cause.""""When we have a clear goal in mind, we think we are struggling to reach a summit. But there is no summit. When we get there, we realize we have just climbed a foothill, and there is an endless series of mountains ahead still to be climbed.""""Of course, nobody had taken the slightest interest in honouring me in these ways during the many years after the key breakthroughs with the ribosome; without my having won the Nobel lottery, none of them would have given me a second thought - if they had thought of me at all. So there were really rewards of getting an award, and it reminded me of the line from Matthew 13:12: 'For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.'""""So I don’t subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even that much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We humans tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible. And when someone like Newton or Einstein sees much further than others, or Watson and Crick synthesize in one stroke the essential features of DNA that might have dribbled out in pieces, we tend to immortalize them."""
6,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107058204-julija,5,"Immersive and inspiring. A great read for a graduate student in life sciences and anyone who likes popular science￼.It is a captivating story not only of one’s scientific career which included a major change in research fields from physics to biology, but also of an intense scientific race￼. Reading this as a young scientist helps to realise that scientific problems are rarely solved by a single scientist: it is instead a collaborative effort of the scientific community. One can often find themselves intimidated by the possibility of getting “scooped” by another team in the field, but Gene Machine shows that although the competition may seem fierce, it is the desire to answer outstanding questions that drives progress and each scientific team towards their goal, and it is indeed the best and most productive way to approach science - through unconditional curiosity.The author gracefully gives credit to as many people as he could although at times such an account becomes overwhelming too detailed￼￼. The book ends with an update on the ribosome field in the post-Nobel prize era, the techniques, questions and new research teams driving the progress further."
7,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23834623-sarmistha,4,"An amazing awe inspiring journey of path-breaking discovery of RNA structure by the author leading RNA biologist. The story cites the persistence and hard-work of many researchers all over the world engaged in the race to uncover the mystery.The account starts with the author taking the life altering decision of taking part in the cut throat competition of finding the structure of gene machine.With progress in time, he acquired the requisite skill and gathered a group of ambitious researchers who worked relentlessly with him for the cause.Their path stricken with multiple risks,setbacks, wrong decisions,failures,politics and need of proper recognition is bound to strike a chord with every reader. Loved the way author emphasized on keep doing core science without falling prey to the lure of big awards and fame that came along-with them.I would recommend the book to each and every science student and to reader who harbor a scientific attitude.

8,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14408579-the-conch,4,"The author, Venkatraman ‘Venki’ Ramakrishnan is a Nobel Prize-winning biologist whose many scientific contributions include his work on the atomic structure of the ribosome. He was born in Chidambaram in Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu. The book is all about advance study of function of Ribosome and its Ribo Nucleic Acid (RNA). RNA holds the mystery of origination of life in the Earth. The author describes his journey from India to ultimately obtaining Nobel prize. The path was not easy. There was cut-throat competition, politics and nepotism too among scientists. Rat race does not spare even scientists. The discovery of structure and function of two subunits of Ribosome for e.g. 30S and 50S have immense contribution in clinical field. The book raised hope among many ordinary Indian students that even if one started from mundane position, however, can reach the sky by sheer determination and hard work. "
9,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5928145-jennifer-glass,5,"An inside look at how an outsider rose to the “pinnacle” of science: winning the Nobel Prize in 2009, along win Ada Yonath and Tom Steitz, for contributions to understanding the structure and function of the ribosome. Venkatraman (“Venki”) Ramakrishnan was trained as a physicist but fell in love with biology as a PhD student. This book reads as Venki’s memoir. The book contains approachable descriptions of myriad scientific techniques, primarily in X-ray crystallography, that eventually enabled the author and fellow Nobel winners to succeed at what was considered crazy for the first decades of his career: solving the atomic structure of the ribosome. These descriptions help the reader grasp the incredible persistence involved in pursuing ribosome structural studies until quite recently, when advances in electron microscopy have vastly expedited progress in the field. The book describes the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of working on this vexing problem from the author’s point of view, with due credit to his mentors, lab members, and numerous collaborators who enabled the successful story. The personal stories, scientific storytelling, and colorful personalities made the book an enjoyable, fast read. The author describes his experience of moving from pursuit of an interesting scientific question with fairly open collaboration (at least on the receiving end!), to growing increasingly nervous and closed-off to potential competition. It struck me not so much as the story of the ribosome, but as an honest description of the evolution of a scientist and a scientific field, the allure of fame and fortune, and a behind-the-scenes look at what is actually involved in receiving such a prestigious prize as the Nobel."
10,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80247437-thomas,3,"An interesting account of a life in science. I can’t say that I know a whole lot more about ribosomes, but something must’ve sunk in somewhere.There was sure lots of information about ribosomes and RNA and DNA and how to crystallize them using the fascinating discipline of crystallography in order to gradually learn their structures at the atomic level. It seemed to me that he spent years working on this only to find new technology coming along that would’ve cut it down to a few hours. Well, at least he got a Nobel Prize. There was lots of stuff about relationships within the scientific community, scientific prizes, politics, and rivalries between scientists and labs. People are people in every discipline.I loved when he won the Nobel and his wife said she thought they gave that the smart people. Apparently, behind every great man is a surprised woman.The account, overall, was a little on the dry side but a worthwhile read nonetheless"
11,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95878161-ardon-pillay,4,"Scientists are naturally averse to being too cavalier with their opinions - but Ramakrishnan is much like James Watson, he is an exception to the rule. He’s very candid about what he sees as the key steps taken to determine the overall structure of the ribosome, the four stroke piston engine of life. It was a very enjoyable read, but I found myself having to stop and take a lot more time to allow the physics of X-Ray Crystallography to sink in (but this may be down to my lack of a physics background). "
12,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"It is probably not the best scientist memoir I have read in terms of literary quality or philosophical depth, but it is one of the most honest description of a scientist’s life. It is this honesty that makes this a remarkable read, and the memory of it will stay with me for a very long time. Modern day science can be ruthlessly competitive, especially in the experimental domain. Venki Ramakrishnan describes his race to discover the structure and functionality of one of the most surprising molecular machine we know – the ribosome, that eventually got him the Nobel prize in Chemistry. He describes the excitement of this race, the fierce competition, and the occasional generosity that peeked through the rivalry and pettiness among scientists. Unlike many such books, he never tries to glorify the scientists as people singularly motivated by their quest, but rather as fallible human beings who are curious, but are also attracted by the lure of fame and success, and even a prize. He is acutely aware that all scientific breakthroughs happen when the time is right, and if one person does not do it then someone else will soon crack the same problem. He is also honest enough to admit that prizes are somewhat subjective, and for any award there are many others who are equally deserving, but gets ignored. Of course everyone says similar magnanimous things after winning a prize, but there is something genuine in his conviction that makes one believe that he really means it. It is so refreshing to hear a Nobel laureate say that he is not sage after all. It is all too common to see people expressing profound opinions on subjects they know very little about after they receive the Nobel prize.In my life I was fortunate enough to know a few such incredibly successful scientists, with major prizes under their belt, including the Nobel prize. Most of them are incredible human beings – fiercely intelligent and well versed in a wide array of things. Two things that I found was common among all of them – they are exceptionally curious people, and they are all human beings like you and me, with the same human frailties. Venki Ramakrishnan seems to be like the rest of them, except he seems to be aware of his ordinariness."
13,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69057876-sami,4,"This book is more important for what it stands for in addition to the scientific content. It's not just another nonfiction, but packs knowledge with the author's wisdom that he has gathered throughout his unconventional career... He describes challenges and difficulties that scientists face in this era.I'd recommend this more for motivation and inspiration although the author gives a very detailed insight into Ribosomes.For a more detailed scientific book, also written in a very nice prose, would be The Gene: An Intimate History by the Pulitzer Prize winning author Siddhartha Mukherjee. "
14,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32956945-anoop-bhat,4,"This book is a Nobel Laureate’s equivalent of Usain Bolt’s 100m sprint. It has similar dopamine kick, but sustained for decades.Usually, building prequel to such science stories is very challenging. Venki manages it brilliantly- he both tells his personal experience around the story and describes in layman’s-term the concrete science behind. One good thing about such story telling is, the reader can nail the story to a parallel experience from his/her life in general.Once Venki begins explaining the race to solve the problem that brought him Nobel, it is hard to keep the book down. Especially, since Venki describes the background and strengths of all the four competing groups in such fine details that it is difficult to route for one group as favorites.Personally, I analyzed that Venki had three things working for him in his path for Nobel. 1. He made some really good decisions, sometimes completely outside the box. 2. He had excellent team- from his lab’s director to his students and they worked relentlessly. 3. He was at the right place at right time.I personally think there are things in Venki’s story that makes him less of an ideal. One such instance is his reaction towards India after he wins the Nobel. Also, I did not find any of his students go on to do outstanding work. He could have added more of his personal emotions and insights as well.I also could not help but to compare the value of Nobel now a days to that during say Einstein’s for example. This is because, Venki explains that now there is a new technology that could do Venki’s decades of work that brought him Nobel just in a week."

As a science student, I for one, never really figured out which field of chemistry to indulge myself into going back and forth on quantum and organic. The author inspires by writing the account of not falling into “oscar” traps of the science world and taking risks, experimenting with the unknown. Truly a Nobel laureate’s work. "

In this book, he candidly and honestly shares this journey of discovery from a physics student to a Nobel Prize winner, detailing the long and arduous process of scientific research, and the intense competitiveness of the field that actually depends a lot on ‘luck’.As a science student, I studied ribosomes in Biology before but I never really thought much about it, especially vis-à-vis how it was discovered. Therefore, this was an interesting read that provided me with insights into the scientific community, making it feel like an essential read for budding scientists, even if the technical details of the subject matter might seem a little dry to some.All in all, this was an educational read that I believe those who are into science, and more specifically, the ribosome, will enjoy and find enriching!4/5"
17,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31920105-youssef-mansour,4,"A beautifully written, well-rounded memoir of the race to discover the atomic structure of the ribosome. Venki Ramakrishnan describes his life and career as a scientist from the time he moved from India to the United States for a PhD in physics.Then, his relatively late transition to biology, all the way to his Nobel prize in Chemistry in 2009. He recounts early crystallization efforts by Ada Yonath, the crystallization of individual ribosome components and the race to get the atomic structure of the intact small subunit of the ribosome. He honestly describes the high-risk and long-term nature of projects of that scale. He captures the fear of scooping and the excitement to see structures for the first time. You see the human side of the scientific endeavor, the perception of ownership of a scientific problem if you work on it long enough, and how the recognition quotas on awards like the Nobel prize leaves out key players and can harm interdisciplinary research. If you're doing anything related to molecular life sciences, I recommend this to you highly ! "
18,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15084212-bimal-patel,4,"First of all, thank you Perseus Books for giving me this opportunity to review this book before it's publication.Almost everyone with some formal education behind them knows or have at least heard about DNA, the genetic library of our cell but how about Ribosomes? The very machinery that translates the genetic material to protein, not as glamorous as DNA right? In Gene Machine by Dr. Venki Ramakrishnan takes us on a journey that ended with discovery of structure of the ribosome to be precise it's two units 30S and 50S. Figuring out a structure of a biological molecule during the times when electron microscopy was in its infancy certainly was a challenge that was mitigated by crystallography. The book describes in details the struggles, the collaborations, the competition, the passion and above all helpful nature of fellow scientists without whom it would have taken just a little longer for this breakthrough discovery. On a personal level this is a memoir of Dr. Ramakrishnan, Indian born scientist who went on to win a Nobel price for his work on ribosome structure. Apart from the chapters dedicated to details about crystallography and extensive discussion of structure of biological molecules, he reflects on the practice of rewarding scientists it's pros and cons and how there are many new awards that compete with Nobel price such as Breakthrough award that is almost 7-8 x more financially rewarding. However, I highly doubt that anyone would trade the Nobel for any other science prize. No discovery is made in isolation and collaboration is how science develops and new inventions are made. This is no better proved anywhere else as in the case of ribosomal research. Ideas were borrowed, data obtained by someone else manipulated, research methods were copied. In the end it was a matter of right people with right skills coming in close contact that won them a Nobel. Dr. Ramakrishnan is frank in showing his gratitude to all those who helped him and it speaks volumes of the his humble nature. For me this book was interesting apart from my usual interest in science is that how Dr. Ramakrishnan who was born in the same state, Gujarat in India went on to become a grad student in physics and then changed his research to molecular biology and persisting at it for 30+ years and eventually winning a Nobel and eventually becoming president of Royal Society joining the ranks of Newton and Rutherford who were former presidents certainly gives one goosebumps. That in itself is a larger than any success story.Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history of structural biology as it applies to ribosomes. Even if you are peripherally knowledgeable of biology of subcelluar molecules, this book is worth your time. I think it will make a great gift for a grad student in biology.This book focuses on the second part (RNA → Protein) of Central Dogma (DNA → RNA → Proteins"
19,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12000072-steve,5,"Excellent memoir/history of science but technical in parts I loved this book. Author Venki Ramakrishnan tells a great story about his work on the ribosome, the part of the cell that reads the genetic code and translates it into proteins. He describes in detail the techniques used and the results. This is perhaps one weakness of the book, as Ramakrishnan used the very complex technique x-ray crystallography. I didn’t understand much of the finer details but I did understand enough to get the broad brushstrokes. To me, this isn’t a big deal, because it isn’t a huge part of the book. The book is the author’s memoir, and his stories about his family and personal life, studies, and travels are fascinating. Equally fascinating were the stories about competition in science and basically how science works. The book is well paced and Ramakrishnan held my attention from page to page, except for the occasional too-technical pages. Ultimately, Ramakrishnan’s work won the Nobel Prize but he is honest in the analysis and criticism of the process. This book is well worth reading for anyone interested in the history of science. Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book via Netgalley for review purposes."
20,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,5,"A very honest account of the race for scientific discovery. I remember venerating scientists when I was younger (in a different way then I venerate them now), and thought of them as superhuman, infallible gods. But if anything, this book shows that deep down inside, we are all emotional beings and our own self interest is often the key to propelling us to glory. As scientists work on important discoveries, many of them will selfishly hold on to facts and knowledge in an attempt to beat one another to Stockholm. I wonder how many important discoveries for human health have come later than they would have, had that not been the case. But above all, this book is a testament to human spirit and to science. For all its flaws, academic bickering, and even backstabbing, science continues to push humanity forward and it is the only “institution”, if you will, whose main tenet is the ability and responsibility to admit mistakes and try again over and over and over. Ramakrishnan is honest and vulnerable in his personal account of one such story, and I really like that he gives credit to so many people who often go unnoticed and unrecognized for their work. "

The science is wonderful and the story of how they got to deciphering the structure is fascinating. I just wish he had done a better job in actually telling the story. There are parts where he gets personal and the very next sentence is extremely technical. It was almost like he was giving me different pieces of a puzzle, but just when the picture would start to come together, he'd move on to the next puzzle. As a student of science, I appreciate every single detail mentioned in this book. As a reader, I was very underwhelmed with how the book came together."

I mean, I get what he's saying, buuuuut...it kind of comes across funny here is all.

It would have helped if the image on page 184 of 30S, a subunit of ribosome had been shown earlier to say ""this is what was being sought to reveal."" And then show (even obliquely what portion of the ribosome that was hidden in. It was not clear to me that 30S and 50S were separate components and also later on 70S.It was an enormous accomplishment to work out the molecular structure and the book outlined the history of research and the author's involvement in acheiving the goal along with colleagues, for which a Nobel Prize was rewarded.What raised this book to four stars for me was the mention of a possible other reason the third codon in DNA is usually redundant is the flexibilty it gives in toggling molecule parts. PreviouslyI had just latched onto the redundancy being protective of mutations, given most mutations occur at the third codon.Also praiseworthy was his chapter on questioning the validty of Noble prizes. It would have been appropriate to mention Rosalind Franklin missing out for her work on DNA.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosal...Here is a brief of description of ribosome that helps one appreciate its significance:https://biologydictionary.net/ribosome/"
25,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3460680-patricia,4,"Gene machine is both a memoir reminiscent of ""The Double Helix"" as well as a well-written review of the journey to resolve the structure of the ribosome. I learned new details about the ribosome including the fact that the ribosome is really a ribozyme with many RNAs participating in the catalyzing reactions of translation. Dr. Ramakrishnan gave a nice summary of the history of X-ray crystallography, as well as the best explanation I've seen on forming a crystal and what the different structural resolutions mean. He also described the amazing tricks of the trade that were used to modify the macromolecular composition of the ribosome with things like tungsten to improve the researchers' ability to resolve the structure of such a large complex (although the 30S and 50S subunits were done separately). The memoir part of the story was quite enjoyable, including the heated race to resolve the structure with sometimes unflattering side comments about his competitors, as well as his point of view on the conference call from the Nobel Award Committee. I found Dr. Ramakhrishnan's story to be much more balanced and filled with self-reflection, unlike the memoir by Dr. Watson, but I am setting the bar low here.I recommend this book for people who like proteins and RNA, wearing all black to scientific conferences, and avoiding ""being scooped"" by fellow scientists. This book also demonstrates that the world is truly a small place. A shout out the Clarence Clemons fans-- you'll see the connection if you read it."
26,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,4,"2009 Nobel Prize winner for chemistry, Venki Ramakrishnan, details in this brief yet engrossing work the process by which he came to be considered for this prize. Along the way we hear of his rocky start in physics as well as the Indian immigrant student experience from the early-mid 1970's in the US, and how it came to pass that he would eventually work in chemistry/molecular biology. While many are familiar with DNA and genes as common terms very few are familiar with his research focus, the ribosome. This component of cells, composed of two subunits, binds messenger RNA and transfer RNA and essentially takes the amino acid information found in DNA, copied and transported by RNA, and synthesizes those strings of amino acids into proteins/polypeptides. The most interesting area of this book is the competitive streak felt by the author and the several competing teams working to unravel these mysteries at the same time. Though often hinted at, the role of competition as pertains to scientific discovery is presented honestly and somewhat affectionately as he seems to suggest it as a genuinely motivating force (while also dealing magnanimously with those who shared the prize with him).

I really enjoyed learning about the researchers in this field and their work, and the inside look at an extremely competitive research area, including the infighting and politics that go with it. I also enjoyed learning about what its like to win a Nobel. Summary: Ramakrishnan grew up in India and came to the US to study physics at Ohio University and UCSD but he got interested in biological questions and ended up studying under one of James Watson's former students at Yale. Ramakrishnan then got a job at Brookhaven National Lab, then U of Utah, then moved to the LMB at Cambridge where he stayed. He worked on x ray crystalllography of protein structures and famously solved the structure of the small (30S) subunit of the ribosome. Its very difficult to form crystals of proteins and especially for the large ribosome so it was a big achievement. He talks about other researchers in the field, especially the other 2 that would share the Nobel with hi, Thomas A. Steitz and Ada E. Yonath. He takes a lot of critical digs at Ada throughout the book so it's clear they had a contentious relationship. He eventually is awarded the 2009 Nobel in Chemistry and is later elected president of the Royal Society. "

This book details the author’s journey to the Noble Prize for Chemistry and beyond but more than that he acknowledges those colleagues and friends who were instrumental in one way or another for his success and the many breakthroughs in their field. As a lay person some of the terminology and science may be a bit above my pay grade but it is laid out clearly and, while not knowing, I do understand. I enjoyed the timeline as well as the difficulty of getting from then to now; there are both serious and humorous moments that will keep a person engaged. The narrator is very good though does read rather clipped, however, the content is interesting so I didn’t let it bother me. If you are in the science field or especially if you are considering this path for your life then I urge you to listen. "

The book was a bit slow to start and also a bit scattered, however after a couple chapters it pulled itself together and the overall direction of the book started to make sense.My only real complaint was, even though he seemed to try and tone it down, the personal anomosity between Venki and Ada still seem to be a focus of far too many comments. I think most people know that not everyone plays nice, especially in a heavy competition, but the focus should have stayed on Venki and his teams story from starting the research to the final awards and 'the future'."

The writing is honest, describing the politics of awards in science and how it is difficult to make it without being in the inner circle.

Ramakrishnan is less relatable and perhaps not as self-reflective or self-aware as Jahren, but his love of the work and his wry sense of humor shines through. He also opens a door into a world few enter, even scientists, as he shines a rare candid light on the politics of working in a competitive field and of being in the running for the Nobel Prize. "

At no point were there any diagrams or pictures to help the reader. The author also (to his credit perhaps) cited virtually everyone who contributed to the research, from the most senior experts down to the undergraduates who worked in the labs for a year or two.

39,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30640144-abhijit-basu,4,"REVIEW OF VENKI RAMAKRISHNAN’S ‘GENE MACHINE’What are ribosomes? Why are they of such importance that teams of dedicated chemical and biological scientists across the world made it their lives’ mission to investigate ribosome’s inner structure over three decades since the early 1980s? The reason behind the great scientific quest is that the genetic information encoded on the DNA would have been of no use without the ribosome molecule as essential cellular processing machine to translate these instructions for making proteins, the building blocks of life. It is on this logic that the 2009 Chemistry Nobel Laureate (joint) Sir Venki Ramakrishnan calls his memoir ‘gene machine.’ Foremost among the factors that make the book so appealing to read is the author’s personal candour – about his ambition, about his professional worries and above all else, about his determination to count in the race for scientific recognition as a ‘dark horse.’ As Siddhartha Mukherjee (author of ‘Emperor of All Maladies’) puts it, his story is that of an ‘outsider’ – twice over. First, as an immigrant settling in the USA and UK, and then, as a PhD in Physics doing his life’s chosen work in molecular biology. Another quality of the book is the author’s writing style. Ramakrishnan has his own way with words and even the more technical middle chapters of the book are laced with enough humour and witty anecdotes to keep interest alive. He is a master of metaphor too – making complex science understandable to lay readers with simple examples. After putting things scientifically – that the ribosome, a ‘giant’ molecule with over a million atoms (still small enough to pack 4000 in the width of a human hair), is the link between our genes and the proteins they specify, he makes the point that understanding how it works will depend on how it structurally looks. He then drives home the importance of that knowing and understanding by a simple allegory. Imagine you are a Martian peering down at earth, he says. You observe tiny objects moving straight or occasionally turning. Look little closer and you find movement happens only when tinier moving things enter those objects. Driven by curiosity, you want to see how the objects are constructed. You find that it is made of numerous working parts, including an engine connected to a crankshaft that makes the wheels turn. You look even closer to find that the engine itself has pistons and sucks in fuel and air that is ignited with a spark plug to drive the piston forward. It is the same with understanding molecules that make life. Understanding DNA and RNA molecules was a big step. But cracking the jigsaw puzzle needed understanding of how the ‘enormous’ ribosomes were constructed which enabled them to decode the DNA information of nucleotide sequence carried by messenger RNAs ‘to stitch together amino acids brought by transfer RNAs into protein.’ Importantly, the author also explains how, by knowing the structure and components of the bacterial ribosome, the work has opened up avenues to development of new antibiotics.It is an engaging story about the agonies and ecstasies, about the disappointments and lucky breaks of ‘rival’ scientists competing in a race for success. The pursuit of success is often made tense by an atmosphere surcharged with ‘politics for recognition.’ At the same time there is cooperation too among the community of scientists, helped by seminars, conferences and mutual discussions which enable cross-pollination of ideas. Ramakrishnan attributes this competitive cooperation to the ‘inbred’ nature of modern scientific discoveries. The 2009 Chemistry Nobel Prize was awarded jointly to three persons. Ada Yonath from Israel was the first to make headway in ribosome crystallisation and kept at it with dogged application for decades. Then there was Tom Steitz, American biochemist and a leading crystallographer of his generation, who, in collaboration with Peter Moore, effectively began the last lap of the race by publishing the atomic structure of the larger (50S) ribosomal subunit. Finally, there was Venki Ramakrishnan, an ‘accidental ribosome biologist’ and a latecomer to the field, who caught up with the others by leading his energetic team of bright postdoc and student associates working round the clock across their trans-Atlantic divide at Cambridge and Utah to achieve high-resolution ‘crystal’ structure of the smaller (30S) ribosome subunit (and later the entire (70S) ribosome, throwing light on the code translation process and on the mechanism of blocking action exploited by antibiotics). Yet, as candidly acknowledged by the author, there were other key contributors who got regrettably left out of Nobel recognition due to the ‘three-recipient limitation’ of the prize. Moreover, as Ramakrishnan himself alludes to in the book’s epilogue, while he and the two others received the recognition for their pioneering work in using crystallography to explore ribosome, with subsequent advancement in electron microscopy, a more direct method allowing higher resolution is now available to investigate organelle structure. The epilogue also contains an endearingly modest, even bordering on philosophical, reflection by the author, in the context of the flood of honours and awards that he received following the ‘Nobel Lottery’, as he calls it, echoing Francis Crick. Referencing the Bible, he cites Matthew 13.12: 'For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.' As already mentioned, the book has quite a few comical anecdotes to liven up things. For instance, there is the story of how Pat Unwin and Carlos Taddei worked at obtaining two-dimensional protein crystals from lizard ovary cells in 1977—the first demonstration that ribosomes were indeed crystallizable. The maverick Taddei was given to insouciantly puffing at his cigar in the lab and regularly setting off the fire alarms. After some time, the experiment was abandoned as the crystals were found not good enough to reveal a detailed atomic arrangement. The unchaperoned lizards left in the basement escaped and were to be seen scampering around the grounds of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology for years thereafter. Another interesting anecdote relates to the author’s two encounters with James Watson. On both occasions, the brash and acerbic American geneticist made light of Ramakrishnan’s labours, saying, ‘Forget the Nobel.’ However, the same Watson was seen attending a lecture by Ramakrishnan and later dispelling Ramakrishnan’s apprehensions by approving his selection as a Nobel Committee expert for the coveted Prize.A COMPARISONIn my personal view as a one-time researcher in Chemistry and a lover of good literature, ‘Gene Machine’ is a thrilling story of a down-to-earth scientist’s quest in a niche area of research holding promise for a clearer understanding of the secrets of life and of better ways to treat complicated maladies. In comparison with other genre books written by Nobel Laureate scientists, I would rate the book in the ‘very good’ category, with a four stars grade. ‘The Double Helix’ (1968) – James Watson’s brilliant account of decoding the DNA – gets ‘excellent’ rating with five stars to boot. But at the top rung of my assessment would be ‘Order out of Chaos’ (1984) – a deeply thought-provoking account of the philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics and its theory of entropy or universal tendency towards disorderliness – written by Ilya Prigogine, 1977 Physical Chemistry Nobel Laureate and his co-author, scientific philosopher Isabelle Stengers. That book, with its readability value and profound philosophical contents, should merit a super-excellent six-star rating almost at par with Erwin Schrödinger’s 1943 book, ‘What is Life?’ Of course, Schrödinger’s book, being an amazingly prophetic foray by a Quantum Physicist into the chemical-biological secret of life’s ‘code script’ is of a different class because it transcends the borders of the scientist’s own Nobel-winning work. Yet all said and done, ‘Gene Machine’, with its insights into the pleasures and pains of the race for scientific recognition, certainly deserves a place of its own at these commanding heights of scientific literature."
40,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43858998-linda-gaines,2,"I'm rather disappointed with this book. First I was really interested in learning about the ribosome and how it functions was discovered. I do feel like I learned a bit, but I really don't understand the different techniques they used to understand how it works. I just don't think it was explained well. Secondly, this book needed a better editor. I understand it was a personal story of the author's career and how the various scientists interacted, but it went off on far too many tangents such that I got lost. So many people were introduced, but only superficially, that I completely forgot who most of them were by the end of the chapter. Also, near the beginning the author talks about the discovery of the structure of DNA and never once mentions Rosalind Franklin, which was a particularly glaring omission. Then halfway through the book, she in mentioned with regards to people who used to be in her lab, and he never explains who she was and what she did for science and DNA. Not once. Perhaps I should blame the editor and not the author for that. In any event, the book needed a better editor."

The lab techniques are difficult to follow at best, even for someone with a science background. Every now and then there are revealing bits of information as to what was discovered. There is a place for this type of writing, but it just didn't hold my interest. What did strike me is how complex the research world is. Collaboration and competition go hand in hand - not an easy pair to balance! Also, many many people, sometimes over generations, are often involved in these major breakthroughs. I understand the need to recognize them and regret that I just wasn't able to take all of those individual stories in."
42,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52557863-grrlscientist,4,"What it is really like to be a scientist, especially a scientist who has been awarded the “most nobel” scientific prize of all?Written by 2009 co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Venkatraman “Venki” Ramakrishnan, an American and British structural biologist who grew up in India, 
Gene Machine: The race to decipher the secrets of the ribosome
 (Basic Books; 2018) is an engaging account of one man’s many scientific contributions to solve the structure of the ribosome, a small structure that is the workhorse of the cell, building the proteins necessary for life.The author begins his story in India, where he studied physics before immigrating to the United States to earn his doctorate in physics. During this time, he met and married — a major life event served to refocus his attention on how to successfully provide for his family as a working scientist. Confronted with a lifetime of “boring and incremental calculations that wouldn’t result in any real advance in understanding”, Dr. Ramakrishnan took a big risk and abruptly shifted his career focus to molecular biology after reading an article about the ribosome in Scientific American. To do this, he spent two years as a grad student in molecular biology at UCSD, gaining essential knowledge and skills necessary to pursue his new career.Because electron microscopy was in its infancy during most of this work, this meant that an older technique, x-ray crystallography, was the main tool used to decipher the structure of the ribosome. But x-ray crystallography created fuzzier, less detailed images than electron microscopy, so this led to the field being informally known as “blobology”.Despite disappointments and setbacks in his second career, Dr. Ramakrishnan persisted for more than 30 years before being awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, being named president of the Royal Society of London, the world’s oldest scientific society and then being knighted in the 2012. (He does not generally use the honorific ‘Sir’.)In this book, Dr. Ramakrishnan clearly explains the science, and highlights the sometimes convoluted process of how science actually works. He details the inside story of lab life including the struggles, failures and blind alleys, the collaborators and friends, the professional competitors and rivals, and the timely and critically important help provided by a number of scientists, as Dr. Ramakrishnan and his team worked tirelessly to solve the structure of this microscopic biological machine. As the story of the author’s professional life unfolds, we learn how a scientist develops the ideas, skills, tools — and the people, along with all the quirks and talents that each one embodies — that are essential to achieve such a remarkable scientific discovery.This profoundly human story is written with honesty and humility, and the author isn’t afraid to laugh at himself. For example, his story about the phone call in October was amusing, and he even shares his wife’s incredulous response when she first learned he had won the Nobel Prize: “I thought you had to be really smart to win one of those!” (Ramakrishnan 237).One element of this story that impressed me most was Dr. Ramakrishnan’s unfailing generosity to his collaborators and his competitors alike. In fact, one of the key themes in this book is that most contemporary science is not about individual achievement; rather, it’s a synthesis of ideas and progress by teams of highly dedicated individuals who devote their lives to solving questions they find compelling.At the end of the book, Dr. Ramakrishnan ponders the nature of science: “When we have a clear goal in mind, we think we are struggling to reach a summit. But there is no summit. When we get there, we realize we have just climbed a foothill, and there is an endless series of mountains ahead still to be climbed.” (Ramakrishnan 256).The author devotes the Epilogue to present some thoughts on the influence (both good and bad) of Truly Big Prizes, particularly the Nobel and the Breakthrough Prizes, upon scientific careers and scientific progress:“So I don’t subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even that much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We humans tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible. And when someone like Newton or Einstein sees much further than others, or Watson and Crick synthesize in one stroke the essential features of DNA that might have dribbled out in pieces, we tend to immortalize them.” (Ramakrishnan 264).This lucid and highly readable account will be enjoyed by students in any of the sciences, by those interested in the history of science, or who love reading memoirs. But really, I think that anyone who is captivated by an absorbing story well told will find much to appreciate in this fascinating book.NOTE: Originally published at Forbes on 30 November 2018.

46,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"Venki Ramakrishnan’s book is the story of the race to understand the structure and workings of the ribosome, and his part in that. He comes across as a modest, self-deprecating person, able to reveal his weaknesses as well as his strengths, and someone who is generous in acknowledging the contributions of others. As with many scientists of great aptitude, he lacks arrogance and at times comes across as quite diffident as to his abilities, fearing that others are better qualified than he is to solve this puzzle. His book does a wonderful job of conveying the combination of friendliness and rivalry that accompanies any scientific contest, no more so than when solving a problem of this importance. The journey is a roller coaster where one day his team seems to be ahead of his rivals, and the next a paper is published that suggests they are behind. He successfully expresses how his emotions rose and sank, as he continually tried to figure out where he was in relation to others in the race. In some respects, the book reminds me of The Double Helix by James Watson which recounts a similar, frantic rush to beat the competition to establish the structure of an important biological molecule. A chapter I found fascinating was one where Ramakrishnan discussed the politics of scientific awards, including the Nobel Prize, arguing that the system can become a closed-club where the same scientists repeatedly win prestigious honours. He was particularly critical of Nobel Prizes, writing: “Because many of the early Nobel laureates were giants in their field, the idea has taken hold – especially among non-scientists – that Nobel laureates are geniuses. In fact, the prize is not awarded for being a great scientist but rather for making a groundbreaking discovery or invention. Some of them may be extraordinarily brilliant, but others are just good scientists who were persistent or happened to stumble onto a major finding. Being in the right place at the right time often helped enormously”. He also blasted the rule that limits the number of winners to three. This may have been appropriate a century ago, but nowadays it doesn’t reflect the collaboration, intentional or otherwise, that marks most major scientific advances.He also writes about what he calls post-Nobelitis. As he puts it: “Suddenly, scientists are thrust into the limelight and bask in the public adulation that goes with it. They are asked for their opinion on everything under the sun, regardless of their own expertise, and it soon goes to their head. Some of them are long past their prime, having made their big discoveries decades earlier, and the renewed attention means that they spend their time wandering around the world, pontificating about all sorts of things”. Ramakrishnan knew that solving the mystery of the ribosome was worthy of a Nobel Prize but, with the rule of three in mind, he honestly admits that “I started worrying about my relative contribution and whether I would be perceived as a Johnny-come-lately rather than a pioneer”.Despite his cynicism about how the system works, Ramakrishnan comes across as extremely ambitious and someone who spent a lot of time fretting whether he would miss out on this ultimate scientific accolade. Would the ribosome really merit an award? And, if so, which three of the numerous scientists involved during something like 20 years of research would be named on the citation? A criticism I have of the book is that so many scientists are named that it is easy to lose track of who did what, where and when. Unfortunately, there is no index so when a name reappears there is no simple way of tracing when he or she was first mentioned. Furthermore, after they have been first introduced, Ramakrishnan often refers to scientists only by their first names, and the text is littered with references to Tom, Dick (actually Richard!) and Harry, which means that even having an index would be of limited value as an aide memoire. Perhaps a cast list might be better.Based on his personal experience, Ramakrishnan provides lots of interesting details about the mechanism of announcing and then awarding the Nobel Prizes. No doubt like many other recipients have been, he was very suspicious when he received the phone call from Sweden informing him that he’d won. Also, curiously, he tells us that the banquet after the ceremony is televised and shown live in Sweden. But he comments: “I wouldn’t have thought spending the evening watching a group of strangers eat would make for much drama, but there were speeches and entertainment”.The book is quite technical in places, notably in terms of crystallographic techniques. Nonetheless, it is not necessary to understand the details in order to enjoy this book because this is an account of how the race for a Nobel Prize is won, or, more often, lost. And therein lies the focus of the book."
47,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107551528-shweata-n,5,"Science is often thought to be done by scientists who isolate themselves in a cocoon and come out with a breakthrough and fly like a butterfly. But this is far far from the realities of academia. 'Gene Machine' brilliantly portraits the competitive nature of science. The book is successful in making us realize that breakthroughs that come about in science are often driven by competition amongst peers, which is quite contrary to what is perceived by the ones outside of academia. The author begins his career in academia and is up for a rather shaky start with several ups and downs, finally deciding to switch fields from being a theoretical physicist to a biologist. In the book, he goes on to give an honest account of his academic career, making bold remarks about various events and people, along the way. Also, his descriptions do not fail to capture the competitiveness in science which often isn't touched upon by many. Not to mention, Venki Ramakrishnan has also done a great job in elucidating some of the complex and technical concepts of ribosomes, proteins, crystallography and others. He has done it in such a way that it is easy for anyone with any/no prior knowledge of the subject to understand the concepts and the limitation in our understanding of it. I felt that the analogies he used, especially the car one to help us realize the limitations in understanding of ribosome,were really simple yet amazing.One thing that was consistent throughout the book was that he consistently acknowledged the fact that he was really lucky and had the right set of people and ideas to make that breakthrough. His first breakthrough comes when his team is able to decipher the structure of the 30S structure of the ribosome. Then they go on to solve the atomic structure of the whole ribosome.And finally, he isn't afraid of discussing about the fact that the idea of prizes and awards. He remarks that ""Nevertheless, scientists are only human. Like everyone else, we can be ambitious and competitive and crave recognition. Instead of inculcating a feeling that the work is its own reward, the scientific establishment feeds this desire to feel special and somehow better than our peers at virtually every stage of the process"". This sort of encompassed the idea of awards are flawed yet people tend to associate high value to it and it is the intrinsic nature of humans to do so. He also goes on to criticize the Nobel prize because it's only awarded to three people in a field each year. This doesn't hold good with the fact that scientific discoveries are usually bought out by a group not a single person and therefore it doesn't make sense to give it to just three people. However, he wins the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009 along with his competitors Ada and Tom.In the epilogue, he says: "" I don't subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible"". I think this sort of sums up my views on science too. ( I must confess that he has phrased it so well, I could never have done that!)In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it who wants to know what 'real' science works and who wants to know the realities of being in academia."
48,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,4,"Nobel Laurate Venki Ramakrishnan’s first book is about his experiences in the race to elucidate the structure of ribosome. I had read an excerpt from this book earlier, where he talked about how winning a Nobel prize may not be the best thing for the scientist and how prizes, at times can be unfair. I liked it very much and was keen on reading the whole book. I finally got the chance after borrowing a copy from a friend.The book starts out with his experiences as a student of physics and his almost accidental entry into biology. It then covers his postdoctoral work that got him interested in ribosomes in the first place followed by his incredible journey across America and then to MRC, Cambridge, which was across the ocean. The book is mostly a personal account, focusing on his experiences and the struggles he and his lab went through. It eventually culminates with his winning the prize and the Nobel prize ceremony. I found the book highly additive and an easy read. Ramakrishnan has done a really nice job of explaining the challenges he faced. Especially, the part on x-ray crystallography is so well written that even someone like me, who runs away from these techniques could understand it. As someone who is in academia, what I liked most about the book though is the honesty and frankness with which the story has been narrated. He has been open about all the politics surrounding the whole ribosome community and science in general. He has also not shied away from his own competitiveness, secrecy and prejudice. Another great point is that he has acknowledged the work of his lab members because in the end, the success is as much theirs as his. After reading this book, I came to know of quite a few things. For instance, in the scientific community, the present trend has been towards doing more collaborative work. However, it has not been the case always. When scientists compete with each other for the same thing as was the case with the ribosome structure, things can at times become ugly. Overall, it may or may not turn to be good for science overall. However, in this case, the ending was happy and the efforts of all those involved lead to an addition of our understanding of one of the fundamental phenomena of nature.Finally, I would say that this book has been an enjoyable read. I think it is definitely a must read for every biologist!"
49,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46231899-laurie89,5," The ‘Gene Machine’ is a fascinating account of Venki Ramakrishnan’s path to uncovering the structure of the ribosome, which resulted in his receiving the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The cast of characters and places in this narrative are truly captivating and provide a cross-sectional view of the scientific life. The book provides insight into how successful scientific careers are forged. The starting point is Dr Ramakrishnan’s journey from India to a Ph.D program in physics at Ohio University. After obtaining a Ph.D. the author poignantly describes his decision to switch fields to biology and how this naturally led him to structural biology. A striking inclusion in this story are the descriptions of the self-doubt and the reasoning behind each change in position; from UC San Diego to Yale, Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island to Oak Ridge National laboratory Tennessee, Utah and finally the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. The author finds the right balance in describing the science and the important roles that his colleagues, mentors and students played. Ultimately the depictions of his laboratory and the research environment provide the reader with a taste of what is involved in a successful competitive scientific career. The humility of the author shines throughout the story.  The heart of the narrative focuses on the race to reveal the structure of the ribosome, which manufactures proteins from the genetic code. While the ribosome is often overlooked by the general public, it is of utmost importance the functioning of all cellular life. The expository includes the history of ribosome and the genetic code, basic biology and the basic techniques in x-ray crystallography. The true break-through in structural biology that was necessary to realize the high resolution images is less clear. It would have greatly helped if there had been an appendix to describe this part of the science so that the readers could have also understand this important context. The book is also lacking an index and a more detailed bibliography of the resulting scientific articles.  This skillful memoir, which is fast paced and reads like a novel, is likely to become a scientific classic about the competition at the cutting edge of science. "
50,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42307468-siddharth-saravanan,3,"This book had 3 distinct phases for me. 1st phase regarding his emigration to the US and his subsequent foray into different aspects of Science was engaging, especially the way in which the author almost accidentally stumbled upon something which would turn out to be his lifelong goal! //Made me reflect on the fact that we need to be open in trying out different aspects of a particular field/life in order to land on something which we feel passionate towards dedicating a major portion of our lives 2nd phase covers the methods used by the author and the madcap race to cross the finishing line before anybody else. Although I'm a student of Biology, most of the science flew over my head because it dealt with techniques like crystallography, X-ray diffraction etc. which I have little idea about. The race to discover the structure is fascinating, but we'll have to wade through multiple scientific techniques and dozens of names and contributions from different people involved in the process, which can be quite hard.//Found it fascinating how so many different people are involved in the process. Though it makes the reading hard, really loved how the author credited every single person involved in the mammoth race! 3rd phase, and the best phase, talks about the ecosystem of prizes and the very hit-and-miss nature of them. We as a society have glorified the Nobel Prize, and rightly so. However it was illuminating reading about how the Nobel isn't all encompassing and is flawed in quite a few ways, along with the numerous other scientific prizes. Gave me a lot of perspective on the nature of credit, and the unfairness which is intrinsic in the whole process//(Brownie points for the statement that ethnic and ultra nationalistic pride is the opposite of racism and xenophobia. Rang true within me)"
51,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,2,"Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most difficult to answer. One such is that of how many Indians have won the Nobel Prize so far. The figure can be as high as twelve, if you count Ronald Ross, Rudyard Kipling, Dalai Lama, V S Naipaul and Mother Teresa. Some or of Indian origin, or been born in India or left India too early in their career. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan was a graduate of Physics from Baroda but immediately migrated to the US for further studies. He won the Nobel in Chemistry in 2009 for ribosome research along with two others. Ramakrishnan’s research strengthened our understanding of the fundamental processes of life and provided a clue to the evolution of modern species of life. This book is a combination of popular science and an autobiography with a seamless blending of the two. His life is devoted to research and learning.We know that our genetic material is locked up in a structure called DNA inside the nucleus of each of our cells. Apart from heredity, these contain recipes for building proteins which are essential for life. Insulin, adrenaline and albumin are all proteins required to sustain the organism. What makes these proteins inside a cell is a molecular gene-machine called ribosome. This machine reads the component list from data derived from the DNA and assembles the protein using amino acids just like a production line. The critical nature of the process need not be emphasized further, as the animal will soon be dead if the pathways are somehow clogged. Virtually every molecule in every cell in every form of life is either made by the ribosome or made by enzymes that are themselves made by ribosomes. Discovery of ribosomes and its role in making protein is the culmination of one of the great triumphs in modern biology. This was by no means easy as the ribosome is not a simple molecule like DNA. It was enormous and complex. The attempt to decipher it was taken up by Crick and Watson, who found the structure of DNA but was abandoned in despair.Ramakrishnan was attracted to ribosomes by an article in the magazine Scientific American. He knew practically nothing of biology which he made up through courses studied part-time. Thus we have a physicist who studied the structure of a crucial biological unit being awarded with a Nobel in chemistry! He attempted to solve the ribosome structure first by neutron scattering which was eventually proved ineffective but was well understood by people with a physics background. The author dwells at length on the step by step progress in revealing the structure and the race with other scientists doing similar work, but this is not in a form that can be easily digested by ordinary readers. I found it extremely tedious especially after reading Siddhartha Mukherjee’s great book ‘The Gene - An Intimate History’ a few weeks before. Of course, you cannot expect such lucidity from a Nobel laureate, but the pertinent fact is that almost all of the readers are not Nobel laureates themselves. It is only during the autobiographical passages that the book becomes even slightly interesting.Study of ribosomes is important in learning how medicines cure us of diseases. Some antibiotics work by blocking the protein creation function of bacterial ribosomes. This is done by binding to a vulnerable location in its structure. Since bacterial and human ribosomes are very different, humans will not be adversely affected by the mechanism of its action. This study also casts light on the dark alleyways of early evolution. Building blocks of RNA can be made from simple chemicals that could have been around in the earth billions of years ago. It may be possible that life emerged with lots of randomly made RNA molecules until some of them could reproduce entirely by themselves. RNA could also preserve heredity between generations.This book presents some valid advice to novices in scientific research. The author asks them not to be hesitant to ask questions, however basic it might be. He justifies it by claiming that no question is too stupid to ask if you want to know the answer. It is also a bare necessity for present-day researchers to belong to the top-line institutes and laboratories. Advanced science has now become a team effort transcending national frontiers and continental boundaries. The members of the theoretical and testing facilities should be known to each other, otherwise it would be difficult to obtain and manage precious time allocated for using sophisticated machines.The author makes a short but pointed criticism of the Nobel award conventions. There is a ‘Rule of Three’ in force. This means that the award, if shared, shall not be divided into more than three parts. This criterion is claimed to be impractical now. When the prize started in 1901, scientists worked in relative isolation and met only once every few years. By the time they announced their results, there was no question of who had discovered what. In the current world, an idea quickly spreads and a lot of people contribute to it in various measures and capacities. And it is not always clear whether the original idea or a later contribution was the truly ground breaking advance. It is a difficult task to select three people from a crowd of somewhat equal contributors without causing resentment or heartburn.Ramakrishnan left India very early and harbours no soft spots in his mind for the mother country. Ignorant of his real feelings, thousands of naïve Indians sent congratulatory emails to him upon winning the Nobel. This clogged his inbox and they received a curt reminder that ‘nationality was an accident of birth’ and by corollary, he does not attach much importance to it. This is a clear case of brain drain.The narrative about the role and secrets of ribosomes is disappointingly matter-of-fact. The author has failed to share the awe he might have felt in revealing the heretofore hidden details. The scientist’s idea of a paper for publishing in a journal is too far away from an ordinary reader’s preference of what is interesting. The book is a veritable Who’s Who of the rapidly growing field of structural biology in general and ribosomes in particular. The author has had a great collaboration with like-minded scholars from across the globe. There are many photographs of co-workers and even rivals. The illustrations given as part of the description are not at all helpful. Relevance has not been a parameter for inclusion as we even see a conceptual diagram of a four-stroke internal combustion engine as part of the narrative.The book is recommended only to serious readers."
52,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"I want sure what I got myself into when I picked up this book, but I can definitely say that it was well worth the read. While the book is focused primarily on figuring out the structure of the ribosome, the story Venki shares about his entrance into this particular field in science, the people he's met and worked with, and what came about from all of his work is very informative. We often hear about the accomplishment of folks like Venki, but rarely get a glimpse of what they went through to get there, this book covers that and more.Upon completing the book, I was left with two lingering thoughts, the first was I had no idea what he was talking about towards the later half of the book. Venki writes, in great detail the vast test, processes, and failures he went through to finally generate crystals that could be used to decipher the ribosome. These chapters were difficult to follow for a layman like myself, but I stuck with it. If he took the time to explain his work of many years, the least I could do is spend a couple hours reading about it.The second thought, was that I do not think there was a single person Venki left out of his story that did not have a direct or indirect influence on his project. He went out of his way to talk about a lot of people who pioneered earlier discoveries into crystallizing molecules, mentors who encouraged him to push the boundaries, peers who kept him in check, and students who brought in new fresh ideas to the problem so hand. This is the part of the book I really enjoyed, the simple act of a person who accomplished something significant, giving recognition were it was due."
53,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15971935-mark-stidham,4,"This was a fun read for me because of its subject matter (the elucidation of the structure of the ribosome). It could be of broader interest because it is a first person account of the life of a scientist in a competitive race to solve a scientific question. As a biochemist almost the same age as the author, I related to the story arc, even though there isn't much similarity in our careers. There is the struggle to find a niche, long investments in study and techniques that end up being useless, and frustrating search for job stability. This particular story is similar to others that feature competitive research and the need to obtain respect from peers. The author spends a good amount of time explaining the benefits and the downsides to the science community hierarchy epitomized by the competition for the Nobel Prize. That Ramakrishnan won a share of the prize is evidence of some objectivity in the process. But overall, the Prize seems more of a club.I was unable to pay attention to this particular race to find the structure of the ribosome, and the book should not be viewed as any more than an introduction to that subject. I look forward to learning the details in the scholarly papers. But it should be mentioned that this incredible biological machine was completely misunderstood not too long ago. It is humbling that such a fundamental process is only now being elucidated, and it shows that there are many more astonishing aspects of our biochemistry to be discovered in the future"

During these tumultuous times, one must stay strong by being sane and there is no more powerful refuge of sanity than books. Thankfully I had packed 3 of them when I had to leave for my emergency service. I finished the first one just last evening. I don't read books on the history of science much often, and had picked up 'Gene Machine' on the recommendations of one of my buddies. This one is Venki Ramakrishnan's side of the fascinating story of how the structure and functions of Ribosome, a cellular organelle, were discovered and how the long journey over decades lead to the Nobel Prize for the author and his two main competitors. The hard work behind every discovery, the cooperation and competition between scientists, the jealousy between them, the politics of awards and their after effects is delved on in detail. The book is a repository of knowledge on biology, which however has been tiring for me as biology was never my favourite subject. In our country, the lives of scientists are never that well discussed except some few like Einstein, Bose, Newton, Meghnad Saha and Jagdish Chandra Bose. This book will be a happy addition to that small grouping. The story of how the structure and functions of the Ribosome, the organelle that synthesizes proteins, and lays the building blocks of life, were explained before the world, is truly an engaging one."
55,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104610180-aquila-michiryu,4,"In Gene Machine, Venki Ramakrishnan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, recounts his scientific journey of unraveling the structure of the ribosome and its biological mysteries. More than that, he honestly reveals the politics and competition present in the realm of science, and how various factors such as luck, personalities, jealousy, money and the desire for awards can all inextricably influence the potential for success as a scientist. He also shares his views on the Nobel Prize (and his experience of winning the prize) and how there is subjectivity present when the panel decides who the prize should be awarded to.As a biology student, I learnt about the ribosome when I studied about the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome. At that time, I didn’t place much thought on how the information in my lecture notes came about. How did scientists find out about the structures of the various components in the cell? And specifically, how did they know what function each component played? Admittedly, these questions rarely crossed my mind when I was a student then, since I didn’t want to waste time ruminating on whatever wasn’t in the syllabus at that time.Reading this book has revealed the “behind-the-scenes” of the scientific discovery of ribosome and I realised that I have underestimated the amount of time and effort these scientists have spent to glean the knowledge we can now comfortably obtain. Moreover, I appreciate the author’s objective revelation about the presence of politics and competition in the scientific community, including how the highly-respected Nobel Prize can be subjective and fallible, things I didn’t hear about previously.Having said that, I can expect readers unfamiliar with the ribosome to not appreciate this book as much due to its scientific nature (though the author tries to simplify the highly scientific details to make it easier for general readers to understand). I had to research on X-Ray Crystallography to find out exactly how it works as it was only briefly mentioned in the book.If you know what the ribosome is, this is an insightful and enlightening book to read!"
56,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90507383-mahin,5,"My friends who aren’t in STEM are incredulous to find out how hyper-competitive (and cut-throat) research can be. Science is viewed as incorruptible. But that doesn’t mean that scientists are necessarily paragons of rationality or truth; sometimes, they guard their knowledge and results out of fear that a peer will ""scoop"" them. In spite of this, science is a collaborative process by necessity. In Gene Machine, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan shares his perspective on the race to discover the ribosome’s structure. He also shares his experiences as an outsider; first as a physicist by training who belatedly discovered his interest in biology and second as an Indian immigrant to the US, where he often lived in majority-white towns (in Ohio and Utah). As a biochemist, I found that Venki explained his research in a way that is accessible to those who aren't scientists (or even biologists). As a result, I found myself skimming over descriptions of DNA, RNA, and other elementary biological concepts; but I appreciated their inclusion for readers who may have forgotten or don't have that knowledge. Another reviewer remarked that you wouldn't expect a book about the discovery of the ribosome's structure to be so gripping, an assessment with which I agree. I think Gene Machine will prove to be one of the best science books to be published in 2018."

That is to say, it follows the well-trodden path of 
The Double Helix
. It definitely gets a lot more hard-science than other books in that vein, though; I found some of the technical details about the ribosome hard to follow here, but I admit the problem may well have been that I had to put down the book for a couple of months halfway through and in the interim forgot the intricacies that he'd introduced earlier.

He honestly describes the pitfalls and limitations of Nobel (or any recognition). It helps to put the awards and recognition in perspective. Many times mind tricks us in thinking award as the aim. This book can tell you how random the selection actually is! It is not exactly correlated with the work you do, work is ofcourse important but there are other dominant factors which no one can control.Concluding -For scientists - must readOthers can safely skip.

Ramakrishnan is less relatable and perhaps not as self-reflective or self-aware as Jahren, but his love of the work and his wry sense of humor shines through.

69,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30640144-abhijit-basu,4,"REVIEW OF VENKI RAMAKRISHNAN’S ‘GENE MACHINE’What are ribosomes? Why are they of such importance that teams of dedicated chemical and biological scientists across the world made it their lives’ mission to investigate ribosome’s inner structure over three decades since the early 1980s? The reason behind the great scientific quest is that the genetic information encoded on the DNA would have been of no use without the ribosome molecule as essential cellular processing machine to translate these instructions for making proteins, the building blocks of life. It is on this logic that the 2009 Chemistry Nobel Laureate (joint) Sir Venki Ramakrishnan calls his memoir ‘gene machine.’ Foremost among the factors that make the book so appealing to read is the author’s personal candour – about his ambition, about his professional worries and above all else, about his determination to count in the race for scientific recognition as a ‘dark horse.’ As Siddhartha Mukherjee (author of ‘Emperor of All Maladies’) puts it, his story is that of an ‘outsider’ – twice over. First, as an immigrant settling in the USA and UK, and then, as a PhD in Physics doing his life’s chosen work in molecular biology. Another quality of the book is the author’s writing style. Ramakrishnan has his own way with words and even the more technical middle chapters of the book are laced with enough humour and witty anecdotes to keep interest alive. He is a master of metaphor too – making complex science understandable to lay readers with simple examples. After putting things scientifically – that the ribosome, a ‘giant’ molecule with over a million atoms (still small enough to pack 4000 in the width of a human hair), is the link between our genes and the proteins they specify, he makes the point that understanding how it works will depend on how it structurally looks. He then drives home the importance of that knowing and understanding by a simple allegory. Imagine you are a Martian peering down at earth, he says. You observe tiny objects moving straight or occasionally turning. Look little closer and you find movement happens only when tinier moving things enter those objects. Driven by curiosity, you want to see how the objects are constructed. You find that it is made of numerous working parts, including an engine connected to a crankshaft that makes the wheels turn. You look even closer to find that the engine itself has pistons and sucks in fuel and air that is ignited with a spark plug to drive the piston forward. It is the same with understanding molecules that make life. Understanding DNA and RNA molecules was a big step. But cracking the jigsaw puzzle needed understanding of how the ‘enormous’ ribosomes were constructed which enabled them to decode the DNA information of nucleotide sequence carried by messenger RNAs ‘to stitch together amino acids brought by transfer RNAs into protein.’ Importantly, the author also explains how, by knowing the structure and components of the bacterial ribosome, the work has opened up avenues to development of new antibiotics.It is an engaging story about the agonies and ecstasies, about the disappointments and lucky breaks of ‘rival’ scientists competing in a race for success. The pursuit of success is often made tense by an atmosphere surcharged with ‘politics for recognition.’ At the same time there is cooperation too among the community of scientists, helped by seminars, conferences and mutual discussions which enable cross-pollination of ideas. Ramakrishnan attributes this competitive cooperation to the ‘inbred’ nature of modern scientific discoveries. The 2009 Chemistry Nobel Prize was awarded jointly to three persons. Ada Yonath from Israel was the first to make headway in ribosome crystallisation and kept at it with dogged application for decades. Then there was Tom Steitz, American biochemist and a leading crystallographer of his generation, who, in collaboration with Peter Moore, effectively began the last lap of the race by publishing the atomic structure of the larger (50S) ribosomal subunit. Finally, there was Venki Ramakrishnan, an ‘accidental ribosome biologist’ and a latecomer to the field, who caught up with the others by leading his energetic team of bright postdoc and student associates working round the clock across their trans-Atlantic divide at Cambridge and Utah to achieve high-resolution ‘crystal’ structure of the smaller (30S) ribosome subunit (and later the entire (70S) ribosome, throwing light on the code translation process and on the mechanism of blocking action exploited by antibiotics). Yet, as candidly acknowledged by the author, there were other key contributors who got regrettably left out of Nobel recognition due to the ‘three-recipient limitation’ of the prize. Moreover, as Ramakrishnan himself alludes to in the book’s epilogue, while he and the two others received the recognition for their pioneering work in using crystallography to explore ribosome, with subsequent advancement in electron microscopy, a more direct method allowing higher resolution is now available to investigate organelle structure. The epilogue also contains an endearingly modest, even bordering on philosophical, reflection by the author, in the context of the flood of honours and awards that he received following the ‘Nobel Lottery’, as he calls it, echoing Francis Crick. Referencing the Bible, he cites Matthew 13.12: 'For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.' As already mentioned, the book has quite a few comical anecdotes to liven up things. For instance, there is the story of how Pat Unwin and Carlos Taddei worked at obtaining two-dimensional protein crystals from lizard ovary cells in 1977—the first demonstration that ribosomes were indeed crystallizable. The maverick Taddei was given to insouciantly puffing at his cigar in the lab and regularly setting off the fire alarms. After some time, the experiment was abandoned as the crystals were found not good enough to reveal a detailed atomic arrangement. The unchaperoned lizards left in the basement escaped and were to be seen scampering around the grounds of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology for years thereafter. Another interesting anecdote relates to the author’s two encounters with James Watson. On both occasions, the brash and acerbic American geneticist made light of Ramakrishnan’s labours, saying, ‘Forget the Nobel.’ However, the same Watson was seen attending a lecture by Ramakrishnan and later dispelling Ramakrishnan’s apprehensions by approving his selection as a Nobel Committee expert for the coveted Prize.A COMPARISONIn my personal view as a one-time researcher in Chemistry and a lover of good literature, ‘Gene Machine’ is a thrilling story of a down-to-earth scientist’s quest in a niche area of research holding promise for a clearer understanding of the secrets of life and of better ways to treat complicated maladies. In comparison with other genre books written by Nobel Laureate scientists, I would rate the book in the ‘very good’ category, with a four stars grade. ‘The Double Helix’ (1968) – James Watson’s brilliant account of decoding the DNA – gets ‘excellent’ rating with five stars to boot. But at the top rung of my assessment would be ‘Order out of Chaos’ (1984) – a deeply thought-provoking account of the philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics and its theory of entropy or universal tendency towards disorderliness – written by Ilya Prigogine, 1977 Physical Chemistry Nobel Laureate and his co-author, scientific philosopher Isabelle Stengers. That book, with its readability value and profound philosophical contents, should merit a super-excellent six-star rating almost at par with Erwin Schrödinger’s 1943 book, ‘What is Life?’ Of course, Schrödinger’s book, being an amazingly prophetic foray by a Quantum Physicist into the chemical-biological secret of life’s ‘code script’ is of a different class because it transcends the borders of the scientist’s own Nobel-winning work. Yet all said and done, ‘Gene Machine’, with its insights into the pleasures and pains of the race for scientific recognition, certainly deserves a place of its own at these commanding heights of scientific literature."
70,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43858998-linda-gaines,2,"I'm rather disappointed with this book. First I was really interested in learning about the ribosome and how it functions was discovered. I do feel like I learned a bit, but I really don't understand the different techniques they used to understand how it works. I just don't think it was explained well. Secondly, this book needed a better editor. I understand it was a personal story of the author's career and how the various scientists interacted, but it went off on far too many tangents such that I got lost. So many people were introduced, but only superficially, that I completely forgot who most of them were by the end of the chapter. Also, near the beginning the author talks about the discovery of the structure of DNA and never once mentions Rosalind Franklin, which was a particularly glaring omission. Then halfway through the book, she in mentioned with regards to people who used to be in her lab, and he never explains who she was and what she did for science and DNA. Not once. Perhaps I should blame the editor and not the author for that. In any event, the book needed a better editor."

Much of it highlights the various researchers, post docs, grad students etc. involved in the search for understanding the structure and function of the ribosome. The lab techniques are difficult to follow at best, even for someone with a science background. Every now and then there are revealing bits of information as to what was discovered. There is a place for this type of writing, but it just didn't hold my interest. What did strike me is how complex the research world is. Collaboration and competition go hand in hand - not an easy pair to balance! Also, many many people, sometimes over generations, are often involved in these major breakthroughs. I understand the need to recognize them and regret that I just wasn't able to take all of those individual stories in."
72,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52557863-grrlscientist,4,"What it is really like to be a scientist, especially a scientist who has been awarded the “most nobel” scientific prize of all?Written by 2009 co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Venkatraman “Venki” Ramakrishnan, an American and British structural biologist who grew up in India, 
Gene Machine: The race to decipher the secrets of the ribosome
 (Basic Books; 2018) is an engaging account of one man’s many scientific contributions to solve the structure of the ribosome, a small structure that is the workhorse of the cell, building the proteins necessary for life.The author begins his story in India, where he studied physics before immigrating to the United States to earn his doctorate in physics. During this time, he met and married — a major life event served to refocus his attention on how to successfully provide for his family as a working scientist. Confronted with a lifetime of “boring and incremental calculations that wouldn’t result in any real advance in understanding”, Dr. Ramakrishnan took a big risk and abruptly shifted his career focus to molecular biology after reading an article about the ribosome in Scientific American. To do this, he spent two years as a grad student in molecular biology at UCSD, gaining essential knowledge and skills necessary to pursue his new career.Because electron microscopy was in its infancy during most of this work, this meant that an older technique, x-ray crystallography, was the main tool used to decipher the structure of the ribosome. But x-ray crystallography created fuzzier, less detailed images than electron microscopy, so this led to the field being informally known as “blobology”.Despite disappointments and setbacks in his second career, Dr. Ramakrishnan persisted for more than 30 years before being awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, being named president of the Royal Society of London, the world’s oldest scientific society and then being knighted in the 2012. (He does not generally use the honorific ‘Sir’.)In this book, Dr. Ramakrishnan clearly explains the science, and highlights the sometimes convoluted process of how science actually works. He details the inside story of lab life including the struggles, failures and blind alleys, the collaborators and friends, the professional competitors and rivals, and the timely and critically important help provided by a number of scientists, as Dr. Ramakrishnan and his team worked tirelessly to solve the structure of this microscopic biological machine. As the story of the author’s professional life unfolds, we learn how a scientist develops the ideas, skills, tools — and the people, along with all the quirks and talents that each one embodies — that are essential to achieve such a remarkable scientific discovery.This profoundly human story is written with honesty and humility, and the author isn’t afraid to laugh at himself. For example, his story about the phone call in October was amusing, and he even shares his wife’s incredulous response when she first learned he had won the Nobel Prize: “I thought you had to be really smart to win one of those!” (Ramakrishnan 237).One element of this story that impressed me most was Dr. Ramakrishnan’s unfailing generosity to his collaborators and his competitors alike. In fact, one of the key themes in this book is that most contemporary science is not about individual achievement; rather, it’s a synthesis of ideas and progress by teams of highly dedicated individuals who devote their lives to solving questions they find compelling.At the end of the book, Dr. Ramakrishnan ponders the nature of science: “When we have a clear goal in mind, we think we are struggling to reach a summit. But there is no summit. When we get there, we realize we have just climbed a foothill, and there is an endless series of mountains ahead still to be climbed.” (Ramakrishnan 256).The author devotes the Epilogue to present some thoughts on the influence (both good and bad) of Truly Big Prizes, particularly the Nobel and the Breakthrough Prizes, upon scientific careers and scientific progress:“So I don’t subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even that much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We humans tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible. And when someone like Newton or Einstein sees much further than others, or Watson and Crick synthesize in one stroke the essential features of DNA that might have dribbled out in pieces, we tend to immortalize them.” (Ramakrishnan 264).This lucid and highly readable account will be enjoyed by students in any of the sciences, by those interested in the history of science, or who love reading memoirs. But really, I think that anyone who is captivated by an absorbing story well told will find much to appreciate in this fascinating book.NOTE: Originally published at Forbes on 30 November 2018.

A work for which the Author shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Ada Yonath and Tom Steitz. A very enriching experience in getting to know about such serious hard work to understand the intricate machineries of living beings in such a 'crystal' clear manner put forward by Venki Ramakrishnan."

If, however, you are looking to understand what exactly the life of a scientist can entail, then pick up a copy and dig in, you're in for a wild intercontinental ride!I rated this book 4/5, from an internal scoring of 8, two points were dropped for the name dropping (a LOT of people are named) and slightly opaque scientific descriptions."
75,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/534526-robert,3,"Having just finished helping my daughter study for her AP biology exam, I was able to hang with some of the technical discussion. However, this book is still very science heavy.Interesting look into how the scientific/academic/Nobel prize world works. Pretty dry."
76,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"Venki Ramakrishnan’s book is the story of the race to understand the structure and workings of the ribosome, and his part in that. He comes across as a modest, self-deprecating person, able to reveal his weaknesses as well as his strengths, and someone who is generous in acknowledging the contributions of others. As with many scientists of great aptitude, he lacks arrogance and at times comes across as quite diffident as to his abilities, fearing that others are better qualified than he is to solve this puzzle. His book does a wonderful job of conveying the combination of friendliness and rivalry that accompanies any scientific contest, no more so than when solving a problem of this importance. The journey is a roller coaster where one day his team seems to be ahead of his rivals, and the next a paper is published that suggests they are behind. He successfully expresses how his emotions rose and sank, as he continually tried to figure out where he was in relation to others in the race. In some respects, the book reminds me of The Double Helix by James Watson which recounts a similar, frantic rush to beat the competition to establish the structure of an important biological molecule. A chapter I found fascinating was one where Ramakrishnan discussed the politics of scientific awards, including the Nobel Prize, arguing that the system can become a closed-club where the same scientists repeatedly win prestigious honours. He was particularly critical of Nobel Prizes, writing: “Because many of the early Nobel laureates were giants in their field, the idea has taken hold – especially among non-scientists – that Nobel laureates are geniuses. In fact, the prize is not awarded for being a great scientist but rather for making a groundbreaking discovery or invention. Some of them may be extraordinarily brilliant, but others are just good scientists who were persistent or happened to stumble onto a major finding. Being in the right place at the right time often helped enormously”. He also blasted the rule that limits the number of winners to three. This may have been appropriate a century ago, but nowadays it doesn’t reflect the collaboration, intentional or otherwise, that marks most major scientific advances.He also writes about what he calls post-Nobelitis. As he puts it: “Suddenly, scientists are thrust into the limelight and bask in the public adulation that goes with it. They are asked for their opinion on everything under the sun, regardless of their own expertise, and it soon goes to their head. Some of them are long past their prime, having made their big discoveries decades earlier, and the renewed attention means that they spend their time wandering around the world, pontificating about all sorts of things”. Ramakrishnan knew that solving the mystery of the ribosome was worthy of a Nobel Prize but, with the rule of three in mind, he honestly admits that “I started worrying about my relative contribution and whether I would be perceived as a Johnny-come-lately rather than a pioneer”.Despite his cynicism about how the system works, Ramakrishnan comes across as extremely ambitious and someone who spent a lot of time fretting whether he would miss out on this ultimate scientific accolade. Would the ribosome really merit an award? And, if so, which three of the numerous scientists involved during something like 20 years of research would be named on the citation? A criticism I have of the book is that so many scientists are named that it is easy to lose track of who did what, where and when. Unfortunately, there is no index so when a name reappears there is no simple way of tracing when he or she was first mentioned. Furthermore, after they have been first introduced, Ramakrishnan often refers to scientists only by their first names, and the text is littered with references to Tom, Dick (actually Richard!) and Harry, which means that even having an index would be of limited value as an aide memoire. Perhaps a cast list might be better.Based on his personal experience, Ramakrishnan provides lots of interesting details about the mechanism of announcing and then awarding the Nobel Prizes. No doubt like many other recipients have been, he was very suspicious when he received the phone call from Sweden informing him that he’d won. Also, curiously, he tells us that the banquet after the ceremony is televised and shown live in Sweden. But he comments: “I wouldn’t have thought spending the evening watching a group of strangers eat would make for much drama, but there were speeches and entertainment”.The book is quite technical in places, notably in terms of crystallographic techniques. Nonetheless, it is not necessary to understand the details in order to enjoy this book because this is an account of how the race for a Nobel Prize is won, or, more often, lost. And therein lies the focus of the book."
77,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107551528-shweata-n,5,"Science is often thought to be done by scientists who isolate themselves in a cocoon and come out with a breakthrough and fly like a butterfly. But this is far far from the realities of academia. 'Gene Machine' brilliantly portraits the competitive nature of science. The book is successful in making us realize that breakthroughs that come about in science are often driven by competition amongst peers, which is quite contrary to what is perceived by the ones outside of academia. The author begins his career in academia and is up for a rather shaky start with several ups and downs, finally deciding to switch fields from being a theoretical physicist to a biologist. In the book, he goes on to give an honest account of his academic career, making bold remarks about various events and people, along the way. Also, his descriptions do not fail to capture the competitiveness in science which often isn't touched upon by many. Not to mention, Venki Ramakrishnan has also done a great job in elucidating some of the complex and technical concepts of ribosomes, proteins, crystallography and others. He has done it in such a way that it is easy for anyone with any/no prior knowledge of the subject to understand the concepts and the limitation in our understanding of it. I felt that the analogies he used, especially the car one to help us realize the limitations in understanding of ribosome,were really simple yet amazing.One thing that was consistent throughout the book was that he consistently acknowledged the fact that he was really lucky and had the right set of people and ideas to make that breakthrough. His first breakthrough comes when his team is able to decipher the structure of the 30S structure of the ribosome. Then they go on to solve the atomic structure of the whole ribosome.And finally, he isn't afraid of discussing about the fact that the idea of prizes and awards. He remarks that ""Nevertheless, scientists are only human. Like everyone else, we can be ambitious and competitive and crave recognition. Instead of inculcating a feeling that the work is its own reward, the scientific establishment feeds this desire to feel special and somehow better than our peers at virtually every stage of the process"". This sort of encompassed the idea of awards are flawed yet people tend to associate high value to it and it is the intrinsic nature of humans to do so. He also goes on to criticize the Nobel prize because it's only awarded to three people in a field each year. This doesn't hold good with the fact that scientific discoveries are usually bought out by a group not a single person and therefore it doesn't make sense to give it to just three people. However, he wins the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009 along with his competitors Ada and Tom.In the epilogue, he says: "" I don't subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible"". I think this sort of sums up my views on science too. ( I must confess that he has phrased it so well, I could never have done that!)In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it who wants to know what 'real' science works and who wants to know the realities of being in academia."
78,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,4,"Nobel Laurate Venki Ramakrishnan’s first book is about his experiences in the race to elucidate the structure of ribosome. I had read an excerpt from this book earlier, where he talked about how winning a Nobel prize may not be the best thing for the scientist and how prizes, at times can be unfair. I liked it very much and was keen on reading the whole book. I finally got the chance after borrowing a copy from a friend.The book starts out with his experiences as a student of physics and his almost accidental entry into biology. It then covers his postdoctoral work that got him interested in ribosomes in the first place followed by his incredible journey across America and then to MRC, Cambridge, which was across the ocean. The book is mostly a personal account, focusing on his experiences and the struggles he and his lab went through. It eventually culminates with his winning the prize and the Nobel prize ceremony. I found the book highly additive and an easy read. Ramakrishnan has done a really nice job of explaining the challenges he faced. Especially, the part on x-ray crystallography is so well written that even someone like me, who runs away from these techniques could understand it. As someone who is in academia, what I liked most about the book though is the honesty and frankness with which the story has been narrated. He has been open about all the politics surrounding the whole ribosome community and science in general. He has also not shied away from his own competitiveness, secrecy and prejudice. Another great point is that he has acknowledged the work of his lab members because in the end, the success is as much theirs as his. After reading this book, I came to know of quite a few things. For instance, in the scientific community, the present trend has been towards doing more collaborative work. However, it has not been the case always. When scientists compete with each other for the same thing as was the case with the ribosome structure, things can at times become ugly. Overall, it may or may not turn to be good for science overall. However, in this case, the ending was happy and the efforts of all those involved lead to an addition of our understanding of one of the fundamental phenomena of nature.Finally, I would say that this book has been an enjoyable read. I think it is definitely a must read for every biologist!"
79,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46231899-laurie89,5," The ‘Gene Machine’ is a fascinating account of Venki Ramakrishnan’s path to uncovering the structure of the ribosome, which resulted in his receiving the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The cast of characters and places in this narrative are truly captivating and provide a cross-sectional view of the scientific life. The book provides insight into how successful scientific careers are forged. The starting point is Dr Ramakrishnan’s journey from India to a Ph.D program in physics at Ohio University. After obtaining a Ph.D. the author poignantly describes his decision to switch fields to biology and how this naturally led him to structural biology. A striking inclusion in this story are the descriptions of the self-doubt and the reasoning behind each change in position; from UC San Diego to Yale, Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island to Oak Ridge National laboratory Tennessee, Utah and finally the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. The author finds the right balance in describing the science and the important roles that his colleagues, mentors and students played. Ultimately the depictions of his laboratory and the research environment provide the reader with a taste of what is involved in a successful competitive scientific career. The humility of the author shines throughout the story.  The heart of the narrative focuses on the race to reveal the structure of the ribosome, which manufactures proteins from the genetic code. While the ribosome is often overlooked by the general public, it is of utmost importance the functioning of all cellular life. The expository includes the history of ribosome and the genetic code, basic biology and the basic techniques in x-ray crystallography. The true break-through in structural biology that was necessary to realize the high resolution images is less clear. It would have greatly helped if there had been an appendix to describe this part of the science so that the readers could have also understand this important context. The book is also lacking an index and a more detailed bibliography of the resulting scientific articles.  This skillful memoir, which is fast paced and reads like a novel, is likely to become a scientific classic about the competition at the cutting edge of science. "
80,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42307468-siddharth-saravanan,3,"This book had 3 distinct phases for me. 1st phase regarding his emigration to the US and his subsequent foray into different aspects of Science was engaging, especially the way in which the author almost accidentally stumbled upon something which would turn out to be his lifelong goal! //Made me reflect on the fact that we need to be open in trying out different aspects of a particular field/life in order to land on something which we feel passionate towards dedicating a major portion of our lives 2nd phase covers the methods used by the author and the madcap race to cross the finishing line before anybody else. Although I'm a student of Biology, most of the science flew over my head because it dealt with techniques like crystallography, X-ray diffraction etc. which I have little idea about. The race to discover the structure is fascinating, but we'll have to wade through multiple scientific techniques and dozens of names and contributions from different people involved in the process, which can be quite hard.//Found it fascinating how so many different people are involved in the process. Though it makes the reading hard, really loved how the author credited every single person involved in the mammoth race! 3rd phase, and the best phase, talks about the ecosystem of prizes and the very hit-and-miss nature of them. We as a society have glorified the Nobel Prize, and rightly so. However it was illuminating reading about how the Nobel isn't all encompassing and is flawed in quite a few ways, along with the numerous other scientific prizes. Gave me a lot of perspective on the nature of credit, and the unfairness which is intrinsic in the whole process//(Brownie points for the statement that ethnic and ultra nationalistic pride is the opposite of racism and xenophobia. Rang true within me)"
81,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,2,"Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most difficult to answer. One such is that of how many Indians have won the Nobel Prize so far. The figure can be as high as twelve, if you count Ronald Ross, Rudyard Kipling, Dalai Lama, V S Naipaul and Mother Teresa. Some or of Indian origin, or been born in India or left India too early in their career. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan was a graduate of Physics from Baroda but immediately migrated to the US for further studies. He won the Nobel in Chemistry in 2009 for ribosome research along with two others. Ramakrishnan’s research strengthened our understanding of the fundamental processes of life and provided a clue to the evolution of modern species of life. This book is a combination of popular science and an autobiography with a seamless blending of the two. His life is devoted to research and learning.We know that our genetic material is locked up in a structure called DNA inside the nucleus of each of our cells. Apart from heredity, these contain recipes for building proteins which are essential for life. Insulin, adrenaline and albumin are all proteins required to sustain the organism. What makes these proteins inside a cell is a molecular gene-machine called ribosome. This machine reads the component list from data derived from the DNA and assembles the protein using amino acids just like a production line. The critical nature of the process need not be emphasized further, as the animal will soon be dead if the pathways are somehow clogged. Virtually every molecule in every cell in every form of life is either made by the ribosome or made by enzymes that are themselves made by ribosomes. Discovery of ribosomes and its role in making protein is the culmination of one of the great triumphs in modern biology. This was by no means easy as the ribosome is not a simple molecule like DNA. It was enormous and complex. The attempt to decipher it was taken up by Crick and Watson, who found the structure of DNA but was abandoned in despair.Ramakrishnan was attracted to ribosomes by an article in the magazine Scientific American. He knew practically nothing of biology which he made up through courses studied part-time. Thus we have a physicist who studied the structure of a crucial biological unit being awarded with a Nobel in chemistry! He attempted to solve the ribosome structure first by neutron scattering which was eventually proved ineffective but was well understood by people with a physics background. The author dwells at length on the step by step progress in revealing the structure and the race with other scientists doing similar work, but this is not in a form that can be easily digested by ordinary readers. I found it extremely tedious especially after reading Siddhartha Mukherjee’s great book ‘The Gene - An Intimate History’ a few weeks before. Of course, you cannot expect such lucidity from a Nobel laureate, but the pertinent fact is that almost all of the readers are not Nobel laureates themselves. It is only during the autobiographical passages that the book becomes even slightly interesting.Study of ribosomes is important in learning how medicines cure us of diseases. Some antibiotics work by blocking the protein creation function of bacterial ribosomes. This is done by binding to a vulnerable location in its structure. Since bacterial and human ribosomes are very different, humans will not be adversely affected by the mechanism of its action. This study also casts light on the dark alleyways of early evolution. Building blocks of RNA can be made from simple chemicals that could have been around in the earth billions of years ago. It may be possible that life emerged with lots of randomly made RNA molecules until some of them could reproduce entirely by themselves. RNA could also preserve heredity between generations.This book presents some valid advice to novices in scientific research. The author asks them not to be hesitant to ask questions, however basic it might be. He justifies it by claiming that no question is too stupid to ask if you want to know the answer. It is also a bare necessity for present-day researchers to belong to the top-line institutes and laboratories. Advanced science has now become a team effort transcending national frontiers and continental boundaries. The members of the theoretical and testing facilities should be known to each other, otherwise it would be difficult to obtain and manage precious time allocated for using sophisticated machines.The author makes a short but pointed criticism of the Nobel award conventions. There is a ‘Rule of Three’ in force. This means that the award, if shared, shall not be divided into more than three parts. This criterion is claimed to be impractical now. When the prize started in 1901, scientists worked in relative isolation and met only once every few years. By the time they announced their results, there was no question of who had discovered what. In the current world, an idea quickly spreads and a lot of people contribute to it in various measures and capacities. And it is not always clear whether the original idea or a later contribution was the truly ground breaking advance. It is a difficult task to select three people from a crowd of somewhat equal contributors without causing resentment or heartburn.Ramakrishnan left India very early and harbours no soft spots in his mind for the mother country. Ignorant of his real feelings, thousands of naïve Indians sent congratulatory emails to him upon winning the Nobel. This clogged his inbox and they received a curt reminder that ‘nationality was an accident of birth’ and by corollary, he does not attach much importance to it. This is a clear case of brain drain.The narrative about the role and secrets of ribosomes is disappointingly matter-of-fact. The author has failed to share the awe he might have felt in revealing the heretofore hidden details. The scientist’s idea of a paper for publishing in a journal is too far away from an ordinary reader’s preference of what is interesting. The book is a veritable Who’s Who of the rapidly growing field of structural biology in general and ribosomes in particular. The author has had a great collaboration with like-minded scholars from across the globe. There are many photographs of co-workers and even rivals. The illustrations given as part of the description are not at all helpful. Relevance has not been a parameter for inclusion as we even see a conceptual diagram of a four-stroke internal combustion engine as part of the narrative.The book is recommended only to serious readers."
82,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"I want sure what I got myself into when I picked up this book, but I can definitely say that it was well worth the read. While the book is focused primarily on figuring out the structure of the ribosome, the story Venki shares about his entrance into this particular field in science, the people he's met and worked with, and what came about from all of his work is very informative. We often hear about the accomplishment of folks like Venki, but rarely get a glimpse of what they went through to get there, this book covers that and more.Upon completing the book, I was left with two lingering thoughts, the first was I had no idea what he was talking about towards the later half of the book. Venki writes, in great detail the vast test, processes, and failures he went through to finally generate crystals that could be used to decipher the ribosome. These chapters were difficult to follow for a layman like myself, but I stuck with it. If he took the time to explain his work of many years, the least I could do is spend a couple hours reading about it.The second thought, was that I do not think there was a single person Venki left out of his story that did not have a direct or indirect influence on his project. He went out of his way to talk about a lot of people who pioneered earlier discoveries into crystallizing molecules, mentors who encouraged him to push the boundaries, peers who kept him in check, and students who brought in new fresh ideas to the problem so hand. This is the part of the book I really enjoyed, the simple act of a person who accomplished something significant, giving recognition were it was due."
83,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15971935-mark-stidham,4,"This was a fun read for me because of its subject matter (the elucidation of the structure of the ribosome). It could be of broader interest because it is a first person account of the life of a scientist in a competitive race to solve a scientific question. As a biochemist almost the same age as the author, I related to the story arc, even though there isn't much similarity in our careers. There is the struggle to find a niche, long investments in study and techniques that end up being useless, and frustrating search for job stability. This particular story is similar to others that feature competitive research and the need to obtain respect from peers. The author spends a good amount of time explaining the benefits and the downsides to the science community hierarchy epitomized by the competition for the Nobel Prize. That Ramakrishnan won a share of the prize is evidence of some objectivity in the process. But overall, the Prize seems more of a club.I was unable to pay attention to this particular race to find the structure of the ribosome, and the book should not be viewed as any more than an introduction to that subject. I look forward to learning the details in the scholarly papers. But it should be mentioned that this incredible biological machine was completely misunderstood not too long ago. It is humbling that such a fundamental process is only now being elucidated, and it shows that there are many more astonishing aspects of our biochemistry to be discovered in the future"

Thankfully I had packed 3 of them when I had to leave for my emergency service. I finished the first one just last evening. I don't read books on the history of science much often, and had picked up 'Gene Machine' on the recommendations of one of my buddies. This one is Venki Ramakrishnan's side of the fascinating story of how the structure and functions of Ribosome, a cellular organelle, were discovered and how the long journey over decades lead to the Nobel Prize for the author and his two main competitors. The hard work behind every discovery, the cooperation and competition between scientists, the jealousy between them, the politics of awards and their after effects is delved on in detail. The book is a repository of knowledge on biology, which however has been tiring for me as biology was never my favourite subject. In our country, the lives of scientists are never that well discussed except some few like Einstein, Bose, Newton, Meghnad Saha and Jagdish Chandra Bose. This book will be a happy addition to that small grouping. The story of how the structure and functions of the Ribosome, the organelle that synthesizes proteins, and lays the building blocks of life, were explained before the world, is truly an engaging one."
85,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104610180-aquila-michiryu,4,"In Gene Machine, Venki Ramakrishnan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, recounts his scientific journey of unraveling the structure of the ribosome and its biological mysteries. More than that, he honestly reveals the politics and competition present in the realm of science, and how various factors such as luck, personalities, jealousy, money and the desire for awards can all inextricably influence the potential for success as a scientist. He also shares his views on the Nobel Prize (and his experience of winning the prize) and how there is subjectivity present when the panel decides who the prize should be awarded to.As a biology student, I learnt about the ribosome when I studied about the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome. At that time, I didn’t place much thought on how the information in my lecture notes came about. How did scientists find out about the structures of the various components in the cell? And specifically, how did they know what function each component played? Admittedly, these questions rarely crossed my mind when I was a student then, since I didn’t want to waste time ruminating on whatever wasn’t in the syllabus at that time.Reading this book has revealed the “behind-the-scenes” of the scientific discovery of ribosome and I realised that I have underestimated the amount of time and effort these scientists have spent to glean the knowledge we can now comfortably obtain. Moreover, I appreciate the author’s objective revelation about the presence of politics and competition in the scientific community, including how the highly-respected Nobel Prize can be subjective and fallible, things I didn’t hear about previously.Having said that, I can expect readers unfamiliar with the ribosome to not appreciate this book as much due to its scientific nature (though the author tries to simplify the highly scientific details to make it easier for general readers to understand). I had to research on X-Ray Crystallography to find out exactly how it works as it was only briefly mentioned in the book.If you know what the ribosome is, this is an insightful and enlightening book to read!"
86,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90507383-mahin,5,"My friends who aren’t in STEM are incredulous to find out how hyper-competitive (and cut-throat) research can be. Science is viewed as incorruptible. But that doesn’t mean that scientists are necessarily paragons of rationality or truth; sometimes, they guard their knowledge and results out of fear that a peer will ""scoop"" them. In spite of this, science is a collaborative process by necessity. In Gene Machine, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan shares his perspective on the race to discover the ribosome’s structure. He also shares his experiences as an outsider; first as a physicist by training who belatedly discovered his interest in biology and second as an Indian immigrant to the US, where he often lived in majority-white towns (in Ohio and Utah). As a biochemist, I found that Venki explained his research in a way that is accessible to those who aren't scientists (or even biologists). As a result, I found myself skimming over descriptions of DNA, RNA, and other elementary biological concepts; but I appreciated their inclusion for readers who may have forgotten or don't have that knowledge. Another reviewer remarked that you wouldn't expect a book about the discovery of the ribosome's structure to be so gripping, an assessment with which I agree. I think Gene Machine will prove to be one of the best science books to be published in 2018."
87,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35657160-jqadams,3,"This book is mostly a memoir of the author's research efforts as he bounces around the United States and United Kingdom eventually vying with other groups to by the first to understand and publish the atomic structure of the ribosome, but it also weaves in information about the ribosome and the methodology by which it is studied (e.g., crystallography) as well as meta-commentary about how science is done, and how the desire for glory and prizes can distort the process. That is to say, it follows the well-trodden path of 
The Double Helix
. It definitely gets a lot more hard-science than other books in that vein, though; I found some of the technical details about the ribosome hard to follow here, but I admit the problem may well have been that I had to put down the book for a couple of months halfway through and in the interim forgot the intricacies that he'd introduced earlier. The account is generally otherwise pretty easy to read: the author's surprisingly candid about various things, and he seems like an interesting character."

It is obviously full of chemistry terms. Author has explained it well, but it is still the matter of interest. I am not very interested in chemistry, so I did not find it much interesting.Researchers however must read it to check out how that world functions. Author calls Noble prize a lottery! He honestly describes the pitfalls and limitations of Nobel (or any recognition). It helps to put the awards and recognition in perspective. Many times mind tricks us in thinking award as the aim. This book can tell you how random the selection actually is! It is not exactly correlated with the work you do, work is ofcourse important but there are other dominant factors which no one can control.Concluding -For scientists - must readOthers can safely skip. You won't miss anything.By the way, this is a kind of accidental read for me.

Ramakrishnan is less relatable and perhaps not as self-reflective or self-aware as Jahren, but his love of the work and his wry sense of humor shines through. He also opens a door into a world few enter, even scientists, as he shines a rare candid light on the politics of working in a competitive field and of being in the running for the Nobel Prize. "

99,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30640144-abhijit-basu,4,"REVIEW OF VENKI RAMAKRISHNAN’S ‘GENE MACHINE’What are ribosomes? Why are they of such importance that teams of dedicated chemical and biological scientists across the world made it their lives’ mission to investigate ribosome’s inner structure over three decades since the early 1980s? The reason behind the great scientific quest is that the genetic information encoded on the DNA would have been of no use without the ribosome molecule as essential cellular processing machine to translate these instructions for making proteins, the building blocks of life. It is on this logic that the 2009 Chemistry Nobel Laureate (joint) Sir Venki Ramakrishnan calls his memoir ‘gene machine.’ Foremost among the factors that make the book so appealing to read is the author’s personal candour – about his ambition, about his professional worries and above all else, about his determination to count in the race for scientific recognition as a ‘dark horse.’ As Siddhartha Mukherjee (author of ‘Emperor of All Maladies’) puts it, his story is that of an ‘outsider’ – twice over. First, as an immigrant settling in the USA and UK, and then, as a PhD in Physics doing his life’s chosen work in molecular biology. Another quality of the book is the author’s writing style. Ramakrishnan has his own way with words and even the more technical middle chapters of the book are laced with enough humour and witty anecdotes to keep interest alive. He is a master of metaphor too – making complex science understandable to lay readers with simple examples. After putting things scientifically – that the ribosome, a ‘giant’ molecule with over a million atoms (still small enough to pack 4000 in the width of a human hair), is the link between our genes and the proteins they specify, he makes the point that understanding how it works will depend on how it structurally looks. He then drives home the importance of that knowing and understanding by a simple allegory. Imagine you are a Martian peering down at earth, he says. You observe tiny objects moving straight or occasionally turning. Look little closer and you find movement happens only when tinier moving things enter those objects. Driven by curiosity, you want to see how the objects are constructed. You find that it is made of numerous working parts, including an engine connected to a crankshaft that makes the wheels turn. You look even closer to find that the engine itself has pistons and sucks in fuel and air that is ignited with a spark plug to drive the piston forward. It is the same with understanding molecules that make life. Understanding DNA and RNA molecules was a big step. But cracking the jigsaw puzzle needed understanding of how the ‘enormous’ ribosomes were constructed which enabled them to decode the DNA information of nucleotide sequence carried by messenger RNAs ‘to stitch together amino acids brought by transfer RNAs into protein.’ Importantly, the author also explains how, by knowing the structure and components of the bacterial ribosome, the work has opened up avenues to development of new antibiotics.It is an engaging story about the agonies and ecstasies, about the disappointments and lucky breaks of ‘rival’ scientists competing in a race for success. The pursuit of success is often made tense by an atmosphere surcharged with ‘politics for recognition.’ At the same time there is cooperation too among the community of scientists, helped by seminars, conferences and mutual discussions which enable cross-pollination of ideas. Ramakrishnan attributes this competitive cooperation to the ‘inbred’ nature of modern scientific discoveries. The 2009 Chemistry Nobel Prize was awarded jointly to three persons. Ada Yonath from Israel was the first to make headway in ribosome crystallisation and kept at it with dogged application for decades. Then there was Tom Steitz, American biochemist and a leading crystallographer of his generation, who, in collaboration with Peter Moore, effectively began the last lap of the race by publishing the atomic structure of the larger (50S) ribosomal subunit. Finally, there was Venki Ramakrishnan, an ‘accidental ribosome biologist’ and a latecomer to the field, who caught up with the others by leading his energetic team of bright postdoc and student associates working round the clock across their trans-Atlantic divide at Cambridge and Utah to achieve high-resolution ‘crystal’ structure of the smaller (30S) ribosome subunit (and later the entire (70S) ribosome, throwing light on the code translation process and on the mechanism of blocking action exploited by antibiotics). Yet, as candidly acknowledged by the author, there were other key contributors who got regrettably left out of Nobel recognition due to the ‘three-recipient limitation’ of the prize. Moreover, as Ramakrishnan himself alludes to in the book’s epilogue, while he and the two others received the recognition for their pioneering work in using crystallography to explore ribosome, with subsequent advancement in electron microscopy, a more direct method allowing higher resolution is now available to investigate organelle structure. The epilogue also contains an endearingly modest, even bordering on philosophical, reflection by the author, in the context of the flood of honours and awards that he received following the ‘Nobel Lottery’, as he calls it, echoing Francis Crick. Referencing the Bible, he cites Matthew 13.12: 'For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.' As already mentioned, the book has quite a few comical anecdotes to liven up things. For instance, there is the story of how Pat Unwin and Carlos Taddei worked at obtaining two-dimensional protein crystals from lizard ovary cells in 1977—the first demonstration that ribosomes were indeed crystallizable. The maverick Taddei was given to insouciantly puffing at his cigar in the lab and regularly setting off the fire alarms. After some time, the experiment was abandoned as the crystals were found not good enough to reveal a detailed atomic arrangement. The unchaperoned lizards left in the basement escaped and were to be seen scampering around the grounds of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology for years thereafter. Another interesting anecdote relates to the author’s two encounters with James Watson. On both occasions, the brash and acerbic American geneticist made light of Ramakrishnan’s labours, saying, ‘Forget the Nobel.’ However, the same Watson was seen attending a lecture by Ramakrishnan and later dispelling Ramakrishnan’s apprehensions by approving his selection as a Nobel Committee expert for the coveted Prize.A COMPARISONIn my personal view as a one-time researcher in Chemistry and a lover of good literature, ‘Gene Machine’ is a thrilling story of a down-to-earth scientist’s quest in a niche area of research holding promise for a clearer understanding of the secrets of life and of better ways to treat complicated maladies. In comparison with other genre books written by Nobel Laureate scientists, I would rate the book in the ‘very good’ category, with a four stars grade. ‘The Double Helix’ (1968) – James Watson’s brilliant account of decoding the DNA – gets ‘excellent’ rating with five stars to boot. But at the top rung of my assessment would be ‘Order out of Chaos’ (1984) – a deeply thought-provoking account of the philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics and its theory of entropy or universal tendency towards disorderliness – written by Ilya Prigogine, 1977 Physical Chemistry Nobel Laureate and his co-author, scientific philosopher Isabelle Stengers. That book, with its readability value and profound philosophical contents, should merit a super-excellent six-star rating almost at par with Erwin Schrödinger’s 1943 book, ‘What is Life?’ Of course, Schrödinger’s book, being an amazingly prophetic foray by a Quantum Physicist into the chemical-biological secret of life’s ‘code script’ is of a different class because it transcends the borders of the scientist’s own Nobel-winning work. Yet all said and done, ‘Gene Machine’, with its insights into the pleasures and pains of the race for scientific recognition, certainly deserves a place of its own at these commanding heights of scientific literature."
100,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43858998-linda-gaines,2,"I'm rather disappointed with this book. First I was really interested in learning about the ribosome and how it functions was discovered. I do feel like I learned a bit, but I really don't understand the different techniques they used to understand how it works. I just don't think it was explained well. Secondly, this book needed a better editor. I understand it was a personal story of the author's career and how the various scientists interacted, but it went off on far too many tangents such that I got lost. So many people were introduced, but only superficially, that I completely forgot who most of them were by the end of the chapter. Also, near the beginning the author talks about the discovery of the structure of DNA and never once mentions Rosalind Franklin, which was a particularly glaring omission. Then halfway through the book, she in mentioned with regards to people who used to be in her lab, and he never explains who she was and what she did for science and DNA. Not once. Perhaps I should blame the editor and not the author for that. In any event, the book needed a better editor."

The lab techniques are difficult to follow at best, even for someone with a science background. Every now and then there are revealing bits of information as to what was discovered. There is a place for this type of writing, but it just didn't hold my interest. What did strike me is how complex the research world is. Collaboration and competition go hand in hand - not an easy pair to balance! Also, many many people, sometimes over generations, are often involved in these major breakthroughs. I understand the need to recognize them and regret that I just wasn't able to take all of those individual stories in."
102,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52557863-grrlscientist,4,"What it is really like to be a scientist, especially a scientist who has been awarded the “most nobel” scientific prize of all?Written by 2009 co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Venkatraman “Venki” Ramakrishnan, an American and British structural biologist who grew up in India, 
Gene Machine: The race to decipher the secrets of the ribosome
 (Basic Books; 2018) is an engaging account of one man’s many scientific contributions to solve the structure of the ribosome, a small structure that is the workhorse of the cell, building the proteins necessary for life.The author begins his story in India, where he studied physics before immigrating to the United States to earn his doctorate in physics. During this time, he met and married — a major life event served to refocus his attention on how to successfully provide for his family as a working scientist. Confronted with a lifetime of “boring and incremental calculations that wouldn’t result in any real advance in understanding”, Dr. Ramakrishnan took a big risk and abruptly shifted his career focus to molecular biology after reading an article about the ribosome in Scientific American. To do this, he spent two years as a grad student in molecular biology at UCSD, gaining essential knowledge and skills necessary to pursue his new career.Because electron microscopy was in its infancy during most of this work, this meant that an older technique, x-ray crystallography, was the main tool used to decipher the structure of the ribosome. But x-ray crystallography created fuzzier, less detailed images than electron microscopy, so this led to the field being informally known as “blobology”.Despite disappointments and setbacks in his second career, Dr. Ramakrishnan persisted for more than 30 years before being awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, being named president of the Royal Society of London, the world’s oldest scientific society and then being knighted in the 2012. (He does not generally use the honorific ‘Sir’.)In this book, Dr. Ramakrishnan clearly explains the science, and highlights the sometimes convoluted process of how science actually works. He details the inside story of lab life including the struggles, failures and blind alleys, the collaborators and friends, the professional competitors and rivals, and the timely and critically important help provided by a number of scientists, as Dr. Ramakrishnan and his team worked tirelessly to solve the structure of this microscopic biological machine. As the story of the author’s professional life unfolds, we learn how a scientist develops the ideas, skills, tools — and the people, along with all the quirks and talents that each one embodies — that are essential to achieve such a remarkable scientific discovery.This profoundly human story is written with honesty and humility, and the author isn’t afraid to laugh at himself. For example, his story about the phone call in October was amusing, and he even shares his wife’s incredulous response when she first learned he had won the Nobel Prize: “I thought you had to be really smart to win one of those!” (Ramakrishnan 237).One element of this story that impressed me most was Dr. Ramakrishnan’s unfailing generosity to his collaborators and his competitors alike. In fact, one of the key themes in this book is that most contemporary science is not about individual achievement; rather, it’s a synthesis of ideas and progress by teams of highly dedicated individuals who devote their lives to solving questions they find compelling.At the end of the book, Dr. Ramakrishnan ponders the nature of science: “When we have a clear goal in mind, we think we are struggling to reach a summit. But there is no summit. When we get there, we realize we have just climbed a foothill, and there is an endless series of mountains ahead still to be climbed.” (Ramakrishnan 256).The author devotes the Epilogue to present some thoughts on the influence (both good and bad) of Truly Big Prizes, particularly the Nobel and the Breakthrough Prizes, upon scientific careers and scientific progress:“So I don’t subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even that much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We humans tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible. And when someone like Newton or Einstein sees much further than others, or Watson and Crick synthesize in one stroke the essential features of DNA that might have dribbled out in pieces, we tend to immortalize them.” (Ramakrishnan 264).This lucid and highly readable account will be enjoyed by students in any of the sciences, by those interested in the history of science, or who love reading memoirs. But really, I think that anyone who is captivated by an absorbing story well told will find much to appreciate in this fascinating book.NOTE: Originally published at Forbes on 30 November 2018.

106,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"Venki Ramakrishnan’s book is the story of the race to understand the structure and workings of the ribosome, and his part in that. He comes across as a modest, self-deprecating person, able to reveal his weaknesses as well as his strengths, and someone who is generous in acknowledging the contributions of others. As with many scientists of great aptitude, he lacks arrogance and at times comes across as quite diffident as to his abilities, fearing that others are better qualified than he is to solve this puzzle. His book does a wonderful job of conveying the combination of friendliness and rivalry that accompanies any scientific contest, no more so than when solving a problem of this importance. The journey is a roller coaster where one day his team seems to be ahead of his rivals, and the next a paper is published that suggests they are behind. He successfully expresses how his emotions rose and sank, as he continually tried to figure out where he was in relation to others in the race. In some respects, the book reminds me of The Double Helix by James Watson which recounts a similar, frantic rush to beat the competition to establish the structure of an important biological molecule. A chapter I found fascinating was one where Ramakrishnan discussed the politics of scientific awards, including the Nobel Prize, arguing that the system can become a closed-club where the same scientists repeatedly win prestigious honours. He was particularly critical of Nobel Prizes, writing: “Because many of the early Nobel laureates were giants in their field, the idea has taken hold – especially among non-scientists – that Nobel laureates are geniuses. In fact, the prize is not awarded for being a great scientist but rather for making a groundbreaking discovery or invention. Some of them may be extraordinarily brilliant, but others are just good scientists who were persistent or happened to stumble onto a major finding. Being in the right place at the right time often helped enormously”. He also blasted the rule that limits the number of winners to three. This may have been appropriate a century ago, but nowadays it doesn’t reflect the collaboration, intentional or otherwise, that marks most major scientific advances.He also writes about what he calls post-Nobelitis. As he puts it: “Suddenly, scientists are thrust into the limelight and bask in the public adulation that goes with it. They are asked for their opinion on everything under the sun, regardless of their own expertise, and it soon goes to their head. Some of them are long past their prime, having made their big discoveries decades earlier, and the renewed attention means that they spend their time wandering around the world, pontificating about all sorts of things”. Ramakrishnan knew that solving the mystery of the ribosome was worthy of a Nobel Prize but, with the rule of three in mind, he honestly admits that “I started worrying about my relative contribution and whether I would be perceived as a Johnny-come-lately rather than a pioneer”.Despite his cynicism about how the system works, Ramakrishnan comes across as extremely ambitious and someone who spent a lot of time fretting whether he would miss out on this ultimate scientific accolade. Would the ribosome really merit an award? And, if so, which three of the numerous scientists involved during something like 20 years of research would be named on the citation? A criticism I have of the book is that so many scientists are named that it is easy to lose track of who did what, where and when. Unfortunately, there is no index so when a name reappears there is no simple way of tracing when he or she was first mentioned. Furthermore, after they have been first introduced, Ramakrishnan often refers to scientists only by their first names, and the text is littered with references to Tom, Dick (actually Richard!) and Harry, which means that even having an index would be of limited value as an aide memoire. Perhaps a cast list might be better.Based on his personal experience, Ramakrishnan provides lots of interesting details about the mechanism of announcing and then awarding the Nobel Prizes. No doubt like many other recipients have been, he was very suspicious when he received the phone call from Sweden informing him that he’d won. Also, curiously, he tells us that the banquet after the ceremony is televised and shown live in Sweden. But he comments: “I wouldn’t have thought spending the evening watching a group of strangers eat would make for much drama, but there were speeches and entertainment”.The book is quite technical in places, notably in terms of crystallographic techniques. Nonetheless, it is not necessary to understand the details in order to enjoy this book because this is an account of how the race for a Nobel Prize is won, or, more often, lost. And therein lies the focus of the book."
107,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107551528-shweata-n,5,"Science is often thought to be done by scientists who isolate themselves in a cocoon and come out with a breakthrough and fly like a butterfly. But this is far far from the realities of academia. 'Gene Machine' brilliantly portraits the competitive nature of science. The book is successful in making us realize that breakthroughs that come about in science are often driven by competition amongst peers, which is quite contrary to what is perceived by the ones outside of academia. The author begins his career in academia and is up for a rather shaky start with several ups and downs, finally deciding to switch fields from being a theoretical physicist to a biologist. In the book, he goes on to give an honest account of his academic career, making bold remarks about various events and people, along the way. Also, his descriptions do not fail to capture the competitiveness in science which often isn't touched upon by many. Not to mention, Venki Ramakrishnan has also done a great job in elucidating some of the complex and technical concepts of ribosomes, proteins, crystallography and others. He has done it in such a way that it is easy for anyone with any/no prior knowledge of the subject to understand the concepts and the limitation in our understanding of it. I felt that the analogies he used, especially the car one to help us realize the limitations in understanding of ribosome,were really simple yet amazing.One thing that was consistent throughout the book was that he consistently acknowledged the fact that he was really lucky and had the right set of people and ideas to make that breakthrough. His first breakthrough comes when his team is able to decipher the structure of the 30S structure of the ribosome. Then they go on to solve the atomic structure of the whole ribosome.And finally, he isn't afraid of discussing about the fact that the idea of prizes and awards. He remarks that ""Nevertheless, scientists are only human. Like everyone else, we can be ambitious and competitive and crave recognition. Instead of inculcating a feeling that the work is its own reward, the scientific establishment feeds this desire to feel special and somehow better than our peers at virtually every stage of the process"". This sort of encompassed the idea of awards are flawed yet people tend to associate high value to it and it is the intrinsic nature of humans to do so. He also goes on to criticize the Nobel prize because it's only awarded to three people in a field each year. This doesn't hold good with the fact that scientific discoveries are usually bought out by a group not a single person and therefore it doesn't make sense to give it to just three people. However, he wins the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009 along with his competitors Ada and Tom.In the epilogue, he says: "" I don't subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible"". I think this sort of sums up my views on science too. ( I must confess that he has phrased it so well, I could never have done that!)In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it who wants to know what 'real' science works and who wants to know the realities of being in academia."
108,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,4,"Nobel Laurate Venki Ramakrishnan’s first book is about his experiences in the race to elucidate the structure of ribosome. I had read an excerpt from this book earlier, where he talked about how winning a Nobel prize may not be the best thing for the scientist and how prizes, at times can be unfair. I liked it very much and was keen on reading the whole book. I finally got the chance after borrowing a copy from a friend.The book starts out with his experiences as a student of physics and his almost accidental entry into biology. It then covers his postdoctoral work that got him interested in ribosomes in the first place followed by his incredible journey across America and then to MRC, Cambridge, which was across the ocean. The book is mostly a personal account, focusing on his experiences and the struggles he and his lab went through. It eventually culminates with his winning the prize and the Nobel prize ceremony. I found the book highly additive and an easy read. Ramakrishnan has done a really nice job of explaining the challenges he faced. Especially, the part on x-ray crystallography is so well written that even someone like me, who runs away from these techniques could understand it. As someone who is in academia, what I liked most about the book though is the honesty and frankness with which the story has been narrated. He has been open about all the politics surrounding the whole ribosome community and science in general. He has also not shied away from his own competitiveness, secrecy and prejudice. Another great point is that he has acknowledged the work of his lab members because in the end, the success is as much theirs as his. After reading this book, I came to know of quite a few things. For instance, in the scientific community, the present trend has been towards doing more collaborative work. However, it has not been the case always. When scientists compete with each other for the same thing as was the case with the ribosome structure, things can at times become ugly. Overall, it may or may not turn to be good for science overall. However, in this case, the ending was happy and the efforts of all those involved lead to an addition of our understanding of one of the fundamental phenomena of nature.Finally, I would say that this book has been an enjoyable read. I think it is definitely a must read for every biologist!"
109,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46231899-laurie89,5," The ‘Gene Machine’ is a fascinating account of Venki Ramakrishnan’s path to uncovering the structure of the ribosome, which resulted in his receiving the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The cast of characters and places in this narrative are truly captivating and provide a cross-sectional view of the scientific life. The book provides insight into how successful scientific careers are forged. The starting point is Dr Ramakrishnan’s journey from India to a Ph.D program in physics at Ohio University. After obtaining a Ph.D. the author poignantly describes his decision to switch fields to biology and how this naturally led him to structural biology. A striking inclusion in this story are the descriptions of the self-doubt and the reasoning behind each change in position; from UC San Diego to Yale, Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island to Oak Ridge National laboratory Tennessee, Utah and finally the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. The author finds the right balance in describing the science and the important roles that his colleagues, mentors and students played. Ultimately the depictions of his laboratory and the research environment provide the reader with a taste of what is involved in a successful competitive scientific career. The humility of the author shines throughout the story.  The heart of the narrative focuses on the race to reveal the structure of the ribosome, which manufactures proteins from the genetic code. While the ribosome is often overlooked by the general public, it is of utmost importance the functioning of all cellular life. The expository includes the history of ribosome and the genetic code, basic biology and the basic techniques in x-ray crystallography. The true break-through in structural biology that was necessary to realize the high resolution images is less clear. It would have greatly helped if there had been an appendix to describe this part of the science so that the readers could have also understand this important context. The book is also lacking an index and a more detailed bibliography of the resulting scientific articles.  This skillful memoir, which is fast paced and reads like a novel, is likely to become a scientific classic about the competition at the cutting edge of science. "
110,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42307468-siddharth-saravanan,3,"This book had 3 distinct phases for me. 1st phase regarding his emigration to the US and his subsequent foray into different aspects of Science was engaging, especially the way in which the author almost accidentally stumbled upon something which would turn out to be his lifelong goal! //Made me reflect on the fact that we need to be open in trying out different aspects of a particular field/life in order to land on something which we feel passionate towards dedicating a major portion of our lives 2nd phase covers the methods used by the author and the madcap race to cross the finishing line before anybody else. Although I'm a student of Biology, most of the science flew over my head because it dealt with techniques like crystallography, X-ray diffraction etc. which I have little idea about. The race to discover the structure is fascinating, but we'll have to wade through multiple scientific techniques and dozens of names and contributions from different people involved in the process, which can be quite hard.//Found it fascinating how so many different people are involved in the process. Though it makes the reading hard, really loved how the author credited every single person involved in the mammoth race! 3rd phase, and the best phase, talks about the ecosystem of prizes and the very hit-and-miss nature of them. We as a society have glorified the Nobel Prize, and rightly so. However it was illuminating reading about how the Nobel isn't all encompassing and is flawed in quite a few ways, along with the numerous other scientific prizes. Gave me a lot of perspective on the nature of credit, and the unfairness which is intrinsic in the whole process//(Brownie points for the statement that ethnic and ultra nationalistic pride is the opposite of racism and xenophobia. Rang true within me)"
111,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,2,"Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most difficult to answer. One such is that of how many Indians have won the Nobel Prize so far. The figure can be as high as twelve, if you count Ronald Ross, Rudyard Kipling, Dalai Lama, V S Naipaul and Mother Teresa. Some or of Indian origin, or been born in India or left India too early in their career. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan was a graduate of Physics from Baroda but immediately migrated to the US for further studies. He won the Nobel in Chemistry in 2009 for ribosome research along with two others. Ramakrishnan’s research strengthened our understanding of the fundamental processes of life and provided a clue to the evolution of modern species of life. This book is a combination of popular science and an autobiography with a seamless blending of the two. His life is devoted to research and learning.We know that our genetic material is locked up in a structure called DNA inside the nucleus of each of our cells. Apart from heredity, these contain recipes for building proteins which are essential for life. Insulin, adrenaline and albumin are all proteins required to sustain the organism. What makes these proteins inside a cell is a molecular gene-machine called ribosome. This machine reads the component list from data derived from the DNA and assembles the protein using amino acids just like a production line. The critical nature of the process need not be emphasized further, as the animal will soon be dead if the pathways are somehow clogged. Virtually every molecule in every cell in every form of life is either made by the ribosome or made by enzymes that are themselves made by ribosomes. Discovery of ribosomes and its role in making protein is the culmination of one of the great triumphs in modern biology. This was by no means easy as the ribosome is not a simple molecule like DNA. It was enormous and complex. The attempt to decipher it was taken up by Crick and Watson, who found the structure of DNA but was abandoned in despair.Ramakrishnan was attracted to ribosomes by an article in the magazine Scientific American. He knew practically nothing of biology which he made up through courses studied part-time. Thus we have a physicist who studied the structure of a crucial biological unit being awarded with a Nobel in chemistry! He attempted to solve the ribosome structure first by neutron scattering which was eventually proved ineffective but was well understood by people with a physics background. The author dwells at length on the step by step progress in revealing the structure and the race with other scientists doing similar work, but this is not in a form that can be easily digested by ordinary readers. I found it extremely tedious especially after reading Siddhartha Mukherjee’s great book ‘The Gene - An Intimate History’ a few weeks before. Of course, you cannot expect such lucidity from a Nobel laureate, but the pertinent fact is that almost all of the readers are not Nobel laureates themselves. It is only during the autobiographical passages that the book becomes even slightly interesting.Study of ribosomes is important in learning how medicines cure us of diseases. Some antibiotics work by blocking the protein creation function of bacterial ribosomes. This is done by binding to a vulnerable location in its structure. Since bacterial and human ribosomes are very different, humans will not be adversely affected by the mechanism of its action. This study also casts light on the dark alleyways of early evolution. Building blocks of RNA can be made from simple chemicals that could have been around in the earth billions of years ago. It may be possible that life emerged with lots of randomly made RNA molecules until some of them could reproduce entirely by themselves. RNA could also preserve heredity between generations.This book presents some valid advice to novices in scientific research. The author asks them not to be hesitant to ask questions, however basic it might be. He justifies it by claiming that no question is too stupid to ask if you want to know the answer. It is also a bare necessity for present-day researchers to belong to the top-line institutes and laboratories. Advanced science has now become a team effort transcending national frontiers and continental boundaries. The members of the theoretical and testing facilities should be known to each other, otherwise it would be difficult to obtain and manage precious time allocated for using sophisticated machines.The author makes a short but pointed criticism of the Nobel award conventions. There is a ‘Rule of Three’ in force. This means that the award, if shared, shall not be divided into more than three parts. This criterion is claimed to be impractical now. When the prize started in 1901, scientists worked in relative isolation and met only once every few years. By the time they announced their results, there was no question of who had discovered what. In the current world, an idea quickly spreads and a lot of people contribute to it in various measures and capacities. And it is not always clear whether the original idea or a later contribution was the truly ground breaking advance. It is a difficult task to select three people from a crowd of somewhat equal contributors without causing resentment or heartburn.Ramakrishnan left India very early and harbours no soft spots in his mind for the mother country. Ignorant of his real feelings, thousands of naïve Indians sent congratulatory emails to him upon winning the Nobel. This clogged his inbox and they received a curt reminder that ‘nationality was an accident of birth’ and by corollary, he does not attach much importance to it. This is a clear case of brain drain.The narrative about the role and secrets of ribosomes is disappointingly matter-of-fact. The author has failed to share the awe he might have felt in revealing the heretofore hidden details. The scientist’s idea of a paper for publishing in a journal is too far away from an ordinary reader’s preference of what is interesting. The book is a veritable Who’s Who of the rapidly growing field of structural biology in general and ribosomes in particular. The author has had a great collaboration with like-minded scholars from across the globe. There are many photographs of co-workers and even rivals. The illustrations given as part of the description are not at all helpful. Relevance has not been a parameter for inclusion as we even see a conceptual diagram of a four-stroke internal combustion engine as part of the narrative.The book is recommended only to serious readers."
112,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"I want sure what I got myself into when I picked up this book, but I can definitely say that it was well worth the read. While the book is focused primarily on figuring out the structure of the ribosome, the story Venki shares about his entrance into this particular field in science, the people he's met and worked with, and what came about from all of his work is very informative. We often hear about the accomplishment of folks like Venki, but rarely get a glimpse of what they went through to get there, this book covers that and more.Upon completing the book, I was left with two lingering thoughts, the first was I had no idea what he was talking about towards the later half of the book. Venki writes, in great detail the vast test, processes, and failures he went through to finally generate crystals that could be used to decipher the ribosome. These chapters were difficult to follow for a layman like myself, but I stuck with it. If he took the time to explain his work of many years, the least I could do is spend a couple hours reading about it.The second thought, was that I do not think there was a single person Venki left out of his story that did not have a direct or indirect influence on his project. He went out of his way to talk about a lot of people who pioneered earlier discoveries into crystallizing molecules, mentors who encouraged him to push the boundaries, peers who kept him in check, and students who brought in new fresh ideas to the problem so hand. This is the part of the book I really enjoyed, the simple act of a person who accomplished something significant, giving recognition were it was due."
113,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15971935-mark-stidham,4,"This was a fun read for me because of its subject matter (the elucidation of the structure of the ribosome). It could be of broader interest because it is a first person account of the life of a scientist in a competitive race to solve a scientific question. As a biochemist almost the same age as the author, I related to the story arc, even though there isn't much similarity in our careers. There is the struggle to find a niche, long investments in study and techniques that end up being useless, and frustrating search for job stability. This particular story is similar to others that feature competitive research and the need to obtain respect from peers. The author spends a good amount of time explaining the benefits and the downsides to the science community hierarchy epitomized by the competition for the Nobel Prize. That Ramakrishnan won a share of the prize is evidence of some objectivity in the process. But overall, the Prize seems more of a club.I was unable to pay attention to this particular race to find the structure of the ribosome, and the book should not be viewed as any more than an introduction to that subject. I look forward to learning the details in the scholarly papers. But it should be mentioned that this incredible biological machine was completely misunderstood not too long ago. It is humbling that such a fundamental process is only now being elucidated, and it shows that there are many more astonishing aspects of our biochemistry to be discovered in the future"

During these tumultuous times, one must stay strong by being sane and there is no more powerful refuge of sanity than books. Thankfully I had packed 3 of them when I had to leave for my emergency service. I finished the first one just last evening. I don't read books on the history of science much often, and had picked up 'Gene Machine' on the recommendations of one of my buddies. This one is Venki Ramakrishnan's side of the fascinating story of how the structure and functions of Ribosome, a cellular organelle, were discovered and how the long journey over decades lead to the Nobel Prize for the author and his two main competitors. The hard work behind every discovery, the cooperation and competition between scientists, the jealousy between them, the politics of awards and their after effects is delved on in detail. The book is a repository of knowledge on biology, which however has been tiring for me as biology was never my favourite subject. In our country, the lives of scientists are never that well discussed except some few like Einstein, Bose, Newton, Meghnad Saha and Jagdish Chandra Bose. This book will be a happy addition to that small grouping. The story of how the structure and functions of the Ribosome, the organelle that synthesizes proteins, and lays the building blocks of life, were explained before the world, is truly an engaging one."
115,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104610180-aquila-michiryu,4,"In Gene Machine, Venki Ramakrishnan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, recounts his scientific journey of unraveling the structure of the ribosome and its biological mysteries. More than that, he honestly reveals the politics and competition present in the realm of science, and how various factors such as luck, personalities, jealousy, money and the desire for awards can all inextricably influence the potential for success as a scientist. He also shares his views on the Nobel Prize (and his experience of winning the prize) and how there is subjectivity present when the panel decides who the prize should be awarded to.As a biology student, I learnt about the ribosome when I studied about the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome. At that time, I didn’t place much thought on how the information in my lecture notes came about. How did scientists find out about the structures of the various components in the cell? And specifically, how did they know what function each component played? Admittedly, these questions rarely crossed my mind when I was a student then, since I didn’t want to waste time ruminating on whatever wasn’t in the syllabus at that time.Reading this book has revealed the “behind-the-scenes” of the scientific discovery of ribosome and I realised that I have underestimated the amount of time and effort these scientists have spent to glean the knowledge we can now comfortably obtain. Moreover, I appreciate the author’s objective revelation about the presence of politics and competition in the scientific community, including how the highly-respected Nobel Prize can be subjective and fallible, things I didn’t hear about previously.Having said that, I can expect readers unfamiliar with the ribosome to not appreciate this book as much due to its scientific nature (though the author tries to simplify the highly scientific details to make it easier for general readers to understand). I had to research on X-Ray Crystallography to find out exactly how it works as it was only briefly mentioned in the book.If you know what the ribosome is, this is an insightful and enlightening book to read!"
116,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90507383-mahin,5,"My friends who aren’t in STEM are incredulous to find out how hyper-competitive (and cut-throat) research can be. Science is viewed as incorruptible. But that doesn’t mean that scientists are necessarily paragons of rationality or truth; sometimes, they guard their knowledge and results out of fear that a peer will ""scoop"" them. In spite of this, science is a collaborative process by necessity. In Gene Machine, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan shares his perspective on the race to discover the ribosome’s structure. He also shares his experiences as an outsider; first as a physicist by training who belatedly discovered his interest in biology and second as an Indian immigrant to the US, where he often lived in majority-white towns (in Ohio and Utah). As a biochemist, I found that Venki explained his research in a way that is accessible to those who aren't scientists (or even biologists). As a result, I found myself skimming over descriptions of DNA, RNA, and other elementary biological concepts; but I appreciated their inclusion for readers who may have forgotten or don't have that knowledge. Another reviewer remarked that you wouldn't expect a book about the discovery of the ribosome's structure to be so gripping, an assessment with which I agree. I think Gene Machine will prove to be one of the best science books to be published in 2018."

That is to say, it follows the well-trodden path of 
The Double Helix
. It definitely gets a lot more hard-science than other books in that vein, though; I found some of the technical details about the ribosome hard to follow here, but I admit the problem may well have been that I had to put down the book for a couple of months halfway through and in the interim forgot the intricacies that he'd introduced earlier.

I am not very interested in chemistry, so I did not find it much interesting.Researchers however must read it to check out how that world functions. Author calls Noble prize a lottery! He honestly describes the pitfalls and limitations of Nobel (or any recognition). It helps to put the awards and recognition in perspective. Many times mind tricks us in thinking award as the aim. This book can tell you how random the selection actually is! It is not exactly correlated with the work you do, work is ofcourse important but there are other dominant factors which no one can control.Concluding -For scientists - must readOthers can safely skip. You won't miss anything.By the way, this is a kind of accidental read for me.

Ramakrishnan is less relatable and perhaps not as self-reflective or self-aware as Jahren, but his love of the work and his wry sense of humor shines through.

129,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30640144-abhijit-basu,4,"REVIEW OF VENKI RAMAKRISHNAN’S ‘GENE MACHINE’What are ribosomes? Why are they of such importance that teams of dedicated chemical and biological scientists across the world made it their lives’ mission to investigate ribosome’s inner structure over three decades since the early 1980s? The reason behind the great scientific quest is that the genetic information encoded on the DNA would have been of no use without the ribosome molecule as essential cellular processing machine to translate these instructions for making proteins, the building blocks of life. It is on this logic that the 2009 Chemistry Nobel Laureate (joint) Sir Venki Ramakrishnan calls his memoir ‘gene machine.’ Foremost among the factors that make the book so appealing to read is the author’s personal candour – about his ambition, about his professional worries and above all else, about his determination to count in the race for scientific recognition as a ‘dark horse.’ As Siddhartha Mukherjee (author of ‘Emperor of All Maladies’) puts it, his story is that of an ‘outsider’ – twice over. First, as an immigrant settling in the USA and UK, and then, as a PhD in Physics doing his life’s chosen work in molecular biology. Another quality of the book is the author’s writing style. Ramakrishnan has his own way with words and even the more technical middle chapters of the book are laced with enough humour and witty anecdotes to keep interest alive. He is a master of metaphor too – making complex science understandable to lay readers with simple examples. After putting things scientifically – that the ribosome, a ‘giant’ molecule with over a million atoms (still small enough to pack 4000 in the width of a human hair), is the link between our genes and the proteins they specify, he makes the point that understanding how it works will depend on how it structurally looks. He then drives home the importance of that knowing and understanding by a simple allegory. Imagine you are a Martian peering down at earth, he says. You observe tiny objects moving straight or occasionally turning. Look little closer and you find movement happens only when tinier moving things enter those objects. Driven by curiosity, you want to see how the objects are constructed. You find that it is made of numerous working parts, including an engine connected to a crankshaft that makes the wheels turn. You look even closer to find that the engine itself has pistons and sucks in fuel and air that is ignited with a spark plug to drive the piston forward. It is the same with understanding molecules that make life. Understanding DNA and RNA molecules was a big step. But cracking the jigsaw puzzle needed understanding of how the ‘enormous’ ribosomes were constructed which enabled them to decode the DNA information of nucleotide sequence carried by messenger RNAs ‘to stitch together amino acids brought by transfer RNAs into protein.’ Importantly, the author also explains how, by knowing the structure and components of the bacterial ribosome, the work has opened up avenues to development of new antibiotics.It is an engaging story about the agonies and ecstasies, about the disappointments and lucky breaks of ‘rival’ scientists competing in a race for success. The pursuit of success is often made tense by an atmosphere surcharged with ‘politics for recognition.’ At the same time there is cooperation too among the community of scientists, helped by seminars, conferences and mutual discussions which enable cross-pollination of ideas. Ramakrishnan attributes this competitive cooperation to the ‘inbred’ nature of modern scientific discoveries. The 2009 Chemistry Nobel Prize was awarded jointly to three persons. Ada Yonath from Israel was the first to make headway in ribosome crystallisation and kept at it with dogged application for decades. Then there was Tom Steitz, American biochemist and a leading crystallographer of his generation, who, in collaboration with Peter Moore, effectively began the last lap of the race by publishing the atomic structure of the larger (50S) ribosomal subunit. Finally, there was Venki Ramakrishnan, an ‘accidental ribosome biologist’ and a latecomer to the field, who caught up with the others by leading his energetic team of bright postdoc and student associates working round the clock across their trans-Atlantic divide at Cambridge and Utah to achieve high-resolution ‘crystal’ structure of the smaller (30S) ribosome subunit (and later the entire (70S) ribosome, throwing light on the code translation process and on the mechanism of blocking action exploited by antibiotics). Yet, as candidly acknowledged by the author, there were other key contributors who got regrettably left out of Nobel recognition due to the ‘three-recipient limitation’ of the prize. Moreover, as Ramakrishnan himself alludes to in the book’s epilogue, while he and the two others received the recognition for their pioneering work in using crystallography to explore ribosome, with subsequent advancement in electron microscopy, a more direct method allowing higher resolution is now available to investigate organelle structure. The epilogue also contains an endearingly modest, even bordering on philosophical, reflection by the author, in the context of the flood of honours and awards that he received following the ‘Nobel Lottery’, as he calls it, echoing Francis Crick. Referencing the Bible, he cites Matthew 13.12: 'For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.' As already mentioned, the book has quite a few comical anecdotes to liven up things. For instance, there is the story of how Pat Unwin and Carlos Taddei worked at obtaining two-dimensional protein crystals from lizard ovary cells in 1977—the first demonstration that ribosomes were indeed crystallizable. The maverick Taddei was given to insouciantly puffing at his cigar in the lab and regularly setting off the fire alarms. After some time, the experiment was abandoned as the crystals were found not good enough to reveal a detailed atomic arrangement. The unchaperoned lizards left in the basement escaped and were to be seen scampering around the grounds of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology for years thereafter. Another interesting anecdote relates to the author’s two encounters with James Watson. On both occasions, the brash and acerbic American geneticist made light of Ramakrishnan’s labours, saying, ‘Forget the Nobel.’ However, the same Watson was seen attending a lecture by Ramakrishnan and later dispelling Ramakrishnan’s apprehensions by approving his selection as a Nobel Committee expert for the coveted Prize.A COMPARISONIn my personal view as a one-time researcher in Chemistry and a lover of good literature, ‘Gene Machine’ is a thrilling story of a down-to-earth scientist’s quest in a niche area of research holding promise for a clearer understanding of the secrets of life and of better ways to treat complicated maladies. In comparison with other genre books written by Nobel Laureate scientists, I would rate the book in the ‘very good’ category, with a four stars grade. ‘The Double Helix’ (1968) – James Watson’s brilliant account of decoding the DNA – gets ‘excellent’ rating with five stars to boot. But at the top rung of my assessment would be ‘Order out of Chaos’ (1984) – a deeply thought-provoking account of the philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics and its theory of entropy or universal tendency towards disorderliness – written by Ilya Prigogine, 1977 Physical Chemistry Nobel Laureate and his co-author, scientific philosopher Isabelle Stengers. That book, with its readability value and profound philosophical contents, should merit a super-excellent six-star rating almost at par with Erwin Schrödinger’s 1943 book, ‘What is Life?’ Of course, Schrödinger’s book, being an amazingly prophetic foray by a Quantum Physicist into the chemical-biological secret of life’s ‘code script’ is of a different class because it transcends the borders of the scientist’s own Nobel-winning work. Yet all said and done, ‘Gene Machine’, with its insights into the pleasures and pains of the race for scientific recognition, certainly deserves a place of its own at these commanding heights of scientific literature."
130,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43858998-linda-gaines,2,"I'm rather disappointed with this book. First I was really interested in learning about the ribosome and how it functions was discovered. I do feel like I learned a bit, but I really don't understand the different techniques they used to understand how it works. I just don't think it was explained well. Secondly, this book needed a better editor. I understand it was a personal story of the author's career and how the various scientists interacted, but it went off on far too many tangents such that I got lost. So many people were introduced, but only superficially, that I completely forgot who most of them were by the end of the chapter. Also, near the beginning the author talks about the discovery of the structure of DNA and never once mentions Rosalind Franklin, which was a particularly glaring omission. Then halfway through the book, she in mentioned with regards to people who used to be in her lab, and he never explains who she was and what she did for science and DNA. Not once. Perhaps I should blame the editor and not the author for that. In any event, the book needed a better editor."
131,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9309543-dana-slaughter,2,"This book is really for people in know and in the research world. Much of it highlights the various researchers, post docs, grad students etc. involved in the search for understanding the structure and function of the ribosome. The lab techniques are difficult to follow at best, even for someone with a science background. Every now and then there are revealing bits of information as to what was discovered. There is a place for this type of writing, but it just didn't hold my interest. What did strike me is how complex the research world is. Collaboration and competition go hand in hand - not an easy pair to balance! Also, many many people, sometimes over generations, are often involved in these major breakthroughs. I understand the need to recognize them and regret that I just wasn't able to take all of those individual stories in."
132,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52557863-grrlscientist,4,"What it is really like to be a scientist, especially a scientist who has been awarded the “most nobel” scientific prize of all?Written by 2009 co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Venkatraman “Venki” Ramakrishnan, an American and British structural biologist who grew up in India, 
Gene Machine: The race to decipher the secrets of the ribosome
 (Basic Books; 2018) is an engaging account of one man’s many scientific contributions to solve the structure of the ribosome, a small structure that is the workhorse of the cell, building the proteins necessary for life.The author begins his story in India, where he studied physics before immigrating to the United States to earn his doctorate in physics. During this time, he met and married — a major life event served to refocus his attention on how to successfully provide for his family as a working scientist. Confronted with a lifetime of “boring and incremental calculations that wouldn’t result in any real advance in understanding”, Dr. Ramakrishnan took a big risk and abruptly shifted his career focus to molecular biology after reading an article about the ribosome in Scientific American. To do this, he spent two years as a grad student in molecular biology at UCSD, gaining essential knowledge and skills necessary to pursue his new career.Because electron microscopy was in its infancy during most of this work, this meant that an older technique, x-ray crystallography, was the main tool used to decipher the structure of the ribosome. But x-ray crystallography created fuzzier, less detailed images than electron microscopy, so this led to the field being informally known as “blobology”.Despite disappointments and setbacks in his second career, Dr. Ramakrishnan persisted for more than 30 years before being awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, being named president of the Royal Society of London, the world’s oldest scientific society and then being knighted in the 2012. (He does not generally use the honorific ‘Sir’.)In this book, Dr. Ramakrishnan clearly explains the science, and highlights the sometimes convoluted process of how science actually works. He details the inside story of lab life including the struggles, failures and blind alleys, the collaborators and friends, the professional competitors and rivals, and the timely and critically important help provided by a number of scientists, as Dr. Ramakrishnan and his team worked tirelessly to solve the structure of this microscopic biological machine. As the story of the author’s professional life unfolds, we learn how a scientist develops the ideas, skills, tools — and the people, along with all the quirks and talents that each one embodies — that are essential to achieve such a remarkable scientific discovery.This profoundly human story is written with honesty and humility, and the author isn’t afraid to laugh at himself. For example, his story about the phone call in October was amusing, and he even shares his wife’s incredulous response when she first learned he had won the Nobel Prize: “I thought you had to be really smart to win one of those!” (Ramakrishnan 237).One element of this story that impressed me most was Dr. Ramakrishnan’s unfailing generosity to his collaborators and his competitors alike. In fact, one of the key themes in this book is that most contemporary science is not about individual achievement; rather, it’s a synthesis of ideas and progress by teams of highly dedicated individuals who devote their lives to solving questions they find compelling.At the end of the book, Dr. Ramakrishnan ponders the nature of science: “When we have a clear goal in mind, we think we are struggling to reach a summit. But there is no summit. When we get there, we realize we have just climbed a foothill, and there is an endless series of mountains ahead still to be climbed.” (Ramakrishnan 256).The author devotes the Epilogue to present some thoughts on the influence (both good and bad) of Truly Big Prizes, particularly the Nobel and the Breakthrough Prizes, upon scientific careers and scientific progress:“So I don’t subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even that much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We humans tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible. And when someone like Newton or Einstein sees much further than others, or Watson and Crick synthesize in one stroke the essential features of DNA that might have dribbled out in pieces, we tend to immortalize them.” (Ramakrishnan 264).This lucid and highly readable account will be enjoyed by students in any of the sciences, by those interested in the history of science, or who love reading memoirs. But really, I think that anyone who is captivated by an absorbing story well told will find much to appreciate in this fascinating book.NOTE: Originally published at Forbes on 30 November 2018.

A work for which the Author shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Ada Yonath and Tom Steitz. A very enriching experience in getting to know about such serious hard work to understand the intricate machineries of living beings in such a 'crystal' clear manner put forward by Venki Ramakrishnan."
134,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57579670-mateus,4,"If you are looking for an explanation of genetics and how DNA works, this book is not the right one. If, however, you are looking to understand what exactly the life of a scientist can entail, then pick up a copy and dig in, you're in for a wild intercontinental ride!I rated this book 4/5, from an internal scoring of 8, two points were dropped for the name dropping (a LOT of people are named) and slightly opaque scientific descriptions."
135,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/534526-robert,3,"Having just finished helping my daughter study for her AP biology exam, I was able to hang with some of the technical discussion. However, this book is still very science heavy.Interesting look into how the scientific/academic/Nobel prize world works. Pretty dry."
136,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"Venki Ramakrishnan’s book is the story of the race to understand the structure and workings of the ribosome, and his part in that. He comes across as a modest, self-deprecating person, able to reveal his weaknesses as well as his strengths, and someone who is generous in acknowledging the contributions of others. As with many scientists of great aptitude, he lacks arrogance and at times comes across as quite diffident as to his abilities, fearing that others are better qualified than he is to solve this puzzle. His book does a wonderful job of conveying the combination of friendliness and rivalry that accompanies any scientific contest, no more so than when solving a problem of this importance. The journey is a roller coaster where one day his team seems to be ahead of his rivals, and the next a paper is published that suggests they are behind. He successfully expresses how his emotions rose and sank, as he continually tried to figure out where he was in relation to others in the race. In some respects, the book reminds me of The Double Helix by James Watson which recounts a similar, frantic rush to beat the competition to establish the structure of an important biological molecule. A chapter I found fascinating was one where Ramakrishnan discussed the politics of scientific awards, including the Nobel Prize, arguing that the system can become a closed-club where the same scientists repeatedly win prestigious honours. He was particularly critical of Nobel Prizes, writing: “Because many of the early Nobel laureates were giants in their field, the idea has taken hold – especially among non-scientists – that Nobel laureates are geniuses. In fact, the prize is not awarded for being a great scientist but rather for making a groundbreaking discovery or invention. Some of them may be extraordinarily brilliant, but others are just good scientists who were persistent or happened to stumble onto a major finding. Being in the right place at the right time often helped enormously”. He also blasted the rule that limits the number of winners to three. This may have been appropriate a century ago, but nowadays it doesn’t reflect the collaboration, intentional or otherwise, that marks most major scientific advances.He also writes about what he calls post-Nobelitis. As he puts it: “Suddenly, scientists are thrust into the limelight and bask in the public adulation that goes with it. They are asked for their opinion on everything under the sun, regardless of their own expertise, and it soon goes to their head. Some of them are long past their prime, having made their big discoveries decades earlier, and the renewed attention means that they spend their time wandering around the world, pontificating about all sorts of things”. Ramakrishnan knew that solving the mystery of the ribosome was worthy of a Nobel Prize but, with the rule of three in mind, he honestly admits that “I started worrying about my relative contribution and whether I would be perceived as a Johnny-come-lately rather than a pioneer”.Despite his cynicism about how the system works, Ramakrishnan comes across as extremely ambitious and someone who spent a lot of time fretting whether he would miss out on this ultimate scientific accolade. Would the ribosome really merit an award? And, if so, which three of the numerous scientists involved during something like 20 years of research would be named on the citation? A criticism I have of the book is that so many scientists are named that it is easy to lose track of who did what, where and when. Unfortunately, there is no index so when a name reappears there is no simple way of tracing when he or she was first mentioned. Furthermore, after they have been first introduced, Ramakrishnan often refers to scientists only by their first names, and the text is littered with references to Tom, Dick (actually Richard!) and Harry, which means that even having an index would be of limited value as an aide memoire. Perhaps a cast list might be better.Based on his personal experience, Ramakrishnan provides lots of interesting details about the mechanism of announcing and then awarding the Nobel Prizes. No doubt like many other recipients have been, he was very suspicious when he received the phone call from Sweden informing him that he’d won. Also, curiously, he tells us that the banquet after the ceremony is televised and shown live in Sweden. But he comments: “I wouldn’t have thought spending the evening watching a group of strangers eat would make for much drama, but there were speeches and entertainment”.The book is quite technical in places, notably in terms of crystallographic techniques. Nonetheless, it is not necessary to understand the details in order to enjoy this book because this is an account of how the race for a Nobel Prize is won, or, more often, lost. And therein lies the focus of the book."
137,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107551528-shweata-n,5,"Science is often thought to be done by scientists who isolate themselves in a cocoon and come out with a breakthrough and fly like a butterfly. But this is far far from the realities of academia. 'Gene Machine' brilliantly portraits the competitive nature of science. The book is successful in making us realize that breakthroughs that come about in science are often driven by competition amongst peers, which is quite contrary to what is perceived by the ones outside of academia. The author begins his career in academia and is up for a rather shaky start with several ups and downs, finally deciding to switch fields from being a theoretical physicist to a biologist. In the book, he goes on to give an honest account of his academic career, making bold remarks about various events and people, along the way. Also, his descriptions do not fail to capture the competitiveness in science which often isn't touched upon by many. Not to mention, Venki Ramakrishnan has also done a great job in elucidating some of the complex and technical concepts of ribosomes, proteins, crystallography and others. He has done it in such a way that it is easy for anyone with any/no prior knowledge of the subject to understand the concepts and the limitation in our understanding of it. I felt that the analogies he used, especially the car one to help us realize the limitations in understanding of ribosome,were really simple yet amazing.One thing that was consistent throughout the book was that he consistently acknowledged the fact that he was really lucky and had the right set of people and ideas to make that breakthrough. His first breakthrough comes when his team is able to decipher the structure of the 30S structure of the ribosome. Then they go on to solve the atomic structure of the whole ribosome.And finally, he isn't afraid of discussing about the fact that the idea of prizes and awards. He remarks that ""Nevertheless, scientists are only human. Like everyone else, we can be ambitious and competitive and crave recognition. Instead of inculcating a feeling that the work is its own reward, the scientific establishment feeds this desire to feel special and somehow better than our peers at virtually every stage of the process"". This sort of encompassed the idea of awards are flawed yet people tend to associate high value to it and it is the intrinsic nature of humans to do so. He also goes on to criticize the Nobel prize because it's only awarded to three people in a field each year. This doesn't hold good with the fact that scientific discoveries are usually bought out by a group not a single person and therefore it doesn't make sense to give it to just three people. However, he wins the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009 along with his competitors Ada and Tom.In the epilogue, he says: "" I don't subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible"". I think this sort of sums up my views on science too. ( I must confess that he has phrased it so well, I could never have done that!)In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it who wants to know what 'real' science works and who wants to know the realities of being in academia."
138,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,4,"Nobel Laurate Venki Ramakrishnan’s first book is about his experiences in the race to elucidate the structure of ribosome. I had read an excerpt from this book earlier, where he talked about how winning a Nobel prize may not be the best thing for the scientist and how prizes, at times can be unfair. I liked it very much and was keen on reading the whole book. I finally got the chance after borrowing a copy from a friend.The book starts out with his experiences as a student of physics and his almost accidental entry into biology. It then covers his postdoctoral work that got him interested in ribosomes in the first place followed by his incredible journey across America and then to MRC, Cambridge, which was across the ocean. The book is mostly a personal account, focusing on his experiences and the struggles he and his lab went through. It eventually culminates with his winning the prize and the Nobel prize ceremony. I found the book highly additive and an easy read. Ramakrishnan has done a really nice job of explaining the challenges he faced. Especially, the part on x-ray crystallography is so well written that even someone like me, who runs away from these techniques could understand it. As someone who is in academia, what I liked most about the book though is the honesty and frankness with which the story has been narrated. He has been open about all the politics surrounding the whole ribosome community and science in general. He has also not shied away from his own competitiveness, secrecy and prejudice. Another great point is that he has acknowledged the work of his lab members because in the end, the success is as much theirs as his. After reading this book, I came to know of quite a few things. For instance, in the scientific community, the present trend has been towards doing more collaborative work. However, it has not been the case always. When scientists compete with each other for the same thing as was the case with the ribosome structure, things can at times become ugly. Overall, it may or may not turn to be good for science overall. However, in this case, the ending was happy and the efforts of all those involved lead to an addition of our understanding of one of the fundamental phenomena of nature.Finally, I would say that this book has been an enjoyable read. I think it is definitely a must read for every biologist!"
139,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46231899-laurie89,5," The ‘Gene Machine’ is a fascinating account of Venki Ramakrishnan’s path to uncovering the structure of the ribosome, which resulted in his receiving the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The cast of characters and places in this narrative are truly captivating and provide a cross-sectional view of the scientific life. The book provides insight into how successful scientific careers are forged. The starting point is Dr Ramakrishnan’s journey from India to a Ph.D program in physics at Ohio University. After obtaining a Ph.D. the author poignantly describes his decision to switch fields to biology and how this naturally led him to structural biology. A striking inclusion in this story are the descriptions of the self-doubt and the reasoning behind each change in position; from UC San Diego to Yale, Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island to Oak Ridge National laboratory Tennessee, Utah and finally the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. The author finds the right balance in describing the science and the important roles that his colleagues, mentors and students played. Ultimately the depictions of his laboratory and the research environment provide the reader with a taste of what is involved in a successful competitive scientific career. The humility of the author shines throughout the story.  The heart of the narrative focuses on the race to reveal the structure of the ribosome, which manufactures proteins from the genetic code. While the ribosome is often overlooked by the general public, it is of utmost importance the functioning of all cellular life. The expository includes the history of ribosome and the genetic code, basic biology and the basic techniques in x-ray crystallography. The true break-through in structural biology that was necessary to realize the high resolution images is less clear. It would have greatly helped if there had been an appendix to describe this part of the science so that the readers could have also understand this important context. The book is also lacking an index and a more detailed bibliography of the resulting scientific articles.  This skillful memoir, which is fast paced and reads like a novel, is likely to become a scientific classic about the competition at the cutting edge of science. "
140,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42307468-siddharth-saravanan,3,"This book had 3 distinct phases for me. 1st phase regarding his emigration to the US and his subsequent foray into different aspects of Science was engaging, especially the way in which the author almost accidentally stumbled upon something which would turn out to be his lifelong goal! //Made me reflect on the fact that we need to be open in trying out different aspects of a particular field/life in order to land on something which we feel passionate towards dedicating a major portion of our lives 2nd phase covers the methods used by the author and the madcap race to cross the finishing line before anybody else. Although I'm a student of Biology, most of the science flew over my head because it dealt with techniques like crystallography, X-ray diffraction etc. which I have little idea about. The race to discover the structure is fascinating, but we'll have to wade through multiple scientific techniques and dozens of names and contributions from different people involved in the process, which can be quite hard.//Found it fascinating how so many different people are involved in the process. Though it makes the reading hard, really loved how the author credited every single person involved in the mammoth race! 3rd phase, and the best phase, talks about the ecosystem of prizes and the very hit-and-miss nature of them. We as a society have glorified the Nobel Prize, and rightly so. However it was illuminating reading about how the Nobel isn't all encompassing and is flawed in quite a few ways, along with the numerous other scientific prizes. Gave me a lot of perspective on the nature of credit, and the unfairness which is intrinsic in the whole process//(Brownie points for the statement that ethnic and ultra nationalistic pride is the opposite of racism and xenophobia. Rang true within me)"
141,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,2,"Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most difficult to answer. One such is that of how many Indians have won the Nobel Prize so far. The figure can be as high as twelve, if you count Ronald Ross, Rudyard Kipling, Dalai Lama, V S Naipaul and Mother Teresa. Some or of Indian origin, or been born in India or left India too early in their career. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan was a graduate of Physics from Baroda but immediately migrated to the US for further studies. He won the Nobel in Chemistry in 2009 for ribosome research along with two others. Ramakrishnan’s research strengthened our understanding of the fundamental processes of life and provided a clue to the evolution of modern species of life. This book is a combination of popular science and an autobiography with a seamless blending of the two. His life is devoted to research and learning.We know that our genetic material is locked up in a structure called DNA inside the nucleus of each of our cells. Apart from heredity, these contain recipes for building proteins which are essential for life. Insulin, adrenaline and albumin are all proteins required to sustain the organism. What makes these proteins inside a cell is a molecular gene-machine called ribosome. This machine reads the component list from data derived from the DNA and assembles the protein using amino acids just like a production line. The critical nature of the process need not be emphasized further, as the animal will soon be dead if the pathways are somehow clogged. Virtually every molecule in every cell in every form of life is either made by the ribosome or made by enzymes that are themselves made by ribosomes. Discovery of ribosomes and its role in making protein is the culmination of one of the great triumphs in modern biology. This was by no means easy as the ribosome is not a simple molecule like DNA. It was enormous and complex. The attempt to decipher it was taken up by Crick and Watson, who found the structure of DNA but was abandoned in despair.Ramakrishnan was attracted to ribosomes by an article in the magazine Scientific American. He knew practically nothing of biology which he made up through courses studied part-time. Thus we have a physicist who studied the structure of a crucial biological unit being awarded with a Nobel in chemistry! He attempted to solve the ribosome structure first by neutron scattering which was eventually proved ineffective but was well understood by people with a physics background. The author dwells at length on the step by step progress in revealing the structure and the race with other scientists doing similar work, but this is not in a form that can be easily digested by ordinary readers. I found it extremely tedious especially after reading Siddhartha Mukherjee’s great book ‘The Gene - An Intimate History’ a few weeks before. Of course, you cannot expect such lucidity from a Nobel laureate, but the pertinent fact is that almost all of the readers are not Nobel laureates themselves. It is only during the autobiographical passages that the book becomes even slightly interesting.Study of ribosomes is important in learning how medicines cure us of diseases. Some antibiotics work by blocking the protein creation function of bacterial ribosomes. This is done by binding to a vulnerable location in its structure. Since bacterial and human ribosomes are very different, humans will not be adversely affected by the mechanism of its action. This study also casts light on the dark alleyways of early evolution. Building blocks of RNA can be made from simple chemicals that could have been around in the earth billions of years ago. It may be possible that life emerged with lots of randomly made RNA molecules until some of them could reproduce entirely by themselves. RNA could also preserve heredity between generations.This book presents some valid advice to novices in scientific research. The author asks them not to be hesitant to ask questions, however basic it might be. He justifies it by claiming that no question is too stupid to ask if you want to know the answer. It is also a bare necessity for present-day researchers to belong to the top-line institutes and laboratories. Advanced science has now become a team effort transcending national frontiers and continental boundaries. The members of the theoretical and testing facilities should be known to each other, otherwise it would be difficult to obtain and manage precious time allocated for using sophisticated machines.The author makes a short but pointed criticism of the Nobel award conventions. There is a ‘Rule of Three’ in force. This means that the award, if shared, shall not be divided into more than three parts. This criterion is claimed to be impractical now. When the prize started in 1901, scientists worked in relative isolation and met only once every few years. By the time they announced their results, there was no question of who had discovered what. In the current world, an idea quickly spreads and a lot of people contribute to it in various measures and capacities. And it is not always clear whether the original idea or a later contribution was the truly ground breaking advance. It is a difficult task to select three people from a crowd of somewhat equal contributors without causing resentment or heartburn.Ramakrishnan left India very early and harbours no soft spots in his mind for the mother country. Ignorant of his real feelings, thousands of naïve Indians sent congratulatory emails to him upon winning the Nobel. This clogged his inbox and they received a curt reminder that ‘nationality was an accident of birth’ and by corollary, he does not attach much importance to it. This is a clear case of brain drain.The narrative about the role and secrets of ribosomes is disappointingly matter-of-fact. The author has failed to share the awe he might have felt in revealing the heretofore hidden details. The scientist’s idea of a paper for publishing in a journal is too far away from an ordinary reader’s preference of what is interesting. The book is a veritable Who’s Who of the rapidly growing field of structural biology in general and ribosomes in particular. The author has had a great collaboration with like-minded scholars from across the globe. There are many photographs of co-workers and even rivals. The illustrations given as part of the description are not at all helpful. Relevance has not been a parameter for inclusion as we even see a conceptual diagram of a four-stroke internal combustion engine as part of the narrative.The book is recommended only to serious readers."
142,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"I want sure what I got myself into when I picked up this book, but I can definitely say that it was well worth the read. While the book is focused primarily on figuring out the structure of the ribosome, the story Venki shares about his entrance into this particular field in science, the people he's met and worked with, and what came about from all of his work is very informative. We often hear about the accomplishment of folks like Venki, but rarely get a glimpse of what they went through to get there, this book covers that and more.Upon completing the book, I was left with two lingering thoughts, the first was I had no idea what he was talking about towards the later half of the book. Venki writes, in great detail the vast test, processes, and failures he went through to finally generate crystals that could be used to decipher the ribosome. These chapters were difficult to follow for a layman like myself, but I stuck with it. If he took the time to explain his work of many years, the least I could do is spend a couple hours reading about it.The second thought, was that I do not think there was a single person Venki left out of his story that did not have a direct or indirect influence on his project. He went out of his way to talk about a lot of people who pioneered earlier discoveries into crystallizing molecules, mentors who encouraged him to push the boundaries, peers who kept him in check, and students who brought in new fresh ideas to the problem so hand. This is the part of the book I really enjoyed, the simple act of a person who accomplished something significant, giving recognition were it was due."
143,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15971935-mark-stidham,4,"This was a fun read for me because of its subject matter (the elucidation of the structure of the ribosome). It could be of broader interest because it is a first person account of the life of a scientist in a competitive race to solve a scientific question. As a biochemist almost the same age as the author, I related to the story arc, even though there isn't much similarity in our careers. There is the struggle to find a niche, long investments in study and techniques that end up being useless, and frustrating search for job stability. This particular story is similar to others that feature competitive research and the need to obtain respect from peers. The author spends a good amount of time explaining the benefits and the downsides to the science community hierarchy epitomized by the competition for the Nobel Prize. That Ramakrishnan won a share of the prize is evidence of some objectivity in the process. But overall, the Prize seems more of a club.I was unable to pay attention to this particular race to find the structure of the ribosome, and the book should not be viewed as any more than an introduction to that subject. I look forward to learning the details in the scholarly papers. But it should be mentioned that this incredible biological machine was completely misunderstood not too long ago. It is humbling that such a fundamental process is only now being elucidated, and it shows that there are many more astonishing aspects of our biochemistry to be discovered in the future"

During these tumultuous times, one must stay strong by being sane and there is no more powerful refuge of sanity than books. Thankfully I had packed 3 of them when I had to leave for my emergency service. I finished the first one just last evening. I don't read books on the history of science much often, and had picked up 'Gene Machine' on the recommendations of one of my buddies. This one is Venki Ramakrishnan's side of the fascinating story of how the structure and functions of Ribosome, a cellular organelle, were discovered and how the long journey over decades lead to the Nobel Prize for the author and his two main competitors. The hard work behind every discovery, the cooperation and competition between scientists, the jealousy between them, the politics of awards and their after effects is delved on in detail. The book is a repository of knowledge on biology, which however has been tiring for me as biology was never my favourite subject. In our country, the lives of scientists are never that well discussed except some few like Einstein, Bose, Newton, Meghnad Saha and Jagdish Chandra Bose. This book will be a happy addition to that small grouping. The story of how the structure and functions of the Ribosome, the organelle that synthesizes proteins, and lays the building blocks of life, were explained before the world, is truly an engaging one."
145,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104610180-aquila-michiryu,4,"In Gene Machine, Venki Ramakrishnan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, recounts his scientific journey of unraveling the structure of the ribosome and its biological mysteries. More than that, he honestly reveals the politics and competition present in the realm of science, and how various factors such as luck, personalities, jealousy, money and the desire for awards can all inextricably influence the potential for success as a scientist. He also shares his views on the Nobel Prize (and his experience of winning the prize) and how there is subjectivity present when the panel decides who the prize should be awarded to.As a biology student, I learnt about the ribosome when I studied about the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome. At that time, I didn’t place much thought on how the information in my lecture notes came about. How did scientists find out about the structures of the various components in the cell? And specifically, how did they know what function each component played? Admittedly, these questions rarely crossed my mind when I was a student then, since I didn’t want to waste time ruminating on whatever wasn’t in the syllabus at that time.Reading this book has revealed the “behind-the-scenes” of the scientific discovery of ribosome and I realised that I have underestimated the amount of time and effort these scientists have spent to glean the knowledge we can now comfortably obtain. Moreover, I appreciate the author’s objective revelation about the presence of politics and competition in the scientific community, including how the highly-respected Nobel Prize can be subjective and fallible, things I didn’t hear about previously.Having said that, I can expect readers unfamiliar with the ribosome to not appreciate this book as much due to its scientific nature (though the author tries to simplify the highly scientific details to make it easier for general readers to understand). I had to research on X-Ray Crystallography to find out exactly how it works as it was only briefly mentioned in the book.If you know what the ribosome is, this is an insightful and enlightening book to read!"
146,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90507383-mahin,5,"My friends who aren’t in STEM are incredulous to find out how hyper-competitive (and cut-throat) research can be. Science is viewed as incorruptible. But that doesn’t mean that scientists are necessarily paragons of rationality or truth; sometimes, they guard their knowledge and results out of fear that a peer will ""scoop"" them. In spite of this, science is a collaborative process by necessity. In Gene Machine, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan shares his perspective on the race to discover the ribosome’s structure. He also shares his experiences as an outsider; first as a physicist by training who belatedly discovered his interest in biology and second as an Indian immigrant to the US, where he often lived in majority-white towns (in Ohio and Utah). As a biochemist, I found that Venki explained his research in a way that is accessible to those who aren't scientists (or even biologists). As a result, I found myself skimming over descriptions of DNA, RNA, and other elementary biological concepts; but I appreciated their inclusion for readers who may have forgotten or don't have that knowledge. Another reviewer remarked that you wouldn't expect a book about the discovery of the ribosome's structure to be so gripping, an assessment with which I agree. I think Gene Machine will prove to be one of the best science books to be published in 2018."

That is to say, it follows the well-trodden path of 
The Double Helix
. It definitely gets a lot more hard-science than other books in that vein, though; I found some of the technical details about the ribosome hard to follow here, but I admit the problem may well have been that I had to put down the book for a couple of months halfway through and in the interim forgot the intricacies that he'd introduced earlier. The account is generally otherwise pretty easy to read: the author's surprisingly candid about various things, and he seems like an interesting character."

I am not very interested in chemistry, so I did not find it much interesting.Researchers however must read it to check out how that world functions. Author calls Noble prize a lottery! He honestly describes the pitfalls and limitations of Nobel (or any recognition). It helps to put the awards and recognition in perspective. Many times mind tricks us in thinking award as the aim. This book can tell you how random the selection actually is! It is not exactly correlated with the work you do, work is ofcourse important but there are other dominant factors which no one can control.Concluding -For scientists - must readOthers can safely skip.

Ramakrishnan is less relatable and perhaps not as self-reflective or self-aware as Jahren, but his love of the work and his wry sense of humor shines through.

159,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30640144-abhijit-basu,4,"REVIEW OF VENKI RAMAKRISHNAN’S ‘GENE MACHINE’What are ribosomes? Why are they of such importance that teams of dedicated chemical and biological scientists across the world made it their lives’ mission to investigate ribosome’s inner structure over three decades since the early 1980s? The reason behind the great scientific quest is that the genetic information encoded on the DNA would have been of no use without the ribosome molecule as essential cellular processing machine to translate these instructions for making proteins, the building blocks of life. It is on this logic that the 2009 Chemistry Nobel Laureate (joint) Sir Venki Ramakrishnan calls his memoir ‘gene machine.’ Foremost among the factors that make the book so appealing to read is the author’s personal candour – about his ambition, about his professional worries and above all else, about his determination to count in the race for scientific recognition as a ‘dark horse.’ As Siddhartha Mukherjee (author of ‘Emperor of All Maladies’) puts it, his story is that of an ‘outsider’ – twice over. First, as an immigrant settling in the USA and UK, and then, as a PhD in Physics doing his life’s chosen work in molecular biology. Another quality of the book is the author’s writing style. Ramakrishnan has his own way with words and even the more technical middle chapters of the book are laced with enough humour and witty anecdotes to keep interest alive. He is a master of metaphor too – making complex science understandable to lay readers with simple examples. After putting things scientifically – that the ribosome, a ‘giant’ molecule with over a million atoms (still small enough to pack 4000 in the width of a human hair), is the link between our genes and the proteins they specify, he makes the point that understanding how it works will depend on how it structurally looks. He then drives home the importance of that knowing and understanding by a simple allegory. Imagine you are a Martian peering down at earth, he says. You observe tiny objects moving straight or occasionally turning. Look little closer and you find movement happens only when tinier moving things enter those objects. Driven by curiosity, you want to see how the objects are constructed. You find that it is made of numerous working parts, including an engine connected to a crankshaft that makes the wheels turn. You look even closer to find that the engine itself has pistons and sucks in fuel and air that is ignited with a spark plug to drive the piston forward. It is the same with understanding molecules that make life. Understanding DNA and RNA molecules was a big step. But cracking the jigsaw puzzle needed understanding of how the ‘enormous’ ribosomes were constructed which enabled them to decode the DNA information of nucleotide sequence carried by messenger RNAs ‘to stitch together amino acids brought by transfer RNAs into protein.’ Importantly, the author also explains how, by knowing the structure and components of the bacterial ribosome, the work has opened up avenues to development of new antibiotics.It is an engaging story about the agonies and ecstasies, about the disappointments and lucky breaks of ‘rival’ scientists competing in a race for success. The pursuit of success is often made tense by an atmosphere surcharged with ‘politics for recognition.’ At the same time there is cooperation too among the community of scientists, helped by seminars, conferences and mutual discussions which enable cross-pollination of ideas. Ramakrishnan attributes this competitive cooperation to the ‘inbred’ nature of modern scientific discoveries. The 2009 Chemistry Nobel Prize was awarded jointly to three persons. Ada Yonath from Israel was the first to make headway in ribosome crystallisation and kept at it with dogged application for decades. Then there was Tom Steitz, American biochemist and a leading crystallographer of his generation, who, in collaboration with Peter Moore, effectively began the last lap of the race by publishing the atomic structure of the larger (50S) ribosomal subunit. Finally, there was Venki Ramakrishnan, an ‘accidental ribosome biologist’ and a latecomer to the field, who caught up with the others by leading his energetic team of bright postdoc and student associates working round the clock across their trans-Atlantic divide at Cambridge and Utah to achieve high-resolution ‘crystal’ structure of the smaller (30S) ribosome subunit (and later the entire (70S) ribosome, throwing light on the code translation process and on the mechanism of blocking action exploited by antibiotics). Yet, as candidly acknowledged by the author, there were other key contributors who got regrettably left out of Nobel recognition due to the ‘three-recipient limitation’ of the prize. Moreover, as Ramakrishnan himself alludes to in the book’s epilogue, while he and the two others received the recognition for their pioneering work in using crystallography to explore ribosome, with subsequent advancement in electron microscopy, a more direct method allowing higher resolution is now available to investigate organelle structure. The epilogue also contains an endearingly modest, even bordering on philosophical, reflection by the author, in the context of the flood of honours and awards that he received following the ‘Nobel Lottery’, as he calls it, echoing Francis Crick. Referencing the Bible, he cites Matthew 13.12: 'For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.' As already mentioned, the book has quite a few comical anecdotes to liven up things. For instance, there is the story of how Pat Unwin and Carlos Taddei worked at obtaining two-dimensional protein crystals from lizard ovary cells in 1977—the first demonstration that ribosomes were indeed crystallizable. The maverick Taddei was given to insouciantly puffing at his cigar in the lab and regularly setting off the fire alarms. After some time, the experiment was abandoned as the crystals were found not good enough to reveal a detailed atomic arrangement. The unchaperoned lizards left in the basement escaped and were to be seen scampering around the grounds of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology for years thereafter. Another interesting anecdote relates to the author’s two encounters with James Watson. On both occasions, the brash and acerbic American geneticist made light of Ramakrishnan’s labours, saying, ‘Forget the Nobel.’ However, the same Watson was seen attending a lecture by Ramakrishnan and later dispelling Ramakrishnan’s apprehensions by approving his selection as a Nobel Committee expert for the coveted Prize.A COMPARISONIn my personal view as a one-time researcher in Chemistry and a lover of good literature, ‘Gene Machine’ is a thrilling story of a down-to-earth scientist’s quest in a niche area of research holding promise for a clearer understanding of the secrets of life and of better ways to treat complicated maladies. In comparison with other genre books written by Nobel Laureate scientists, I would rate the book in the ‘very good’ category, with a four stars grade. ‘The Double Helix’ (1968) – James Watson’s brilliant account of decoding the DNA – gets ‘excellent’ rating with five stars to boot. But at the top rung of my assessment would be ‘Order out of Chaos’ (1984) – a deeply thought-provoking account of the philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics and its theory of entropy or universal tendency towards disorderliness – written by Ilya Prigogine, 1977 Physical Chemistry Nobel Laureate and his co-author, scientific philosopher Isabelle Stengers. That book, with its readability value and profound philosophical contents, should merit a super-excellent six-star rating almost at par with Erwin Schrödinger’s 1943 book, ‘What is Life?’ Of course, Schrödinger’s book, being an amazingly prophetic foray by a Quantum Physicist into the chemical-biological secret of life’s ‘code script’ is of a different class because it transcends the borders of the scientist’s own Nobel-winning work. Yet all said and done, ‘Gene Machine’, with its insights into the pleasures and pains of the race for scientific recognition, certainly deserves a place of its own at these commanding heights of scientific literature."
160,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43858998-linda-gaines,2,"I'm rather disappointed with this book. First I was really interested in learning about the ribosome and how it functions was discovered. I do feel like I learned a bit, but I really don't understand the different techniques they used to understand how it works. I just don't think it was explained well. Secondly, this book needed a better editor. I understand it was a personal story of the author's career and how the various scientists interacted, but it went off on far too many tangents such that I got lost. So many people were introduced, but only superficially, that I completely forgot who most of them were by the end of the chapter. Also, near the beginning the author talks about the discovery of the structure of DNA and never once mentions Rosalind Franklin, which was a particularly glaring omission. Then halfway through the book, she in mentioned with regards to people who used to be in her lab, and he never explains who she was and what she did for science and DNA. Not once. Perhaps I should blame the editor and not the author for that. In any event, the book needed a better editor."

There is a place for this type of writing, but it just didn't hold my interest. What did strike me is how complex the research world is. Collaboration and competition go hand in hand - not an easy pair to balance! Also, many many people, sometimes over generations, are often involved in these major breakthroughs.

162,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52557863-grrlscientist,4,"What it is really like to be a scientist, especially a scientist who has been awarded the “most nobel” scientific prize of all?Written by 2009 co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Venkatraman “Venki” Ramakrishnan, an American and British structural biologist who grew up in India, 
Gene Machine: The race to decipher the secrets of the ribosome
 (Basic Books; 2018) is an engaging account of one man’s many scientific contributions to solve the structure of the ribosome, a small structure that is the workhorse of the cell, building the proteins necessary for life.The author begins his story in India, where he studied physics before immigrating to the United States to earn his doctorate in physics. During this time, he met and married — a major life event served to refocus his attention on how to successfully provide for his family as a working scientist. Confronted with a lifetime of “boring and incremental calculations that wouldn’t result in any real advance in understanding”, Dr. Ramakrishnan took a big risk and abruptly shifted his career focus to molecular biology after reading an article about the ribosome in Scientific American. To do this, he spent two years as a grad student in molecular biology at UCSD, gaining essential knowledge and skills necessary to pursue his new career.Because electron microscopy was in its infancy during most of this work, this meant that an older technique, x-ray crystallography, was the main tool used to decipher the structure of the ribosome. But x-ray crystallography created fuzzier, less detailed images than electron microscopy, so this led to the field being informally known as “blobology”.Despite disappointments and setbacks in his second career, Dr. Ramakrishnan persisted for more than 30 years before being awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, being named president of the Royal Society of London, the world’s oldest scientific society and then being knighted in the 2012. (He does not generally use the honorific ‘Sir’.)In this book, Dr. Ramakrishnan clearly explains the science, and highlights the sometimes convoluted process of how science actually works. He details the inside story of lab life including the struggles, failures and blind alleys, the collaborators and friends, the professional competitors and rivals, and the timely and critically important help provided by a number of scientists, as Dr. Ramakrishnan and his team worked tirelessly to solve the structure of this microscopic biological machine. As the story of the author’s professional life unfolds, we learn how a scientist develops the ideas, skills, tools — and the people, along with all the quirks and talents that each one embodies — that are essential to achieve such a remarkable scientific discovery.This profoundly human story is written with honesty and humility, and the author isn’t afraid to laugh at himself. For example, his story about the phone call in October was amusing, and he even shares his wife’s incredulous response when she first learned he had won the Nobel Prize: “I thought you had to be really smart to win one of those!” (Ramakrishnan 237).One element of this story that impressed me most was Dr. Ramakrishnan’s unfailing generosity to his collaborators and his competitors alike. In fact, one of the key themes in this book is that most contemporary science is not about individual achievement; rather, it’s a synthesis of ideas and progress by teams of highly dedicated individuals who devote their lives to solving questions they find compelling.At the end of the book, Dr. Ramakrishnan ponders the nature of science: “When we have a clear goal in mind, we think we are struggling to reach a summit. But there is no summit. When we get there, we realize we have just climbed a foothill, and there is an endless series of mountains ahead still to be climbed.” (Ramakrishnan 256).The author devotes the Epilogue to present some thoughts on the influence (both good and bad) of Truly Big Prizes, particularly the Nobel and the Breakthrough Prizes, upon scientific careers and scientific progress:“So I don’t subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even that much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We humans tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible. And when someone like Newton or Einstein sees much further than others, or Watson and Crick synthesize in one stroke the essential features of DNA that might have dribbled out in pieces, we tend to immortalize them.” (Ramakrishnan 264).This lucid and highly readable account will be enjoyed by students in any of the sciences, by those interested in the history of science, or who love reading memoirs. But really, I think that anyone who is captivated by an absorbing story well told will find much to appreciate in this fascinating book.NOTE: Originally published at Forbes on 30 November 2018.

166,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"Venki Ramakrishnan’s book is the story of the race to understand the structure and workings of the ribosome, and his part in that. He comes across as a modest, self-deprecating person, able to reveal his weaknesses as well as his strengths, and someone who is generous in acknowledging the contributions of others. As with many scientists of great aptitude, he lacks arrogance and at times comes across as quite diffident as to his abilities, fearing that others are better qualified than he is to solve this puzzle. His book does a wonderful job of conveying the combination of friendliness and rivalry that accompanies any scientific contest, no more so than when solving a problem of this importance. The journey is a roller coaster where one day his team seems to be ahead of his rivals, and the next a paper is published that suggests they are behind. He successfully expresses how his emotions rose and sank, as he continually tried to figure out where he was in relation to others in the race. In some respects, the book reminds me of The Double Helix by James Watson which recounts a similar, frantic rush to beat the competition to establish the structure of an important biological molecule. A chapter I found fascinating was one where Ramakrishnan discussed the politics of scientific awards, including the Nobel Prize, arguing that the system can become a closed-club where the same scientists repeatedly win prestigious honours. He was particularly critical of Nobel Prizes, writing: “Because many of the early Nobel laureates were giants in their field, the idea has taken hold – especially among non-scientists – that Nobel laureates are geniuses. In fact, the prize is not awarded for being a great scientist but rather for making a groundbreaking discovery or invention. Some of them may be extraordinarily brilliant, but others are just good scientists who were persistent or happened to stumble onto a major finding. Being in the right place at the right time often helped enormously”. He also blasted the rule that limits the number of winners to three. This may have been appropriate a century ago, but nowadays it doesn’t reflect the collaboration, intentional or otherwise, that marks most major scientific advances.He also writes about what he calls post-Nobelitis. As he puts it: “Suddenly, scientists are thrust into the limelight and bask in the public adulation that goes with it. They are asked for their opinion on everything under the sun, regardless of their own expertise, and it soon goes to their head. Some of them are long past their prime, having made their big discoveries decades earlier, and the renewed attention means that they spend their time wandering around the world, pontificating about all sorts of things”. Ramakrishnan knew that solving the mystery of the ribosome was worthy of a Nobel Prize but, with the rule of three in mind, he honestly admits that “I started worrying about my relative contribution and whether I would be perceived as a Johnny-come-lately rather than a pioneer”.Despite his cynicism about how the system works, Ramakrishnan comes across as extremely ambitious and someone who spent a lot of time fretting whether he would miss out on this ultimate scientific accolade. Would the ribosome really merit an award? And, if so, which three of the numerous scientists involved during something like 20 years of research would be named on the citation? A criticism I have of the book is that so many scientists are named that it is easy to lose track of who did what, where and when. Unfortunately, there is no index so when a name reappears there is no simple way of tracing when he or she was first mentioned. Furthermore, after they have been first introduced, Ramakrishnan often refers to scientists only by their first names, and the text is littered with references to Tom, Dick (actually Richard!) and Harry, which means that even having an index would be of limited value as an aide memoire. Perhaps a cast list might be better.Based on his personal experience, Ramakrishnan provides lots of interesting details about the mechanism of announcing and then awarding the Nobel Prizes. No doubt like many other recipients have been, he was very suspicious when he received the phone call from Sweden informing him that he’d won. Also, curiously, he tells us that the banquet after the ceremony is televised and shown live in Sweden. But he comments: “I wouldn’t have thought spending the evening watching a group of strangers eat would make for much drama, but there were speeches and entertainment”.The book is quite technical in places, notably in terms of crystallographic techniques. Nonetheless, it is not necessary to understand the details in order to enjoy this book because this is an account of how the race for a Nobel Prize is won, or, more often, lost. And therein lies the focus of the book."
167,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107551528-shweata-n,5,"Science is often thought to be done by scientists who isolate themselves in a cocoon and come out with a breakthrough and fly like a butterfly. But this is far far from the realities of academia. 'Gene Machine' brilliantly portraits the competitive nature of science. The book is successful in making us realize that breakthroughs that come about in science are often driven by competition amongst peers, which is quite contrary to what is perceived by the ones outside of academia. The author begins his career in academia and is up for a rather shaky start with several ups and downs, finally deciding to switch fields from being a theoretical physicist to a biologist. In the book, he goes on to give an honest account of his academic career, making bold remarks about various events and people, along the way. Also, his descriptions do not fail to capture the competitiveness in science which often isn't touched upon by many. Not to mention, Venki Ramakrishnan has also done a great job in elucidating some of the complex and technical concepts of ribosomes, proteins, crystallography and others. He has done it in such a way that it is easy for anyone with any/no prior knowledge of the subject to understand the concepts and the limitation in our understanding of it. I felt that the analogies he used, especially the car one to help us realize the limitations in understanding of ribosome,were really simple yet amazing.One thing that was consistent throughout the book was that he consistently acknowledged the fact that he was really lucky and had the right set of people and ideas to make that breakthrough. His first breakthrough comes when his team is able to decipher the structure of the 30S structure of the ribosome. Then they go on to solve the atomic structure of the whole ribosome.And finally, he isn't afraid of discussing about the fact that the idea of prizes and awards. He remarks that ""Nevertheless, scientists are only human. Like everyone else, we can be ambitious and competitive and crave recognition. Instead of inculcating a feeling that the work is its own reward, the scientific establishment feeds this desire to feel special and somehow better than our peers at virtually every stage of the process"". This sort of encompassed the idea of awards are flawed yet people tend to associate high value to it and it is the intrinsic nature of humans to do so. He also goes on to criticize the Nobel prize because it's only awarded to three people in a field each year. This doesn't hold good with the fact that scientific discoveries are usually bought out by a group not a single person and therefore it doesn't make sense to give it to just three people. However, he wins the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009 along with his competitors Ada and Tom.In the epilogue, he says: "" I don't subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible"". I think this sort of sums up my views on science too. ( I must confess that he has phrased it so well, I could never have done that!)In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it who wants to know what 'real' science works and who wants to know the realities of being in academia."
168,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,4,"Nobel Laurate Venki Ramakrishnan’s first book is about his experiences in the race to elucidate the structure of ribosome. I had read an excerpt from this book earlier, where he talked about how winning a Nobel prize may not be the best thing for the scientist and how prizes, at times can be unfair. I liked it very much and was keen on reading the whole book. I finally got the chance after borrowing a copy from a friend.The book starts out with his experiences as a student of physics and his almost accidental entry into biology. It then covers his postdoctoral work that got him interested in ribosomes in the first place followed by his incredible journey across America and then to MRC, Cambridge, which was across the ocean. The book is mostly a personal account, focusing on his experiences and the struggles he and his lab went through. It eventually culminates with his winning the prize and the Nobel prize ceremony. I found the book highly additive and an easy read. Ramakrishnan has done a really nice job of explaining the challenges he faced. Especially, the part on x-ray crystallography is so well written that even someone like me, who runs away from these techniques could understand it. As someone who is in academia, what I liked most about the book though is the honesty and frankness with which the story has been narrated. He has been open about all the politics surrounding the whole ribosome community and science in general. He has also not shied away from his own competitiveness, secrecy and prejudice. Another great point is that he has acknowledged the work of his lab members because in the end, the success is as much theirs as his. After reading this book, I came to know of quite a few things. For instance, in the scientific community, the present trend has been towards doing more collaborative work. However, it has not been the case always. When scientists compete with each other for the same thing as was the case with the ribosome structure, things can at times become ugly. Overall, it may or may not turn to be good for science overall. However, in this case, the ending was happy and the efforts of all those involved lead to an addition of our understanding of one of the fundamental phenomena of nature.Finally, I would say that this book has been an enjoyable read. I think it is definitely a must read for every biologist!"
169,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46231899-laurie89,5," The ‘Gene Machine’ is a fascinating account of Venki Ramakrishnan’s path to uncovering the structure of the ribosome, which resulted in his receiving the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The cast of characters and places in this narrative are truly captivating and provide a cross-sectional view of the scientific life. The book provides insight into how successful scientific careers are forged. The starting point is Dr Ramakrishnan’s journey from India to a Ph.D program in physics at Ohio University. After obtaining a Ph.D. the author poignantly describes his decision to switch fields to biology and how this naturally led him to structural biology. A striking inclusion in this story are the descriptions of the self-doubt and the reasoning behind each change in position; from UC San Diego to Yale, Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island to Oak Ridge National laboratory Tennessee, Utah and finally the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. The author finds the right balance in describing the science and the important roles that his colleagues, mentors and students played. Ultimately the depictions of his laboratory and the research environment provide the reader with a taste of what is involved in a successful competitive scientific career. The humility of the author shines throughout the story.  The heart of the narrative focuses on the race to reveal the structure of the ribosome, which manufactures proteins from the genetic code. While the ribosome is often overlooked by the general public, it is of utmost importance the functioning of all cellular life. The expository includes the history of ribosome and the genetic code, basic biology and the basic techniques in x-ray crystallography. The true break-through in structural biology that was necessary to realize the high resolution images is less clear. It would have greatly helped if there had been an appendix to describe this part of the science so that the readers could have also understand this important context. The book is also lacking an index and a more detailed bibliography of the resulting scientific articles.  This skillful memoir, which is fast paced and reads like a novel, is likely to become a scientific classic about the competition at the cutting edge of science. "
170,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42307468-siddharth-saravanan,3,"This book had 3 distinct phases for me. 1st phase regarding his emigration to the US and his subsequent foray into different aspects of Science was engaging, especially the way in which the author almost accidentally stumbled upon something which would turn out to be his lifelong goal! //Made me reflect on the fact that we need to be open in trying out different aspects of a particular field/life in order to land on something which we feel passionate towards dedicating a major portion of our lives 2nd phase covers the methods used by the author and the madcap race to cross the finishing line before anybody else. Although I'm a student of Biology, most of the science flew over my head because it dealt with techniques like crystallography, X-ray diffraction etc. which I have little idea about. The race to discover the structure is fascinating, but we'll have to wade through multiple scientific techniques and dozens of names and contributions from different people involved in the process, which can be quite hard.//Found it fascinating how so many different people are involved in the process. Though it makes the reading hard, really loved how the author credited every single person involved in the mammoth race! 3rd phase, and the best phase, talks about the ecosystem of prizes and the very hit-and-miss nature of them. We as a society have glorified the Nobel Prize, and rightly so. However it was illuminating reading about how the Nobel isn't all encompassing and is flawed in quite a few ways, along with the numerous other scientific prizes. Gave me a lot of perspective on the nature of credit, and the unfairness which is intrinsic in the whole process//(Brownie points for the statement that ethnic and ultra nationalistic pride is the opposite of racism and xenophobia. Rang true within me)"
171,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,2,"Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most difficult to answer. One such is that of how many Indians have won the Nobel Prize so far. The figure can be as high as twelve, if you count Ronald Ross, Rudyard Kipling, Dalai Lama, V S Naipaul and Mother Teresa. Some or of Indian origin, or been born in India or left India too early in their career. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan was a graduate of Physics from Baroda but immediately migrated to the US for further studies. He won the Nobel in Chemistry in 2009 for ribosome research along with two others. Ramakrishnan’s research strengthened our understanding of the fundamental processes of life and provided a clue to the evolution of modern species of life. This book is a combination of popular science and an autobiography with a seamless blending of the two. His life is devoted to research and learning.We know that our genetic material is locked up in a structure called DNA inside the nucleus of each of our cells. Apart from heredity, these contain recipes for building proteins which are essential for life. Insulin, adrenaline and albumin are all proteins required to sustain the organism. What makes these proteins inside a cell is a molecular gene-machine called ribosome. This machine reads the component list from data derived from the DNA and assembles the protein using amino acids just like a production line. The critical nature of the process need not be emphasized further, as the animal will soon be dead if the pathways are somehow clogged. Virtually every molecule in every cell in every form of life is either made by the ribosome or made by enzymes that are themselves made by ribosomes. Discovery of ribosomes and its role in making protein is the culmination of one of the great triumphs in modern biology. This was by no means easy as the ribosome is not a simple molecule like DNA. It was enormous and complex. The attempt to decipher it was taken up by Crick and Watson, who found the structure of DNA but was abandoned in despair.Ramakrishnan was attracted to ribosomes by an article in the magazine Scientific American. He knew practically nothing of biology which he made up through courses studied part-time. Thus we have a physicist who studied the structure of a crucial biological unit being awarded with a Nobel in chemistry! He attempted to solve the ribosome structure first by neutron scattering which was eventually proved ineffective but was well understood by people with a physics background. The author dwells at length on the step by step progress in revealing the structure and the race with other scientists doing similar work, but this is not in a form that can be easily digested by ordinary readers. I found it extremely tedious especially after reading Siddhartha Mukherjee’s great book ‘The Gene - An Intimate History’ a few weeks before. Of course, you cannot expect such lucidity from a Nobel laureate, but the pertinent fact is that almost all of the readers are not Nobel laureates themselves. It is only during the autobiographical passages that the book becomes even slightly interesting.Study of ribosomes is important in learning how medicines cure us of diseases. Some antibiotics work by blocking the protein creation function of bacterial ribosomes. This is done by binding to a vulnerable location in its structure. Since bacterial and human ribosomes are very different, humans will not be adversely affected by the mechanism of its action. This study also casts light on the dark alleyways of early evolution. Building blocks of RNA can be made from simple chemicals that could have been around in the earth billions of years ago. It may be possible that life emerged with lots of randomly made RNA molecules until some of them could reproduce entirely by themselves. RNA could also preserve heredity between generations.This book presents some valid advice to novices in scientific research. The author asks them not to be hesitant to ask questions, however basic it might be. He justifies it by claiming that no question is too stupid to ask if you want to know the answer. It is also a bare necessity for present-day researchers to belong to the top-line institutes and laboratories. Advanced science has now become a team effort transcending national frontiers and continental boundaries. The members of the theoretical and testing facilities should be known to each other, otherwise it would be difficult to obtain and manage precious time allocated for using sophisticated machines.The author makes a short but pointed criticism of the Nobel award conventions. There is a ‘Rule of Three’ in force. This means that the award, if shared, shall not be divided into more than three parts. This criterion is claimed to be impractical now. When the prize started in 1901, scientists worked in relative isolation and met only once every few years. By the time they announced their results, there was no question of who had discovered what. In the current world, an idea quickly spreads and a lot of people contribute to it in various measures and capacities. And it is not always clear whether the original idea or a later contribution was the truly ground breaking advance. It is a difficult task to select three people from a crowd of somewhat equal contributors without causing resentment or heartburn.Ramakrishnan left India very early and harbours no soft spots in his mind for the mother country. Ignorant of his real feelings, thousands of naïve Indians sent congratulatory emails to him upon winning the Nobel. This clogged his inbox and they received a curt reminder that ‘nationality was an accident of birth’ and by corollary, he does not attach much importance to it. This is a clear case of brain drain.The narrative about the role and secrets of ribosomes is disappointingly matter-of-fact. The author has failed to share the awe he might have felt in revealing the heretofore hidden details. The scientist’s idea of a paper for publishing in a journal is too far away from an ordinary reader’s preference of what is interesting. The book is a veritable Who’s Who of the rapidly growing field of structural biology in general and ribosomes in particular. The author has had a great collaboration with like-minded scholars from across the globe. There are many photographs of co-workers and even rivals. The illustrations given as part of the description are not at all helpful. Relevance has not been a parameter for inclusion as we even see a conceptual diagram of a four-stroke internal combustion engine as part of the narrative.The book is recommended only to serious readers."
172,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"I want sure what I got myself into when I picked up this book, but I can definitely say that it was well worth the read. While the book is focused primarily on figuring out the structure of the ribosome, the story Venki shares about his entrance into this particular field in science, the people he's met and worked with, and what came about from all of his work is very informative. We often hear about the accomplishment of folks like Venki, but rarely get a glimpse of what they went through to get there, this book covers that and more.Upon completing the book, I was left with two lingering thoughts, the first was I had no idea what he was talking about towards the later half of the book. Venki writes, in great detail the vast test, processes, and failures he went through to finally generate crystals that could be used to decipher the ribosome. These chapters were difficult to follow for a layman like myself, but I stuck with it. If he took the time to explain his work of many years, the least I could do is spend a couple hours reading about it.The second thought, was that I do not think there was a single person Venki left out of his story that did not have a direct or indirect influence on his project. He went out of his way to talk about a lot of people who pioneered earlier discoveries into crystallizing molecules, mentors who encouraged him to push the boundaries, peers who kept him in check, and students who brought in new fresh ideas to the problem so hand. This is the part of the book I really enjoyed, the simple act of a person who accomplished something significant, giving recognition were it was due."
173,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15971935-mark-stidham,4,"This was a fun read for me because of its subject matter (the elucidation of the structure of the ribosome). It could be of broader interest because it is a first person account of the life of a scientist in a competitive race to solve a scientific question. As a biochemist almost the same age as the author, I related to the story arc, even though there isn't much similarity in our careers. There is the struggle to find a niche, long investments in study and techniques that end up being useless, and frustrating search for job stability. This particular story is similar to others that feature competitive research and the need to obtain respect from peers. The author spends a good amount of time explaining the benefits and the downsides to the science community hierarchy epitomized by the competition for the Nobel Prize. That Ramakrishnan won a share of the prize is evidence of some objectivity in the process. But overall, the Prize seems more of a club.I was unable to pay attention to this particular race to find the structure of the ribosome, and the book should not be viewed as any more than an introduction to that subject. I look forward to learning the details in the scholarly papers. But it should be mentioned that this incredible biological machine was completely misunderstood not too long ago. It is humbling that such a fundamental process is only now being elucidated, and it shows that there are many more astonishing aspects of our biochemistry to be discovered in the future"

During these tumultuous times, one must stay strong by being sane and there is no more powerful refuge of sanity than books. Thankfully I had packed 3 of them when I had to leave for my emergency service. I finished the first one just last evening. I don't read books on the history of science much often, and had picked up 'Gene Machine' on the recommendations of one of my buddies. This one is Venki Ramakrishnan's side of the fascinating story of how the structure and functions of Ribosome, a cellular organelle, were discovered and how the long journey over decades lead to the Nobel Prize for the author and his two main competitors. The hard work behind every discovery, the cooperation and competition between scientists, the jealousy between them, the politics of awards and their after effects is delved on in detail. The book is a repository of knowledge on biology, which however has been tiring for me as biology was never my favourite subject. In our country, the lives of scientists are never that well discussed except some few like Einstein, Bose, Newton, Meghnad Saha and Jagdish Chandra Bose. This book will be a happy addition to that small grouping. The story of how the structure and functions of the Ribosome, the organelle that synthesizes proteins, and lays the building blocks of life, were explained before the world, is truly an engaging one."
175,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104610180-aquila-michiryu,4,"In Gene Machine, Venki Ramakrishnan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, recounts his scientific journey of unraveling the structure of the ribosome and its biological mysteries. More than that, he honestly reveals the politics and competition present in the realm of science, and how various factors such as luck, personalities, jealousy, money and the desire for awards can all inextricably influence the potential for success as a scientist. He also shares his views on the Nobel Prize (and his experience of winning the prize) and how there is subjectivity present when the panel decides who the prize should be awarded to.As a biology student, I learnt about the ribosome when I studied about the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome. At that time, I didn’t place much thought on how the information in my lecture notes came about. How did scientists find out about the structures of the various components in the cell? And specifically, how did they know what function each component played? Admittedly, these questions rarely crossed my mind when I was a student then, since I didn’t want to waste time ruminating on whatever wasn’t in the syllabus at that time.Reading this book has revealed the “behind-the-scenes” of the scientific discovery of ribosome and I realised that I have underestimated the amount of time and effort these scientists have spent to glean the knowledge we can now comfortably obtain. Moreover, I appreciate the author’s objective revelation about the presence of politics and competition in the scientific community, including how the highly-respected Nobel Prize can be subjective and fallible, things I didn’t hear about previously.Having said that, I can expect readers unfamiliar with the ribosome to not appreciate this book as much due to its scientific nature (though the author tries to simplify the highly scientific details to make it easier for general readers to understand). I had to research on X-Ray Crystallography to find out exactly how it works as it was only briefly mentioned in the book.If you know what the ribosome is, this is an insightful and enlightening book to read!"
176,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90507383-mahin,5,"My friends who aren’t in STEM are incredulous to find out how hyper-competitive (and cut-throat) research can be. Science is viewed as incorruptible. But that doesn’t mean that scientists are necessarily paragons of rationality or truth; sometimes, they guard their knowledge and results out of fear that a peer will ""scoop"" them. In spite of this, science is a collaborative process by necessity. In Gene Machine, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan shares his perspective on the race to discover the ribosome’s structure. He also shares his experiences as an outsider; first as a physicist by training who belatedly discovered his interest in biology and second as an Indian immigrant to the US, where he often lived in majority-white towns (in Ohio and Utah). As a biochemist, I found that Venki explained his research in a way that is accessible to those who aren't scientists (or even biologists). As a result, I found myself skimming over descriptions of DNA, RNA, and other elementary biological concepts; but I appreciated their inclusion for readers who may have forgotten or don't have that knowledge. Another reviewer remarked that you wouldn't expect a book about the discovery of the ribosome's structure to be so gripping, an assessment with which I agree. I think Gene Machine will prove to be one of the best science books to be published in 2018."

That is to say, it follows the well-trodden path of 
The Double Helix
. It definitely gets a lot more hard-science than other books in that vein, though; I found some of the technical details about the ribosome hard to follow here, but I admit the problem may well have been that I had to put down the book for a couple of months halfway through and in the interim forgot the intricacies that he'd introduced earlier.

I am not very interested in chemistry, so I did not find it much interesting.Researchers however must read it to check out how that world functions. Author calls Noble prize a lottery! He honestly describes the pitfalls and limitations of Nobel (or any recognition). It helps to put the awards and recognition in perspective. Many times mind tricks us in thinking award as the aim. This book can tell you how random the selection actually is! It is not exactly correlated with the work you do, work is ofcourse important but there are other dominant factors which no one can control.Concluding -For scientists - must readOthers can safely skip.

Ramakrishnan is less relatable and perhaps not as self-reflective or self-aware as Jahren, but his love of the work and his wry sense of humor shines through.

189,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30640144-abhijit-basu,4,"REVIEW OF VENKI RAMAKRISHNAN’S ‘GENE MACHINE’What are ribosomes? Why are they of such importance that teams of dedicated chemical and biological scientists across the world made it their lives’ mission to investigate ribosome’s inner structure over three decades since the early 1980s? The reason behind the great scientific quest is that the genetic information encoded on the DNA would have been of no use without the ribosome molecule as essential cellular processing machine to translate these instructions for making proteins, the building blocks of life. It is on this logic that the 2009 Chemistry Nobel Laureate (joint) Sir Venki Ramakrishnan calls his memoir ‘gene machine.’ Foremost among the factors that make the book so appealing to read is the author’s personal candour – about his ambition, about his professional worries and above all else, about his determination to count in the race for scientific recognition as a ‘dark horse.’ As Siddhartha Mukherjee (author of ‘Emperor of All Maladies’) puts it, his story is that of an ‘outsider’ – twice over. First, as an immigrant settling in the USA and UK, and then, as a PhD in Physics doing his life’s chosen work in molecular biology. Another quality of the book is the author’s writing style. Ramakrishnan has his own way with words and even the more technical middle chapters of the book are laced with enough humour and witty anecdotes to keep interest alive. He is a master of metaphor too – making complex science understandable to lay readers with simple examples. After putting things scientifically – that the ribosome, a ‘giant’ molecule with over a million atoms (still small enough to pack 4000 in the width of a human hair), is the link between our genes and the proteins they specify, he makes the point that understanding how it works will depend on how it structurally looks. He then drives home the importance of that knowing and understanding by a simple allegory. Imagine you are a Martian peering down at earth, he says. You observe tiny objects moving straight or occasionally turning. Look little closer and you find movement happens only when tinier moving things enter those objects. Driven by curiosity, you want to see how the objects are constructed. You find that it is made of numerous working parts, including an engine connected to a crankshaft that makes the wheels turn. You look even closer to find that the engine itself has pistons and sucks in fuel and air that is ignited with a spark plug to drive the piston forward. It is the same with understanding molecules that make life. Understanding DNA and RNA molecules was a big step. But cracking the jigsaw puzzle needed understanding of how the ‘enormous’ ribosomes were constructed which enabled them to decode the DNA information of nucleotide sequence carried by messenger RNAs ‘to stitch together amino acids brought by transfer RNAs into protein.’ Importantly, the author also explains how, by knowing the structure and components of the bacterial ribosome, the work has opened up avenues to development of new antibiotics.It is an engaging story about the agonies and ecstasies, about the disappointments and lucky breaks of ‘rival’ scientists competing in a race for success. The pursuit of success is often made tense by an atmosphere surcharged with ‘politics for recognition.’ At the same time there is cooperation too among the community of scientists, helped by seminars, conferences and mutual discussions which enable cross-pollination of ideas. Ramakrishnan attributes this competitive cooperation to the ‘inbred’ nature of modern scientific discoveries. The 2009 Chemistry Nobel Prize was awarded jointly to three persons. Ada Yonath from Israel was the first to make headway in ribosome crystallisation and kept at it with dogged application for decades. Then there was Tom Steitz, American biochemist and a leading crystallographer of his generation, who, in collaboration with Peter Moore, effectively began the last lap of the race by publishing the atomic structure of the larger (50S) ribosomal subunit. Finally, there was Venki Ramakrishnan, an ‘accidental ribosome biologist’ and a latecomer to the field, who caught up with the others by leading his energetic team of bright postdoc and student associates working round the clock across their trans-Atlantic divide at Cambridge and Utah to achieve high-resolution ‘crystal’ structure of the smaller (30S) ribosome subunit (and later the entire (70S) ribosome, throwing light on the code translation process and on the mechanism of blocking action exploited by antibiotics). Yet, as candidly acknowledged by the author, there were other key contributors who got regrettably left out of Nobel recognition due to the ‘three-recipient limitation’ of the prize. Moreover, as Ramakrishnan himself alludes to in the book’s epilogue, while he and the two others received the recognition for their pioneering work in using crystallography to explore ribosome, with subsequent advancement in electron microscopy, a more direct method allowing higher resolution is now available to investigate organelle structure. The epilogue also contains an endearingly modest, even bordering on philosophical, reflection by the author, in the context of the flood of honours and awards that he received following the ‘Nobel Lottery’, as he calls it, echoing Francis Crick. Referencing the Bible, he cites Matthew 13.12: 'For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.' As already mentioned, the book has quite a few comical anecdotes to liven up things. For instance, there is the story of how Pat Unwin and Carlos Taddei worked at obtaining two-dimensional protein crystals from lizard ovary cells in 1977—the first demonstration that ribosomes were indeed crystallizable. The maverick Taddei was given to insouciantly puffing at his cigar in the lab and regularly setting off the fire alarms. After some time, the experiment was abandoned as the crystals were found not good enough to reveal a detailed atomic arrangement. The unchaperoned lizards left in the basement escaped and were to be seen scampering around the grounds of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology for years thereafter. Another interesting anecdote relates to the author’s two encounters with James Watson. On both occasions, the brash and acerbic American geneticist made light of Ramakrishnan’s labours, saying, ‘Forget the Nobel.’ However, the same Watson was seen attending a lecture by Ramakrishnan and later dispelling Ramakrishnan’s apprehensions by approving his selection as a Nobel Committee expert for the coveted Prize.A COMPARISONIn my personal view as a one-time researcher in Chemistry and a lover of good literature, ‘Gene Machine’ is a thrilling story of a down-to-earth scientist’s quest in a niche area of research holding promise for a clearer understanding of the secrets of life and of better ways to treat complicated maladies. In comparison with other genre books written by Nobel Laureate scientists, I would rate the book in the ‘very good’ category, with a four stars grade. ‘The Double Helix’ (1968) – James Watson’s brilliant account of decoding the DNA – gets ‘excellent’ rating with five stars to boot. But at the top rung of my assessment would be ‘Order out of Chaos’ (1984) – a deeply thought-provoking account of the philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics and its theory of entropy or universal tendency towards disorderliness – written by Ilya Prigogine, 1977 Physical Chemistry Nobel Laureate and his co-author, scientific philosopher Isabelle Stengers. That book, with its readability value and profound philosophical contents, should merit a super-excellent six-star rating almost at par with Erwin Schrödinger’s 1943 book, ‘What is Life?’ Of course, Schrödinger’s book, being an amazingly prophetic foray by a Quantum Physicist into the chemical-biological secret of life’s ‘code script’ is of a different class because it transcends the borders of the scientist’s own Nobel-winning work. Yet all said and done, ‘Gene Machine’, with its insights into the pleasures and pains of the race for scientific recognition, certainly deserves a place of its own at these commanding heights of scientific literature."
190,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43858998-linda-gaines,2,"I'm rather disappointed with this book. First I was really interested in learning about the ribosome and how it functions was discovered. I do feel like I learned a bit, but I really don't understand the different techniques they used to understand how it works. I just don't think it was explained well. Secondly, this book needed a better editor. I understand it was a personal story of the author's career and how the various scientists interacted, but it went off on far too many tangents such that I got lost. So many people were introduced, but only superficially, that I completely forgot who most of them were by the end of the chapter. Also, near the beginning the author talks about the discovery of the structure of DNA and never once mentions Rosalind Franklin, which was a particularly glaring omission. Then halfway through the book, she in mentioned with regards to people who used to be in her lab, and he never explains who she was and what she did for science and DNA. Not once. Perhaps I should blame the editor and not the author for that. In any event, the book needed a better editor."
191,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9309543-dana-slaughter,2,"This book is really for people in know and in the research world. Much of it highlights the various researchers, post docs, grad students etc. involved in the search for understanding the structure and function of the ribosome. The lab techniques are difficult to follow at best, even for someone with a science background. Every now and then there are revealing bits of information as to what was discovered. There is a place for this type of writing, but it just didn't hold my interest. What did strike me is how complex the research world is. Collaboration and competition go hand in hand - not an easy pair to balance! Also, many many people, sometimes over generations, are often involved in these major breakthroughs. I understand the need to recognize them and regret that I just wasn't able to take all of those individual stories in."
192,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52557863-grrlscientist,4,"What it is really like to be a scientist, especially a scientist who has been awarded the “most nobel” scientific prize of all?Written by 2009 co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Venkatraman “Venki” Ramakrishnan, an American and British structural biologist who grew up in India, 
Gene Machine: The race to decipher the secrets of the ribosome
 (Basic Books; 2018) is an engaging account of one man’s many scientific contributions to solve the structure of the ribosome, a small structure that is the workhorse of the cell, building the proteins necessary for life.The author begins his story in India, where he studied physics before immigrating to the United States to earn his doctorate in physics. During this time, he met and married — a major life event served to refocus his attention on how to successfully provide for his family as a working scientist. Confronted with a lifetime of “boring and incremental calculations that wouldn’t result in any real advance in understanding”, Dr. Ramakrishnan took a big risk and abruptly shifted his career focus to molecular biology after reading an article about the ribosome in Scientific American. To do this, he spent two years as a grad student in molecular biology at UCSD, gaining essential knowledge and skills necessary to pursue his new career.Because electron microscopy was in its infancy during most of this work, this meant that an older technique, x-ray crystallography, was the main tool used to decipher the structure of the ribosome. But x-ray crystallography created fuzzier, less detailed images than electron microscopy, so this led to the field being informally known as “blobology”.Despite disappointments and setbacks in his second career, Dr. Ramakrishnan persisted for more than 30 years before being awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, being named president of the Royal Society of London, the world’s oldest scientific society and then being knighted in the 2012. (He does not generally use the honorific ‘Sir’.)In this book, Dr. Ramakrishnan clearly explains the science, and highlights the sometimes convoluted process of how science actually works. He details the inside story of lab life including the struggles, failures and blind alleys, the collaborators and friends, the professional competitors and rivals, and the timely and critically important help provided by a number of scientists, as Dr. Ramakrishnan and his team worked tirelessly to solve the structure of this microscopic biological machine. As the story of the author’s professional life unfolds, we learn how a scientist develops the ideas, skills, tools — and the people, along with all the quirks and talents that each one embodies — that are essential to achieve such a remarkable scientific discovery.This profoundly human story is written with honesty and humility, and the author isn’t afraid to laugh at himself. For example, his story about the phone call in October was amusing, and he even shares his wife’s incredulous response when she first learned he had won the Nobel Prize: “I thought you had to be really smart to win one of those!” (Ramakrishnan 237).One element of this story that impressed me most was Dr. Ramakrishnan’s unfailing generosity to his collaborators and his competitors alike. In fact, one of the key themes in this book is that most contemporary science is not about individual achievement; rather, it’s a synthesis of ideas and progress by teams of highly dedicated individuals who devote their lives to solving questions they find compelling.At the end of the book, Dr. Ramakrishnan ponders the nature of science: “When we have a clear goal in mind, we think we are struggling to reach a summit. But there is no summit. When we get there, we realize we have just climbed a foothill, and there is an endless series of mountains ahead still to be climbed.” (Ramakrishnan 256).The author devotes the Epilogue to present some thoughts on the influence (both good and bad) of Truly Big Prizes, particularly the Nobel and the Breakthrough Prizes, upon scientific careers and scientific progress:“So I don’t subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even that much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We humans tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible. And when someone like Newton or Einstein sees much further than others, or Watson and Crick synthesize in one stroke the essential features of DNA that might have dribbled out in pieces, we tend to immortalize them.” (Ramakrishnan 264).This lucid and highly readable account will be enjoyed by students in any of the sciences, by those interested in the history of science, or who love reading memoirs. But really, I think that anyone who is captivated by an absorbing story well told will find much to appreciate in this fascinating book.NOTE: Originally published at Forbes on 30 November 2018.

A work for which the Author shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Ada Yonath and Tom Steitz. A very enriching experience in getting to know about such serious hard work to understand the intricate machineries of living beings in such a 'crystal' clear manner put forward by Venki Ramakrishnan."

If, however, you are looking to understand what exactly the life of a scientist can entail, then pick up a copy and dig in, you're in for a wild intercontinental ride!I rated this book 4/5, from an internal scoring of 8, two points were dropped for the name dropping (a LOT of people are named) and slightly opaque scientific descriptions."
195,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/534526-robert,3,"Having just finished helping my daughter study for her AP biology exam, I was able to hang with some of the technical discussion. However, this book is still very science heavy.Interesting look into how the scientific/academic/Nobel prize world works. Pretty dry."
196,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"Venki Ramakrishnan’s book is the story of the race to understand the structure and workings of the ribosome, and his part in that. He comes across as a modest, self-deprecating person, able to reveal his weaknesses as well as his strengths, and someone who is generous in acknowledging the contributions of others. As with many scientists of great aptitude, he lacks arrogance and at times comes across as quite diffident as to his abilities, fearing that others are better qualified than he is to solve this puzzle. His book does a wonderful job of conveying the combination of friendliness and rivalry that accompanies any scientific contest, no more so than when solving a problem of this importance. The journey is a roller coaster where one day his team seems to be ahead of his rivals, and the next a paper is published that suggests they are behind. He successfully expresses how his emotions rose and sank, as he continually tried to figure out where he was in relation to others in the race. In some respects, the book reminds me of The Double Helix by James Watson which recounts a similar, frantic rush to beat the competition to establish the structure of an important biological molecule. A chapter I found fascinating was one where Ramakrishnan discussed the politics of scientific awards, including the Nobel Prize, arguing that the system can become a closed-club where the same scientists repeatedly win prestigious honours. He was particularly critical of Nobel Prizes, writing: “Because many of the early Nobel laureates were giants in their field, the idea has taken hold – especially among non-scientists – that Nobel laureates are geniuses. In fact, the prize is not awarded for being a great scientist but rather for making a groundbreaking discovery or invention. Some of them may be extraordinarily brilliant, but others are just good scientists who were persistent or happened to stumble onto a major finding. Being in the right place at the right time often helped enormously”. He also blasted the rule that limits the number of winners to three. This may have been appropriate a century ago, but nowadays it doesn’t reflect the collaboration, intentional or otherwise, that marks most major scientific advances.He also writes about what he calls post-Nobelitis. As he puts it: “Suddenly, scientists are thrust into the limelight and bask in the public adulation that goes with it. They are asked for their opinion on everything under the sun, regardless of their own expertise, and it soon goes to their head. Some of them are long past their prime, having made their big discoveries decades earlier, and the renewed attention means that they spend their time wandering around the world, pontificating about all sorts of things”. Ramakrishnan knew that solving the mystery of the ribosome was worthy of a Nobel Prize but, with the rule of three in mind, he honestly admits that “I started worrying about my relative contribution and whether I would be perceived as a Johnny-come-lately rather than a pioneer”.Despite his cynicism about how the system works, Ramakrishnan comes across as extremely ambitious and someone who spent a lot of time fretting whether he would miss out on this ultimate scientific accolade. Would the ribosome really merit an award? And, if so, which three of the numerous scientists involved during something like 20 years of research would be named on the citation? A criticism I have of the book is that so many scientists are named that it is easy to lose track of who did what, where and when. Unfortunately, there is no index so when a name reappears there is no simple way of tracing when he or she was first mentioned. Furthermore, after they have been first introduced, Ramakrishnan often refers to scientists only by their first names, and the text is littered with references to Tom, Dick (actually Richard!) and Harry, which means that even having an index would be of limited value as an aide memoire. Perhaps a cast list might be better.Based on his personal experience, Ramakrishnan provides lots of interesting details about the mechanism of announcing and then awarding the Nobel Prizes. No doubt like many other recipients have been, he was very suspicious when he received the phone call from Sweden informing him that he’d won. Also, curiously, he tells us that the banquet after the ceremony is televised and shown live in Sweden. But he comments: “I wouldn’t have thought spending the evening watching a group of strangers eat would make for much drama, but there were speeches and entertainment”.The book is quite technical in places, notably in terms of crystallographic techniques. Nonetheless, it is not necessary to understand the details in order to enjoy this book because this is an account of how the race for a Nobel Prize is won, or, more often, lost. And therein lies the focus of the book."
197,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107551528-shweata-n,5,"Science is often thought to be done by scientists who isolate themselves in a cocoon and come out with a breakthrough and fly like a butterfly. But this is far far from the realities of academia. 'Gene Machine' brilliantly portraits the competitive nature of science. The book is successful in making us realize that breakthroughs that come about in science are often driven by competition amongst peers, which is quite contrary to what is perceived by the ones outside of academia. The author begins his career in academia and is up for a rather shaky start with several ups and downs, finally deciding to switch fields from being a theoretical physicist to a biologist. In the book, he goes on to give an honest account of his academic career, making bold remarks about various events and people, along the way. Also, his descriptions do not fail to capture the competitiveness in science which often isn't touched upon by many. Not to mention, Venki Ramakrishnan has also done a great job in elucidating some of the complex and technical concepts of ribosomes, proteins, crystallography and others. He has done it in such a way that it is easy for anyone with any/no prior knowledge of the subject to understand the concepts and the limitation in our understanding of it. I felt that the analogies he used, especially the car one to help us realize the limitations in understanding of ribosome,were really simple yet amazing.One thing that was consistent throughout the book was that he consistently acknowledged the fact that he was really lucky and had the right set of people and ideas to make that breakthrough. His first breakthrough comes when his team is able to decipher the structure of the 30S structure of the ribosome. Then they go on to solve the atomic structure of the whole ribosome.And finally, he isn't afraid of discussing about the fact that the idea of prizes and awards. He remarks that ""Nevertheless, scientists are only human. Like everyone else, we can be ambitious and competitive and crave recognition. Instead of inculcating a feeling that the work is its own reward, the scientific establishment feeds this desire to feel special and somehow better than our peers at virtually every stage of the process"". This sort of encompassed the idea of awards are flawed yet people tend to associate high value to it and it is the intrinsic nature of humans to do so. He also goes on to criticize the Nobel prize because it's only awarded to three people in a field each year. This doesn't hold good with the fact that scientific discoveries are usually bought out by a group not a single person and therefore it doesn't make sense to give it to just three people. However, he wins the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009 along with his competitors Ada and Tom.In the epilogue, he says: "" I don't subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible"". I think this sort of sums up my views on science too. ( I must confess that he has phrased it so well, I could never have done that!)In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it who wants to know what 'real' science works and who wants to know the realities of being in academia."
198,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,4,"Nobel Laurate Venki Ramakrishnan’s first book is about his experiences in the race to elucidate the structure of ribosome. I had read an excerpt from this book earlier, where he talked about how winning a Nobel prize may not be the best thing for the scientist and how prizes, at times can be unfair. I liked it very much and was keen on reading the whole book. I finally got the chance after borrowing a copy from a friend.The book starts out with his experiences as a student of physics and his almost accidental entry into biology. It then covers his postdoctoral work that got him interested in ribosomes in the first place followed by his incredible journey across America and then to MRC, Cambridge, which was across the ocean. The book is mostly a personal account, focusing on his experiences and the struggles he and his lab went through. It eventually culminates with his winning the prize and the Nobel prize ceremony. I found the book highly additive and an easy read. Ramakrishnan has done a really nice job of explaining the challenges he faced. Especially, the part on x-ray crystallography is so well written that even someone like me, who runs away from these techniques could understand it. As someone who is in academia, what I liked most about the book though is the honesty and frankness with which the story has been narrated. He has been open about all the politics surrounding the whole ribosome community and science in general. He has also not shied away from his own competitiveness, secrecy and prejudice. Another great point is that he has acknowledged the work of his lab members because in the end, the success is as much theirs as his. After reading this book, I came to know of quite a few things. For instance, in the scientific community, the present trend has been towards doing more collaborative work. However, it has not been the case always. When scientists compete with each other for the same thing as was the case with the ribosome structure, things can at times become ugly. Overall, it may or may not turn to be good for science overall. However, in this case, the ending was happy and the efforts of all those involved lead to an addition of our understanding of one of the fundamental phenomena of nature.Finally, I would say that this book has been an enjoyable read. I think it is definitely a must read for every biologist!"
199,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46231899-laurie89,5," The ‘Gene Machine’ is a fascinating account of Venki Ramakrishnan’s path to uncovering the structure of the ribosome, which resulted in his receiving the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The cast of characters and places in this narrative are truly captivating and provide a cross-sectional view of the scientific life. The book provides insight into how successful scientific careers are forged. The starting point is Dr Ramakrishnan’s journey from India to a Ph.D program in physics at Ohio University. After obtaining a Ph.D. the author poignantly describes his decision to switch fields to biology and how this naturally led him to structural biology. A striking inclusion in this story are the descriptions of the self-doubt and the reasoning behind each change in position; from UC San Diego to Yale, Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island to Oak Ridge National laboratory Tennessee, Utah and finally the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. The author finds the right balance in describing the science and the important roles that his colleagues, mentors and students played. Ultimately the depictions of his laboratory and the research environment provide the reader with a taste of what is involved in a successful competitive scientific career. The humility of the author shines throughout the story.  The heart of the narrative focuses on the race to reveal the structure of the ribosome, which manufactures proteins from the genetic code. While the ribosome is often overlooked by the general public, it is of utmost importance the functioning of all cellular life. The expository includes the history of ribosome and the genetic code, basic biology and the basic techniques in x-ray crystallography. The true break-through in structural biology that was necessary to realize the high resolution images is less clear. It would have greatly helped if there had been an appendix to describe this part of the science so that the readers could have also understand this important context. The book is also lacking an index and a more detailed bibliography of the resulting scientific articles.  This skillful memoir, which is fast paced and reads like a novel, is likely to become a scientific classic about the competition at the cutting edge of science. "

Although I'm a student of Biology, most of the science flew over my head because it dealt with techniques like crystallography, X-ray diffraction etc. which I have little idea about. The race to discover the structure is fascinating, but we'll have to wade through multiple scientific techniques and dozens of names and contributions from different people involved in the process, which can be quite hard.//Found it fascinating how so many different people are involved in the process. Though it makes the reading hard, really loved how the author credited every single person involved in the mammoth race! 3rd phase, and the best phase, talks about the ecosystem of prizes and the very hit-and-miss nature of them. We as a society have glorified the Nobel Prize, and rightly so. However it was illuminating reading about how the Nobel isn't all encompassing and is flawed in quite a few ways, along with the numerous other scientific prizes. Gave me a lot of perspective on the nature of credit, and the unfairness which is intrinsic in the whole process//(Brownie points for the statement that ethnic and ultra nationalistic pride is the opposite of racism and xenophobia. Rang true within me)"
201,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,2,"Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most difficult to answer. One such is that of how many Indians have won the Nobel Prize so far. The figure can be as high as twelve, if you count Ronald Ross, Rudyard Kipling, Dalai Lama, V S Naipaul and Mother Teresa. Some or of Indian origin, or been born in India or left India too early in their career. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan was a graduate of Physics from Baroda but immediately migrated to the US for further studies. He won the Nobel in Chemistry in 2009 for ribosome research along with two others. Ramakrishnan’s research strengthened our understanding of the fundamental processes of life and provided a clue to the evolution of modern species of life. This book is a combination of popular science and an autobiography with a seamless blending of the two. His life is devoted to research and learning.We know that our genetic material is locked up in a structure called DNA inside the nucleus of each of our cells. Apart from heredity, these contain recipes for building proteins which are essential for life. Insulin, adrenaline and albumin are all proteins required to sustain the organism. What makes these proteins inside a cell is a molecular gene-machine called ribosome. This machine reads the component list from data derived from the DNA and assembles the protein using amino acids just like a production line. The critical nature of the process need not be emphasized further, as the animal will soon be dead if the pathways are somehow clogged. Virtually every molecule in every cell in every form of life is either made by the ribosome or made by enzymes that are themselves made by ribosomes. Discovery of ribosomes and its role in making protein is the culmination of one of the great triumphs in modern biology. This was by no means easy as the ribosome is not a simple molecule like DNA. It was enormous and complex. The attempt to decipher it was taken up by Crick and Watson, who found the structure of DNA but was abandoned in despair.Ramakrishnan was attracted to ribosomes by an article in the magazine Scientific American. He knew practically nothing of biology which he made up through courses studied part-time. Thus we have a physicist who studied the structure of a crucial biological unit being awarded with a Nobel in chemistry! He attempted to solve the ribosome structure first by neutron scattering which was eventually proved ineffective but was well understood by people with a physics background. The author dwells at length on the step by step progress in revealing the structure and the race with other scientists doing similar work, but this is not in a form that can be easily digested by ordinary readers. I found it extremely tedious especially after reading Siddhartha Mukherjee’s great book ‘The Gene - An Intimate History’ a few weeks before. Of course, you cannot expect such lucidity from a Nobel laureate, but the pertinent fact is that almost all of the readers are not Nobel laureates themselves. It is only during the autobiographical passages that the book becomes even slightly interesting.Study of ribosomes is important in learning how medicines cure us of diseases. Some antibiotics work by blocking the protein creation function of bacterial ribosomes. This is done by binding to a vulnerable location in its structure. Since bacterial and human ribosomes are very different, humans will not be adversely affected by the mechanism of its action. This study also casts light on the dark alleyways of early evolution. Building blocks of RNA can be made from simple chemicals that could have been around in the earth billions of years ago. It may be possible that life emerged with lots of randomly made RNA molecules until some of them could reproduce entirely by themselves. RNA could also preserve heredity between generations.This book presents some valid advice to novices in scientific research. The author asks them not to be hesitant to ask questions, however basic it might be. He justifies it by claiming that no question is too stupid to ask if you want to know the answer. It is also a bare necessity for present-day researchers to belong to the top-line institutes and laboratories. Advanced science has now become a team effort transcending national frontiers and continental boundaries. The members of the theoretical and testing facilities should be known to each other, otherwise it would be difficult to obtain and manage precious time allocated for using sophisticated machines.The author makes a short but pointed criticism of the Nobel award conventions. There is a ‘Rule of Three’ in force. This means that the award, if shared, shall not be divided into more than three parts. This criterion is claimed to be impractical now. When the prize started in 1901, scientists worked in relative isolation and met only once every few years. By the time they announced their results, there was no question of who had discovered what. In the current world, an idea quickly spreads and a lot of people contribute to it in various measures and capacities. And it is not always clear whether the original idea or a later contribution was the truly ground breaking advance. It is a difficult task to select three people from a crowd of somewhat equal contributors without causing resentment or heartburn.Ramakrishnan left India very early and harbours no soft spots in his mind for the mother country. Ignorant of his real feelings, thousands of naïve Indians sent congratulatory emails to him upon winning the Nobel. This clogged his inbox and they received a curt reminder that ‘nationality was an accident of birth’ and by corollary, he does not attach much importance to it. This is a clear case of brain drain.The narrative about the role and secrets of ribosomes is disappointingly matter-of-fact. The author has failed to share the awe he might have felt in revealing the heretofore hidden details. The scientist’s idea of a paper for publishing in a journal is too far away from an ordinary reader’s preference of what is interesting. The book is a veritable Who’s Who of the rapidly growing field of structural biology in general and ribosomes in particular. The author has had a great collaboration with like-minded scholars from across the globe. There are many photographs of co-workers and even rivals. The illustrations given as part of the description are not at all helpful. Relevance has not been a parameter for inclusion as we even see a conceptual diagram of a four-stroke internal combustion engine as part of the narrative.The book is recommended only to serious readers."
202,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"I want sure what I got myself into when I picked up this book, but I can definitely say that it was well worth the read. While the book is focused primarily on figuring out the structure of the ribosome, the story Venki shares about his entrance into this particular field in science, the people he's met and worked with, and what came about from all of his work is very informative. We often hear about the accomplishment of folks like Venki, but rarely get a glimpse of what they went through to get there, this book covers that and more.Upon completing the book, I was left with two lingering thoughts, the first was I had no idea what he was talking about towards the later half of the book. Venki writes, in great detail the vast test, processes, and failures he went through to finally generate crystals that could be used to decipher the ribosome. These chapters were difficult to follow for a layman like myself, but I stuck with it. If he took the time to explain his work of many years, the least I could do is spend a couple hours reading about it.The second thought, was that I do not think there was a single person Venki left out of his story that did not have a direct or indirect influence on his project. He went out of his way to talk about a lot of people who pioneered earlier discoveries into crystallizing molecules, mentors who encouraged him to push the boundaries, peers who kept him in check, and students who brought in new fresh ideas to the problem so hand. This is the part of the book I really enjoyed, the simple act of a person who accomplished something significant, giving recognition were it was due."
203,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15971935-mark-stidham,4,"This was a fun read for me because of its subject matter (the elucidation of the structure of the ribosome). It could be of broader interest because it is a first person account of the life of a scientist in a competitive race to solve a scientific question. As a biochemist almost the same age as the author, I related to the story arc, even though there isn't much similarity in our careers. There is the struggle to find a niche, long investments in study and techniques that end up being useless, and frustrating search for job stability. This particular story is similar to others that feature competitive research and the need to obtain respect from peers. The author spends a good amount of time explaining the benefits and the downsides to the science community hierarchy epitomized by the competition for the Nobel Prize. That Ramakrishnan won a share of the prize is evidence of some objectivity in the process. But overall, the Prize seems more of a club.I was unable to pay attention to this particular race to find the structure of the ribosome, and the book should not be viewed as any more than an introduction to that subject. I look forward to learning the details in the scholarly papers. But it should be mentioned that this incredible biological machine was completely misunderstood not too long ago. It is humbling that such a fundamental process is only now being elucidated, and it shows that there are many more astonishing aspects of our biochemistry to be discovered in the future"

During these tumultuous times, one must stay strong by being sane and there is no more powerful refuge of sanity than books. Thankfully I had packed 3 of them when I had to leave for my emergency service. I finished the first one just last evening. I don't read books on the history of science much often, and had picked up 'Gene Machine' on the recommendations of one of my buddies. This one is Venki Ramakrishnan's side of the fascinating story of how the structure and functions of Ribosome, a cellular organelle, were discovered and how the long journey over decades lead to the Nobel Prize for the author and his two main competitors. The hard work behind every discovery, the cooperation and competition between scientists, the jealousy between them, the politics of awards and their after effects is delved on in detail. The book is a repository of knowledge on biology, which however has been tiring for me as biology was never my favourite subject. In our country, the lives of scientists are never that well discussed except some few like Einstein, Bose, Newton, Meghnad Saha and Jagdish Chandra Bose. This book will be a happy addition to that small grouping. The story of how the structure and functions of the Ribosome, the organelle that synthesizes proteins, and lays the building blocks of life, were explained before the world, is truly an engaging one."
205,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104610180-aquila-michiryu,4,"In Gene Machine, Venki Ramakrishnan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, recounts his scientific journey of unraveling the structure of the ribosome and its biological mysteries. More than that, he honestly reveals the politics and competition present in the realm of science, and how various factors such as luck, personalities, jealousy, money and the desire for awards can all inextricably influence the potential for success as a scientist. He also shares his views on the Nobel Prize (and his experience of winning the prize) and how there is subjectivity present when the panel decides who the prize should be awarded to.As a biology student, I learnt about the ribosome when I studied about the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome. At that time, I didn’t place much thought on how the information in my lecture notes came about. How did scientists find out about the structures of the various components in the cell? And specifically, how did they know what function each component played? Admittedly, these questions rarely crossed my mind when I was a student then, since I didn’t want to waste time ruminating on whatever wasn’t in the syllabus at that time.Reading this book has revealed the “behind-the-scenes” of the scientific discovery of ribosome and I realised that I have underestimated the amount of time and effort these scientists have spent to glean the knowledge we can now comfortably obtain. Moreover, I appreciate the author’s objective revelation about the presence of politics and competition in the scientific community, including how the highly-respected Nobel Prize can be subjective and fallible, things I didn’t hear about previously.Having said that, I can expect readers unfamiliar with the ribosome to not appreciate this book as much due to its scientific nature (though the author tries to simplify the highly scientific details to make it easier for general readers to understand). I had to research on X-Ray Crystallography to find out exactly how it works as it was only briefly mentioned in the book.If you know what the ribosome is, this is an insightful and enlightening book to read!"
206,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90507383-mahin,5,"My friends who aren’t in STEM are incredulous to find out how hyper-competitive (and cut-throat) research can be. Science is viewed as incorruptible. But that doesn’t mean that scientists are necessarily paragons of rationality or truth; sometimes, they guard their knowledge and results out of fear that a peer will ""scoop"" them. In spite of this, science is a collaborative process by necessity. In Gene Machine, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan shares his perspective on the race to discover the ribosome’s structure. He also shares his experiences as an outsider; first as a physicist by training who belatedly discovered his interest in biology and second as an Indian immigrant to the US, where he often lived in majority-white towns (in Ohio and Utah). As a biochemist, I found that Venki explained his research in a way that is accessible to those who aren't scientists (or even biologists). As a result, I found myself skimming over descriptions of DNA, RNA, and other elementary biological concepts; but I appreciated their inclusion for readers who may have forgotten or don't have that knowledge. Another reviewer remarked that you wouldn't expect a book about the discovery of the ribosome's structure to be so gripping, an assessment with which I agree. I think Gene Machine will prove to be one of the best science books to be published in 2018."

That is to say, it follows the well-trodden path of 
The Double Helix
. It definitely gets a lot more hard-science than other books in that vein, though; I found some of the technical details about the ribosome hard to follow here, but I admit the problem may well have been that I had to put down the book for a couple of months halfway through and in the interim forgot the intricacies that he'd introduced earlier. The account is generally otherwise pretty easy to read: the author's surprisingly candid about various things, and he seems like an interesting character."

I am not very interested in chemistry, so I did not find it much interesting.Researchers however must read it to check out how that world functions. Author calls Noble prize a lottery! He honestly describes the pitfalls and limitations of Nobel (or any recognition). It helps to put the awards and recognition in perspective. Many times mind tricks us in thinking award as the aim. This book can tell you how random the selection actually is! It is not exactly correlated with the work you do, work is ofcourse important but there are other dominant factors which no one can control.Concluding -For scientists - must readOthers can safely skip. You won't miss anything.By the way, this is a kind of accidental read for me.

Ramakrishnan is less relatable and perhaps not as self-reflective or self-aware as Jahren, but his love of the work and his wry sense of humor shines through.

219,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30640144-abhijit-basu,4,"REVIEW OF VENKI RAMAKRISHNAN’S ‘GENE MACHINE’What are ribosomes? Why are they of such importance that teams of dedicated chemical and biological scientists across the world made it their lives’ mission to investigate ribosome’s inner structure over three decades since the early 1980s? The reason behind the great scientific quest is that the genetic information encoded on the DNA would have been of no use without the ribosome molecule as essential cellular processing machine to translate these instructions for making proteins, the building blocks of life. It is on this logic that the 2009 Chemistry Nobel Laureate (joint) Sir Venki Ramakrishnan calls his memoir ‘gene machine.’ Foremost among the factors that make the book so appealing to read is the author’s personal candour – about his ambition, about his professional worries and above all else, about his determination to count in the race for scientific recognition as a ‘dark horse.’ As Siddhartha Mukherjee (author of ‘Emperor of All Maladies’) puts it, his story is that of an ‘outsider’ – twice over. First, as an immigrant settling in the USA and UK, and then, as a PhD in Physics doing his life’s chosen work in molecular biology. Another quality of the book is the author’s writing style. Ramakrishnan has his own way with words and even the more technical middle chapters of the book are laced with enough humour and witty anecdotes to keep interest alive. He is a master of metaphor too – making complex science understandable to lay readers with simple examples. After putting things scientifically – that the ribosome, a ‘giant’ molecule with over a million atoms (still small enough to pack 4000 in the width of a human hair), is the link between our genes and the proteins they specify, he makes the point that understanding how it works will depend on how it structurally looks. He then drives home the importance of that knowing and understanding by a simple allegory. Imagine you are a Martian peering down at earth, he says. You observe tiny objects moving straight or occasionally turning. Look little closer and you find movement happens only when tinier moving things enter those objects. Driven by curiosity, you want to see how the objects are constructed. You find that it is made of numerous working parts, including an engine connected to a crankshaft that makes the wheels turn. You look even closer to find that the engine itself has pistons and sucks in fuel and air that is ignited with a spark plug to drive the piston forward. It is the same with understanding molecules that make life. Understanding DNA and RNA molecules was a big step. But cracking the jigsaw puzzle needed understanding of how the ‘enormous’ ribosomes were constructed which enabled them to decode the DNA information of nucleotide sequence carried by messenger RNAs ‘to stitch together amino acids brought by transfer RNAs into protein.’ Importantly, the author also explains how, by knowing the structure and components of the bacterial ribosome, the work has opened up avenues to development of new antibiotics.It is an engaging story about the agonies and ecstasies, about the disappointments and lucky breaks of ‘rival’ scientists competing in a race for success. The pursuit of success is often made tense by an atmosphere surcharged with ‘politics for recognition.’ At the same time there is cooperation too among the community of scientists, helped by seminars, conferences and mutual discussions which enable cross-pollination of ideas. Ramakrishnan attributes this competitive cooperation to the ‘inbred’ nature of modern scientific discoveries. The 2009 Chemistry Nobel Prize was awarded jointly to three persons. Ada Yonath from Israel was the first to make headway in ribosome crystallisation and kept at it with dogged application for decades. Then there was Tom Steitz, American biochemist and a leading crystallographer of his generation, who, in collaboration with Peter Moore, effectively began the last lap of the race by publishing the atomic structure of the larger (50S) ribosomal subunit. Finally, there was Venki Ramakrishnan, an ‘accidental ribosome biologist’ and a latecomer to the field, who caught up with the others by leading his energetic team of bright postdoc and student associates working round the clock across their trans-Atlantic divide at Cambridge and Utah to achieve high-resolution ‘crystal’ structure of the smaller (30S) ribosome subunit (and later the entire (70S) ribosome, throwing light on the code translation process and on the mechanism of blocking action exploited by antibiotics). Yet, as candidly acknowledged by the author, there were other key contributors who got regrettably left out of Nobel recognition due to the ‘three-recipient limitation’ of the prize. Moreover, as Ramakrishnan himself alludes to in the book’s epilogue, while he and the two others received the recognition for their pioneering work in using crystallography to explore ribosome, with subsequent advancement in electron microscopy, a more direct method allowing higher resolution is now available to investigate organelle structure. The epilogue also contains an endearingly modest, even bordering on philosophical, reflection by the author, in the context of the flood of honours and awards that he received following the ‘Nobel Lottery’, as he calls it, echoing Francis Crick. Referencing the Bible, he cites Matthew 13.12: 'For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.' As already mentioned, the book has quite a few comical anecdotes to liven up things. For instance, there is the story of how Pat Unwin and Carlos Taddei worked at obtaining two-dimensional protein crystals from lizard ovary cells in 1977—the first demonstration that ribosomes were indeed crystallizable. The maverick Taddei was given to insouciantly puffing at his cigar in the lab and regularly setting off the fire alarms. After some time, the experiment was abandoned as the crystals were found not good enough to reveal a detailed atomic arrangement. The unchaperoned lizards left in the basement escaped and were to be seen scampering around the grounds of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology for years thereafter. Another interesting anecdote relates to the author’s two encounters with James Watson. On both occasions, the brash and acerbic American geneticist made light of Ramakrishnan’s labours, saying, ‘Forget the Nobel.’ However, the same Watson was seen attending a lecture by Ramakrishnan and later dispelling Ramakrishnan’s apprehensions by approving his selection as a Nobel Committee expert for the coveted Prize.A COMPARISONIn my personal view as a one-time researcher in Chemistry and a lover of good literature, ‘Gene Machine’ is a thrilling story of a down-to-earth scientist’s quest in a niche area of research holding promise for a clearer understanding of the secrets of life and of better ways to treat complicated maladies. In comparison with other genre books written by Nobel Laureate scientists, I would rate the book in the ‘very good’ category, with a four stars grade. ‘The Double Helix’ (1968) – James Watson’s brilliant account of decoding the DNA – gets ‘excellent’ rating with five stars to boot. But at the top rung of my assessment would be ‘Order out of Chaos’ (1984) – a deeply thought-provoking account of the philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics and its theory of entropy or universal tendency towards disorderliness – written by Ilya Prigogine, 1977 Physical Chemistry Nobel Laureate and his co-author, scientific philosopher Isabelle Stengers. That book, with its readability value and profound philosophical contents, should merit a super-excellent six-star rating almost at par with Erwin Schrödinger’s 1943 book, ‘What is Life?’ Of course, Schrödinger’s book, being an amazingly prophetic foray by a Quantum Physicist into the chemical-biological secret of life’s ‘code script’ is of a different class because it transcends the borders of the scientist’s own Nobel-winning work. Yet all said and done, ‘Gene Machine’, with its insights into the pleasures and pains of the race for scientific recognition, certainly deserves a place of its own at these commanding heights of scientific literature."
220,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43858998-linda-gaines,2,"I'm rather disappointed with this book. First I was really interested in learning about the ribosome and how it functions was discovered. I do feel like I learned a bit, but I really don't understand the different techniques they used to understand how it works. I just don't think it was explained well. Secondly, this book needed a better editor. I understand it was a personal story of the author's career and how the various scientists interacted, but it went off on far too many tangents such that I got lost. So many people were introduced, but only superficially, that I completely forgot who most of them were by the end of the chapter. Also, near the beginning the author talks about the discovery of the structure of DNA and never once mentions Rosalind Franklin, which was a particularly glaring omission. Then halfway through the book, she in mentioned with regards to people who used to be in her lab, and he never explains who she was and what she did for science and DNA. Not once. Perhaps I should blame the editor and not the author for that. In any event, the book needed a better editor."

The lab techniques are difficult to follow at best, even for someone with a science background. Every now and then there are revealing bits of information as to what was discovered. There is a place for this type of writing, but it just didn't hold my interest. What did strike me is how complex the research world is. Collaboration and competition go hand in hand - not an easy pair to balance! Also, many many people, sometimes over generations, are often involved in these major breakthroughs.

222,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52557863-grrlscientist,4,"What it is really like to be a scientist, especially a scientist who has been awarded the “most nobel” scientific prize of all?Written by 2009 co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Venkatraman “Venki” Ramakrishnan, an American and British structural biologist who grew up in India, 
Gene Machine: The race to decipher the secrets of the ribosome
 (Basic Books; 2018) is an engaging account of one man’s many scientific contributions to solve the structure of the ribosome, a small structure that is the workhorse of the cell, building the proteins necessary for life.The author begins his story in India, where he studied physics before immigrating to the United States to earn his doctorate in physics. During this time, he met and married — a major life event served to refocus his attention on how to successfully provide for his family as a working scientist. Confronted with a lifetime of “boring and incremental calculations that wouldn’t result in any real advance in understanding”, Dr. Ramakrishnan took a big risk and abruptly shifted his career focus to molecular biology after reading an article about the ribosome in Scientific American. To do this, he spent two years as a grad student in molecular biology at UCSD, gaining essential knowledge and skills necessary to pursue his new career.Because electron microscopy was in its infancy during most of this work, this meant that an older technique, x-ray crystallography, was the main tool used to decipher the structure of the ribosome. But x-ray crystallography created fuzzier, less detailed images than electron microscopy, so this led to the field being informally known as “blobology”.Despite disappointments and setbacks in his second career, Dr. Ramakrishnan persisted for more than 30 years before being awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, being named president of the Royal Society of London, the world’s oldest scientific society and then being knighted in the 2012. (He does not generally use the honorific ‘Sir’.)In this book, Dr. Ramakrishnan clearly explains the science, and highlights the sometimes convoluted process of how science actually works. He details the inside story of lab life including the struggles, failures and blind alleys, the collaborators and friends, the professional competitors and rivals, and the timely and critically important help provided by a number of scientists, as Dr. Ramakrishnan and his team worked tirelessly to solve the structure of this microscopic biological machine. As the story of the author’s professional life unfolds, we learn how a scientist develops the ideas, skills, tools — and the people, along with all the quirks and talents that each one embodies — that are essential to achieve such a remarkable scientific discovery.This profoundly human story is written with honesty and humility, and the author isn’t afraid to laugh at himself. For example, his story about the phone call in October was amusing, and he even shares his wife’s incredulous response when she first learned he had won the Nobel Prize: “I thought you had to be really smart to win one of those!” (Ramakrishnan 237).One element of this story that impressed me most was Dr. Ramakrishnan’s unfailing generosity to his collaborators and his competitors alike. In fact, one of the key themes in this book is that most contemporary science is not about individual achievement; rather, it’s a synthesis of ideas and progress by teams of highly dedicated individuals who devote their lives to solving questions they find compelling.At the end of the book, Dr. Ramakrishnan ponders the nature of science: “When we have a clear goal in mind, we think we are struggling to reach a summit. But there is no summit. When we get there, we realize we have just climbed a foothill, and there is an endless series of mountains ahead still to be climbed.” (Ramakrishnan 256).The author devotes the Epilogue to present some thoughts on the influence (both good and bad) of Truly Big Prizes, particularly the Nobel and the Breakthrough Prizes, upon scientific careers and scientific progress:“So I don’t subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even that much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We humans tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible. And when someone like Newton or Einstein sees much further than others, or Watson and Crick synthesize in one stroke the essential features of DNA that might have dribbled out in pieces, we tend to immortalize them.” (Ramakrishnan 264).This lucid and highly readable account will be enjoyed by students in any of the sciences, by those interested in the history of science, or who love reading memoirs. But really, I think that anyone who is captivated by an absorbing story well told will find much to appreciate in this fascinating book.NOTE: Originally published at Forbes on 30 November 2018.

226,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"Venki Ramakrishnan’s book is the story of the race to understand the structure and workings of the ribosome, and his part in that. He comes across as a modest, self-deprecating person, able to reveal his weaknesses as well as his strengths, and someone who is generous in acknowledging the contributions of others. As with many scientists of great aptitude, he lacks arrogance and at times comes across as quite diffident as to his abilities, fearing that others are better qualified than he is to solve this puzzle. His book does a wonderful job of conveying the combination of friendliness and rivalry that accompanies any scientific contest, no more so than when solving a problem of this importance. The journey is a roller coaster where one day his team seems to be ahead of his rivals, and the next a paper is published that suggests they are behind. He successfully expresses how his emotions rose and sank, as he continually tried to figure out where he was in relation to others in the race. In some respects, the book reminds me of The Double Helix by James Watson which recounts a similar, frantic rush to beat the competition to establish the structure of an important biological molecule. A chapter I found fascinating was one where Ramakrishnan discussed the politics of scientific awards, including the Nobel Prize, arguing that the system can become a closed-club where the same scientists repeatedly win prestigious honours. He was particularly critical of Nobel Prizes, writing: “Because many of the early Nobel laureates were giants in their field, the idea has taken hold – especially among non-scientists – that Nobel laureates are geniuses. In fact, the prize is not awarded for being a great scientist but rather for making a groundbreaking discovery or invention. Some of them may be extraordinarily brilliant, but others are just good scientists who were persistent or happened to stumble onto a major finding. Being in the right place at the right time often helped enormously”. He also blasted the rule that limits the number of winners to three. This may have been appropriate a century ago, but nowadays it doesn’t reflect the collaboration, intentional or otherwise, that marks most major scientific advances.He also writes about what he calls post-Nobelitis. As he puts it: “Suddenly, scientists are thrust into the limelight and bask in the public adulation that goes with it. They are asked for their opinion on everything under the sun, regardless of their own expertise, and it soon goes to their head. Some of them are long past their prime, having made their big discoveries decades earlier, and the renewed attention means that they spend their time wandering around the world, pontificating about all sorts of things”. Ramakrishnan knew that solving the mystery of the ribosome was worthy of a Nobel Prize but, with the rule of three in mind, he honestly admits that “I started worrying about my relative contribution and whether I would be perceived as a Johnny-come-lately rather than a pioneer”.Despite his cynicism about how the system works, Ramakrishnan comes across as extremely ambitious and someone who spent a lot of time fretting whether he would miss out on this ultimate scientific accolade. Would the ribosome really merit an award? And, if so, which three of the numerous scientists involved during something like 20 years of research would be named on the citation? A criticism I have of the book is that so many scientists are named that it is easy to lose track of who did what, where and when. Unfortunately, there is no index so when a name reappears there is no simple way of tracing when he or she was first mentioned. Furthermore, after they have been first introduced, Ramakrishnan often refers to scientists only by their first names, and the text is littered with references to Tom, Dick (actually Richard!) and Harry, which means that even having an index would be of limited value as an aide memoire. Perhaps a cast list might be better.Based on his personal experience, Ramakrishnan provides lots of interesting details about the mechanism of announcing and then awarding the Nobel Prizes. No doubt like many other recipients have been, he was very suspicious when he received the phone call from Sweden informing him that he’d won. Also, curiously, he tells us that the banquet after the ceremony is televised and shown live in Sweden. But he comments: “I wouldn’t have thought spending the evening watching a group of strangers eat would make for much drama, but there were speeches and entertainment”.The book is quite technical in places, notably in terms of crystallographic techniques. Nonetheless, it is not necessary to understand the details in order to enjoy this book because this is an account of how the race for a Nobel Prize is won, or, more often, lost. And therein lies the focus of the book."
227,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107551528-shweata-n,5,"Science is often thought to be done by scientists who isolate themselves in a cocoon and come out with a breakthrough and fly like a butterfly. But this is far far from the realities of academia. 'Gene Machine' brilliantly portraits the competitive nature of science. The book is successful in making us realize that breakthroughs that come about in science are often driven by competition amongst peers, which is quite contrary to what is perceived by the ones outside of academia. The author begins his career in academia and is up for a rather shaky start with several ups and downs, finally deciding to switch fields from being a theoretical physicist to a biologist. In the book, he goes on to give an honest account of his academic career, making bold remarks about various events and people, along the way. Also, his descriptions do not fail to capture the competitiveness in science which often isn't touched upon by many. Not to mention, Venki Ramakrishnan has also done a great job in elucidating some of the complex and technical concepts of ribosomes, proteins, crystallography and others. He has done it in such a way that it is easy for anyone with any/no prior knowledge of the subject to understand the concepts and the limitation in our understanding of it. I felt that the analogies he used, especially the car one to help us realize the limitations in understanding of ribosome,were really simple yet amazing.One thing that was consistent throughout the book was that he consistently acknowledged the fact that he was really lucky and had the right set of people and ideas to make that breakthrough. His first breakthrough comes when his team is able to decipher the structure of the 30S structure of the ribosome. Then they go on to solve the atomic structure of the whole ribosome.And finally, he isn't afraid of discussing about the fact that the idea of prizes and awards. He remarks that ""Nevertheless, scientists are only human. Like everyone else, we can be ambitious and competitive and crave recognition. Instead of inculcating a feeling that the work is its own reward, the scientific establishment feeds this desire to feel special and somehow better than our peers at virtually every stage of the process"". This sort of encompassed the idea of awards are flawed yet people tend to associate high value to it and it is the intrinsic nature of humans to do so. He also goes on to criticize the Nobel prize because it's only awarded to three people in a field each year. This doesn't hold good with the fact that scientific discoveries are usually bought out by a group not a single person and therefore it doesn't make sense to give it to just three people. However, he wins the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009 along with his competitors Ada and Tom.In the epilogue, he says: "" I don't subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible"". I think this sort of sums up my views on science too. ( I must confess that he has phrased it so well, I could never have done that!)In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it who wants to know what 'real' science works and who wants to know the realities of being in academia."
228,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,4,"Nobel Laurate Venki Ramakrishnan’s first book is about his experiences in the race to elucidate the structure of ribosome. I had read an excerpt from this book earlier, where he talked about how winning a Nobel prize may not be the best thing for the scientist and how prizes, at times can be unfair. I liked it very much and was keen on reading the whole book. I finally got the chance after borrowing a copy from a friend.The book starts out with his experiences as a student of physics and his almost accidental entry into biology. It then covers his postdoctoral work that got him interested in ribosomes in the first place followed by his incredible journey across America and then to MRC, Cambridge, which was across the ocean. The book is mostly a personal account, focusing on his experiences and the struggles he and his lab went through. It eventually culminates with his winning the prize and the Nobel prize ceremony. I found the book highly additive and an easy read. Ramakrishnan has done a really nice job of explaining the challenges he faced. Especially, the part on x-ray crystallography is so well written that even someone like me, who runs away from these techniques could understand it. As someone who is in academia, what I liked most about the book though is the honesty and frankness with which the story has been narrated. He has been open about all the politics surrounding the whole ribosome community and science in general. He has also not shied away from his own competitiveness, secrecy and prejudice. Another great point is that he has acknowledged the work of his lab members because in the end, the success is as much theirs as his. After reading this book, I came to know of quite a few things. For instance, in the scientific community, the present trend has been towards doing more collaborative work. However, it has not been the case always. When scientists compete with each other for the same thing as was the case with the ribosome structure, things can at times become ugly. Overall, it may or may not turn to be good for science overall. However, in this case, the ending was happy and the efforts of all those involved lead to an addition of our understanding of one of the fundamental phenomena of nature.Finally, I would say that this book has been an enjoyable read. I think it is definitely a must read for every biologist!"
229,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46231899-laurie89,5," The ‘Gene Machine’ is a fascinating account of Venki Ramakrishnan’s path to uncovering the structure of the ribosome, which resulted in his receiving the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The cast of characters and places in this narrative are truly captivating and provide a cross-sectional view of the scientific life. The book provides insight into how successful scientific careers are forged. The starting point is Dr Ramakrishnan’s journey from India to a Ph.D program in physics at Ohio University. After obtaining a Ph.D. the author poignantly describes his decision to switch fields to biology and how this naturally led him to structural biology. A striking inclusion in this story are the descriptions of the self-doubt and the reasoning behind each change in position; from UC San Diego to Yale, Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island to Oak Ridge National laboratory Tennessee, Utah and finally the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. The author finds the right balance in describing the science and the important roles that his colleagues, mentors and students played. Ultimately the depictions of his laboratory and the research environment provide the reader with a taste of what is involved in a successful competitive scientific career. The humility of the author shines throughout the story.  The heart of the narrative focuses on the race to reveal the structure of the ribosome, which manufactures proteins from the genetic code. While the ribosome is often overlooked by the general public, it is of utmost importance the functioning of all cellular life. The expository includes the history of ribosome and the genetic code, basic biology and the basic techniques in x-ray crystallography. The true break-through in structural biology that was necessary to realize the high resolution images is less clear. It would have greatly helped if there had been an appendix to describe this part of the science so that the readers could have also understand this important context. The book is also lacking an index and a more detailed bibliography of the resulting scientific articles.  This skillful memoir, which is fast paced and reads like a novel, is likely to become a scientific classic about the competition at the cutting edge of science. "
230,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42307468-siddharth-saravanan,3,"This book had 3 distinct phases for me. 1st phase regarding his emigration to the US and his subsequent foray into different aspects of Science was engaging, especially the way in which the author almost accidentally stumbled upon something which would turn out to be his lifelong goal! //Made me reflect on the fact that we need to be open in trying out different aspects of a particular field/life in order to land on something which we feel passionate towards dedicating a major portion of our lives 2nd phase covers the methods used by the author and the madcap race to cross the finishing line before anybody else. Although I'm a student of Biology, most of the science flew over my head because it dealt with techniques like crystallography, X-ray diffraction etc. which I have little idea about. The race to discover the structure is fascinating, but we'll have to wade through multiple scientific techniques and dozens of names and contributions from different people involved in the process, which can be quite hard.//Found it fascinating how so many different people are involved in the process. Though it makes the reading hard, really loved how the author credited every single person involved in the mammoth race! 3rd phase, and the best phase, talks about the ecosystem of prizes and the very hit-and-miss nature of them. We as a society have glorified the Nobel Prize, and rightly so. However it was illuminating reading about how the Nobel isn't all encompassing and is flawed in quite a few ways, along with the numerous other scientific prizes. Gave me a lot of perspective on the nature of credit, and the unfairness which is intrinsic in the whole process//(Brownie points for the statement that ethnic and ultra nationalistic pride is the opposite of racism and xenophobia. Rang true within me)"
231,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,2,"Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most difficult to answer. One such is that of how many Indians have won the Nobel Prize so far. The figure can be as high as twelve, if you count Ronald Ross, Rudyard Kipling, Dalai Lama, V S Naipaul and Mother Teresa. Some or of Indian origin, or been born in India or left India too early in their career. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan was a graduate of Physics from Baroda but immediately migrated to the US for further studies. He won the Nobel in Chemistry in 2009 for ribosome research along with two others. Ramakrishnan’s research strengthened our understanding of the fundamental processes of life and provided a clue to the evolution of modern species of life. This book is a combination of popular science and an autobiography with a seamless blending of the two. His life is devoted to research and learning.We know that our genetic material is locked up in a structure called DNA inside the nucleus of each of our cells. Apart from heredity, these contain recipes for building proteins which are essential for life. Insulin, adrenaline and albumin are all proteins required to sustain the organism. What makes these proteins inside a cell is a molecular gene-machine called ribosome. This machine reads the component list from data derived from the DNA and assembles the protein using amino acids just like a production line. The critical nature of the process need not be emphasized further, as the animal will soon be dead if the pathways are somehow clogged. Virtually every molecule in every cell in every form of life is either made by the ribosome or made by enzymes that are themselves made by ribosomes. Discovery of ribosomes and its role in making protein is the culmination of one of the great triumphs in modern biology. This was by no means easy as the ribosome is not a simple molecule like DNA. It was enormous and complex. The attempt to decipher it was taken up by Crick and Watson, who found the structure of DNA but was abandoned in despair.Ramakrishnan was attracted to ribosomes by an article in the magazine Scientific American. He knew practically nothing of biology which he made up through courses studied part-time. Thus we have a physicist who studied the structure of a crucial biological unit being awarded with a Nobel in chemistry! He attempted to solve the ribosome structure first by neutron scattering which was eventually proved ineffective but was well understood by people with a physics background. The author dwells at length on the step by step progress in revealing the structure and the race with other scientists doing similar work, but this is not in a form that can be easily digested by ordinary readers. I found it extremely tedious especially after reading Siddhartha Mukherjee’s great book ‘The Gene - An Intimate History’ a few weeks before. Of course, you cannot expect such lucidity from a Nobel laureate, but the pertinent fact is that almost all of the readers are not Nobel laureates themselves. It is only during the autobiographical passages that the book becomes even slightly interesting.Study of ribosomes is important in learning how medicines cure us of diseases. Some antibiotics work by blocking the protein creation function of bacterial ribosomes. This is done by binding to a vulnerable location in its structure. Since bacterial and human ribosomes are very different, humans will not be adversely affected by the mechanism of its action. This study also casts light on the dark alleyways of early evolution. Building blocks of RNA can be made from simple chemicals that could have been around in the earth billions of years ago. It may be possible that life emerged with lots of randomly made RNA molecules until some of them could reproduce entirely by themselves. RNA could also preserve heredity between generations.This book presents some valid advice to novices in scientific research. The author asks them not to be hesitant to ask questions, however basic it might be. He justifies it by claiming that no question is too stupid to ask if you want to know the answer. It is also a bare necessity for present-day researchers to belong to the top-line institutes and laboratories. Advanced science has now become a team effort transcending national frontiers and continental boundaries. The members of the theoretical and testing facilities should be known to each other, otherwise it would be difficult to obtain and manage precious time allocated for using sophisticated machines.The author makes a short but pointed criticism of the Nobel award conventions. There is a ‘Rule of Three’ in force. This means that the award, if shared, shall not be divided into more than three parts. This criterion is claimed to be impractical now. When the prize started in 1901, scientists worked in relative isolation and met only once every few years. By the time they announced their results, there was no question of who had discovered what. In the current world, an idea quickly spreads and a lot of people contribute to it in various measures and capacities. And it is not always clear whether the original idea or a later contribution was the truly ground breaking advance. It is a difficult task to select three people from a crowd of somewhat equal contributors without causing resentment or heartburn.Ramakrishnan left India very early and harbours no soft spots in his mind for the mother country. Ignorant of his real feelings, thousands of naïve Indians sent congratulatory emails to him upon winning the Nobel. This clogged his inbox and they received a curt reminder that ‘nationality was an accident of birth’ and by corollary, he does not attach much importance to it. This is a clear case of brain drain.The narrative about the role and secrets of ribosomes is disappointingly matter-of-fact. The author has failed to share the awe he might have felt in revealing the heretofore hidden details. The scientist’s idea of a paper for publishing in a journal is too far away from an ordinary reader’s preference of what is interesting. The book is a veritable Who’s Who of the rapidly growing field of structural biology in general and ribosomes in particular. The author has had a great collaboration with like-minded scholars from across the globe. There are many photographs of co-workers and even rivals. The illustrations given as part of the description are not at all helpful. Relevance has not been a parameter for inclusion as we even see a conceptual diagram of a four-stroke internal combustion engine as part of the narrative.The book is recommended only to serious readers."
232,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"I want sure what I got myself into when I picked up this book, but I can definitely say that it was well worth the read. While the book is focused primarily on figuring out the structure of the ribosome, the story Venki shares about his entrance into this particular field in science, the people he's met and worked with, and what came about from all of his work is very informative. We often hear about the accomplishment of folks like Venki, but rarely get a glimpse of what they went through to get there, this book covers that and more.Upon completing the book, I was left with two lingering thoughts, the first was I had no idea what he was talking about towards the later half of the book. Venki writes, in great detail the vast test, processes, and failures he went through to finally generate crystals that could be used to decipher the ribosome. These chapters were difficult to follow for a layman like myself, but I stuck with it. If he took the time to explain his work of many years, the least I could do is spend a couple hours reading about it.The second thought, was that I do not think there was a single person Venki left out of his story that did not have a direct or indirect influence on his project. He went out of his way to talk about a lot of people who pioneered earlier discoveries into crystallizing molecules, mentors who encouraged him to push the boundaries, peers who kept him in check, and students who brought in new fresh ideas to the problem so hand. This is the part of the book I really enjoyed, the simple act of a person who accomplished something significant, giving recognition were it was due."
233,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15971935-mark-stidham,4,"This was a fun read for me because of its subject matter (the elucidation of the structure of the ribosome). It could be of broader interest because it is a first person account of the life of a scientist in a competitive race to solve a scientific question. As a biochemist almost the same age as the author, I related to the story arc, even though there isn't much similarity in our careers. There is the struggle to find a niche, long investments in study and techniques that end up being useless, and frustrating search for job stability. This particular story is similar to others that feature competitive research and the need to obtain respect from peers. The author spends a good amount of time explaining the benefits and the downsides to the science community hierarchy epitomized by the competition for the Nobel Prize. That Ramakrishnan won a share of the prize is evidence of some objectivity in the process. But overall, the Prize seems more of a club.I was unable to pay attention to this particular race to find the structure of the ribosome, and the book should not be viewed as any more than an introduction to that subject. I look forward to learning the details in the scholarly papers. But it should be mentioned that this incredible biological machine was completely misunderstood not too long ago. It is humbling that such a fundamental process is only now being elucidated, and it shows that there are many more astonishing aspects of our biochemistry to be discovered in the future"

During these tumultuous times, one must stay strong by being sane and there is no more powerful refuge of sanity than books. Thankfully I had packed 3 of them when I had to leave for my emergency service. I finished the first one just last evening. I don't read books on the history of science much often, and had picked up 'Gene Machine' on the recommendations of one of my buddies. This one is Venki Ramakrishnan's side of the fascinating story of how the structure and functions of Ribosome, a cellular organelle, were discovered and how the long journey over decades lead to the Nobel Prize for the author and his two main competitors. The hard work behind every discovery, the cooperation and competition between scientists, the jealousy between them, the politics of awards and their after effects is delved on in detail. The book is a repository of knowledge on biology, which however has been tiring for me as biology was never my favourite subject. In our country, the lives of scientists are never that well discussed except some few like Einstein, Bose, Newton, Meghnad Saha and Jagdish Chandra Bose. This book will be a happy addition to that small grouping. The story of how the structure and functions of the Ribosome, the organelle that synthesizes proteins, and lays the building blocks of life, were explained before the world, is truly an engaging one."
235,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104610180-aquila-michiryu,4,"In Gene Machine, Venki Ramakrishnan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, recounts his scientific journey of unraveling the structure of the ribosome and its biological mysteries. More than that, he honestly reveals the politics and competition present in the realm of science, and how various factors such as luck, personalities, jealousy, money and the desire for awards can all inextricably influence the potential for success as a scientist. He also shares his views on the Nobel Prize (and his experience of winning the prize) and how there is subjectivity present when the panel decides who the prize should be awarded to.As a biology student, I learnt about the ribosome when I studied about the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome. At that time, I didn’t place much thought on how the information in my lecture notes came about. How did scientists find out about the structures of the various components in the cell? And specifically, how did they know what function each component played? Admittedly, these questions rarely crossed my mind when I was a student then, since I didn’t want to waste time ruminating on whatever wasn’t in the syllabus at that time.Reading this book has revealed the “behind-the-scenes” of the scientific discovery of ribosome and I realised that I have underestimated the amount of time and effort these scientists have spent to glean the knowledge we can now comfortably obtain. Moreover, I appreciate the author’s objective revelation about the presence of politics and competition in the scientific community, including how the highly-respected Nobel Prize can be subjective and fallible, things I didn’t hear about previously.Having said that, I can expect readers unfamiliar with the ribosome to not appreciate this book as much due to its scientific nature (though the author tries to simplify the highly scientific details to make it easier for general readers to understand). I had to research on X-Ray Crystallography to find out exactly how it works as it was only briefly mentioned in the book.If you know what the ribosome is, this is an insightful and enlightening book to read!"
236,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90507383-mahin,5,"My friends who aren’t in STEM are incredulous to find out how hyper-competitive (and cut-throat) research can be. Science is viewed as incorruptible. But that doesn’t mean that scientists are necessarily paragons of rationality or truth; sometimes, they guard their knowledge and results out of fear that a peer will ""scoop"" them. In spite of this, science is a collaborative process by necessity. In Gene Machine, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan shares his perspective on the race to discover the ribosome’s structure. He also shares his experiences as an outsider; first as a physicist by training who belatedly discovered his interest in biology and second as an Indian immigrant to the US, where he often lived in majority-white towns (in Ohio and Utah). As a biochemist, I found that Venki explained his research in a way that is accessible to those who aren't scientists (or even biologists). As a result, I found myself skimming over descriptions of DNA, RNA, and other elementary biological concepts; but I appreciated their inclusion for readers who may have forgotten or don't have that knowledge. Another reviewer remarked that you wouldn't expect a book about the discovery of the ribosome's structure to be so gripping, an assessment with which I agree. I think Gene Machine will prove to be one of the best science books to be published in 2018."

That is to say, it follows the well-trodden path of 
The Double Helix
. It definitely gets a lot more hard-science than other books in that vein, though; I found some of the technical details about the ribosome hard to follow here, but I admit the problem may well have been that I had to put down the book for a couple of months halfway through and in the interim forgot the intricacies that he'd introduced earlier. The account is generally otherwise pretty easy to read: the author's surprisingly candid about various things, and he seems like an interesting character."

I am not very interested in chemistry, so I did not find it much interesting.Researchers however must read it to check out how that world functions. Author calls Noble prize a lottery! He honestly describes the pitfalls and limitations of Nobel (or any recognition). It helps to put the awards and recognition in perspective. Many times mind tricks us in thinking award as the aim. This book can tell you how random the selection actually is! It is not exactly correlated with the work you do, work is ofcourse important but there are other dominant factors which no one can control.Concluding -For scientists - must readOthers can safely skip. You won't miss anything.By the way, this is a kind of accidental read for me.

Ramakrishnan is less relatable and perhaps not as self-reflective or self-aware as Jahren, but his love of the work and his wry sense of humor shines through. He also opens a door into a world few enter, even scientists, as he shines a rare candid light on the politics of working in a competitive field and of being in the running for the Nobel Prize. "

At the beginning only the briefest description of its structure and function was given. As a result much of what was presented as the sequence of discoveries leading to understanding the ribosome was difficult to follow. At no point were there any diagrams or pictures to help the reader. The author also (to his credit perhaps) cited virtually everyone who contributed to the research, from the most senior experts down to the undergraduates who worked in the labs for a year or two. This may have been an interesting story to someone much more knowledgeable but it wasn't a book for the interested layman."

249,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30640144-abhijit-basu,4,"REVIEW OF VENKI RAMAKRISHNAN’S ‘GENE MACHINE’What are ribosomes? Why are they of such importance that teams of dedicated chemical and biological scientists across the world made it their lives’ mission to investigate ribosome’s inner structure over three decades since the early 1980s? The reason behind the great scientific quest is that the genetic information encoded on the DNA would have been of no use without the ribosome molecule as essential cellular processing machine to translate these instructions for making proteins, the building blocks of life. It is on this logic that the 2009 Chemistry Nobel Laureate (joint) Sir Venki Ramakrishnan calls his memoir ‘gene machine.’ Foremost among the factors that make the book so appealing to read is the author’s personal candour – about his ambition, about his professional worries and above all else, about his determination to count in the race for scientific recognition as a ‘dark horse.’ As Siddhartha Mukherjee (author of ‘Emperor of All Maladies’) puts it, his story is that of an ‘outsider’ – twice over. First, as an immigrant settling in the USA and UK, and then, as a PhD in Physics doing his life’s chosen work in molecular biology. Another quality of the book is the author’s writing style. Ramakrishnan has his own way with words and even the more technical middle chapters of the book are laced with enough humour and witty anecdotes to keep interest alive. He is a master of metaphor too – making complex science understandable to lay readers with simple examples. After putting things scientifically – that the ribosome, a ‘giant’ molecule with over a million atoms (still small enough to pack 4000 in the width of a human hair), is the link between our genes and the proteins they specify, he makes the point that understanding how it works will depend on how it structurally looks. He then drives home the importance of that knowing and understanding by a simple allegory. Imagine you are a Martian peering down at earth, he says. You observe tiny objects moving straight or occasionally turning. Look little closer and you find movement happens only when tinier moving things enter those objects. Driven by curiosity, you want to see how the objects are constructed. You find that it is made of numerous working parts, including an engine connected to a crankshaft that makes the wheels turn. You look even closer to find that the engine itself has pistons and sucks in fuel and air that is ignited with a spark plug to drive the piston forward. It is the same with understanding molecules that make life. Understanding DNA and RNA molecules was a big step. But cracking the jigsaw puzzle needed understanding of how the ‘enormous’ ribosomes were constructed which enabled them to decode the DNA information of nucleotide sequence carried by messenger RNAs ‘to stitch together amino acids brought by transfer RNAs into protein.’ Importantly, the author also explains how, by knowing the structure and components of the bacterial ribosome, the work has opened up avenues to development of new antibiotics.It is an engaging story about the agonies and ecstasies, about the disappointments and lucky breaks of ‘rival’ scientists competing in a race for success. The pursuit of success is often made tense by an atmosphere surcharged with ‘politics for recognition.’ At the same time there is cooperation too among the community of scientists, helped by seminars, conferences and mutual discussions which enable cross-pollination of ideas. Ramakrishnan attributes this competitive cooperation to the ‘inbred’ nature of modern scientific discoveries. The 2009 Chemistry Nobel Prize was awarded jointly to three persons. Ada Yonath from Israel was the first to make headway in ribosome crystallisation and kept at it with dogged application for decades. Then there was Tom Steitz, American biochemist and a leading crystallographer of his generation, who, in collaboration with Peter Moore, effectively began the last lap of the race by publishing the atomic structure of the larger (50S) ribosomal subunit. Finally, there was Venki Ramakrishnan, an ‘accidental ribosome biologist’ and a latecomer to the field, who caught up with the others by leading his energetic team of bright postdoc and student associates working round the clock across their trans-Atlantic divide at Cambridge and Utah to achieve high-resolution ‘crystal’ structure of the smaller (30S) ribosome subunit (and later the entire (70S) ribosome, throwing light on the code translation process and on the mechanism of blocking action exploited by antibiotics). Yet, as candidly acknowledged by the author, there were other key contributors who got regrettably left out of Nobel recognition due to the ‘three-recipient limitation’ of the prize. Moreover, as Ramakrishnan himself alludes to in the book’s epilogue, while he and the two others received the recognition for their pioneering work in using crystallography to explore ribosome, with subsequent advancement in electron microscopy, a more direct method allowing higher resolution is now available to investigate organelle structure. The epilogue also contains an endearingly modest, even bordering on philosophical, reflection by the author, in the context of the flood of honours and awards that he received following the ‘Nobel Lottery’, as he calls it, echoing Francis Crick. Referencing the Bible, he cites Matthew 13.12: 'For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.' As already mentioned, the book has quite a few comical anecdotes to liven up things. For instance, there is the story of how Pat Unwin and Carlos Taddei worked at obtaining two-dimensional protein crystals from lizard ovary cells in 1977—the first demonstration that ribosomes were indeed crystallizable. The maverick Taddei was given to insouciantly puffing at his cigar in the lab and regularly setting off the fire alarms. After some time, the experiment was abandoned as the crystals were found not good enough to reveal a detailed atomic arrangement. The unchaperoned lizards left in the basement escaped and were to be seen scampering around the grounds of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology for years thereafter. Another interesting anecdote relates to the author’s two encounters with James Watson. On both occasions, the brash and acerbic American geneticist made light of Ramakrishnan’s labours, saying, ‘Forget the Nobel.’ However, the same Watson was seen attending a lecture by Ramakrishnan and later dispelling Ramakrishnan’s apprehensions by approving his selection as a Nobel Committee expert for the coveted Prize.A COMPARISONIn my personal view as a one-time researcher in Chemistry and a lover of good literature, ‘Gene Machine’ is a thrilling story of a down-to-earth scientist’s quest in a niche area of research holding promise for a clearer understanding of the secrets of life and of better ways to treat complicated maladies. In comparison with other genre books written by Nobel Laureate scientists, I would rate the book in the ‘very good’ category, with a four stars grade. ‘The Double Helix’ (1968) – James Watson’s brilliant account of decoding the DNA – gets ‘excellent’ rating with five stars to boot. But at the top rung of my assessment would be ‘Order out of Chaos’ (1984) – a deeply thought-provoking account of the philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics and its theory of entropy or universal tendency towards disorderliness – written by Ilya Prigogine, 1977 Physical Chemistry Nobel Laureate and his co-author, scientific philosopher Isabelle Stengers. That book, with its readability value and profound philosophical contents, should merit a super-excellent six-star rating almost at par with Erwin Schrödinger’s 1943 book, ‘What is Life?’ Of course, Schrödinger’s book, being an amazingly prophetic foray by a Quantum Physicist into the chemical-biological secret of life’s ‘code script’ is of a different class because it transcends the borders of the scientist’s own Nobel-winning work. Yet all said and done, ‘Gene Machine’, with its insights into the pleasures and pains of the race for scientific recognition, certainly deserves a place of its own at these commanding heights of scientific literature."
250,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43858998-linda-gaines,2,"I'm rather disappointed with this book. First I was really interested in learning about the ribosome and how it functions was discovered. I do feel like I learned a bit, but I really don't understand the different techniques they used to understand how it works. I just don't think it was explained well. Secondly, this book needed a better editor. I understand it was a personal story of the author's career and how the various scientists interacted, but it went off on far too many tangents such that I got lost. So many people were introduced, but only superficially, that I completely forgot who most of them were by the end of the chapter. Also, near the beginning the author talks about the discovery of the structure of DNA and never once mentions Rosalind Franklin, which was a particularly glaring omission. Then halfway through the book, she in mentioned with regards to people who used to be in her lab, and he never explains who she was and what she did for science and DNA. Not once. Perhaps I should blame the editor and not the author for that. In any event, the book needed a better editor."

Much of it highlights the various researchers, post docs, grad students etc. involved in the search for understanding the structure and function of the ribosome. The lab techniques are difficult to follow at best, even for someone with a science background. Every now and then there are revealing bits of information as to what was discovered. There is a place for this type of writing, but it just didn't hold my interest. What did strike me is how complex the research world is. Collaboration and competition go hand in hand - not an easy pair to balance! Also, many many people, sometimes over generations, are often involved in these major breakthroughs. I understand the need to recognize them and regret that I just wasn't able to take all of those individual stories in."
252,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52557863-grrlscientist,4,"What it is really like to be a scientist, especially a scientist who has been awarded the “most nobel” scientific prize of all?Written by 2009 co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Venkatraman “Venki” Ramakrishnan, an American and British structural biologist who grew up in India, 
Gene Machine: The race to decipher the secrets of the ribosome
 (Basic Books; 2018) is an engaging account of one man’s many scientific contributions to solve the structure of the ribosome, a small structure that is the workhorse of the cell, building the proteins necessary for life.The author begins his story in India, where he studied physics before immigrating to the United States to earn his doctorate in physics. During this time, he met and married — a major life event served to refocus his attention on how to successfully provide for his family as a working scientist. Confronted with a lifetime of “boring and incremental calculations that wouldn’t result in any real advance in understanding”, Dr. Ramakrishnan took a big risk and abruptly shifted his career focus to molecular biology after reading an article about the ribosome in Scientific American. To do this, he spent two years as a grad student in molecular biology at UCSD, gaining essential knowledge and skills necessary to pursue his new career.Because electron microscopy was in its infancy during most of this work, this meant that an older technique, x-ray crystallography, was the main tool used to decipher the structure of the ribosome. But x-ray crystallography created fuzzier, less detailed images than electron microscopy, so this led to the field being informally known as “blobology”.Despite disappointments and setbacks in his second career, Dr. Ramakrishnan persisted for more than 30 years before being awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, being named president of the Royal Society of London, the world’s oldest scientific society and then being knighted in the 2012. (He does not generally use the honorific ‘Sir’.)In this book, Dr. Ramakrishnan clearly explains the science, and highlights the sometimes convoluted process of how science actually works. He details the inside story of lab life including the struggles, failures and blind alleys, the collaborators and friends, the professional competitors and rivals, and the timely and critically important help provided by a number of scientists, as Dr. Ramakrishnan and his team worked tirelessly to solve the structure of this microscopic biological machine. As the story of the author’s professional life unfolds, we learn how a scientist develops the ideas, skills, tools — and the people, along with all the quirks and talents that each one embodies — that are essential to achieve such a remarkable scientific discovery.This profoundly human story is written with honesty and humility, and the author isn’t afraid to laugh at himself. For example, his story about the phone call in October was amusing, and he even shares his wife’s incredulous response when she first learned he had won the Nobel Prize: “I thought you had to be really smart to win one of those!” (Ramakrishnan 237).One element of this story that impressed me most was Dr. Ramakrishnan’s unfailing generosity to his collaborators and his competitors alike. In fact, one of the key themes in this book is that most contemporary science is not about individual achievement; rather, it’s a synthesis of ideas and progress by teams of highly dedicated individuals who devote their lives to solving questions they find compelling.At the end of the book, Dr. Ramakrishnan ponders the nature of science: “When we have a clear goal in mind, we think we are struggling to reach a summit. But there is no summit. When we get there, we realize we have just climbed a foothill, and there is an endless series of mountains ahead still to be climbed.” (Ramakrishnan 256).The author devotes the Epilogue to present some thoughts on the influence (both good and bad) of Truly Big Prizes, particularly the Nobel and the Breakthrough Prizes, upon scientific careers and scientific progress:“So I don’t subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even that much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We humans tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible. And when someone like Newton or Einstein sees much further than others, or Watson and Crick synthesize in one stroke the essential features of DNA that might have dribbled out in pieces, we tend to immortalize them.” (Ramakrishnan 264).This lucid and highly readable account will be enjoyed by students in any of the sciences, by those interested in the history of science, or who love reading memoirs. But really, I think that anyone who is captivated by an absorbing story well told will find much to appreciate in this fascinating book.NOTE: Originally published at Forbes on 30 November 2018.

If, however, you are looking to understand what exactly the life of a scientist can entail, then pick up a copy and dig in, you're in for a wild intercontinental ride!I rated this book 4/5, from an internal scoring of 8, two points were dropped for the name dropping (a LOT of people are named) and slightly opaque scientific descriptions."
255,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/534526-robert,3,"Having just finished helping my daughter study for her AP biology exam, I was able to hang with some of the technical discussion. However, this book is still very science heavy.Interesting look into how the scientific/academic/Nobel prize world works. Pretty dry."
256,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"Venki Ramakrishnan’s book is the story of the race to understand the structure and workings of the ribosome, and his part in that. He comes across as a modest, self-deprecating person, able to reveal his weaknesses as well as his strengths, and someone who is generous in acknowledging the contributions of others. As with many scientists of great aptitude, he lacks arrogance and at times comes across as quite diffident as to his abilities, fearing that others are better qualified than he is to solve this puzzle. His book does a wonderful job of conveying the combination of friendliness and rivalry that accompanies any scientific contest, no more so than when solving a problem of this importance. The journey is a roller coaster where one day his team seems to be ahead of his rivals, and the next a paper is published that suggests they are behind. He successfully expresses how his emotions rose and sank, as he continually tried to figure out where he was in relation to others in the race. In some respects, the book reminds me of The Double Helix by James Watson which recounts a similar, frantic rush to beat the competition to establish the structure of an important biological molecule. A chapter I found fascinating was one where Ramakrishnan discussed the politics of scientific awards, including the Nobel Prize, arguing that the system can become a closed-club where the same scientists repeatedly win prestigious honours. He was particularly critical of Nobel Prizes, writing: “Because many of the early Nobel laureates were giants in their field, the idea has taken hold – especially among non-scientists – that Nobel laureates are geniuses. In fact, the prize is not awarded for being a great scientist but rather for making a groundbreaking discovery or invention. Some of them may be extraordinarily brilliant, but others are just good scientists who were persistent or happened to stumble onto a major finding. Being in the right place at the right time often helped enormously”. He also blasted the rule that limits the number of winners to three. This may have been appropriate a century ago, but nowadays it doesn’t reflect the collaboration, intentional or otherwise, that marks most major scientific advances.He also writes about what he calls post-Nobelitis. As he puts it: “Suddenly, scientists are thrust into the limelight and bask in the public adulation that goes with it. They are asked for their opinion on everything under the sun, regardless of their own expertise, and it soon goes to their head. Some of them are long past their prime, having made their big discoveries decades earlier, and the renewed attention means that they spend their time wandering around the world, pontificating about all sorts of things”. Ramakrishnan knew that solving the mystery of the ribosome was worthy of a Nobel Prize but, with the rule of three in mind, he honestly admits that “I started worrying about my relative contribution and whether I would be perceived as a Johnny-come-lately rather than a pioneer”.Despite his cynicism about how the system works, Ramakrishnan comes across as extremely ambitious and someone who spent a lot of time fretting whether he would miss out on this ultimate scientific accolade. Would the ribosome really merit an award? And, if so, which three of the numerous scientists involved during something like 20 years of research would be named on the citation? A criticism I have of the book is that so many scientists are named that it is easy to lose track of who did what, where and when. Unfortunately, there is no index so when a name reappears there is no simple way of tracing when he or she was first mentioned. Furthermore, after they have been first introduced, Ramakrishnan often refers to scientists only by their first names, and the text is littered with references to Tom, Dick (actually Richard!) and Harry, which means that even having an index would be of limited value as an aide memoire. Perhaps a cast list might be better.Based on his personal experience, Ramakrishnan provides lots of interesting details about the mechanism of announcing and then awarding the Nobel Prizes. No doubt like many other recipients have been, he was very suspicious when he received the phone call from Sweden informing him that he’d won. Also, curiously, he tells us that the banquet after the ceremony is televised and shown live in Sweden. But he comments: “I wouldn’t have thought spending the evening watching a group of strangers eat would make for much drama, but there were speeches and entertainment”.The book is quite technical in places, notably in terms of crystallographic techniques. Nonetheless, it is not necessary to understand the details in order to enjoy this book because this is an account of how the race for a Nobel Prize is won, or, more often, lost. And therein lies the focus of the book."
257,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107551528-shweata-n,5,"Science is often thought to be done by scientists who isolate themselves in a cocoon and come out with a breakthrough and fly like a butterfly. But this is far far from the realities of academia. 'Gene Machine' brilliantly portraits the competitive nature of science. The book is successful in making us realize that breakthroughs that come about in science are often driven by competition amongst peers, which is quite contrary to what is perceived by the ones outside of academia. The author begins his career in academia and is up for a rather shaky start with several ups and downs, finally deciding to switch fields from being a theoretical physicist to a biologist. In the book, he goes on to give an honest account of his academic career, making bold remarks about various events and people, along the way. Also, his descriptions do not fail to capture the competitiveness in science which often isn't touched upon by many. Not to mention, Venki Ramakrishnan has also done a great job in elucidating some of the complex and technical concepts of ribosomes, proteins, crystallography and others. He has done it in such a way that it is easy for anyone with any/no prior knowledge of the subject to understand the concepts and the limitation in our understanding of it. I felt that the analogies he used, especially the car one to help us realize the limitations in understanding of ribosome,were really simple yet amazing.One thing that was consistent throughout the book was that he consistently acknowledged the fact that he was really lucky and had the right set of people and ideas to make that breakthrough. His first breakthrough comes when his team is able to decipher the structure of the 30S structure of the ribosome. Then they go on to solve the atomic structure of the whole ribosome.And finally, he isn't afraid of discussing about the fact that the idea of prizes and awards. He remarks that ""Nevertheless, scientists are only human. Like everyone else, we can be ambitious and competitive and crave recognition. Instead of inculcating a feeling that the work is its own reward, the scientific establishment feeds this desire to feel special and somehow better than our peers at virtually every stage of the process"". This sort of encompassed the idea of awards are flawed yet people tend to associate high value to it and it is the intrinsic nature of humans to do so. He also goes on to criticize the Nobel prize because it's only awarded to three people in a field each year. This doesn't hold good with the fact that scientific discoveries are usually bought out by a group not a single person and therefore it doesn't make sense to give it to just three people. However, he wins the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009 along with his competitors Ada and Tom.In the epilogue, he says: "" I don't subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible"". I think this sort of sums up my views on science too. ( I must confess that he has phrased it so well, I could never have done that!)In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it who wants to know what 'real' science works and who wants to know the realities of being in academia."
258,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,4,"Nobel Laurate Venki Ramakrishnan’s first book is about his experiences in the race to elucidate the structure of ribosome. I had read an excerpt from this book earlier, where he talked about how winning a Nobel prize may not be the best thing for the scientist and how prizes, at times can be unfair. I liked it very much and was keen on reading the whole book. I finally got the chance after borrowing a copy from a friend.The book starts out with his experiences as a student of physics and his almost accidental entry into biology. It then covers his postdoctoral work that got him interested in ribosomes in the first place followed by his incredible journey across America and then to MRC, Cambridge, which was across the ocean. The book is mostly a personal account, focusing on his experiences and the struggles he and his lab went through. It eventually culminates with his winning the prize and the Nobel prize ceremony. I found the book highly additive and an easy read. Ramakrishnan has done a really nice job of explaining the challenges he faced. Especially, the part on x-ray crystallography is so well written that even someone like me, who runs away from these techniques could understand it. As someone who is in academia, what I liked most about the book though is the honesty and frankness with which the story has been narrated. He has been open about all the politics surrounding the whole ribosome community and science in general. He has also not shied away from his own competitiveness, secrecy and prejudice. Another great point is that he has acknowledged the work of his lab members because in the end, the success is as much theirs as his. After reading this book, I came to know of quite a few things. For instance, in the scientific community, the present trend has been towards doing more collaborative work. However, it has not been the case always. When scientists compete with each other for the same thing as was the case with the ribosome structure, things can at times become ugly. Overall, it may or may not turn to be good for science overall. However, in this case, the ending was happy and the efforts of all those involved lead to an addition of our understanding of one of the fundamental phenomena of nature.Finally, I would say that this book has been an enjoyable read. I think it is definitely a must read for every biologist!"
259,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46231899-laurie89,5," The ‘Gene Machine’ is a fascinating account of Venki Ramakrishnan’s path to uncovering the structure of the ribosome, which resulted in his receiving the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The cast of characters and places in this narrative are truly captivating and provide a cross-sectional view of the scientific life. The book provides insight into how successful scientific careers are forged. The starting point is Dr Ramakrishnan’s journey from India to a Ph.D program in physics at Ohio University. After obtaining a Ph.D. the author poignantly describes his decision to switch fields to biology and how this naturally led him to structural biology. A striking inclusion in this story are the descriptions of the self-doubt and the reasoning behind each change in position; from UC San Diego to Yale, Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island to Oak Ridge National laboratory Tennessee, Utah and finally the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. The author finds the right balance in describing the science and the important roles that his colleagues, mentors and students played. Ultimately the depictions of his laboratory and the research environment provide the reader with a taste of what is involved in a successful competitive scientific career. The humility of the author shines throughout the story.  The heart of the narrative focuses on the race to reveal the structure of the ribosome, which manufactures proteins from the genetic code. While the ribosome is often overlooked by the general public, it is of utmost importance the functioning of all cellular life. The expository includes the history of ribosome and the genetic code, basic biology and the basic techniques in x-ray crystallography. The true break-through in structural biology that was necessary to realize the high resolution images is less clear. It would have greatly helped if there had been an appendix to describe this part of the science so that the readers could have also understand this important context. The book is also lacking an index and a more detailed bibliography of the resulting scientific articles.  This skillful memoir, which is fast paced and reads like a novel, is likely to become a scientific classic about the competition at the cutting edge of science. "

Although I'm a student of Biology, most of the science flew over my head because it dealt with techniques like crystallography, X-ray diffraction etc. which I have little idea about. The race to discover the structure is fascinating, but we'll have to wade through multiple scientific techniques and dozens of names and contributions from different people involved in the process, which can be quite hard.//Found it fascinating how so many different people are involved in the process. Though it makes the reading hard, really loved how the author credited every single person involved in the mammoth race! 3rd phase, and the best phase, talks about the ecosystem of prizes and the very hit-and-miss nature of them. We as a society have glorified the Nobel Prize, and rightly so. However it was illuminating reading about how the Nobel isn't all encompassing and is flawed in quite a few ways, along with the numerous other scientific prizes. Gave me a lot of perspective on the nature of credit, and the unfairness which is intrinsic in the whole process//(Brownie points for the statement that ethnic and ultra nationalistic pride is the opposite of racism and xenophobia. Rang true within me)"
261,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,2,"Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most difficult to answer. One such is that of how many Indians have won the Nobel Prize so far. The figure can be as high as twelve, if you count Ronald Ross, Rudyard Kipling, Dalai Lama, V S Naipaul and Mother Teresa. Some or of Indian origin, or been born in India or left India too early in their career. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan was a graduate of Physics from Baroda but immediately migrated to the US for further studies. He won the Nobel in Chemistry in 2009 for ribosome research along with two others. Ramakrishnan’s research strengthened our understanding of the fundamental processes of life and provided a clue to the evolution of modern species of life. This book is a combination of popular science and an autobiography with a seamless blending of the two. His life is devoted to research and learning.We know that our genetic material is locked up in a structure called DNA inside the nucleus of each of our cells. Apart from heredity, these contain recipes for building proteins which are essential for life. Insulin, adrenaline and albumin are all proteins required to sustain the organism. What makes these proteins inside a cell is a molecular gene-machine called ribosome. This machine reads the component list from data derived from the DNA and assembles the protein using amino acids just like a production line. The critical nature of the process need not be emphasized further, as the animal will soon be dead if the pathways are somehow clogged. Virtually every molecule in every cell in every form of life is either made by the ribosome or made by enzymes that are themselves made by ribosomes. Discovery of ribosomes and its role in making protein is the culmination of one of the great triumphs in modern biology. This was by no means easy as the ribosome is not a simple molecule like DNA. It was enormous and complex. The attempt to decipher it was taken up by Crick and Watson, who found the structure of DNA but was abandoned in despair.Ramakrishnan was attracted to ribosomes by an article in the magazine Scientific American. He knew practically nothing of biology which he made up through courses studied part-time. Thus we have a physicist who studied the structure of a crucial biological unit being awarded with a Nobel in chemistry! He attempted to solve the ribosome structure first by neutron scattering which was eventually proved ineffective but was well understood by people with a physics background. The author dwells at length on the step by step progress in revealing the structure and the race with other scientists doing similar work, but this is not in a form that can be easily digested by ordinary readers. I found it extremely tedious especially after reading Siddhartha Mukherjee’s great book ‘The Gene - An Intimate History’ a few weeks before. Of course, you cannot expect such lucidity from a Nobel laureate, but the pertinent fact is that almost all of the readers are not Nobel laureates themselves. It is only during the autobiographical passages that the book becomes even slightly interesting.Study of ribosomes is important in learning how medicines cure us of diseases. Some antibiotics work by blocking the protein creation function of bacterial ribosomes. This is done by binding to a vulnerable location in its structure. Since bacterial and human ribosomes are very different, humans will not be adversely affected by the mechanism of its action. This study also casts light on the dark alleyways of early evolution. Building blocks of RNA can be made from simple chemicals that could have been around in the earth billions of years ago. It may be possible that life emerged with lots of randomly made RNA molecules until some of them could reproduce entirely by themselves. RNA could also preserve heredity between generations.This book presents some valid advice to novices in scientific research. The author asks them not to be hesitant to ask questions, however basic it might be. He justifies it by claiming that no question is too stupid to ask if you want to know the answer. It is also a bare necessity for present-day researchers to belong to the top-line institutes and laboratories. Advanced science has now become a team effort transcending national frontiers and continental boundaries. The members of the theoretical and testing facilities should be known to each other, otherwise it would be difficult to obtain and manage precious time allocated for using sophisticated machines.The author makes a short but pointed criticism of the Nobel award conventions. There is a ‘Rule of Three’ in force. This means that the award, if shared, shall not be divided into more than three parts. This criterion is claimed to be impractical now. When the prize started in 1901, scientists worked in relative isolation and met only once every few years. By the time they announced their results, there was no question of who had discovered what. In the current world, an idea quickly spreads and a lot of people contribute to it in various measures and capacities. And it is not always clear whether the original idea or a later contribution was the truly ground breaking advance. It is a difficult task to select three people from a crowd of somewhat equal contributors without causing resentment or heartburn.Ramakrishnan left India very early and harbours no soft spots in his mind for the mother country. Ignorant of his real feelings, thousands of naïve Indians sent congratulatory emails to him upon winning the Nobel. This clogged his inbox and they received a curt reminder that ‘nationality was an accident of birth’ and by corollary, he does not attach much importance to it. This is a clear case of brain drain.The narrative about the role and secrets of ribosomes is disappointingly matter-of-fact. The author has failed to share the awe he might have felt in revealing the heretofore hidden details. The scientist’s idea of a paper for publishing in a journal is too far away from an ordinary reader’s preference of what is interesting. The book is a veritable Who’s Who of the rapidly growing field of structural biology in general and ribosomes in particular. The author has had a great collaboration with like-minded scholars from across the globe. There are many photographs of co-workers and even rivals. The illustrations given as part of the description are not at all helpful. Relevance has not been a parameter for inclusion as we even see a conceptual diagram of a four-stroke internal combustion engine as part of the narrative.The book is recommended only to serious readers."
262,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"I want sure what I got myself into when I picked up this book, but I can definitely say that it was well worth the read. While the book is focused primarily on figuring out the structure of the ribosome, the story Venki shares about his entrance into this particular field in science, the people he's met and worked with, and what came about from all of his work is very informative. We often hear about the accomplishment of folks like Venki, but rarely get a glimpse of what they went through to get there, this book covers that and more.Upon completing the book, I was left with two lingering thoughts, the first was I had no idea what he was talking about towards the later half of the book. Venki writes, in great detail the vast test, processes, and failures he went through to finally generate crystals that could be used to decipher the ribosome. These chapters were difficult to follow for a layman like myself, but I stuck with it. If he took the time to explain his work of many years, the least I could do is spend a couple hours reading about it.The second thought, was that I do not think there was a single person Venki left out of his story that did not have a direct or indirect influence on his project. He went out of his way to talk about a lot of people who pioneered earlier discoveries into crystallizing molecules, mentors who encouraged him to push the boundaries, peers who kept him in check, and students who brought in new fresh ideas to the problem so hand. This is the part of the book I really enjoyed, the simple act of a person who accomplished something significant, giving recognition were it was due."
263,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15971935-mark-stidham,4,"This was a fun read for me because of its subject matter (the elucidation of the structure of the ribosome). It could be of broader interest because it is a first person account of the life of a scientist in a competitive race to solve a scientific question. As a biochemist almost the same age as the author, I related to the story arc, even though there isn't much similarity in our careers. There is the struggle to find a niche, long investments in study and techniques that end up being useless, and frustrating search for job stability. This particular story is similar to others that feature competitive research and the need to obtain respect from peers. The author spends a good amount of time explaining the benefits and the downsides to the science community hierarchy epitomized by the competition for the Nobel Prize. That Ramakrishnan won a share of the prize is evidence of some objectivity in the process. But overall, the Prize seems more of a club.I was unable to pay attention to this particular race to find the structure of the ribosome, and the book should not be viewed as any more than an introduction to that subject. I look forward to learning the details in the scholarly papers. But it should be mentioned that this incredible biological machine was completely misunderstood not too long ago. It is humbling that such a fundamental process is only now being elucidated, and it shows that there are many more astonishing aspects of our biochemistry to be discovered in the future"

During these tumultuous times, one must stay strong by being sane and there is no more powerful refuge of sanity than books. Thankfully I had packed 3 of them when I had to leave for my emergency service. I finished the first one just last evening. I don't read books on the history of science much often, and had picked up 'Gene Machine' on the recommendations of one of my buddies. This one is Venki Ramakrishnan's side of the fascinating story of how the structure and functions of Ribosome, a cellular organelle, were discovered and how the long journey over decades lead to the Nobel Prize for the author and his two main competitors. The hard work behind every discovery, the cooperation and competition between scientists, the jealousy between them, the politics of awards and their after effects is delved on in detail. The book is a repository of knowledge on biology, which however has been tiring for me as biology was never my favourite subject. In our country, the lives of scientists are never that well discussed except some few like Einstein, Bose, Newton, Meghnad Saha and Jagdish Chandra Bose. This book will be a happy addition to that small grouping. The story of how the structure and functions of the Ribosome, the organelle that synthesizes proteins, and lays the building blocks of life, were explained before the world, is truly an engaging one."
265,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104610180-aquila-michiryu,4,"In Gene Machine, Venki Ramakrishnan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, recounts his scientific journey of unraveling the structure of the ribosome and its biological mysteries. More than that, he honestly reveals the politics and competition present in the realm of science, and how various factors such as luck, personalities, jealousy, money and the desire for awards can all inextricably influence the potential for success as a scientist. He also shares his views on the Nobel Prize (and his experience of winning the prize) and how there is subjectivity present when the panel decides who the prize should be awarded to.As a biology student, I learnt about the ribosome when I studied about the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome. At that time, I didn’t place much thought on how the information in my lecture notes came about. How did scientists find out about the structures of the various components in the cell? And specifically, how did they know what function each component played? Admittedly, these questions rarely crossed my mind when I was a student then, since I didn’t want to waste time ruminating on whatever wasn’t in the syllabus at that time.Reading this book has revealed the “behind-the-scenes” of the scientific discovery of ribosome and I realised that I have underestimated the amount of time and effort these scientists have spent to glean the knowledge we can now comfortably obtain. Moreover, I appreciate the author’s objective revelation about the presence of politics and competition in the scientific community, including how the highly-respected Nobel Prize can be subjective and fallible, things I didn’t hear about previously.Having said that, I can expect readers unfamiliar with the ribosome to not appreciate this book as much due to its scientific nature (though the author tries to simplify the highly scientific details to make it easier for general readers to understand). I had to research on X-Ray Crystallography to find out exactly how it works as it was only briefly mentioned in the book.If you know what the ribosome is, this is an insightful and enlightening book to read!"
266,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90507383-mahin,5,"My friends who aren’t in STEM are incredulous to find out how hyper-competitive (and cut-throat) research can be. Science is viewed as incorruptible. But that doesn’t mean that scientists are necessarily paragons of rationality or truth; sometimes, they guard their knowledge and results out of fear that a peer will ""scoop"" them. In spite of this, science is a collaborative process by necessity. In Gene Machine, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan shares his perspective on the race to discover the ribosome’s structure. He also shares his experiences as an outsider; first as a physicist by training who belatedly discovered his interest in biology and second as an Indian immigrant to the US, where he often lived in majority-white towns (in Ohio and Utah). As a biochemist, I found that Venki explained his research in a way that is accessible to those who aren't scientists (or even biologists). As a result, I found myself skimming over descriptions of DNA, RNA, and other elementary biological concepts; but I appreciated their inclusion for readers who may have forgotten or don't have that knowledge. Another reviewer remarked that you wouldn't expect a book about the discovery of the ribosome's structure to be so gripping, an assessment with which I agree. I think Gene Machine will prove to be one of the best science books to be published in 2018."

That is to say, it follows the well-trodden path of 
The Double Helix
. It definitely gets a lot more hard-science than other books in that vein, though; I found some of the technical details about the ribosome hard to follow here, but I admit the problem may well have been that I had to put down the book for a couple of months halfway through and in the interim forgot the intricacies that he'd introduced earlier. The account is generally otherwise pretty easy to read: the author's surprisingly candid about various things, and he seems like an interesting character."

I am not very interested in chemistry, so I did not find it much interesting.Researchers however must read it to check out how that world functions. Author calls Noble prize a lottery! He honestly describes the pitfalls and limitations of Nobel (or any recognition). It helps to put the awards and recognition in perspective. Many times mind tricks us in thinking award as the aim. This book can tell you how random the selection actually is! It is not exactly correlated with the work you do, work is ofcourse important but there are other dominant factors which no one can control.Concluding -For scientists - must readOthers can safely skip. You won't miss anything.By the way, this is a kind of accidental read for me.

Ramakrishnan is less relatable and perhaps not as self-reflective or self-aware as Jahren, but his love of the work and his wry sense of humor shines through.

279,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30640144-abhijit-basu,4,"REVIEW OF VENKI RAMAKRISHNAN’S ‘GENE MACHINE’What are ribosomes? Why are they of such importance that teams of dedicated chemical and biological scientists across the world made it their lives’ mission to investigate ribosome’s inner structure over three decades since the early 1980s? The reason behind the great scientific quest is that the genetic information encoded on the DNA would have been of no use without the ribosome molecule as essential cellular processing machine to translate these instructions for making proteins, the building blocks of life. It is on this logic that the 2009 Chemistry Nobel Laureate (joint) Sir Venki Ramakrishnan calls his memoir ‘gene machine.’ Foremost among the factors that make the book so appealing to read is the author’s personal candour – about his ambition, about his professional worries and above all else, about his determination to count in the race for scientific recognition as a ‘dark horse.’ As Siddhartha Mukherjee (author of ‘Emperor of All Maladies’) puts it, his story is that of an ‘outsider’ – twice over. First, as an immigrant settling in the USA and UK, and then, as a PhD in Physics doing his life’s chosen work in molecular biology. Another quality of the book is the author’s writing style. Ramakrishnan has his own way with words and even the more technical middle chapters of the book are laced with enough humour and witty anecdotes to keep interest alive. He is a master of metaphor too – making complex science understandable to lay readers with simple examples. After putting things scientifically – that the ribosome, a ‘giant’ molecule with over a million atoms (still small enough to pack 4000 in the width of a human hair), is the link between our genes and the proteins they specify, he makes the point that understanding how it works will depend on how it structurally looks. He then drives home the importance of that knowing and understanding by a simple allegory. Imagine you are a Martian peering down at earth, he says. You observe tiny objects moving straight or occasionally turning. Look little closer and you find movement happens only when tinier moving things enter those objects. Driven by curiosity, you want to see how the objects are constructed. You find that it is made of numerous working parts, including an engine connected to a crankshaft that makes the wheels turn. You look even closer to find that the engine itself has pistons and sucks in fuel and air that is ignited with a spark plug to drive the piston forward. It is the same with understanding molecules that make life. Understanding DNA and RNA molecules was a big step. But cracking the jigsaw puzzle needed understanding of how the ‘enormous’ ribosomes were constructed which enabled them to decode the DNA information of nucleotide sequence carried by messenger RNAs ‘to stitch together amino acids brought by transfer RNAs into protein.’ Importantly, the author also explains how, by knowing the structure and components of the bacterial ribosome, the work has opened up avenues to development of new antibiotics.It is an engaging story about the agonies and ecstasies, about the disappointments and lucky breaks of ‘rival’ scientists competing in a race for success. The pursuit of success is often made tense by an atmosphere surcharged with ‘politics for recognition.’ At the same time there is cooperation too among the community of scientists, helped by seminars, conferences and mutual discussions which enable cross-pollination of ideas. Ramakrishnan attributes this competitive cooperation to the ‘inbred’ nature of modern scientific discoveries. The 2009 Chemistry Nobel Prize was awarded jointly to three persons. Ada Yonath from Israel was the first to make headway in ribosome crystallisation and kept at it with dogged application for decades. Then there was Tom Steitz, American biochemist and a leading crystallographer of his generation, who, in collaboration with Peter Moore, effectively began the last lap of the race by publishing the atomic structure of the larger (50S) ribosomal subunit. Finally, there was Venki Ramakrishnan, an ‘accidental ribosome biologist’ and a latecomer to the field, who caught up with the others by leading his energetic team of bright postdoc and student associates working round the clock across their trans-Atlantic divide at Cambridge and Utah to achieve high-resolution ‘crystal’ structure of the smaller (30S) ribosome subunit (and later the entire (70S) ribosome, throwing light on the code translation process and on the mechanism of blocking action exploited by antibiotics). Yet, as candidly acknowledged by the author, there were other key contributors who got regrettably left out of Nobel recognition due to the ‘three-recipient limitation’ of the prize. Moreover, as Ramakrishnan himself alludes to in the book’s epilogue, while he and the two others received the recognition for their pioneering work in using crystallography to explore ribosome, with subsequent advancement in electron microscopy, a more direct method allowing higher resolution is now available to investigate organelle structure. The epilogue also contains an endearingly modest, even bordering on philosophical, reflection by the author, in the context of the flood of honours and awards that he received following the ‘Nobel Lottery’, as he calls it, echoing Francis Crick. Referencing the Bible, he cites Matthew 13.12: 'For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.' As already mentioned, the book has quite a few comical anecdotes to liven up things. For instance, there is the story of how Pat Unwin and Carlos Taddei worked at obtaining two-dimensional protein crystals from lizard ovary cells in 1977—the first demonstration that ribosomes were indeed crystallizable. The maverick Taddei was given to insouciantly puffing at his cigar in the lab and regularly setting off the fire alarms. After some time, the experiment was abandoned as the crystals were found not good enough to reveal a detailed atomic arrangement. The unchaperoned lizards left in the basement escaped and were to be seen scampering around the grounds of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology for years thereafter. Another interesting anecdote relates to the author’s two encounters with James Watson. On both occasions, the brash and acerbic American geneticist made light of Ramakrishnan’s labours, saying, ‘Forget the Nobel.’ However, the same Watson was seen attending a lecture by Ramakrishnan and later dispelling Ramakrishnan’s apprehensions by approving his selection as a Nobel Committee expert for the coveted Prize.A COMPARISONIn my personal view as a one-time researcher in Chemistry and a lover of good literature, ‘Gene Machine’ is a thrilling story of a down-to-earth scientist’s quest in a niche area of research holding promise for a clearer understanding of the secrets of life and of better ways to treat complicated maladies. In comparison with other genre books written by Nobel Laureate scientists, I would rate the book in the ‘very good’ category, with a four stars grade. ‘The Double Helix’ (1968) – James Watson’s brilliant account of decoding the DNA – gets ‘excellent’ rating with five stars to boot. But at the top rung of my assessment would be ‘Order out of Chaos’ (1984) – a deeply thought-provoking account of the philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics and its theory of entropy or universal tendency towards disorderliness – written by Ilya Prigogine, 1977 Physical Chemistry Nobel Laureate and his co-author, scientific philosopher Isabelle Stengers. That book, with its readability value and profound philosophical contents, should merit a super-excellent six-star rating almost at par with Erwin Schrödinger’s 1943 book, ‘What is Life?’ Of course, Schrödinger’s book, being an amazingly prophetic foray by a Quantum Physicist into the chemical-biological secret of life’s ‘code script’ is of a different class because it transcends the borders of the scientist’s own Nobel-winning work. Yet all said and done, ‘Gene Machine’, with its insights into the pleasures and pains of the race for scientific recognition, certainly deserves a place of its own at these commanding heights of scientific literature."
280,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43858998-linda-gaines,2,"I'm rather disappointed with this book. First I was really interested in learning about the ribosome and how it functions was discovered. I do feel like I learned a bit, but I really don't understand the different techniques they used to understand how it works. I just don't think it was explained well. Secondly, this book needed a better editor. I understand it was a personal story of the author's career and how the various scientists interacted, but it went off on far too many tangents such that I got lost. So many people were introduced, but only superficially, that I completely forgot who most of them were by the end of the chapter. Also, near the beginning the author talks about the discovery of the structure of DNA and never once mentions Rosalind Franklin, which was a particularly glaring omission. Then halfway through the book, she in mentioned with regards to people who used to be in her lab, and he never explains who she was and what she did for science and DNA. Not once. Perhaps I should blame the editor and not the author for that. In any event, the book needed a better editor."

There is a place for this type of writing, but it just didn't hold my interest. What did strike me is how complex the research world is. Collaboration and competition go hand in hand - not an easy pair to balance! Also, many many people, sometimes over generations, are often involved in these major breakthroughs.

282,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52557863-grrlscientist,4,"What it is really like to be a scientist, especially a scientist who has been awarded the “most nobel” scientific prize of all?Written by 2009 co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Venkatraman “Venki” Ramakrishnan, an American and British structural biologist who grew up in India, 
Gene Machine: The race to decipher the secrets of the ribosome
 (Basic Books; 2018) is an engaging account of one man’s many scientific contributions to solve the structure of the ribosome, a small structure that is the workhorse of the cell, building the proteins necessary for life.The author begins his story in India, where he studied physics before immigrating to the United States to earn his doctorate in physics. During this time, he met and married — a major life event served to refocus his attention on how to successfully provide for his family as a working scientist. Confronted with a lifetime of “boring and incremental calculations that wouldn’t result in any real advance in understanding”, Dr. Ramakrishnan took a big risk and abruptly shifted his career focus to molecular biology after reading an article about the ribosome in Scientific American. To do this, he spent two years as a grad student in molecular biology at UCSD, gaining essential knowledge and skills necessary to pursue his new career.Because electron microscopy was in its infancy during most of this work, this meant that an older technique, x-ray crystallography, was the main tool used to decipher the structure of the ribosome. But x-ray crystallography created fuzzier, less detailed images than electron microscopy, so this led to the field being informally known as “blobology”.Despite disappointments and setbacks in his second career, Dr. Ramakrishnan persisted for more than 30 years before being awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, being named president of the Royal Society of London, the world’s oldest scientific society and then being knighted in the 2012. (He does not generally use the honorific ‘Sir’.)In this book, Dr. Ramakrishnan clearly explains the science, and highlights the sometimes convoluted process of how science actually works. He details the inside story of lab life including the struggles, failures and blind alleys, the collaborators and friends, the professional competitors and rivals, and the timely and critically important help provided by a number of scientists, as Dr. Ramakrishnan and his team worked tirelessly to solve the structure of this microscopic biological machine. As the story of the author’s professional life unfolds, we learn how a scientist develops the ideas, skills, tools — and the people, along with all the quirks and talents that each one embodies — that are essential to achieve such a remarkable scientific discovery.This profoundly human story is written with honesty and humility, and the author isn’t afraid to laugh at himself. For example, his story about the phone call in October was amusing, and he even shares his wife’s incredulous response when she first learned he had won the Nobel Prize: “I thought you had to be really smart to win one of those!” (Ramakrishnan 237).One element of this story that impressed me most was Dr. Ramakrishnan’s unfailing generosity to his collaborators and his competitors alike. In fact, one of the key themes in this book is that most contemporary science is not about individual achievement; rather, it’s a synthesis of ideas and progress by teams of highly dedicated individuals who devote their lives to solving questions they find compelling.At the end of the book, Dr. Ramakrishnan ponders the nature of science: “When we have a clear goal in mind, we think we are struggling to reach a summit. But there is no summit. When we get there, we realize we have just climbed a foothill, and there is an endless series of mountains ahead still to be climbed.” (Ramakrishnan 256).The author devotes the Epilogue to present some thoughts on the influence (both good and bad) of Truly Big Prizes, particularly the Nobel and the Breakthrough Prizes, upon scientific careers and scientific progress:“So I don’t subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even that much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We humans tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible. And when someone like Newton or Einstein sees much further than others, or Watson and Crick synthesize in one stroke the essential features of DNA that might have dribbled out in pieces, we tend to immortalize them.” (Ramakrishnan 264).This lucid and highly readable account will be enjoyed by students in any of the sciences, by those interested in the history of science, or who love reading memoirs. But really, I think that anyone who is captivated by an absorbing story well told will find much to appreciate in this fascinating book.NOTE: Originally published at Forbes on 30 November 2018.

If, however, you are looking to understand what exactly the life of a scientist can entail, then pick up a copy and dig in, you're in for a wild intercontinental ride!I rated this book 4/5, from an internal scoring of 8, two points were dropped for the name dropping (a LOT of people are named) and slightly opaque scientific descriptions."
285,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/534526-robert,3,"Having just finished helping my daughter study for her AP biology exam, I was able to hang with some of the technical discussion. However, this book is still very science heavy.Interesting look into how the scientific/academic/Nobel prize world works. Pretty dry."
286,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"Venki Ramakrishnan’s book is the story of the race to understand the structure and workings of the ribosome, and his part in that. He comes across as a modest, self-deprecating person, able to reveal his weaknesses as well as his strengths, and someone who is generous in acknowledging the contributions of others. As with many scientists of great aptitude, he lacks arrogance and at times comes across as quite diffident as to his abilities, fearing that others are better qualified than he is to solve this puzzle. His book does a wonderful job of conveying the combination of friendliness and rivalry that accompanies any scientific contest, no more so than when solving a problem of this importance. The journey is a roller coaster where one day his team seems to be ahead of his rivals, and the next a paper is published that suggests they are behind. He successfully expresses how his emotions rose and sank, as he continually tried to figure out where he was in relation to others in the race. In some respects, the book reminds me of The Double Helix by James Watson which recounts a similar, frantic rush to beat the competition to establish the structure of an important biological molecule. A chapter I found fascinating was one where Ramakrishnan discussed the politics of scientific awards, including the Nobel Prize, arguing that the system can become a closed-club where the same scientists repeatedly win prestigious honours. He was particularly critical of Nobel Prizes, writing: “Because many of the early Nobel laureates were giants in their field, the idea has taken hold – especially among non-scientists – that Nobel laureates are geniuses. In fact, the prize is not awarded for being a great scientist but rather for making a groundbreaking discovery or invention. Some of them may be extraordinarily brilliant, but others are just good scientists who were persistent or happened to stumble onto a major finding. Being in the right place at the right time often helped enormously”. He also blasted the rule that limits the number of winners to three. This may have been appropriate a century ago, but nowadays it doesn’t reflect the collaboration, intentional or otherwise, that marks most major scientific advances.He also writes about what he calls post-Nobelitis. As he puts it: “Suddenly, scientists are thrust into the limelight and bask in the public adulation that goes with it. They are asked for their opinion on everything under the sun, regardless of their own expertise, and it soon goes to their head. Some of them are long past their prime, having made their big discoveries decades earlier, and the renewed attention means that they spend their time wandering around the world, pontificating about all sorts of things”. Ramakrishnan knew that solving the mystery of the ribosome was worthy of a Nobel Prize but, with the rule of three in mind, he honestly admits that “I started worrying about my relative contribution and whether I would be perceived as a Johnny-come-lately rather than a pioneer”.Despite his cynicism about how the system works, Ramakrishnan comes across as extremely ambitious and someone who spent a lot of time fretting whether he would miss out on this ultimate scientific accolade. Would the ribosome really merit an award? And, if so, which three of the numerous scientists involved during something like 20 years of research would be named on the citation? A criticism I have of the book is that so many scientists are named that it is easy to lose track of who did what, where and when. Unfortunately, there is no index so when a name reappears there is no simple way of tracing when he or she was first mentioned. Furthermore, after they have been first introduced, Ramakrishnan often refers to scientists only by their first names, and the text is littered with references to Tom, Dick (actually Richard!) and Harry, which means that even having an index would be of limited value as an aide memoire. Perhaps a cast list might be better.Based on his personal experience, Ramakrishnan provides lots of interesting details about the mechanism of announcing and then awarding the Nobel Prizes. No doubt like many other recipients have been, he was very suspicious when he received the phone call from Sweden informing him that he’d won. Also, curiously, he tells us that the banquet after the ceremony is televised and shown live in Sweden. But he comments: “I wouldn’t have thought spending the evening watching a group of strangers eat would make for much drama, but there were speeches and entertainment”.The book is quite technical in places, notably in terms of crystallographic techniques. Nonetheless, it is not necessary to understand the details in order to enjoy this book because this is an account of how the race for a Nobel Prize is won, or, more often, lost. And therein lies the focus of the book."
287,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107551528-shweata-n,5,"Science is often thought to be done by scientists who isolate themselves in a cocoon and come out with a breakthrough and fly like a butterfly. But this is far far from the realities of academia. 'Gene Machine' brilliantly portraits the competitive nature of science. The book is successful in making us realize that breakthroughs that come about in science are often driven by competition amongst peers, which is quite contrary to what is perceived by the ones outside of academia. The author begins his career in academia and is up for a rather shaky start with several ups and downs, finally deciding to switch fields from being a theoretical physicist to a biologist. In the book, he goes on to give an honest account of his academic career, making bold remarks about various events and people, along the way. Also, his descriptions do not fail to capture the competitiveness in science which often isn't touched upon by many. Not to mention, Venki Ramakrishnan has also done a great job in elucidating some of the complex and technical concepts of ribosomes, proteins, crystallography and others. He has done it in such a way that it is easy for anyone with any/no prior knowledge of the subject to understand the concepts and the limitation in our understanding of it. I felt that the analogies he used, especially the car one to help us realize the limitations in understanding of ribosome,were really simple yet amazing.One thing that was consistent throughout the book was that he consistently acknowledged the fact that he was really lucky and had the right set of people and ideas to make that breakthrough. His first breakthrough comes when his team is able to decipher the structure of the 30S structure of the ribosome. Then they go on to solve the atomic structure of the whole ribosome.And finally, he isn't afraid of discussing about the fact that the idea of prizes and awards. He remarks that ""Nevertheless, scientists are only human. Like everyone else, we can be ambitious and competitive and crave recognition. Instead of inculcating a feeling that the work is its own reward, the scientific establishment feeds this desire to feel special and somehow better than our peers at virtually every stage of the process"". This sort of encompassed the idea of awards are flawed yet people tend to associate high value to it and it is the intrinsic nature of humans to do so. He also goes on to criticize the Nobel prize because it's only awarded to three people in a field each year. This doesn't hold good with the fact that scientific discoveries are usually bought out by a group not a single person and therefore it doesn't make sense to give it to just three people. However, he wins the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009 along with his competitors Ada and Tom.In the epilogue, he says: "" I don't subscribe to the heroic narrative of science. Rather, some of us are fortunate enough to be the agents of important discoveries that would have been made anyway, sometimes not even much later. But this cold analytical view does not sit well with our emotional selves. We tend to personify everything we touch. We give names to theories and theorems, discoveries, laboratories, even pieces of apparatus. Science becomes a play, with heroes and villains. So even if discoveries are inevitable, we recognize that it is individuals who make them happen, and we like to honour those who took that first leap into the unknown, to go just beyond what was thought to be possible"". I think this sort of sums up my views on science too. ( I must confess that he has phrased it so well, I could never have done that!)In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it who wants to know what 'real' science works and who wants to know the realities of being in academia."
288,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,4,"Nobel Laurate Venki Ramakrishnan’s first book is about his experiences in the race to elucidate the structure of ribosome. I had read an excerpt from this book earlier, where he talked about how winning a Nobel prize may not be the best thing for the scientist and how prizes, at times can be unfair. I liked it very much and was keen on reading the whole book. I finally got the chance after borrowing a copy from a friend.The book starts out with his experiences as a student of physics and his almost accidental entry into biology. It then covers his postdoctoral work that got him interested in ribosomes in the first place followed by his incredible journey across America and then to MRC, Cambridge, which was across the ocean. The book is mostly a personal account, focusing on his experiences and the struggles he and his lab went through. It eventually culminates with his winning the prize and the Nobel prize ceremony. I found the book highly additive and an easy read. Ramakrishnan has done a really nice job of explaining the challenges he faced. Especially, the part on x-ray crystallography is so well written that even someone like me, who runs away from these techniques could understand it. As someone who is in academia, what I liked most about the book though is the honesty and frankness with which the story has been narrated. He has been open about all the politics surrounding the whole ribosome community and science in general. He has also not shied away from his own competitiveness, secrecy and prejudice. Another great point is that he has acknowledged the work of his lab members because in the end, the success is as much theirs as his. After reading this book, I came to know of quite a few things. For instance, in the scientific community, the present trend has been towards doing more collaborative work. However, it has not been the case always. When scientists compete with each other for the same thing as was the case with the ribosome structure, things can at times become ugly. Overall, it may or may not turn to be good for science overall. However, in this case, the ending was happy and the efforts of all those involved lead to an addition of our understanding of one of the fundamental phenomena of nature.Finally, I would say that this book has been an enjoyable read. I think it is definitely a must read for every biologist!"
289,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46231899-laurie89,5," The ‘Gene Machine’ is a fascinating account of Venki Ramakrishnan’s path to uncovering the structure of the ribosome, which resulted in his receiving the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The cast of characters and places in this narrative are truly captivating and provide a cross-sectional view of the scientific life. The book provides insight into how successful scientific careers are forged. The starting point is Dr Ramakrishnan’s journey from India to a Ph.D program in physics at Ohio University. After obtaining a Ph.D. the author poignantly describes his decision to switch fields to biology and how this naturally led him to structural biology. A striking inclusion in this story are the descriptions of the self-doubt and the reasoning behind each change in position; from UC San Diego to Yale, Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island to Oak Ridge National laboratory Tennessee, Utah and finally the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. The author finds the right balance in describing the science and the important roles that his colleagues, mentors and students played. Ultimately the depictions of his laboratory and the research environment provide the reader with a taste of what is involved in a successful competitive scientific career. The humility of the author shines throughout the story.  The heart of the narrative focuses on the race to reveal the structure of the ribosome, which manufactures proteins from the genetic code. While the ribosome is often overlooked by the general public, it is of utmost importance the functioning of all cellular life. The expository includes the history of ribosome and the genetic code, basic biology and the basic techniques in x-ray crystallography. The true break-through in structural biology that was necessary to realize the high resolution images is less clear. It would have greatly helped if there had been an appendix to describe this part of the science so that the readers could have also understand this important context. The book is also lacking an index and a more detailed bibliography of the resulting scientific articles.  This skillful memoir, which is fast paced and reads like a novel, is likely to become a scientific classic about the competition at the cutting edge of science. "
290,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42307468-siddharth-saravanan,3,"This book had 3 distinct phases for me. 1st phase regarding his emigration to the US and his subsequent foray into different aspects of Science was engaging, especially the way in which the author almost accidentally stumbled upon something which would turn out to be his lifelong goal! //Made me reflect on the fact that we need to be open in trying out different aspects of a particular field/life in order to land on something which we feel passionate towards dedicating a major portion of our lives 2nd phase covers the methods used by the author and the madcap race to cross the finishing line before anybody else. Although I'm a student of Biology, most of the science flew over my head because it dealt with techniques like crystallography, X-ray diffraction etc. which I have little idea about. The race to discover the structure is fascinating, but we'll have to wade through multiple scientific techniques and dozens of names and contributions from different people involved in the process, which can be quite hard.//Found it fascinating how so many different people are involved in the process. Though it makes the reading hard, really loved how the author credited every single person involved in the mammoth race! 3rd phase, and the best phase, talks about the ecosystem of prizes and the very hit-and-miss nature of them. We as a society have glorified the Nobel Prize, and rightly so. However it was illuminating reading about how the Nobel isn't all encompassing and is flawed in quite a few ways, along with the numerous other scientific prizes. Gave me a lot of perspective on the nature of credit, and the unfairness which is intrinsic in the whole process//(Brownie points for the statement that ethnic and ultra nationalistic pride is the opposite of racism and xenophobia. Rang true within me)"
291,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,2,"Sometimes, the simplest questions are the most difficult to answer. One such is that of how many Indians have won the Nobel Prize so far. The figure can be as high as twelve, if you count Ronald Ross, Rudyard Kipling, Dalai Lama, V S Naipaul and Mother Teresa. Some or of Indian origin, or been born in India or left India too early in their career. Venkatraman Ramakrishnan was a graduate of Physics from Baroda but immediately migrated to the US for further studies. He won the Nobel in Chemistry in 2009 for ribosome research along with two others. Ramakrishnan’s research strengthened our understanding of the fundamental processes of life and provided a clue to the evolution of modern species of life. This book is a combination of popular science and an autobiography with a seamless blending of the two. His life is devoted to research and learning.We know that our genetic material is locked up in a structure called DNA inside the nucleus of each of our cells. Apart from heredity, these contain recipes for building proteins which are essential for life. Insulin, adrenaline and albumin are all proteins required to sustain the organism. What makes these proteins inside a cell is a molecular gene-machine called ribosome. This machine reads the component list from data derived from the DNA and assembles the protein using amino acids just like a production line. The critical nature of the process need not be emphasized further, as the animal will soon be dead if the pathways are somehow clogged. Virtually every molecule in every cell in every form of life is either made by the ribosome or made by enzymes that are themselves made by ribosomes. Discovery of ribosomes and its role in making protein is the culmination of one of the great triumphs in modern biology. This was by no means easy as the ribosome is not a simple molecule like DNA. It was enormous and complex. The attempt to decipher it was taken up by Crick and Watson, who found the structure of DNA but was abandoned in despair.Ramakrishnan was attracted to ribosomes by an article in the magazine Scientific American. He knew practically nothing of biology which he made up through courses studied part-time. Thus we have a physicist who studied the structure of a crucial biological unit being awarded with a Nobel in chemistry! He attempted to solve the ribosome structure first by neutron scattering which was eventually proved ineffective but was well understood by people with a physics background. The author dwells at length on the step by step progress in revealing the structure and the race with other scientists doing similar work, but this is not in a form that can be easily digested by ordinary readers. I found it extremely tedious especially after reading Siddhartha Mukherjee’s great book ‘The Gene - An Intimate History’ a few weeks before. Of course, you cannot expect such lucidity from a Nobel laureate, but the pertinent fact is that almost all of the readers are not Nobel laureates themselves. It is only during the autobiographical passages that the book becomes even slightly interesting.Study of ribosomes is important in learning how medicines cure us of diseases. Some antibiotics work by blocking the protein creation function of bacterial ribosomes. This is done by binding to a vulnerable location in its structure. Since bacterial and human ribosomes are very different, humans will not be adversely affected by the mechanism of its action. This study also casts light on the dark alleyways of early evolution. Building blocks of RNA can be made from simple chemicals that could have been around in the earth billions of years ago. It may be possible that life emerged with lots of randomly made RNA molecules until some of them could reproduce entirely by themselves. RNA could also preserve heredity between generations.This book presents some valid advice to novices in scientific research. The author asks them not to be hesitant to ask questions, however basic it might be. He justifies it by claiming that no question is too stupid to ask if you want to know the answer. It is also a bare necessity for present-day researchers to belong to the top-line institutes and laboratories. Advanced science has now become a team effort transcending national frontiers and continental boundaries. The members of the theoretical and testing facilities should be known to each other, otherwise it would be difficult to obtain and manage precious time allocated for using sophisticated machines.The author makes a short but pointed criticism of the Nobel award conventions. There is a ‘Rule of Three’ in force. This means that the award, if shared, shall not be divided into more than three parts. This criterion is claimed to be impractical now. When the prize started in 1901, scientists worked in relative isolation and met only once every few years. By the time they announced their results, there was no question of who had discovered what. In the current world, an idea quickly spreads and a lot of people contribute to it in various measures and capacities. And it is not always clear whether the original idea or a later contribution was the truly ground breaking advance. It is a difficult task to select three people from a crowd of somewhat equal contributors without causing resentment or heartburn.Ramakrishnan left India very early and harbours no soft spots in his mind for the mother country. Ignorant of his real feelings, thousands of naïve Indians sent congratulatory emails to him upon winning the Nobel. This clogged his inbox and they received a curt reminder that ‘nationality was an accident of birth’ and by corollary, he does not attach much importance to it. This is a clear case of brain drain.The narrative about the role and secrets of ribosomes is disappointingly matter-of-fact. The author has failed to share the awe he might have felt in revealing the heretofore hidden details. The scientist’s idea of a paper for publishing in a journal is too far away from an ordinary reader’s preference of what is interesting. The book is a veritable Who’s Who of the rapidly growing field of structural biology in general and ribosomes in particular. The author has had a great collaboration with like-minded scholars from across the globe. There are many photographs of co-workers and even rivals. The illustrations given as part of the description are not at all helpful. Relevance has not been a parameter for inclusion as we even see a conceptual diagram of a four-stroke internal combustion engine as part of the narrative.The book is recommended only to serious readers."
292,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39270567-leo,4,"I want sure what I got myself into when I picked up this book, but I can definitely say that it was well worth the read. While the book is focused primarily on figuring out the structure of the ribosome, the story Venki shares about his entrance into this particular field in science, the people he's met and worked with, and what came about from all of his work is very informative. We often hear about the accomplishment of folks like Venki, but rarely get a glimpse of what they went through to get there, this book covers that and more.Upon completing the book, I was left with two lingering thoughts, the first was I had no idea what he was talking about towards the later half of the book. Venki writes, in great detail the vast test, processes, and failures he went through to finally generate crystals that could be used to decipher the ribosome. These chapters were difficult to follow for a layman like myself, but I stuck with it. If he took the time to explain his work of many years, the least I could do is spend a couple hours reading about it.The second thought, was that I do not think there was a single person Venki left out of his story that did not have a direct or indirect influence on his project. He went out of his way to talk about a lot of people who pioneered earlier discoveries into crystallizing molecules, mentors who encouraged him to push the boundaries, peers who kept him in check, and students who brought in new fresh ideas to the problem so hand. This is the part of the book I really enjoyed, the simple act of a person who accomplished something significant, giving recognition were it was due."
293,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15971935-mark-stidham,4,"This was a fun read for me because of its subject matter (the elucidation of the structure of the ribosome). It could be of broader interest because it is a first person account of the life of a scientist in a competitive race to solve a scientific question. As a biochemist almost the same age as the author, I related to the story arc, even though there isn't much similarity in our careers. There is the struggle to find a niche, long investments in study and techniques that end up being useless, and frustrating search for job stability. This particular story is similar to others that feature competitive research and the need to obtain respect from peers. The author spends a good amount of time explaining the benefits and the downsides to the science community hierarchy epitomized by the competition for the Nobel Prize. That Ramakrishnan won a share of the prize is evidence of some objectivity in the process. But overall, the Prize seems more of a club.I was unable to pay attention to this particular race to find the structure of the ribosome, and the book should not be viewed as any more than an introduction to that subject. I look forward to learning the details in the scholarly papers. But it should be mentioned that this incredible biological machine was completely misunderstood not too long ago. It is humbling that such a fundamental process is only now being elucidated, and it shows that there are many more astonishing aspects of our biochemistry to be discovered in the future"

During these tumultuous times, one must stay strong by being sane and there is no more powerful refuge of sanity than books. Thankfully I had packed 3 of them when I had to leave for my emergency service. I finished the first one just last evening. I don't read books on the history of science much often, and had picked up 'Gene Machine' on the recommendations of one of my buddies. This one is Venki Ramakrishnan's side of the fascinating story of how the structure and functions of Ribosome, a cellular organelle, were discovered and how the long journey over decades lead to the Nobel Prize for the author and his two main competitors. The hard work behind every discovery, the cooperation and competition between scientists, the jealousy between them, the politics of awards and their after effects is delved on in detail. The book is a repository of knowledge on biology, which however has been tiring for me as biology was never my favourite subject. In our country, the lives of scientists are never that well discussed except some few like Einstein, Bose, Newton, Meghnad Saha and Jagdish Chandra Bose. This book will be a happy addition to that small grouping. The story of how the structure and functions of the Ribosome, the organelle that synthesizes proteins, and lays the building blocks of life, were explained before the world, is truly an engaging one."
295,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104610180-aquila-michiryu,4,"In Gene Machine, Venki Ramakrishnan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, recounts his scientific journey of unraveling the structure of the ribosome and its biological mysteries. More than that, he honestly reveals the politics and competition present in the realm of science, and how various factors such as luck, personalities, jealousy, money and the desire for awards can all inextricably influence the potential for success as a scientist. He also shares his views on the Nobel Prize (and his experience of winning the prize) and how there is subjectivity present when the panel decides who the prize should be awarded to.As a biology student, I learnt about the ribosome when I studied about the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome. At that time, I didn’t place much thought on how the information in my lecture notes came about. How did scientists find out about the structures of the various components in the cell? And specifically, how did they know what function each component played? Admittedly, these questions rarely crossed my mind when I was a student then, since I didn’t want to waste time ruminating on whatever wasn’t in the syllabus at that time.Reading this book has revealed the “behind-the-scenes” of the scientific discovery of ribosome and I realised that I have underestimated the amount of time and effort these scientists have spent to glean the knowledge we can now comfortably obtain. Moreover, I appreciate the author’s objective revelation about the presence of politics and competition in the scientific community, including how the highly-respected Nobel Prize can be subjective and fallible, things I didn’t hear about previously.Having said that, I can expect readers unfamiliar with the ribosome to not appreciate this book as much due to its scientific nature (though the author tries to simplify the highly scientific details to make it easier for general readers to understand). I had to research on X-Ray Crystallography to find out exactly how it works as it was only briefly mentioned in the book.If you know what the ribosome is, this is an insightful and enlightening book to read!"
296,All,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90507383-mahin,5,"My friends who aren’t in STEM are incredulous to find out how hyper-competitive (and cut-throat) research can be. Science is viewed as incorruptible. But that doesn’t mean that scientists are necessarily paragons of rationality or truth; sometimes, they guard their knowledge and results out of fear that a peer will ""scoop"" them. In spite of this, science is a collaborative process by necessity. In Gene Machine, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan shares his perspective on the race to discover the ribosome’s structure. He also shares his experiences as an outsider; first as a physicist by training who belatedly discovered his interest in biology and second as an Indian immigrant to the US, where he often lived in majority-white towns (in Ohio and Utah). As a biochemist, I found that Venki explained his research in a way that is accessible to those who aren't scientists (or even biologists). As a result, I found myself skimming over descriptions of DNA, RNA, and other elementary biological concepts; but I appreciated their inclusion for readers who may have forgotten or don't have that knowledge. Another reviewer remarked that you wouldn't expect a book about the discovery of the ribosome's structure to be so gripping, an assessment with which I agree. I think Gene Machine will prove to be one of the best science books to be published in 2018."

That is to say, it follows the well-trodden path of 
The Double Helix
. It definitely gets a lot more hard-science than other books in that vein, though; I found some of the technical details about the ribosome hard to follow here, but I admit the problem may well have been that I had to put down the book for a couple of months halfway through and in the interim forgot the intricacies that he'd introduced earlier. The account is generally otherwise pretty easy to read: the author's surprisingly candid about various things, and he seems like an interesting character."

I am not very interested in chemistry, so I did not find it much interesting.Researchers however must read it to check out how that world functions. Author calls Noble prize a lottery! He honestly describes the pitfalls and limitations of Nobel (or any recognition). It helps to put the awards and recognition in perspective. Many times mind tricks us in thinking award as the aim. This book can tell you how random the selection actually is! It is not exactly correlated with the work you do, work is ofcourse important but there are other dominant factors which no one can control.Concluding -For scientists - must readOthers can safely skip. You won't miss anything.By the way, this is a kind of accidental read for me.
