Buy it now if you haven’t read it.Table of contents:1 Weapons of Influence2 Reciprocation: The Old Give and Take…and Take3 Commitment and Consistency: Hobgoblins of the Mind4 Social Proof: Truths Are Us5 Liking: The Friendly Thief6 Authority: Directed Deference7 Scarcity: The Rule of the FewNotes:Below are my key takeaways and some interesting points, but I’m telling you. Buy it. Read it. Trust me. * Expensive implies quality. Example: gems in a jewel case that weren’t selling were marked up and then sold at a “discount” to the markup (a price higher than the original price), and they sold like hotcakes. * Power of contrast. Example: If you go into a men’s store they’ll try and sell you an expensive suit before the sell you the expensive sweater, because the contrast makes the sweater appear more affordable. * Reciprocity. Example: If someone buys you something (say, a Coke), you’re more likely to by something from them (say, raffle tickets). * Concession. Example: If someone tries to sell you something and you pass (say $5 of $1 raffle tickets), they’ll try and sell you something less that you’ll end up buying because you feel bad (1 $1 raffle ticket). Another term used here is “reject then retreat.” * Commitment leads to consistency leads to collaboration. Example: During the Korean war, the Chinese got American soldiers to make public commitments of various things. Then they made those commitments even more public, which the American soldiers had to stand by to be consistent. That consistency then led them down a path of minor forms of collaboration – without them really thinking about it as such. * Writing something down, even privately, strengthens your commitment to something. * People like and believe in commitment because their image and reputation is on the line (ie the Chinese concentration camp example above). * People like more what they struggle to get, even if it’s not that good. Example: frats (hey, it’s in the book, don’t hate the messenger). * People like to feel they have control over a decision – even if they really don’t. * The power of social proof, or the idea that if others do it it’s good. Example: introverted pre-schoolers who saw introverted kids become social in a movie were more inclined to go play. Another example: cults. People follow the crowd because they believe in the “wisdom” of the crowd. * Convince and you shall be convinced. Example: cults, where people who convince or convert others become more convinced (that’s why so many are evangelical). * Assign responsibility if you want things done. Example: a stabbing that took place over many minutes had 38 witnesses…it happened cause everyone figured someone else would call the police. * The power of copycats that’ll play on social proof. Example: if you find a wallet of someone like you and you’re more likely to return it (it’s true). Another (scary) example: more suicides when the press publicizes a suicide…more fatal “accidents” too. * Liking is an important part of influence. Attractiveness, similarity (identity and context), compliments, contact & cooperation all can make someone more influential. * The reason good cop/bad cop works is because the subject feels someone is on their side. * Associations are powerful. Bearers of good news get treated well, and bad news get treated poorly. Examples: weathermen (or Roman messengers reporting lost battles!) * People tend to defer to authority/experts. Examples: experiments involving shock therapy where people listened to a guy in a lab coat to inflict pain on another human being (incredible how strong this is). * The power of connotations and context over content, and how it can imply authority. Titles and clothing do this. * Gaining trust. Example: a waiter who advises against a more expensive item early in the meal will gain the trust of everyone at the table, and then he can suggest more expensive items and more items through the course of the meal. * Scarcity is powerful. There’s a psychological reaction…people don’t want to lose their freedom, and don’t want to lose. This plays to a second point: competition. Invite 3 used car buyers at the same time and you’ll sell the car faster. A cookie is more attractive if there are two of them than if there are 10 of them. (Always as yourself when something is scarce: will the cookie taste as good if there are 10 of them?). Plus, if you saw that the number went from 10 to 2, you want it even more. It can even lead to revolt…when something is given and then taken away, people get mad; if something is never given at all, they don’t know what they’re missing. * “It appears that commitments are most effective in changing a person’s self-image and future behavior when they are active, public, and effortful.” * “The most influential leaders are those who know how to arrange group conditions to allow the principle of social proof to work maximally in their favor.” * “Social proof is most powerful for those who feel unfamiliar or unsure in a specific situation and who, consequently, must look outside of themselves for evidence of how to best behave there.”"
1,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,3,Another one of those business books where it's a good read if you haven't read any others from the same genre but with the same basically formula where they keep repeating information that can be condensed down into a few pages and which every other business book will tell you but of course they'll rephrase it. If you haven't ever thought much about the influence of the way you talk to people and vice versa I'm sure this can be very eye opening. If you're pretty self aware or have contemplated how difference in you behavior can affect that of others then you're going to just find most of the things in these books to be obvious.
2,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1007094-gina-grone,3,"I don't understand why so many people rated this book so highly.--It panders to the audience by using overly simple language and repeating the same idea 5 times to make sure that the reader really understood. Example (from memory): ""People are heavily influenced by society. Society shapes our choices. Our choices are influenced by the people around us. There are countless examples of one's choices being swayed by his or her peers."" Thanks, I got it the first time.--The first and second ""weapons of influence"" were interesting and thought-provoking. Reciprocity and consistency. The third to sixth weapons were just plain obvious. Social proof, i.e. a group's preference influences your own? No shit. Liking, i.e. someone similar to be more persuasive to you? OK, obvious. Authority, i.e. power leads to persuasive ability? [sarcastic] Wow! Scarcity, i.e. perceiving scarcity leads to increased desire of a resource? Mildly surprising.--The author must have read about the device of repetition just before writing this book and used the book for practice. The amount of times that he used ""click, whirr"" to illustrate the metaphor or playing a tape in our heads to produce automatic action made me want to scream! (Also, cassette tapes were out of style by the time I was in high school...)--His choice phrase for people who consciously used these ""weapons of influence"" were ... wait for it ... ""COMPLIANCE PRACTITIONERS""!!! Just call them ""influencers"" or something less vomit-inducing, buddy.--The author ""updated"" the edition for the printing in 2007. He should have just done a reprint with a new foreword or something, because the result of the update is a total failure. 90% of the references are still from the mid-80's or before. A discussion about the future of communicating with computer has one puny line added to it about how everyone uses the Internet now. To be fair, some of the conclusions drawn and the research presented were very interesting. But the feel of the writing was so juvenile and repetitive that I can't recommend this book to anyone. I'm sure there are much better books on the topic. "
3,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9368697-shishir,3,"Six ""weapons of influence""1)Reciprocation - People tend to return a favor. Thus, the pervasiveness of free samples in marketing. In his conferences, he often uses the example of Ethiopia providing thousands of dollars in humanitarian aid to Mexico just after the 1985 earthquake, despite Ethiopia suffering from a crippling famine and civil war at the time. Ethopia had been reciprocating for the diplomatic support Mexico provided when Italy invaded Ethopia in 1937. 2)Commitment and Consistency - If people commit, verbally or in writing, to an idea or goal, they are more likely to honor that commitment. Even if the original incentive or motivation is removed after they have already agreed, they will continue to honor the agreement. For example, in car sales, suddenly raising the price at the last moment works because the buyer has already decided to buy. See cognitive dissonance. 3)Social Proof - People will do things that they see other people are doing. For example, in one experiment, one or more confederates would look up into the sky; bystanders would then look up into the sky to see what they were seeing. At one point this experiment aborted, as so many people were looking up that they stopped traffic. See conformity, and the Asch conformity experiments. 4)Authority - People will tend to obey authority figures, even if they are asked to perform objectionable acts. Cialdini cites incidents, such as the Milgram experiments in the early 1960s and the My Lai massacre. 5)Liking - People are easily persuaded by other people that they like. Cialdini cites the marketing of Tupperware in what might now be called viral marketing. People were more likely to buy if they liked the person selling it to them. Some of the many biases favoring more attractive people are discussed. See physical attractiveness stereotype. 6)Scarcity - Perceived scarcity will generate demand. For example, saying offers are available for a ""limited time only"" encourages sales. "
4,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/631799-jerry,4,"I put this book under ""dangerous knowledge."" Cialdini, still a top consultant in this field, has a tiny disclaimer at the end of the book saying how he's aware that this knowledge could be misused, but doesn't go much further. I see this stuff abused all the time, to spin democracies to go to war, to sell us products and services we don't really need and much, much more. I've been wanting to start an ethics institute around this topic. Interested? Write me!"
5,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/727106-mark-cheverton,5,"Required reading for all marketing professionals. The book details the most common approaches to influencing the decisions of others, backed up by the authors time spent infiltrating direct marketing companies and the like. Offers handy hints on how to spot when you're being manipulated and how to handle it.A very enjoyable read, should leave you much more aware of how you're being played next time you're in the market for a used car."
6,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"A couple of months ago, I read somewhere that when it comes to the psychology of persuasion and influence, Cialdini is the “daddy” of this subject. I chuckled and moved on. But then, a few days ago I found myself in a bookstore holding this book and heading to the counter. I came back home, and devoured it chapter by chapter, awestruck and flabbergasted by the sheer brilliance of the psychology of persuasion. Cialdini is no novice, apart from being an academic scholar and researcher who conducted innumerable experiments over the course of his career; He spent three years, in field, researching for this book. He entered into programs offered by different business enterprises and marketing agencies to train sales staff and dealers in ‘the art of persuasion’. Cialdini explains the science at work behind the curtains of this ‘art show’ in this book. We live in a consumer society. Our markets survive and thrive on mass consumption of products that are neither necessities nor luxury, but still they find their way to our homes right through our pockets. Why and how it happens, how we are convinced and persuaded to do something we really don’t need or want to do? Why in certain situations we are unable to fight the temptation to buy something we have no use of? How exactly do we fall for these marketing gimmicks? This book has the answer.For our convenience, our brain has evolved some fixed-action patterns, patterns that we follow almost blindly without any recourse to reason or logic. Why we do this? Because our brain has been programmed this way and because by doing this we don’t have to think too hard, it seems natural and effortless, almost as if it is the most obvious and right thing to do. This ‘shortcut’ of ours is exploited, almost everyday by people who are trying to sell us something. Cialdini repeatedly uses the term ‘click, whirr’, which explains our behavior patterns when we encounter a situation for which we have a ‘programmed reaction’. What the situation does is that it appeals to our conscious mind with a red-flag-signal. A file is ‘clicked open’ as a result, and ‘whirr’… out rolls the standard sequence of behaviors. (view spoiler)[For instance, if a thing is expensive it is good. If a thing is rare, it is precious. Likewise, we are more likely to spend a higher amount on alloy rims if we have spent a fair deal on the car. The more we spend on our suit, the more we are likely to spend on shoes and tie. This is due to the contrast principle, which is that on spending a high amount of money on an expensive thing we are likely to spend money on something less expensive than the initial product but which is still expensive enough if compared to its alternatives in the market. Click, whirr. The more we spend on the first thing, the more we are likely to spend on the second and the third. (hide spoiler)]The other important principles that marketing agents employ to get our assent are: Reciprocation, Commitment and Consistency, Friendliness, Authority and Scarcity.These are the shortcuts our brain is evolved to rely upon for making quick smart decisions, and it is by manipulating these very ‘click, whirr’ responses that we are compelled to say yes, even when we don’t want or need to. The synthesis of his entire research has been divided and assembled in 7 chapters. Each chapter explaining, through case studies, social experiments, research and psychological analysis of human behavior, different methods and tact with which we are convinced to do or not do a certain thing. This book has a lot in common with Daniel Kahnemans’ “Thinking, fast and slow” which is one of my favorite books of all time. I highly recommend these two books to anyone who is interested in behavioral psychology. "

I would recommend this to anyone, and will definitely listen to it again.I tired one of his techniques on a colleague I had been chasing for week, and it worked like a charm within an hour, so 1 for 1."
8,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686221-wen,4,"Yesterday I had to kill a couple hours, and happened to have this tiny audiobook on my phone. it turned out to be an instructive read.The author offered six principles of influence, i.e. getting people to comply or say yes: reciprocation, scarcity, authority, consensus, commitment and liking. he identified three agents who apply these principles with various degree of success, a bungler, a smuggler, and a sleuth; this was an alternative approach to give application tips than, say, using to-do and not-to-do lists.The examples were mostly business cases, although according to the author the principles also apply to other facets of life. Here are some practical tips included: -One can sell more expensive item by showing the top-of-the-line first and then working down.-When someone thanks you for a sizable favor you did him, instead of saying ""it was nothing"", say ""listen, you'd do the same for me"" to remind the person to reciprocate in the future.-When selling something, highlight the benefits the person stands to lose by not choosing your product, as people are more motivated by the thought of losing something than that of gaining something.-A leader, instead of simply using a poll, should communicate to the team that each member's input will be a factor into the equation of a decision, although might not be the deciding factor.-A commitment will most likely produce lasting changes when it's active, public and voluntary.-The factors that lead to liking: similarity, praise and Cooperation.  I would not disagree that those are little more than common sense, and one must have read iterations of them in other psychology self-help books. Also the six principles are no way exhaustive in the arts of influencing.And yet this was a nice little framework, and to me, there would have certainly been less fun ways to pass time than listening to this book."
9,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/199338-david,5,"Social Proof - People will do things that they see other people are doing.

10,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/371225-rachel,5,"So, I've read a fair amount of the literature about group dynamics and social influence, and taught classes that discussed and used it. So I thought I'd know much of what was in this book already. While I was familiar with some of it, there were a number of tricks I hadn't noticed, and excellent descriptions of the ones I had, complete with explanations. Definitely worth reading!Influence describes the six categories of techniques that have the potential to influence us without our conscious awareness. One, for example, is the mark of authority -- people are more likely to follow directions and suggestions given by someone with a title (Dr., Judge) than otherwise. The same applies to suggestions given by people who dress as if they are in the successful upper-class, or who are acknowledged authorities in some field (it doesn't have to be the one under discussion). What makes the book interesting (besides the highly useful listing of techniques and defenses) is the additional research -- including the surveys showing that people *are* in fact completely unaware that they're doing it. When asked about an experiment, they will insist that the given technique won't work, but when actually involved in the experiment, will fall for it almost every time. Really interesting stuff.I read recently that if you trace the locations (by location-aware cell phones) of a small population in an American city over a 6-month period, on average, the movement collapses into standard predator patterns. ( http://www.citeulike.org/user/sjc/art... ). This says something profound about the reasons we give for our behavior vs. the underlying causes. Cialdini sheds some light on these differences by pointing out some other areas where our thoughts don't match our actions, and explaining the unconscious shortcuts we use to help us function in our daily lives.Plus, it's got some great tricks to get out of being pressured into buying stuff or contributing to charities you don't like. :D"
11,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,3,"Psychological studies like a Malcolm Gladwell style. It's taken me a long time to get through it.Unfortunately a bunch of the topics mentioned I've learned from taking Psychology in University. It had interesting information but I feel it really drags on each topic.Clothiers know to sell the most expensive item first because the accessories are cheaper in comparison and they're more likely to buy them as well. Instead of buy cheap, then expensive.When you ask for a favour don't just say can I print out these copies and jump in line? instead use the magic word ""because, because I'm in a rush. It's effective just using the word because. Even if you say because I need to print these people would still allow you to jump the line."
12,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127810-ricky,2,"It's sometimes insightful but it seems to be written for a ""young adult"" reader and it seems to pander to the audience. I keep finding myself wishing it were better researched and better reasoned. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that such a popular book is so loaded with conventional wisdom and random assumptions presented as quasi-scientific. What made me about apoplectic is that his fifth edition continues his inaccurate presentation of the Catherine Genovese myth despite that it has been widely discredited.It's kind of disappointing. I'd recommend it to people as being worth reading but I strongly wish it were more academically rigorous. It's not nice to say but the guy comes across sometimes as kind of flaky and not that smart. Perhaps he's just as much of a chump when it comes to ideas as he says he is when it comes to complying with the requests of other people.By the last couple of chapters I couldn't stand it anymore. I basically quickly skimmed them. The chapters on Authority and Scarcity are all over the place. The fifth edition, with its extensive editing, shouldn't be this sloppy. I think it would have been better if he had simply rewritten it because aside from all of the forced conclusions and so forth, the mixture of outdated references and haphazardly injected contemporary material feels schizophrenic.It's hard not to dislike this guy just for his inane bio on the back cover as it is vomit-inducingly cutesy."
13,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7650924-varun,4,"The techniques described in this book are very fundamental to our psychology and the way Cialdini has explained them in a lucid manner is commendable. It requires a deep understanding of the subject to be able to bring such perspicuity to a subject area. In his almost story-like narrative, the author has at times over-communicated or repeatedly emphasized a particular phrase often to benefit of the reader. As a reader, you may feel that you already know some of these tricks of the trade, but then author brings out specific edge cases where a particular influence approach may fail because you just are trying to blindly apply the technique without understanding those edge cases. A must-read book for anyone looking to come across as a person who gets the buy-ins she or he wants. Obviously, a mere reading of this book won't make you a master. But taking specific notes and applying them in your real life is what matters."
14,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,4,"'Know Thyself' is not just a catchy cliché, it was for centuries a central spiritual imperative. Reading books like this only remind one of why it is so important. Even with modern psychology the average person understands so very little about themselves, their drives, why they do what they do, why they like what they like, that they are easily manipulated and exploited. You could say that it is even better if the person fallaciously believes they do know themselves and are confident in that understanding, these are even more gullible than the naiveté. Robert Cialdini dissects all the different tactics that marketers have known for years on how to get people to do things they initially had no desire for. Through careful analysis and explanation he goes one by one over these techniques and how to counter them. The author's impetus for even conducting this study a sincere desire to understand himself better because of how many times he had been duped, sold, tricked, conned and convinced into purchasing/doing things against his true wishes. These Weapons of Influence are1- Reciprocation (feeling indebt to return a favor)2- Commitment and Consistency (People naturally don't like change, they want predictability)3- Social Proof (If everyone is doing it, that is proof enough)4- Liking (We are more susceptible to being influenced by those we like) 5- Authority (Many are more than happy to put blind faith in authority)6- Scarcity (Ahh the central tenet of Economics, also has a powerful emotional appeal)  "

16,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1160359-daniel,4,"With the sophisticated mental apparatus we have used to build world eminence as a species, we have created an environment so complex, fast-paced, and information-laden that we must increasingly deal with it in the fashion of the animals we long ago transcended.Another fascinating book, this time provided by the ""Influence Without Authority"" class I took through Deere back in April.An overarching idea of the book is that people don't always use all the available information to make a decision - somtimes they use shortcuts. The book explores many of these shortcuts and those that exploit them in great detail. The shortcuts are as follows.1. Reciprocation - There are two types of reciprocation. Type 1 - Giving a ""free sample"" - This kind is used by Hare Krishnas in airports. They pin a flower on a passerby before asking for a donation. People feel more obligated to give a donation since they already received a flower, even if they throw the flower in the trash 3 steps later and are even angry about it.Type 2 - Making a big demand, then conceding, getting the target to reciprocate a concession. He used an example where a Boy Scout initially asked him to buy a box of cookies for $5 or something, then after declining, the Boy Scout said, ""Well, we have these chocolate bars for only $1."" The Boy Scout conceded the larger sale, and the customer felt obligated to ""concede"" by buying the cheaper option.Committment and Consistency - This was perhaps the most fascinating chapter. It's quite simple: people want to be consistent with their past actions. Once people admit or make a declaration, it may even ""grow legs to stand on"" in their mind as they justify their actions. Some of the fascinating examples:Retailers advertised certain toys like crazy for Christmas, but deliberately didn't supply enough. They got parents to promise their kids the toy, but then the parents couldn't buy it. Then the retailers would advertise it again in January, and there would be plenty available. This was a way to pump up sales during a normally dead time for stores, and cash in on parents' promises to their children.Signing petitions is extremely dangerous! There was a story about people who signed a petition about traffic safety. Then, 6 weeks later, they were asked to put an ugly ""Buckle up"" billboard in their front yard. The people who signed the petition were far more likely to allow the billboard. Another study was done where people were asked to sign a petition totally unrelated to traffic safety. Then 6 weeks later they were asked to put the same ugly ""Buckle up"" billboard. The results were the same - even though the petition was in no way about traffic safety! Why? Because by signing the petition, people ""saw"" themselves more as the type of person who would take action for public causes like traffic safety.The Chinese used simple tricks on prisoners. They'd get them to admit that America has problems, and then get them to write about America's problems. Putting it in writing has a powerful effect to make the writer believe it even more. They'd also get them to admit that Communism wasn't ""all bad"" for China, and get them to write about that. Pretty soon, they'd have essays on the subject which appeared damaging to the USA, and made the prisoners look brainwashed.Social Proof - Everyone is doing it, especially people just like you! If you go stand on a street corner, and stare up at a point in the sky, people might think you are nuts. If you and 3 of you friends go to a street corner and do the same thing, passers by will be far more likely to look up to see what ""everyone"" is looking at. We are far more likely to just ""do what everyone else is doing"" when there is uncertainty about what the best course of action is.In this chapter, he goes through the whole ordeal about the woman who was killed in New York, where there were 32 witnesses that never called the police. They were confused because it was happening in broad daylight, and because no one else was panicking. You can cut through this mob mentality by grabbing someone and giving the, specific instructions - ""Call the police!""He also went through the story about the cult that moved to Jonestown, Guyana and ""drank the kool aid"" in a mass suicide. By moving to such a remote area, there were no other people like them anywhere. It gave their leader more influence over the group - the only people ""like"" them were themselves. When one woman ""drank the kool aid"", it was a snowball, because she was just like the others.He also went into detail about how suicide rates dramatically increase when a highly publisized suicide occurs in an area. He even went so far as to blame an increase in car accidents and plance crashes on them - and had the data to back it up! Fascinating. His contention is that this increase in car accidents and plane crashes aren't accidental, but are fake suicides.Liking - Tupperware parties are so successful because they are using your friends as their salespeople. These parties also use social proof and reciprocity (by giving prizes, guests feel obligated to buy more). They also use commitment by getting people to say publicly how they will use the products.But liking is a big category. He reviewed how attractive people get a ""halo effect"", where we believe them and like them better, and are therefore more likely to buy from them. Serving people lunch before asking for a contribution also works! We also like and follow people we perceive as similar to ourselves.Authority - Just the appearance of a business suit or a doctor's lab coat can make people believe them more. He told a story where nurses have been found to obey doctors (and ignore their own training) just because doctors have authority over them. He also told the infamous story where people would continue administering shock therapy to ""subjects"" because the professor told them to continue - despite people screaming in the other room. Beware of people in business suits!Scarcity - By making something scarce, people want it more, and even like it more. Taking it away makes people want it even more. There was an elaborate study where they gave one set of people 10 cookies, another set 2, and then a third set initially 10, and then took away 8 and left them with two. The people who thought the cookies tasted best were the 3rd set. The people with only 2 to begin with ranked #2, and the people with 10 rated the cookies the least tasty. The moral of the story is that we value things more when we have less, and we value things the most right after they were taken away from us.This is why ""first come, first serve"" works so well. It's also why having multiple people competing for the same thing works so well.Cialdini closes the book by saying that we humans have created an insanely complex world that is getting incomprehensible - we call it the ""Information Age"" not the ""Knowledge Age"". In this context, we are more likely than ever to use these shortcuts to help us make decisions quicker and easier. Using these shortcuts isn't always a bad thing, but we need to be more aware of when they can be exploited by others. There is more opportunity than ever for exploitation. I agree 100%."
17,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"I read this book a second time--not realizing that I had read it 35 years ago! Again, I can give it a 5-star rating. This is a top-notch book on psychology, and seems quite comprehensive on the subject of how we are persuaded to do things. The book is fascinating and engaging.Here are a few of the ways we are persuaded:ReciprocationConsistency acts as a shield against thought, and can be exploited. The book contains numerous examples of how we strain to stay consistent. Maybe, this is why so many Trump-supporters cannot break away from this fascist in the White House. Another important technique is to first obtain a small commitment, followed by ever-increasing commitments.Social ProofPeople look to others for guidance in their behaviors. It is so interesting that people will help others in distress if there are just a few bystanders. But if there are many bystanders, they won't think of helping, assuming others will step in.Many copycat suicides are disguised as accidents. As a result, many innocent people also die in the resulting so-called ""accidents"".Laugh tracks used to be very popular in TV shows. But they aren't new. In 1820, opera houses were hiring people who would applaud to instigate audience reactions. The phony applause grew to include laughing and weeping on cue, as well as calls of ""encore"".Association PrinciplePeople like to be associated with celebrities and famous events. For example, after the 1980 American Olympic hockey team victory over Russia's team, scalpers swarmed outside the hockey arena. They were selling $100 for a pair of ticket stubs.During a California referendum on smoking in public places, a woman in LA was overheard saying: ""It's a real tough decision. They've got big stars speaking for it, and big stars speaking against it. You don't know how to vote.""Scarce CommodityMy favorite example is a sales tactic used by toy sellers, with artificially-created scarcity. Parents promise their children a favored toy for Christmas. The toy is not available in toy stores before Christmas, so parents end up buying a substitute toy. Later, after the Christmas season, children remind their parents of their promise. So, parents have to return to the stores and buy the originally-promised toy!Another marvelous story is about how the author's brother sold cars while in school. He advertised a car, and had three prospective buyers make appointments to see the car at the same time. This created intense competition due to scarcity. The buyers failed to realize that the competition's increased pressure had nothing to do with the merits of the car. People don't stop to think that the joy of a scarce commodity is NOT in experiencing it, but in POSSESSING it.I cannot overstate how much fun this book is. Maybe this review will INFLUENCE you to read it! :-)"
18,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798615-veronika,3,"This book gives good insight to compliance strategies and main reasons we are persuaded - however I was unimpressed by a few of the examples Cialdini used and the main conclusion he made at the end of the book. Example 1: After claiming to have been a bigger socialite than he really is to impress a young attractive saleswoman, Cialdini became particularly pugnacious about her ""strategy of tricking him into exaggerating his habits"" where as this was his fault, not the saleswoman's. When she offered a package that saves him money - since he claimed to go out so often - she was actually offering a favour; the fact that he was bragging - because she was young and good looking - was not her fault at all. He makes this out to be a malevolent trick used by the saleswoman when in fact it was him trapping himself. He could have easily just not lied, despite her being young and attractive, instead of going into a big argument in the end about her ""wrong-headed strategy to persuade him to exaggerate his social habits""Example 2: His friend Sara, who after being offered to be married to her boyfriend (Lets call him Candidate 2) chose to go back to her old boyfriend, Tim, despite him unwilling to marry her: Cialdini says she has been tricked by Tim into going back as he had offered to marry her while she was courted by Candidate Nr. 2 but disregarded of the marriage after she chose him. I don't see this example as a properly researched one - the reasons we chose mates is a lot more complicated than who is willing to marry us. Just because Candidate Nr. 2 was willing, does not necessarily make him a more attractive potential partner. There are a lot of other things to consider. What's more Cialdini said she was genuinely happier in the end - so was this not a good deal? He had also not considered she may have only had Candidate Nr. 2 around to put Tim into a competitive situation and to profit from the scarcity rule... Tim, who is obviously for some reason or another - clearly unknown to Cialdini - much more valuable to her than Candidate Nr. 2. I also did not like his conclusion that she must chose before her time is up and all her alternatives to Tim disappear. Finally, I was not particularly impressed with the conclusion of the book: ""We should be willing to use boycott, threat, confrontation, censure, tirade, nearly anything to retaliate"" to those exploiting our natural triggers to ""short cut"" the massive amounts of information presented to us: for example dismissing any show that uses fake laughter, not giving any tips to bartenders who ""salt"" their tip jar and the like....recognising these exploits of triggers and short cuts is one thing, but going to war with them and arguing with every salesperson as he does in various examples of the book would be far more energy and time consuming than it is worth.

Now I do. This book pretty much covers all the popular studies done on the human psyche and far from being an academic paper, brings the Psychology of Persuasion to the masses in a well articulated, well referenced, book.I especially liked how the book used said studies in how it affects daily, and non-daily lives. For example: Scarcity. We already know that something being scarce increases it's perceived value, but then the book goes on to say WHY does scarcity increases perceived value and draws yet another example of how the 1960s Black Revolution stemmed from scarcity. Who would have known?The subject is intriguing to say the least. Wouldn't you like to know what makes you decide, and what you can do to help someone else decide? ;)"

Robert Cialdini's very readable and sensible book satisfied both needs simultaneously.Cialdini, like many psychologists, argued that humans face many difficult decisions in life. He argues, Automatic, stereotyped behavior is prevalent in much of human action, because in many cases it is the most efficient form of behaving, and in other cases it is simply necessary. You and I exist in an extraordinarily complicated stimulus environment, easily the most rapidly moving and complex that has ever existed on this planet. To deal with it, we need shortcuts. (p. 5)As Cialdini said, when faced with difficult situations and a shortcut, we respond with an unthinking click and whirr.Cialdini identified six broad compliance-pulling situations: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity. Use these and you can and will sell ideas, merchandise, and relationships. Supporting these ideas, Cialdini described experiments, his ""undercover"" work with a number of sales experts (such as car sales), and the times when he and others have been tricked to buy or do things without recognizing (until after the fact). He also explained how we can recognize and avoid complying. For example, when in a situation pulling compliance through reciprocity,As long as we perceive and define [the other person's] action as a compliance device instead of a favor, he no longer has the reciprocation rule as an ally: The rule says that favors are to be met with favors; it does not require that tricks be met with favors. (p. 39)When I read books I enjoy, I always want to share. I'd like to share this with the other members of a board I'm on – and everyone I know who wants to influence others' behavior."

I went on talking about how 'revealing' the book is during hangouts with friends, in between classes, sometimes during classes and when not. I tried to explain to mom how the rule of reciprocation influences our decisions while having dinner with her, tried to explain the reason behind certain behaviors of our newly appointed driver to my father. The book got to me.I did certain things throughout my life without even ever recognizing that there might be a concrete reason behind why I have been doing this. For example, I have a thing 'for' footing my food bill all the time. If it is not someone's birthday, or a special occasion where someone is giving a treat, but is trying to pay my bill, I feel uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. Almost physically uncomfortable. I have stopped dating once because the guy simply won't let me pay my bill. I believe it is a good practice, but I wasn't sure why I had this strong feeling against this. Now I know. I simply did not want to have the Rule of Reciprocation influence me.The book with vividly furnished examples and case studies tells you what persuades and influences people, their decisions. Why they say yes to some offers and no to the others. The in-depth discussion on the six weapons of influence: Reciprocation, Commitment & Consistency, Social Proof, Liking, Authority and Scarcity is such an eye-opener.

RECIPROCITY - The rule says that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.The beauty of the free sample, is that it is also a gift and, as much, can engage the reciprocity rule: many people find it difficult to accept a sample from the always-smiling attendant, return only the toothpick, and walk away.There is an obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and an obligation to repay.2. COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY - Our nearly obsessive desire to be (and to appear) consistent with what we have already done.TIP ON GOALS: Set a goal and write it down. Whatever the goal, the important thing is that you set it, so you've got something for which to aim. There is something magical about writing things down. 3. SOCIAL PROOF - One means we use to determine what is correct is to find what other people think is correct. The principle applies especially to the way we decide what constitutes correct behavior. We view a behavior as more correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it.In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct.4. LIKING - We most prefer to say yes to the requests of someone we know and LIKE. This simple rule is used in hundreds of ways by total strangers to get us to comply with their requests.5. AUTHORITY - We are trained from birth that obedience to ""proper"" authority is right, and disobedience is wrong.Information from a recognized authority can provide us a valuable shortcut for deciding how to act in a situation. WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK, THEREFORE, WE DON'T. (sometimes it's best to avoid shortcuts)6. SCARCITY - Opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limited. (People want what they can't have)As opportunities become less available, we lose freedoms; and we hate to lose the freedoms we already have.""Probably one of the best books I've read. A must read if you're doing business; or if you want to understand why you buy things. "

You may also know I generally don't like many of them - ironic given that I write in the business/professional/trade space. This book is an exception and is really very good. I wavered between 4 and 5 stars and I plumped for 5 being in a generous mood today. This book explains how various levers of influence are used to persuade us to do certain things - mainly buy products, and it explains how we can try to resist those levers. It was originally written in 1984 and although updated, it does at times feel a little dated. Nevertheless, the information is enlightening, occasionally entertaining and occasionally frightening. It was written before the era of social media, but this should not worry you. The very same levers of influence are used now - just much more intensely. It is not all equally good, but the good parts are very good, and I enjoyed it. As I read it, I found myself thinking ""oh yes, I've fallen for that trick"" several times. As a book aimed at explaining to the lay person how we are manipulated by people like sales assistants, advertisers and marketeers it is therefore somewhat ironic that it is endorsed by the Journal of Market Research as an important book for marketeers. But then I don't think those in marketing or advertising ever worried much about irony!Don't be fooled by the cover, which almost put me off. This is not written by someone who has played all the tricks in the game and now wants to share them after a successful career selling - he is a self-confessed sucker who got interested in the tricks because he fell for them so often, and then studied them as a psychologist. Definitely worth a read. "

26,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"An intriguing exploration of the psychology of persuasion. Cialdini explains six “weapons of influence,” showing how they’re used, why they work, and how to resist them. There’s plenty of research and anecdotes. The lessons are applied to everyday life, and frequently to marketing and sales.The main point is that when we focus on a single influencing feature rather than the entire situation, we often respond automatically, leading to a poor decision. Although influencing features can provide shortcuts that save us time in analyzing a situation, we must be wary of those people who misrepresent evidence and use their influence to exploit.The six principles of influence are reciprocation, commitment and consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity.Several of the anecdotes are long-winded.I’ve seen this book on many lists of business books, and finally decided to read it because Daniel Pink recommended it in To Sell is Human.NotesReciprocationPresent the customer the more expensive item first, so subsequent items seem relatively inexpensive.People tend to reciprocate concessions. To apply this, offer an expensive option; when they decline, offer a less expensive option. As another example, ask for a big favor; when they decline, ask for a small favor.Commitment and ConsistencyThe foot-in-the-door technique: ask a person to make a small commitment, which manipulates their self-image. Later, they’ll be more likely to comply with more and larger requests that are consistent with this image. Written commitments are especially effective.To get a child to behave long-term, it’s more effective to provide a reason they can internalize and take personal responsibility for than to make external threats.To test a decision you’ve made (or are about to make), ask yourself, ""Knowing what I know now, would I make the same choice?""Social ProofIf you need medical help in a crowd, the most effective option is to be precise about your need for aid. Pick one person, point to them and say, ""You, sir, in the blue jacket, I need help. Call an ambulance."" ""We will use the actions of others to decide on proper behavior for ourselves, especially when we view those others as similar to ourselves.”LikingPeople tend to like those who are similar in interests, background, interest, age, religion, and politics.""Continued exposure to a person or object under unpleasant conditions such as frustration, conflict, or competition leads to less liking.""Cooperation towards common goals is one of the best ways to overcome hostility between different groups.People become fonder of people and things the experience while eating. That’s why food is often served when people are trying to influence.AuthorityPeople tend not to question the orders of those they perceive to be legitimate authorities.A person's title, clothes, and trappings (status symbols) affect their perceived authority.ScarcityParental interference makes some couples feel greater love and desire for marriage."
27,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7118702-loy-machedo,5,"Loy Machedo’s Book Review – Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert CialdiniI first bumped into Robert Cialdini’s work with “Yes! 50 Scientifically Proven Ways to be Persuasive”. I found that book to be absolutely impressive and so, when I got to know he had also authored “Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion”, I was more than eager to read it. And without a doubt, I can tell you, I am glad I did. Harvard Business Review lists Dr. Cialdini's research in ""Breakthrough Ideas for Today's Business Agenda"" as he breaks down the Science of Influence into 6 key principles of persuasion.1)	Reciprocity - People tend to return a favor. Example the pervasiveness of free samples in marketing or The good cop/bad cop strategy where the criminal or suspect tends to open up to the cop who is nice to him. And as an act of reciprocity, returns the kindness by giving the required information. 2)	Commitment and Consistency - If people commit verbally or in writing they are more likely to honor that commitment. The reason stems from the pressures that come with being congruent with their self image. Example - Car salesman employ this strategy by raising the price of the vehicle at the last moment works because the buyer has already decided to buy or the Chinese brainwashing on American prisoners to enforce disloyalty towards their country. 3)	Social Proof - People will do things that they see other people are doing. Example – If a group of people would look up into the sky; bystanders would then look up into the sky to see what they were seeing. 4)	Authority - People will tend to obey authority figures, even if they are asked to perform objectionable acts5)	Liking - People are easily persuaded by other people that they like. 6)	Scarcity - Scarcity (real / artificial) will generate demand. Example, Offers with ""limited time only"" creates more sales.The whole book has quite a number of examples to state and reinfornce the points of wisdom stated by Caildini which makes the book very compelling everything from having the Hare Krishnas and their flower gift strategy to what telemarketers do to ensure sales to the fake laughter used by sitcoms to create even more laughter. Overall RatingI found this book to be a Masterpiece in the Science of Psychology. In fact, I personally felt, this book should be made mandatory for everyone to read – especially the part where the author clearly states, that misusing these techniques will result in a more of a negative result than positive – As I feel quite a number of Sales People with their so called ‘Smart Closes’ think they have achieved a positive result – while the fact remains, they have destroyed themselves slowly and surely. A great book, A fantastic read and A worthwhile investment. Without hesitation, I would give this book a perfect 10 out of 10. Loy Machedoloymachedo.com "

Instead, we rely on mental shortcuts – ""if everybody thinks it's good, then it must be good"" and ""if we like someone/something, it must be good"". Those shortcuts are crucial to functioning – there simply isn't time to stop and think deeply about everything. Most of the time they serve us well. But they can also be exploited, and occasionally, they are. This book is about how people use our mental shortcuts to get us to say ""YES"".A nice illustration is a story from a jewellery store. The owner tried to sell turquoise jewellery, but nobody would buy it. She tried various tactics – showcasing it, improving the storytelling, etc. – but none worked. People just wouldn't buy it. Desperate, she told her employee to slash the price in half and went on vacation. But the employee made a mistake – instead of having the price, she doubled it. When the owner returned, she was in for a surprise – all the turquoise had sold out. In people's minds, ""expensive"" equals ""good"" and that made the product more desirable.""Expensive = good"" is the first mental shortcut this book introduces to you. A lot more follow. Some of them are:* We tend to comply more with people we like (if a waiter gets us to like them and makes us feel they have our interest at heart, we tend to tip more)* Scarcity makes us value things higher that we would usually (if we're one of three people taking a look at a car for sale, we're more likely to bid more compared to if we were alone)* We tend to comply with people we think have authority (a jay-walker is more likely to be followed by bystanders when they look like a CTO than when they look like a regular person)* We tend to seek reciprocity in our relationships (when somebody does us a small favour, we're more likely to comply with their requests later; a salesman who got us a present days ago is more likely to get a ""yes"" from us today)* ...and so onThe book goes over various studies and experiments that identify ""weapons of influence"" employed by compliance professionals. So it can be used either for good or evil. On the former, it will teach you how to protect yourself against possible exploitations of your mental shortcuts without giving them up. On the latter, it will show you some tips and tricks to coax customers, clients and friends into complying with your wishes.Take your pick."

36,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"A good read on six principles of human psychology that can help you to persuade others. This is a ""pop psychology"" book, so as always, take the contents of the book as good rules of thumb, rather than hard scientific principles. That said, a good rule of thumb can be very useful in life, and this book presents 6 rules that you should take into account.1. Reciprocity. If you give someone a gift or do them a favor, they are socially obligated to give something back. Key idea: before making a request of someone, do them a favor. Even if it's something really small (e.g., Hare Krishna followers giving free flowers, supermarkets giving away free samples), you're much more likely to have your request accepted. It's impolite to reject a gift and even more so to not reciprocate, so this is a powerful psychological concept.2. Scarcity. People want something more if there is less of it available, and especially if others compete with them for it. If you want a customer to be more likely to buy your product, you can tell them it's running out, or there's a deadline, or better yet, some other company is going to buy the last available one! This is why real estate agents rarely do 1-on-1 showings of houses and instead love to do open houses, where many potential buyers show up at the same time and realize how many others are competing with them for this scarce resource.3. Consistency. If you've said or done something previously—if you've committed to something, especially publicly—you're much more likely to maintain or even expand on that behavior. There is a huge amount of power in getting someone to commit to something, even if it's something small, before asking for something bigger. And if the commitment is public and/or in writing, it's much more powerful. For example, if you sell cleaning products, get the customer to talk about their problem, the ideal solution, and how they'd feel if they had such a solution. Ask them if they are the type of person who likes a clean and tidy home. Ask them to talk about how much messiness bothers them and how much better they feel when everything is put away. Now that they identify as the type of person who likes cleanliness, when you offer them your cleaning product, they will be much more likely to accept. 4. Authority. People trust experts. This one is fairly obvious, but an important idea is that, in some cases, you should take extra effort to make people aware of your authority. For example, patients comply more with a doctor's advice if the doctor's diploma is hanging in a visible spot in their office. 5. Social proof. People look to others for how to behave, especially in uncertain situations. Cialdini has a number of great stories around this principle. One is the classic case where a woman was killed in a NYC street and even though there were 30+ witnesses, no one called the police or tried to help. Instead, they all looked at each other, saw no one was reacting, and assumed since no one else was reacting, it must be OK. Another is the impact of front-page news stories: for example, if a famous person commits suicide, the number of suicides goes up, especially amongst people who are similar to the celebrity (e.g., same gender, race, age). And yet another was the idea of opera claqueurs, who are paid to attend operas and applaud, cheer, laugh, cry, etc. It's the original version of the sitcom laugh track.6. Liking. People listen much more to those they like: or, more specifically, to those who are similar to them, those who compliment them, and those that cooperate with them. This is one of the reasons attractive people have massive benefits in society. We like the way someone looks and unconsciously will treat them better and trust them more.7 (bonus) Contrast. This is another important principle mentioned in the book, though it's not listed as one of the ""big 6."" The idea is that instead of trying to gauge the absolute value of something, most people determine value by comparing with something else (other books, such as ""Thinking: Fast and Slow"" talk extensively about ""priming effects""). For example, when negotiating, start with a very high price, and then back off to the real number you want; that real number will seem much more reasonable by contrast. In fact, by backing off to your real number, this ""concession"" will feel like a gift to the other person, so you'll likely not only benefit from contrast, but reciprocity too.The common theme amongst all these ideas—and many other psychological principles—is that our brains are always looking for shortcuts. It's too inefficient to make all decisions from first principles, so we develop heuristics that let us make decisions quickly. These shortcuts and heuristics work most of the time, but if you know what they are, you can take advantage of them. I have to admit that while reading this book, some of the tricks Cialdini describes are a bit questionable; others feel downright immoral. For example, he talks about a trick car dealers use where they offer you a low price and get you to agree to buy the car at that price. They might even let you take it home for a day and tell all your neighbors about the great deal you got. But when you come back the next day to sign the paperwork, they tell you there had been a mistake, and the price is now higher. Because the customer has already committed to themselves, their family, and their neighbors, to buying the car, they often go along with this higher price, even if they never would've accepted it had it been the original offer.That to me feels manipulative and wrong. But then again, we are all manipulating each other all the time. A salesman may wear a suit to impress a customer more; a saleswoman will wear makeup; a web designer will make the website look clean and snappy; a SaaS company will list the price per month rather than per year; and so on. There's a line in there somewhere, but it's not always obvious where it is.One of the other interesting insights from this book is that the reason the brain uses all these shortcuts is that the world is complicated and the amount of information can be overwhelming. What's worrying is that the amount of information we have access to is increasing due to the Internet. Will this lead to people using even more shortcuts and leaving themselves open to even more abuse? Is this what makes fake news and the election of Trump possible?"

The book is very nicely structured and includes summaries at the end of each chapter, along with questions for discussion. He even offers sections titled ""Defense"" to help understand how to diffuse or deflect the different types of influence. He delves into reciprocation, liking, social proof, compliance to authority, scarcity, and consistency/conformity.The premise of the book is that humans are all wired in certain ways -- we look for cognitive shortcuts to save time and energy in making decisions. Sometimes this is useful and sometimes, not so much. We're wired to accept things that are familiar, and to reciprocate and like people and to want to get along in certain ways.Cialdini talks a lot about ""compliance professionals"" -- folks in marketing and sales who understand the concepts he describes in the book, and at the end of the book -- advises us to rebel against those unscrupulous types who seek to manipulate us with false information. Since the book was written in 2009 - I was curious to see what Cialdini has written more recently, especially on the recent presidential elections in the US.

It is by no means a 21st treatise on how influence works. I don't even recommend this as a historical example of how salespeople and other influence experts may have been taught; it's that bad."

But if you've studied communications in university or if you have personal interests in the psychology of persuasion - you will not find many new ideas here. However, Cialdini gives some cool examples to illustrate his points."
41,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84317608-javier-lorenzana,3,"Easy, quick read on the art of persuasion. Key Takeaways- Reciprocity: people are more inclined to repay something.- People seek similarity, praise, and mutual goals- Influence is highly contextual. What happens before the pitch is equally as important"
42,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18185192-athan-tolis,4,"This is a classic that is unlikely to retain its status, but this it owes to its “manners” rather than its “substance.” The next generation is highly unlikely to abide the 1960’s style worldview of Robert Cialdini and totally unlikely to recognize any of the products described in the book. (Encyclopedias, anyone?) I was shocked to discover “Influence” originally came out in 1984, if I’m honest. It feels a lot more like “Hustler” than “Color of Money,” bottom line. In 1984 there was no Internet, besides, and that’s where influence is of any use these days.But if hustle you must, it takes you through a number of techniques that may not 100% survive the transition from door-to-door double-glazing sales techniques to online marketing, but regardless merit your attention.Given that my startup finally has a product to sell, I thought “what the heck” (to quote from a 1983 movie) and made “Influence” my companion in the tube for a week. And I found out about •	Reciprocation•	Consistency•	Social Proof•	Liking•	Authority, and•	ScarcityThe idea here is that we humans are bombarded by information and rely heavily on what Daniel Kahneman has called (thirty years later) our “System 1” to navigate the planet: our prejudice, intuition and rules of thumb. To trick your mark’s intuition, you need to find the weak entry points into his subconscious, and the six chapters deal with an entry point each.Not all chapters are equally good and not all deal 100% with influence per se, but my reading time was not wasted. And as a bonus, I now know the source of some of the most persistent circulars to appear on the early Internet, such as the letter (p. 15) from the daughter who failed chemistry, all the way to Frank Zappa deadpanning back to a rude interviewer (who called him a girl for having long hair) that his wooden leg made him a chair (p. 274).APPENDIX ---- THIS IS NOT MY REVIEW, MERELY MY NOTES FROM THE BOOK:RECIPROCATIONPeople are wired to reciprocate. If you can get somebody to accept the tiniest gift they will be obliged to you.•	People know this and will sometimes work toward avoiding uninvited debts.•	But once your gift is accepted, you’re in: you can trigger “unfair exchanges.” People do not want to fail the reciprocity rule, they don’t want to be mooches•	Small gifts work well, because they are difficult to turn down. Your mark is too embarrassed not to accept (we’re also wired to not offend somebody who’s offering a gift) so then you’re set. A free can of Coke at a time when a drink would be natural is quoted as something you can lever well.•	Free samples are even better: your mark 1. gets to experience the product 2. owes youReciprocal concessions take reciprocation to the next level. Basically, ask for something big. If you get turned down, which is a concession on your part, you are in a position to ask for something smaller. Example: “if you can’t buy tickets to our ball, would you perhaps consider buying some cookies?”Here you are not only triggering reciprocation. You are also invoking the contrast principle.Apparently this was the technique the scriptwriters for Happy Days used to get the word “virgin” into the show. They’d stick it in the script 50 times and the reviewer would allow it in once, at the place the scriptwriters wanted it all along.Oh, and that headhunter who asked you if you cared for a job at some crappy competitor? The only thing he wanted all along was your deskmates’ names you gave him toward the end of the call, after you told him you are happy at your job. Yup, that was a kick in the stomach.It gets worse: suppose you start with the high demand. And suppose you meet your mark in the middle (i.e. where you always wanted to end up.) You get two benefits for free:(i)	He now “owns” the deal. He earned it and he’s responsible for it. Not you(ii)	He gets the satisfaction of having beaten you down. He feels good about the deal and maybe even you.So if you work at a department store and a customer’s walking in, you now know why your boss wants you to start with the 3k suit before you move on to the shirts, ties and sweaters.CONSISTENCY – COMMITMENTWe all like to think we are consistent. When Faraday was asked if some competing scientist was always wrong, he allegedly quipped back that no, he wasn’t that consistent. That’s something for the salesman to latch onto!Consistency is also a great “System 1” shortcut. It acts as(i)	A shield against thought (“If there’s liver on the menu, I’m set”)(ii)	A way to tie yourself to the mast (which explains why news reinforces our beliefs regardless)Two AWESOME stories here: first, one from the author’s visit to transcendental meditation workshop, where his fellow professor’s piercing questions actually got others to immediately sign up, in case they go home and think about it and change their mind and second, one from the toy store. It turns out that the toys advertised most heavily on TV ahead of Christmas don’t become available till January. You promise them to your kids, you don’t find them, you buy other toys to stick under the tree and then, to show your kids that good people keep promises you go to the store and buy the advertised toys as soon as they become available. “But, daddy, you promised:” you’re checkmated! The advertiser pushed your consistency button there!It gets even when we move on to the practices of the Chinese toward their POWs during the Korean War. They would offer you tiny little concessions (a cigarette or something) if you would as much as state that not everything was perfect in America. Another tiny gift if you were happy to write that down. Recognition was given if you’d participate in essay competitions regarding the politics of the times, with care taken to often reward essays that, while critical of communism or of China, also cared to take a less absolute view of the world.The key here is that when you write something down that moves from your initial position, you own it. It’s yours. And if you write something a bit further away from your original position, you own that too. If you read your essay in front of other POWs or if it’s broadcast, you own that too.The prizes must be small. You cannot be able to tell yourself you were coerced.And then, of course, if you have any self-esteem you will defend what you said, you’ll stay consistent with it. So that was the Chinese way to slowly sway you: small, incremental steps to change your self-perception.The “Magic Act” was the commitment in writing. The second step was you telling your story in front of the public eye.Fraternity hazing, like waiting in line to get tickets to a show, works the same way: once you’ve been subjected to it, you own the experience, you feel it did you good and you appreciate what comes next more. Colleges across America have gone to great lengths to ban it, but upperclassmen will not have it any other way. The suffering they went through (that the author convincingly compares with the rituals of African tribesmen) is inseparable from what makes them love their fraternity. It was the very act of commitment. Oh, and exactly for the same reason the Chinese gave small prizes, you cannot send your pledges to clean out toilets at the local hospital. It cannot be something they did for the common good. Hazing has GOT to be pointless, they need to have suffered it for their own sake.Car salesmen take this “ownership” concept even further: they’ll low-ball you on a car. You know your market, so you jump on the deal. By the time “a mistake” is discovered in the price that lines it up with all the other prices you saw, you “own” the deal you struck, and besides it’s no worse than the competition. The trick is you’re now sold on the deal, when you came it to look at the actual car. You end up getting a fair deal, perhaps, but not necessarily on the car you would have bought if you did not feel the need to be consistent.The biggest idea here is left for last: commitment generates its own support. The car you dealt on, you find reasons you actually like it after you’re set on the deal. Once you’re a customer, you find your own reasons why you like the product, basically. The original prop may fall, but the table will have grown its own legs! This extends all the way to more important parts of your life, the author says: once you’re committed to your life partner, you have the rest of your life to find out what it is that attracted you to her…SOCIAL PROOFWe are sheep. We want to know what others are doing, especially if we’re not sure what we’re doing. That’s how come canned laughter is effective in televised comedy, that’s how come the barista at Starbucks will “salt” the tip jar with dollar notes and that’s how come it’s effective advertising to say that the Ford Focus is the “fastest selling” car in the world and that’s why a club will maintain a long line outside the door even if it’s not full inside: to signal to us sheep to imitate others.We mainly take our cues from people we consider to be our peers: toddlers who become less diffident if they’ve seen videos of other outgoing children; the author’s son who refused to swim was found safe and sound in the neighbors’ pool, swimming alongside the similarly-aged son of the neighbors; Jim Jones’ disciples drank the cool-aid after a mom, one of them, served some to her infant and had some herself; conversely, Catherine Genovese was famously left to die (a well-publicized incident from 19640 probably because the first couple people to walk by her did not notice her: those who walked by next took notice of how the first passers-by did not help and took their cue from them!(The book also goes into a crazy wormhole that’s nothing to do with sales but is interesting nonetheless: the higher incidence of lethal accidents after vs. before highly publicized accidents –showing imitation—the manner the age of post suicide accident victims clusters around the age of the person involved in a heavily publicized suicide etc. etc. Useful for a minister of propaganda, perhaps, but of no use to a salesman, I would think)LIKINGIf they like you, you will sell. To be liked, it helps to:•	Look good•	Be similar to whoever you’re selling to•	Pay compliments•	Maintain contact •	Be associated with good news•	Be associated with success•	Be introduced by somebody who is liked (and borrow from their good standing)There are techniques to being liked. For example, cops use the “good cop – bad cop” technique to extract confessions –to the good cop.AUTHORITYAuthority sells. People will follow an expert. The famous Stanley Milgram experiment is mentioned from the sixties, where otherwise perfectly normal people would invariably carry on administering electric shocks to screaming actors, because an expert was telling them to do so.Also the example of actors who play doctors on television and go on to advertise products that normally an expert would be expected to sell, rather than somebody who merely acts in the role of an expert. The point is made that purchase decisions are made by the subconscious, which is happy to take 100% illogical shortcuts.Clothes are important too. That’s why you need to dress the part.SCARCITYIf something is running out, first we’ll take it and then we’ll think. It’s a trick used to sell speakers out of the back of a van, the latest hot savings product etc. That’s because it presses two big buttons:•	It’s a “shortcut,” in that if something’s running out, it must be good•	Straight out of prospect theory, it’s something you have now, but stand to lose, thereby triggering regretThe author goes on to discuss Romeo and Juliet and how he feels silly whenever he makes a negative comment about his children’s consorts. The reaction of the buying public whenever there is a gun-related massacre would fit right in here too, though the vintage of the book restricts us to a less poignant incident from Kennesaw, GA.From there, the author goes on to discuss how revolutions often happen after swathes of a population experience enhanced status that gets taken away, how Barry Diller once overpaid for some deal and how his brother books appointments to see cars he sells all at the same time…"

Its one of those books that everyone talks about but not enough people actually implement the advice. It is a Goldmine of valuable strategies and marketing and psychology experiments. "
46,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9724363-maria,5,"In this book Cialdini explores the subtle and not so subtle ways that our behaviour and decision-making can be influence by others. Most of the time influence and persuasion are useful exchanges wired into daily human interactions, but as such they are at times used by others to sway us one way or another without our awareness. Cialdini's goal is to educate the reader about misuses of influence and to provide tools for pushing back. He is, for example, emphatically against trickery that salespeople use to push a product such as presenting as scarce when it is plentiful, or hiring professional actors for ""testimonials"" about the product's quality. Most examples in the book come from retail or entertainment, but I can see how these same tactics can easily be used in work settings or personal relationships.Influence can be obvious, but it is often a lot less visible and causes automatic responses that have been wired into us for quick decision making. Studies show that we will, without realizing it, put significantly more effort into acquiring products that we otherwise know we don't need if they are endorsed by people we respect or like, shown to be about to run out or in high demand by others (especially those we can easily relate to), or presented by those in our social circle. Some examples felt outdated for me (like Tupperwear parties or newspaper ads), but there are enough general examples in the book to present the overall mechanisms of influence. A few of those startled me, I realized that although I consider myself well-aware of unwanted influence, there have been many times when I fell pray to the exact tactics that Cialdini describes. Although the book was written in the 80's, many of the mechanisms described can be easily projected into our age of ever-growing connections and information to understand how they are used and magnified through social media.This book stood out for me among the social psychology books I've read recently because of the clear relation of research to the conclusions the author draws, the real life examples I could relate to, and the quality of the writing. I recommend it to anyone who would like to better understand how we are persuaded and influenced on a daily, hourly basis whether unintentionally or on purpose, and how to apply this knowledge to making decisions with more awareness."
47,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,5,"Author Cialdini began the research that would lead to this book when he got tired of being taken advantage of. He’s not unintelligent, yet he would find himself talked into buying things he didn’t want at all. What was happening? It turns out that there are some basic ways that humans are influenced, and most people follow them without questioning. Some are just the easy way to deal with situations, while some actually create discomfort when one refuses to follow the social conventions. Cialdini breaks it all down into six methods of getting people to do things the way the user wants them to: reciprocation- if someone does something for you, no matter how small, you must then do what they want you to do, hence all those charities that send you return address labels; commitment and consistency-if they can get you to establish yourself as something, say, someone who likes to go out to dinner by asking you about your habits in a survey, then ask you to buy a coupon book for dining out, you are more apt to buy the thing rather than risk the image built in the survey; social proof- if other people think a certain way, so should you- the canned laughter on sitcoms is the most common use of this; liking- this comes into play in ploys like Tupperware parties, where because the person benefiting is your friend you feel you *have* to buy something, it is brought into play by having the seller be someone attractive and dress like and have similar values to you; authority- 9 out of 10 doctors recommend this drug!; and scarcity- hurry, only 10 left! -or limited edition items. We’ve all seen these ploys; we’ve all fallen prey to them. The author gives a few suggestions as to how to prevent yourself from doing so in the future. Basically it comes down to being willing to break social rules, like the one of reciprocity. One must remember to think about every interaction where someone wants something from you, rather than running on auto pilot. It’s an interesting book. Not only does Cialdini have a lot of studies to back up his thesis, but he’s an entertaining writer. "

Reciprocation: we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.Ex: For the ladies, if a guy takes you out to an expensive dinner, you feel obligated to go out with him again even though you weren’t that into him.2. Commitment & Consistency: Desire to be (and to appear) consistent with what we have already done.Ex: You stay married, even though divorce may be the best option, because you’ve made a public commitment “til death do us part”.3. Social Proof: Everyone else is doing it, so I’ll do it too.Ex: You’re at a bar and your 4 friends order margaritas, so you do the same.4. Authority: People tend to follow authority figuresEx: Titles (PhD, Esq, MBA, etc.)5. Liking: We prefer to say yes to the requests of people we know and like. Some attributes to like is:A) Physical Attractiveness B) SimilarityC) ComplimentsD) Contact: We like things that are familiar to us. On the other hand, we often fear what we don’t know.Ex: Contact is one reason people try to eat at the same restaurants over and over and over again instead of trying a new place. E) Cooperation: We like people who work with us, instead of against us.Ex: Sports teamsF) Conditioning & Association: Whomever you root for represents YOU; and when he wins, YOU win.  Ex:  People says “WE won!!” when their team wins, but they say “THEY lost!!” when their team loses??6. Scarcity: Opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limitedEx: Deadlines — An official time limit is placed on the customer’s opportunity to get the offer. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are great examples."
49,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24336679-kris-muir,5,"Are you curious about how you are influenced by others? Do you wonder if you could implement compliance strategies more effectively?Yesterday I finished reading Robert Cialdini's seminal book ""Influence."" It's been on my reading list for a year based on recommendations from Shane Parrish (Farnam Street) as well as being one of the top 20 books of Charlie Munger (Berkshire Hathaway). Cialdini's book employs well-chosen research studies and descriptive anecdotes to underscore the fundamental psychological ""weapons of influence"" that impact our decisions on a daily basis. In his words, the most important triggers for influencing others are ""commitments, opportunities for reciprocation, the compliant behavior of similar others, feelings of liking or friendship, authority directives, and scarcity information.""To me, Cialdini's ""Influence"" represents many of the ideas of two great books that I have read in recent years, Daniel Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" and Daniel Pink's ""To Sell is Human."" If you haven't read any of these, then I suggest reading them in this order: Pink > Cialdini > Kahneman.Happy Reading!"
50,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64716875-isaac-perdomo,5,"This book will help you influence others while maintaining ethics at a high standard. It has some insights, stories and research-based arguments that support the author's ideas. Totally worth reading if you are towards a sales, marketing or any leadership role. I suggest you read the book and listen to the audiobook available in YouTube every now and then.Here are the six principles in a nutshell:- Reciprocity				 “You are obligated to give back others the form of behavior that they have given to you”	- Scarcity A less-available item or information is more desired and more valued than a available one.- Authority You are more likely to comply to someone with major authority than yours. If they have  achieved that level they must be experts and trustable.	- Consensus / Social Proof “Very frequently, people can accurately decide what is appropriate to do by examining what  others like them are doing”- Commitment & Consistency	“Human nature wants to be or appear to be consistent with what they’ve already done”- Friendship & Liking	We are most likely to say “yes” to someone we know and like."
51,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34084870-amanda,5,"I greatly enjoyed this book talking about the psychology of persuasion. In the beginning he talked about how a mother turkey did not kill a chicken-hawk baby because of it's ability to mimic the cry of the other turkey babies, but if a turkey chick did not make a sound, the mama turkey would get rid of the quiet baby. It was fascinating to hear all the different tactics that are used to get us to react the way others want us to. One example he used was the laughter reel on live tv shows that actors do not particularly like, but it's to make us laugh even when the jokes may not be funny.He had spoken about how others need to see the reactions of those around them in situations where they are unsure in how to respond. Something that stood out was when he told the story of being in the accident and the drivers continued to drive by, assuming that others would try to help in this situation, so he had to grab one person's attention and make them responsible to get the assistance he needed. I highly recommend this book to find out in what ways we are being influenced on a daily basis. Great read!"
52,006124189X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4303154-julie,4,"Really interesting book, although I think 200 pages would have worked better than 300. The anecdotes are useful to show how these techniques can be used against you but it felt a bit too long toward the end. It's a really good book though. Every chapter describes a different way our instincts can be used and abused by scammers, or just as bad how sometimes we mislead ourselves all on our own. The chapter on social proof was particularly scary: when we are uncertain of the situation we look to strangers for what is the right thing to do, when in fact it's just what they're doing too and so we might let someone die at our feet and walk right past them because if no one else is doing anything, it must not be important.Most beneficially, every chapter ends with a section on ""how to say no"" or generally recognise moments when it might be be wise not to trust our instincts, while acknowledging how difficult that can be. I think these sections will be worth a regular re-read."

Each social tactic is explained thoroughly and he uses a lot of stories as well as his own experiments to back it up. I love how he peppers his anecdotes with his sense of humor (""Looking somewhat embarrassed because his father seemed to be raving while inexplicably soaking his socks in a small puddle and waving his shoes around..."")You'll kick yourself every time he points out how you've fallen for an influence tactic and didn't even know it."
