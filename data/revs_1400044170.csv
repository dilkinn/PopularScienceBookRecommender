I'm sorry, because the subject is fascinating; and sorry because Louise Gilder is obviously an intelligent scholar. But for some reason she decided to write this history as a series of conversations – and it's this determined quirk that put my teeth on edge from the start. Here's an example from p. 103:""We have always said so glibly,"" Heisenberg told his frustration, or the trees, or Bohr, or Einstein, ""that the path of the electron in the cloud chamber can be observed."" He turned to see his footprints among the frost, and he thought of the electron shooting through the cloud chamber, leaving its footprints of dew behind, small condensed clouds. ""But perhaps,"" he continued slowly, ""what we really observed was something much less. Perhaps"" – he was walking faster now, his breath, like the electron, leaving clouds behind him....Yikes. This isn't history; it's an awkward fictionalization, a conceit that collapses science into an entangled pile of clichés."
1,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52734344-nate-hansen,4,"Very, very good. Gilder does an excellent job of capturing the personality, fervor, and excitement of a bunch of men who reinvented the universe. This book gives a cogent and smart account of how we got some very complex ideas. Read it."
2,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/825885-mazola1,4,"In The Age of Entanglement, Louisa Gilder sketches and humanizes one of the most baffling ideas of modern science -- the concept of entanglement in quantum mechanics. Einstein famously called entanglement ""spooky action-at-a distance, and battled fruitlessly for the last two decades of his life to rebut it. Entanglement implies that particles, even if separated by large distances, can ""communicate"" with each other simultaneously. It also implies that photons, electrons, atoms, indeed all matter, including such things as baseballs and cars, behave as both particles and waves, that particles can just pop into existence, and that things may have no reality until measured or observed. These concepts fly in the face of many of the underlying pillars of classical physics, as well as some of the most firmly rooted ideas of our ordinary life, such as causation, the flow of time, and that cause precedes effect. Quantum mechanics is full of weirdness, such as faster than light propagation of information and that two observers can each observe the same event as occurring before the other observer observes it.In In The Age of Entanglement, Gilder illuminates entanglement through imagined or reconstructed conversations between the physicists who created the edifice of quantum mechanics. Using the diaries, notebooks, books and recollections of those physicists and their friends, collegues and families, Gilder draws a compelling picture of the history of an idea and the frustration and angst it caused in those who developed it.The weirdness of quantum mechanics and its impact on the psyches of those who tried to understand it, which is a central idea of this book, is well summed up by what Richard Feynman had to say in an oft-quoted remark: ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" Feynman explained that in quantum mechanics, ""our imagination is stretched to the utmost -- not, as in fiction, to imagine things which are not really there, but just to comprehend those things which are there."" Warning that these things are difficult to understand (surely an understantement) Feynman said:""But the difficulty really is psychological and exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to yourslef, 'But how can it be like that?' -- which is a reflection of an uncontrolled and utterly vain desire to see it in terms of something familiar....Do not keep saying to yourself, 'But how can it be like that?' because you will get 'down the drain,' into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped."" As In The Age of Entanglement makes clear, many brilliant physicists, including the leading lights of quantum mechanics, could not resist exploring those blind alleys. The book explores their frustrations in trying to make sense of that which makes no sense and so violently conflicts with the world of classical physics in which we all live. This tension is made ironically and delightfully clear in Gilder's recountings of the conversations between the physicists, in which the most arcane and almost mystical ideas are given equal weight with the mundane actions of those who express them, who eat, walk and fiddle with their pipes even as they discuss the deepest mysteries of the universe. In The Age of Entanglement won't make you understand quantum physics any better, but it will make you understand better the physists who struggled so hard to understand (and sometimes to evade) the meaning of their own ideas. "
3,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"Gilder chose an interesting way to relate material that is often unrelatable. Many famous physicists are known for asserting that no one understands quantum physics. My favorite Feynman quote is, ""There was a time when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of relativity. I do not believe there ever was such a time. There might have been a time when only one man did, because he was the only guy who caught on, before he wrote his paper. But after people read the paper a lot of people understood the theory of relativity in some way or other, certainly more than twelve. On the other hand, I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.""Considering this, Gilder did a truly fantastic job of walking the reader through the history of the entanglement. Told using evidence such as memoirs, correspondence, and notes, this book reads almost like historical fiction. And this story was beautifully told. I am still waiting for a book that makes it perfectly clear. But so is everyone else......"
4,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374596-blarg,4,"(This is a cross-post of my review at http://thebartbooks.blogspot.com/2009...)“This quantum question is so uncommonly important and difficult that it should concern everyone.”-- Albert Einstein, 1908.The concepts of quantum mechanics have fascinated me for a great many years. I’ve read dozens of books on the subject but am no closer to grasping the concepts underlying a mystery that perplexed Einstein himself until the day he died.Einstein spent his entire life wrestling with the issues raised by the initial discovery of quantum mechanics in the year 1900. He was never really able to move past his initial frustration with the fact that under certain physical circumstances, two individual subatomic particles, far apart from each other, act in concert with each other in a way that violates all known explanations.These two particles seem to influence each other simultaneously and remotely; communicating with each other by an unknown mechanism that would far exceed the speed of light.Einstein ridiculed this phenomenon as “spooky action-at-a-distance” and called it “a sort of telepathic coupling” in his initial efforts to argue that someone must have had a few too many drinks down at the lab.The phenomenon has since been proven to exist and this book is the true story of the people who spent (and are spending) their lives studying quantum mechanics, spooky action-at-a-distance, and are trying to make sense of it all. I really hope they figure it out in our lifetime because it is 100% guaranteed to be a jaw dropping revision to our sense of reality. [For a (relatively) quick overview of quantum entanglement, this entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy does as good a job of any on the web: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-...]What may be in store for us is a shock as big as the one that came to the citizens of Flatland in one of my absolute favorite books: The very brief (less than 50 pages) story of Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions, by Edwin Abbott.In Flatland, Abbott describes a world of people who live in a two dimensional world – a flat plane -- where men are polygons and women are line segments. They have no concept of up or down. And then, one day, a three dimensional sphere visits them and it rocks their world as it demonstrates how what they see in two dimensions is proof of a third dimension.Such a world-rocking is likely somewhere in our future, and some very smart folks (string theorists) think that many additional dimensions exist and that all matter (and especially those spooky particles) is connected through one of those other dimensions.At first, The Age of Entanglement was not at all what I wanted, because I was hoping for an account of the latest breakthroughs in the field and a description of new quantum theories. Instead I found myself reading a historical account of the characters, featuring a fictionalized recreation of their conversations. (The author drew on actual letters and speeches by the scientists in her effort to recreate various conversations.)After the initial frustration at this artifice I found myself captivated by the story of how Einstein, Schrödinger, Oppenheimer, von Neumann, Bohm, Feynman, and of course Bell devoted much of their lives to thinking about and discussing the phenomenon of quantum entanglement.Put another way, I did not want to learn about the historical context of their respective efforts and how they overlapped and interacted with each other. But I’m glad I did.I recommend this book only to people who have a strong interest not only in quantum mechanics but in the stories of the scientists whose lives were and are tangled up in its concepts. Those folks will likely enjoy it a great deal. "
5,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,4,"Why did it take so long to discover entanglement after quantum mechanics was developed? This question is examined in light of the personalities of the scientists and the conversations between them. As for the physics itself, consider this comment about the Schrödinger equation:""The wave function ψ described an electron in in three dimensions: perfect. But it described a pair of electrons as a single wave in six dimensions: nonsense.""Nonsense was the prevailing point of view at the time, which was ""fixed"" by Max Born interpreting the equation as the probability of finding the particle somewhere. Entanglement, the theme of the book, is defined right in the equation - two particles are part of the same wave. But what about the six dimensions? Perhaps we have two 3-dimensional universes? Strangely this ""many worlds"" interpretation of quantum mechanics is barely mentioned in the book.The delay in discovering entanglement is attributed to Niels Bohr and his philosophy that it is not possible to understand what is happening in quantum mechanics and it is even wrong to try. Worse was the notion of the observer actually being essential to any observation, as opposed to the observation requiring interaction of the particle with photons, affecting the result. John Bell is quoted as asking, ""Was the wave function of the world waiting to jump for billions of years until a single celled living creature appeared? Or did it have to wait a little longer for a better system with a PhD?"" Niels Bohr's powerful personality ensured that most physicists accepted his view, and that which he said cannot be questioned was not questioned. Again, Bell says of those who did question, ""Their arguments were not refuted, they were simply trampled on."" Blinded by this philosophy, Bohr's followers ignored the evidence for entanglement. It was the skeptic Albert Einstein who identified it in his famous 1935 ""EPR"" paper. He tried to defend realism by showing that QM was flawed by predicting spooky action at a great distance, faster than light can travel. But even Einstein was dismissed and ignored for many decades. A more forceful defense of realism in QM can be found in The Beginning of Infinity by physicist David Deutch.Perhaps the central character in the book is John Bell, also a fierce defender of realism. In his spare time, because no one else cared, he explored the EPR result and developed his Bell's Inequality. This mathematically proved that the results of quantum mechanics are not compatible with ""locality"". Thus two particles far apart can be instantaneously connected, just as the Schrödinger equation suggests. We can keep realism only if we accept action at a distance.The book ends the same way as Erwin Schrodinger and the Quantum Revolution by John Gribbin, though I think Gribbin did a better job of it. In general, the book does better for giving a feel for how the process of science works than explain the science itself. It is insightful how undue deference to authority and a circular philosophy that inhibits questioning and understanding can delay the advance of science for decades. I am glad I read this book."
6,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1758252-david,4,"""If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself."" - Albert EinsteinEven after reading this book, I don't understand quantum physics - but that wasn't the author's purpose. She focused on the history of the research and the relationships between the scientists. This book isn't for everyone. You don't have to know a lot of math or physics, but I can't imagine you would enjoy this book without a significant math and physics background. In case you aren't going to read it, here are some things you might be interested in:1. A lot of the book was based on letters written by the scientists to each other. No one writes letters anymore - does that mean we won't have a record of what people are thinking anymore? Or will emails serve the same purpose?2. Sometimes we have an unrealistic view of how new scientific knowledge is obtained. You know, someone comes up with a theory and the other scientists work together to do experiments to prove or disprove the theory. In reality there are arguments between scientists, jealousy, politics, premature consensus - everything imperfect humans struggle with."
7,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10812329-hershel-shipman,5,Great history of quantum mechanics till about the last decade. As usual for books of the type it mentions subjects very close to my interest area and adds significantly to my reading list
8,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5952398-ed,5,"In 1989, the year before he died, John Bell gave the ""speech of his career"" to his fellow physicists, taking issue with the standard interpretation of quantum physics: ""It would seem that the theory is exclusively concerned about 'results of measurement' and has nothing to say about anything else. What exactly qualifies some physical systems to play the role of 'measurer'? Was the wavefunction of the world waiting to jump for thousands of millions of years until a single-celled living creature appeared? Or did it have to wait a little longer, for some better qualified system...with a Ph.D.? If the theory is to apply to anything but highly idealized laboratory operations, are we not obliged to admit that more or less 'measurement-like' processes are going on more or less all the time, more or less everywhere?"" In The Age of Entanglement, Louisa Gilder presents us with quantum physics not as a textbook abstraction, but as a vigorous debate among brilliant men and women trying to make sense of the most baffling of mysteries. Gilder has performed a great service by assembling a vast collection of letters, conversations, speeches and anecdotes to tell this story in a fascinating way. Over many years of contentious theorizing and difficult experimentation, physicists came to grips with the implications of quantum mechanics: either little things are not fully real until they are observed by big things like us (the view attacked by Bell); or maybe they are real in some mysterious way, entangled in a hidden web of nonlocal connections. Quantum physics challenges the traditional scientific view of a world consisting of separate, independently existing objects exerting forces on one another from point to point to point in space. I suggest that readers without a lot of familiarity with quantum physics have handy a book which explains the physics a little more clearly, such as Rosenblum and Kuttner's Quantum Enigma. The strength of Gilder's book is less in its explanations than its storytelling. For that, it is a great read. "
9,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6281322-sara-jamshidi-zelenberg,2,"I felt a little frustrated with this book. First, let me say that it is such a great idea. Exploring the history of the theory of quantum mechanics via the difficulties surrounding entanglement is brilliant. I also think this book does a good job discussing some of the serious personal and political dramas these researchers faced (e.g. the rise of the Nazis and the second red scare in the US). That being said, I didn't like that the science was often skipped. When it wasn't, I thought it was confusing (with the one exception of quantum information at the end). Maybe that's unavoidable with this topic? Perhaps this book is best meant for physicists interested in the history of the subject. I think a general audience would find this book boring and, therefore, difficult to finish.All in all, I don't regret reading it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone outside of physics. "
10,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51530871-johns,5,"What were you doing seven years out of college? Writing a page-turner, science history book like this one? No slacker she, Louisa Gilder was polishing off this page-turning narrative of ninety-six years of the development of the Quantum Theory. You'll need to read parts of this book three times to understand the mysterious science displayed here . . . but keep at it: the intellectual rewards provided by this book are real and lasting. I'm eager to read her next work and appreciate the hours of mental enlargement she gave me through reading this stunning history. "
11,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93145680-alison-berry,5,"I loved this book when I read it several years ago, and enjoyed it even more on a recent reread. The author does a masterful job of weaving human characters, personalities, and historic background together with the revolutionary ideas the protagonists were pursuing. The physical and quantum mechanical concepts are very well explained. This is one of my favorite books and I look forward to more from this author."
12,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66014608-jon-thomas,5,I have a layman's fascination with quantum mechanics. I loved this book because it introduced me to the concepts in quantum mechanics in an understandable way and it is a charming story of the interaction between the great physicists of the 20th century. 
13,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3490714-reese,5,"I read this book a few years ago. But I liked it so much that I have gone back to it from time to time to reread some of the more interesting sections and chapters. As someone who wanted to be a physicist or astronomer when I was in high school, but eventually went in other directions, I have had a lifelong fascination with both. Some reviewers have complained that this book did not explain the science thoroughly enough. However, that was not the main purpose of the book, and since most physicists who even work in this field would agree with Richard Feynman on the difficulty of truly understanding quantum physics, I think Louisa Gilder was very wise to approach the subject the way she did. She did a masterful job in bringing to life many of the central players in the story. She also put the long running debates and collaborations among the scientists who were in the thick of things in historical context as quantum physics began and was developed. It is true that the second half of the book is a more sustained and continuous story of the exploration of entanglement itself, as compared to the first half of the book, during which this major question kept popping up but was mostly ignored. The first half moves around more in time, and covers the contributions of a fairly large number of physicists to the discoveries of quantum physics. But I do not agree with some of the reviewers here who think the first half of the book is too disjointed or confusing. The nature of the beast itself (quantum physics) is what is quite confusing. I would say that Ms Gilder's partly fictionalized account of the early discoveries, questions, conversations, speculations, and debates reads like a novel and could be quite helpful to anyone who wants to learn more about this history and have a better understanding of who the players were and the arguments, collaborations, and other interactions that went on between these giants of 20th Century physics. It is very creative and engaging story telling."
14,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9249371-shockvalue,3,"The concept of taking fragments of meetings, papers and conversations and creating a historical-fiction from it to teach us about both the physicists and their concepts was an interesting idea. It gave an entertaining view of how we got from here to there introducing many of the main players along the way. However, it didn't excel at either being a biography of any particular physicist, nor delving into their theories deeply enough to make me understand them. I guess it's kind of like one of those ""Survey"" courses with an interesting historical-fiction twist."
15,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3346363-matt-heavner,4,"A fantastic human and scientific history of quantum mechanics. The author obviously (and admittedly) took a large number of liberties on the ""details"" of historic conversations, but it humanized the history in a very nice way. I found it somewhat repetitive, but this is realistic - once someone coins a good turn of phrase, they tend to use it several times. I haven't read a ""human history of quantum"" in a while, but this is one of the best from those I remember."
16,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7236883-vishal,4,Fantastic read. Rich narrative and vivid description of a complete arc of epic debates in the Physics community helps unveil the curtain on how the biggest and now mainstream ideas came to be despite all the struggle and long periods of being profoundly misunderstood.

19,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875081-arvind-balasundaram,5,"In this fascinating account of the topsy-turvy world of quantum mechanics, Louisa Gilder conveys the attempt of the human imagination to logically wrestle with the sometimes bizarre, as experienced and narrated by the theories' most famous protagonists. Relying almost entirely on actual conversational material between these scientists, or else the correspondence between them, this book provides a glimpse into how physics experienced a transformational change as the everyday perceptual world and its supporting assumptions collapsed quickly as science delved into the world of the extremely small.The dual particle/wave theories of matter and its associated mathematics led to a seemingly puzzling conclusion - that subatomic particles are dominated by 'entanglement' - a process that begins when two such particles interact, and then forever lose their separated existence. Irrespective of the distance that separates them, the tweaking of one particle produces an instant response in the other, a conclusion that Einstein termed ""spooky action at a distance"". This book cogently summarizes how the smartest scientists at the forefront of developing these theories struggled to make sense of its implications.The beauty of Gilder's approach is that by resorting to actual written or spoken material, the reader is transported into the instant of the dialogue and becomes a passive participant in the exchange. As a result, one experiences the deepest levels of frustration these scientists felt, either in accepting a colleague's interpretation or in the stubbornness of their own world views. ""You are the only person with whom I am actually willing to come to terms,"" laments Einstein in a letter to his contemporary, Schrodinger, ""Almost all the other fellows do not look from the facts to the theory but from the theory to the facts; they cannot get out of the network of already accepted concepts; instead, comically, they only wriggle about inside'.This account brilliantly combines as a work of history, an intermediate course in quantum mechanics, as well as a biography of scientific personalities, all comprehensively elucidated in a single work. Developments and theories like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and Schrodinger's wavefunction collapse get prominent coverage, but with the often missing mental map of what the discoverers were going through before enunciating these to a broader audience. ""We have always said so glibly,"" recorded a not-so-sure Heisenberg, ""that the path of an electron in the cloud chamber can be observed. But perhaps what we really observed was something much less. We merely saw a series of discrete and ill-defined spots through which the electron had passed. In fact, all we do see in the cloud chamber are individual water droplets which must certainly be larger than an electron. The right question should therefore be: Can quantum mechanics represent the fact that an electron finds itself approximately in a given place and that it moves approximately with a given velocity, and can we make these approximations so close that they do not cause experimental difficulties?""An additional contribution made by Gilder is the inclusion of several concluding chapters that take the history of quantum exploration into the more recent work of scientists like Bohm and Bell. Gilder presents an exhaustive review of the thinking and debates that broke out following the publication of the well-known EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) paper in 1935; the introduction of hidden variables by David Bohm, that finally culminated in the famous inequality of Bell that restricts the extent to which two unconnected particles can be correlated. Experiments by Alain Aspect, and more recently, by Greenberger, Horne, and Zellinger (all elegantly summarized by Gilder) conclusively established that quantum mechanics routinely violates the requirements established by Bell's Theorem. Finally, quantum entanglement had been definitively established. In the final chapter, Gilder briefly introduces the reader to the world of quantum computing and how information transfer processes, especially in cryptographic science, eerily parallel quantum happenings and interactions.This is a work of monumental importance in the documentation of quantum histories, while simultaneously tackling scientific concepts usually out of reach for the layperson. The account leaves the reader convinced that the quantum pioneers were similarly in much doubt about the implied structure of reality stemming from their theories, even if fluent in advanced physics and mathematics. Some of them, like Einstein, went to their graves remaining disbelievers in spooky action at a distance forces. In today's world of instant quantum teleportation, Gilder's account takes a quantum leap backward into the laboratories and conversations of its earliest champions. This work is a mind-boggling accomplishment, that will leave its readers begging for more... "
20,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492668-mark,3,"Quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of entanglement, where particles that are created together or exist in close proximity have certain basic features (their quantum state) which either cannot be described independently of each other or do not exist independently of each other even if the particles become separated by an arbitrarily large distance, are very complex topics. I don't know if you can really learn any basic thing about them by reading this book.The author has attempted to write a conceptual history of the idea of entanglement. She describes her technique in the preface, creating dialogues from the famous participants remembered spoken comments and their contemporary relevant written comments. The result is interesting, but much of it is not very closely related to her topic and, since it is mostly just mention of arguments among the discoverers/creators of quantum physics without the mathematics, it can be somewhat vacuous. Some of the dialogues, especially the historically earlier ones, read like a bad play.The book is structured around a particular discovery or concept of a famous Scottish physicist named John Bell, called Bell’s theorem or Bell’s inequality. This theorem or inequality is mentioned fairly frequently in the book, but descriptions are vague. It is probably an impossible task to explain this topic to a large mathematically naive readership. The problem is, of course, quantum theory itself. As Chris Fuchs is quoted in the book, When I was in junior high school, I sat down with Martin Gardner's book 'Relativity for the Million' and came away with an understanding of the subject that sustains me even today. The concepts were strange to my everyday world, but they were clear enough that I could get a grasp of them knowing little more mathematics than arithmetic. One should expect nothing less for a proper foundation to the quantum. Until we can explain the essence of the theory to a junior high school student ... –the essence, not the mathematics – and have them walk away with a deep lasting memory, I well believe we will have not understood a thing about quantum foundations.The author’s analogies and explanations are sometimes lacking, for example when she feels the need to parenthetically define a function as (part of an equation), but the original Einstein gedanken experiment that was later described in the EPR paper, and some of the recent experiments in entanglement are well described.None of this means that there isn’t a lot of interesting stuff here, mostly about the physicists' interactions and private lives. One approach might be to read this book as a supplement to another more technical one on quantum physics. I found reading the Wikipedia entries on quantum entanglement and Bell’s theorem to be very helpful."
21,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18276334-wolfgang,3,"History of the development of the Quantum Theory.The book takes an unusual approach of recounting the history by letting all the main actors speak. The dialogs between Rutherford, Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, Pauli etc etc have been derived from letters, biographies and other sources.The idea is great to tell this story through the words of the main players. However, the way Louisa has done is VERY uneven.The first half recounts the early story and ends roughly in the 50's around the time when Einstein dies. This half is extremely choppy, many abrupt context changes and the explanations of the physical phenomena as well as the different theoretical approaches is very confusing. I doubt anybody who hasn't been exposed to this material can make any rhyme or reason out of this. If one is patient, the explanations are refined now and again later and slowly a more digestible picture is emerging. But, to be honest, I wanted to stop reading more than once. What kept me going was the nostalgia of much better accounts of this story that I read in 70's and another review that said at the beginning of the second half, ""the clouds separate and a totally different book starts"".This second half was indeed much better. If you just look at the layout of the text you will notice that there are long paragraphs that indicate a real narrative vs. the choppy first half with many 2-3 line sections.This second half tells the modern story of Quantum Theory, again through the words of the main players and succeeds much better as a ""story"". It brings the history all the way to 2005 and aside from being hard to put down, makes appetite for a much deeper dive into this field. The only weak point of the second half is that again, the explanations of an admittedly complex field, stay very vague and don't really satisfy. But as an appetizer for more, this is great stuff !!"
22,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1766854-george-gilder,5,"Early last century, Einstein and Bohr, the two grand masters of quantum theory, debated its meaning. Einstein declared, based on the clear implications of quantum mathematics, that quantum effects were non local, entailing ""spooky action at a distance,"" correlations at faster than the speed of light, and thus he challenged the completeness and coherence of quantum theory. Bohr responded by citing the correspondence principle, which says that at larger scales quantum phenomena assimilate to classical models, and the principle of complementarity, which asserts that quantum entities can have paradoxical characteristics that are both real but that cannot be reconciled by conventional reasoning.The Age of Entanglement shows that hundreds of experiments conducted over the last thirty years have proven both of these titans wrong. Quantum theory is inexorably non-local by normal standards and it scales across the universe beyond time and space in a phenomenon called entanglement. This fascinating book retells the history of Twentieth Century physics to accommodate the fact that the two greatest quantum theorists were both right and wrong in intriguing ways and tells how entanglement is now manifested in technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.The book reads like a novel, full of dialogs that lead the reader into ever deeper levels of understanding of the great mysteries of physics.GG "
23,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3486245-charles,3,"I really really wanted to like this book a lot. It is copiously, even obcessively referenced. Rather than following each of the giants of quantum thory as independent lines, the author tries to demonstrate the discussions and interdependence of these geniouses, due to training, personality, and creativity. The time covered is from about 1920 to 2006.This is one of the most exciting periods of physics history, fundamentally forcing scientists to question all previous notions of mechanics, and to try to explain the findings that happen at the extremes of time, space, and velocity.The author has taken a wonderful, creative, and original approach, even more impressive as a first book. I applaud her efforts. Her efforts included approachable explaination of some rather indescribable findings (superb job), and to share some puns and other trickery of the conversations and correspondences, many of which were in German (also an excellent job).So, what was missing? Maybe the task is impossible, to explain the unexplainable, to reason the unreasonable, to keep a narrative spirited yet historically correct. I found the book far less exhilerating than I had hoped. The devout science readers and dilitants of physics will appreciate the book, and, perhaps even enjoy it. "
24,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11715243-jesse,4,"I think that my feelings on this book are largely shaped by the fact that I have a PhD in physics. Despite the fact that I know little about the history and development of quantum mechanics (only what you learn in passing by learning quantum mechanics), much of this book still felt familiar. So many of the central figures are characters in physics lore and legend, that they weren't that surprising. Even those I didn't know, I still mostly recognized the names (if only in connection with this equation or that theory or textbook).This was a thoroughly enjoyable book. The premise was a little odd to me, how the history was presented, in these fabricated conversations using real words taken from different bits of primary text. But once I got over that, it felt fairly natural. For me, it was like seeing an old familiar friend. I haven't really done anything with quantum mechanics in years, and this reminded me of a lot of the wonder, and sheer strangeness, that I felt when first learning it.Then again, I can't say as I've ever thought too deeply about it. The book strikes a bit close to home in some regards, since I know that, when it comes to quantum mechanics, I tend to fall in the 'shut up and calculate' camp."
25,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25544144-scott-brooks,1,"I'm not a physicist, but I get the sense that even if I did have the deeper understanding of physics, I'd bet that this book would still leave my head spinning. The problem, for me, was that the author really never wove a strong story throughout the progression of the interesting discoveries within the field of quantum physics. The book jumps around throughout history in a dizzying fashion and fails to center strongly on it's central figures, continuously deviating to the mundane details of each new physics scholar as they enter the spotlight throughout the years. The result is a disjointed telling of the story of ""the quanta"" and an extremely hard read since the book itself suffers so severely from a lack of focus. I would not recommend this title to anyone... I will say that the narrator Walter Dixon makes a valiant effort in telling this oddly woven tale, but alas, even his smooth and steady voice cannot save this gigantic run on sentence / A.D.D. ridden excuse for a book."
26,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/626921-mike-white,3,"The book got much, much better towards the latter half.I didn't like the reconstructed historical conversations of the early players in quantum mechanics (too often it felt like a cut-and-paste substitute for analysis or explanation by the author). Towards the end, when Gilder relied more on her own interviews with scientists, the book became much, much stronger. The second half of the book proves that Gilder can be an excellent science writer.This book would have been better if the author had condensed her section on the early history of quantum mechanics (which has been already been done in many other books, by historians with a better background in the subject) and spent more time explaining the science of entanglement post-Bell theory that she discusses in the second half of the book.For a first book, Gilder has done a decent job, and I'm looking forward to her next one."
27,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185285-shaz-rasul,5,"Gilder manages to weave the science (and its evolution), personalities, and the histories of the day together to present the most extensive (and engrossing) history of quantum physics that I could imagine. Notably, she goes much deeper into the controversies and interplay between the greats, and their intellectual heirs. I particularly liked that she took the work well beyond Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, and Schroedinger - all the way to the present day discussions about quantum computing and encryption.For a non-scientific reader, I may recommend Uncertainty: Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, and the Struggle for the Soul of Science as a warmup for The Age of Entanglement."
28,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052695-jim-good,3,"Told through recreation history where quotes from different scientists are put together and composed as artificial conversations when they historically met. Interesting from that perspective, but can be a little distracting at times. The main concepts in the book are the Bohr and Einstien camps of quantum theory during development and how each side framed their argument and how entanglement and action at a distance have further carried that argument. The discussions are technical and at times required a couple readings to get full understanding but lays the groundwork for today’s science of strings and multi-dimmensional reality. Not recommended for anyone without a science background, but would be a good complement to “Warped Passages”."
29,1400044170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2671549-anastasia-hobbet,4,"I've gone on a cosmology bender in recent months, trying to get beyond my OMG mentality about the subject, and this kind, generous, humane book was a gift. It wasn't easy for me to keep all the personalities separate, but I came to see these famous physicists as a big, happy, quarreling family that I only wish I could be a part of. I'm up for adoption, guys! --And Einstein...well, that's next, a really good biography of The Man. PS: When a cousin visited earlier this summer, I waxed eloquent on my romance with cosmology, going on and on about how inspiring I found it all. He listened with full and generous attention, nodding and smiling, and then told me later that he only realized hours afterward that I wasn't talking about cosmetology."
