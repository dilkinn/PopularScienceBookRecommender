0,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,3,"A decent book on Entanglement. Suffers from my pet peeve in popular science books -- which is repeating lots of material you have read over and over again. You would think that someone coming to a book on Entanglement would have read a few other accounts of quantum mechanics before and doesn't need to re-read the familiar history starting from the Greeks through Planck and Bohr, Heisenberg and the rest of the early pioneers. Or that someone who wants an introduction to quantum mechanics would not want to start with a book that focuses on one aspect. The book also suffers from too much biography, which would be fine if it were not for the fact that it features 20+ scientists -- so that mini-biographies of each weigh down the explication.The second half is interesting, including both theoretical work like Bell's theorem and the experimental tests of it. You can never really understand this material without going through the actual physics (and even then you can't actually understand it), but the shortness of the explication made one suffer a little more than normal in a book of this sort. Plus there was a lot less on applications of entanglement, like encryption, than I might have liked."

2,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7931101-jason,4,"the world of the fast and the small is strange indeed and only a handful of scientific greats have really been able to delve down deep into what it all might mean. in the first half of the book, Aczel introduces the reader to them: Planck, Bohr, Schr√∂dinger, de Broglie - the personalities behind the fabled ""Thirty Years that Shook Physics"" and the concepts that disquieted Einstein himself. the second half tells the story of the major research on quantum entanglement between then and now as well as touching on possible technologies that may emerge from that research in the future.Aczel, a scientist himself, keeps the speculation grounded in math and science. this is exactly what one should do when faced with a topic as heady as spooky action at a distance between entangled particles. even if the concept of entanglement itself remains elusive, the story of how we achieved any understanding at all of it is fascinating."
3,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1171690-stan-paulsen,4,"I think more than a few entangled photons whooooshed right over my head while reading this book. Still I was spellbound with what I did understand. I loved learning about all the physicists that contributed to quantum theory and the experiments they designed and performed. I had some trouble following some of those experiments, however, but the ones I did understand were absolutely fascinating.Einstein was right, this stuff is spooky, but how very interesting! If it weren't for all of the rigorous data behind ""the most successful theory in science"" I would have trouble believing entanglement is nothing more than the rantings of a bunch of really smart crackpots. The reality is more bizarre than what even the best mad scientists can come up with. "

5,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076331-ergun-coruh,2,"I first came across the bizarre quantum phenomenon known as ""Entanglement"" while reading a book called The Large, the Small and the Human Mind by Roger Penrose, then I lost it at some point. In desperation I started to search other resources and found this book called ENTANGLEMENT: The Greatest Mystery in Physics by science author Amir Aczel. Aczel describes Quantum Entanglement as follows:""Entanglement is a superposition state of the states of two or more particles, taken as one system. Spatial separation as we know it seems to evaporate with respect to such system. Two particles that can be miles, or light years, apart may behave in a concerted way: what happens to one of them happens to the other one instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them. ""Good book, served the purpose, certainly enhanced my understanding of Quantum Entanglement. However scientific flow was frequently disrupted by lengthy life stories of Physicists. Thereby the focus was lost and reading became excruciatingly hard -one wonders could this be more of a science history book rather than a book about Entanglement-. Also some of experiments weren't explained well despite pictures. 2.5 out of 5."

Beware, you need a strong mind for science and logic, otherwise this book will smash your brain. Hmm... can teleportation be possible? This book, for the first half, has a lot of history about the theory."
7,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90147-sarah,3,"I have read more interesting and thorough explanations of entanglement, but this serves as a decent introduction to the phenomenon. Aczel never, ever should have described the physicists in question as being ""entangled"" with each other - way too cheesy and the meaning of the quantum phenomenon gets undermined. Any decent editor would have prevented such a thing. Also, it seems to me to be common knowledge that Grete Hermann called Neumann out for false assumptions before anyone else had the guts, or cleverness, to, and yet, she gets no mention in this book. That is a huge, unforgivable oversight."
8,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6733229-bennett-coles,2,"Promising a discussion on one of the most fascinating topics in modern physics, this book disappoints. It takes the reader through the usual ""history of modern physics"" in order to set the stage, but then it just becomes a series of biographies of 20th century physicists who happened to work on the question of entanglement. Only in the last few pages does this book actually talk about the fact that entanglement has been proven as reality, and virtually no space is given to discussing what it might actually mean. Maybe I was just looking for something else, but this book unfortunately comes up very light on substance."

I understood little of the subject matter, i.e., the 'entanglement phenomena' of quantum theory; but the author presented the material in such a way that I found the threads that bound the scientific/historical discovery of the concept of 'entanglement' in theoretical physics absolutely fascinating. I am a lay person, not at all versed in the fields of science or mathematics, yet I shall be reading additional works by Amir Aczel. "
10,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086104-randal-samstag,4,A book by a mathematician who has retired to writing popular books about mathematics and science. I got it out of the Seattle Public Library. A good popular introduction to the strange science of entanglement. Seek more and you will be even more puzzled.
11,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91261074-chris-esposo,5,"A really good book introducing the subject of entanglement. The first 2 hours go through a basic history of Quantum Mechanics, but provides some interesting vignettes of Plank, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, and Von Neumann. 2 fun facts I pulled away from this part: Plank, like Einstein, didn't ever believe Quantum theory was anything more than a statistical approximation, and he came about his name-sake constant purely through empirical means. He never realized it may end up being a universal invariant. Second interesting fact on the fathers of QT, Schrodinger was a chronic philanderer, who had an illegitimate child, who himself fathered a noted particle physicist many years later.From here, the book focuses on the real meat of the subject matter, namely Bell's Inequality, and the mathematical and experimental results predicting this finding. As a subject matter layman myself, it is deeply striking to learn the fact that both the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the Bell Inequality, are simple extensions of properties of Hilbert Spaces as the author demonstrates in the text. Hilbert spaces are a type of abstract algebra in pure mathematics.According to the author, the algebraic structures that show these results are the Non-commutativity of operator products for the Uncertainty principle, and a proof that no dispersion free states exist in Hilbert Spaces of dimensions greater than or equal to 3, for Bell's inequality. I have not done the proof by hand myself, so I'll take his word on that. Unfortunately, besides broadly stating what a dispersion-free state is, which he summarizes as a state with only non-stochastic components, not much is explained about how they are derived/defined with respect to Hilbert Spaces. This is where I suspect a proper textbook on QM would come in handy.Despite the failure in some of the descriptive details, these two results should strike the listener to their core. The fact that the corpus of QM can be fitted into such a neat/clean mathematical structure, is a prime example of the often quoted ""unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics"" from Eugene Wigner. In fact, as the author states int he book, QM is accurate up to numerical precision of 40 decimal places for behaviours of objects less than 10 nanometers. It's also never been inconsistent with any experimentation up to now.The consistency of the theory with empirical data is no small feat, as there are many subjects and theories that attempt to extend from pure abstraction but fail miserably when corresponding to real data. Mathematical economics comes principally to mind when thinking of examples. There, one has a subject that front-loads much more abstraction than QM, or even QFT, or any of the modern day iterations of those ideas, and yet can scarcely claim any predictive power whatsoever. That subject is almost a total failure as a predictive science in its purported domain. The fact that the founders of QM extended a theory from abstraction to reality, while maintaining empirical consistency, will remain a rare jewel in human knowledge for some time I suspect.Some, however, would contend that this is an anachronistic characterization, as linear algebra and quantum theory are contemporaneous. Therefore, the abstract algebra which founds the Hilbert Space Theory came after the experimental findings of QM. So one would be hard-pressed to claim that QM sprung forth from pure abstraction. This may be true about the Uncertainty Principle, although, it should be noted that Heisenberg independently derived matrix algebra, and the Linear Algebra was developed often unknown to early 20th century physicists. However, it doesn't seem to be true about the Bell Inequality, and the corresponding proof, establishing that entanglement was an actual physical phenomenon.This book goes over a lot of the above discussion and much more, including the scientific and philosophical discussions of the EPR paradox, and how this motivated the study of entanglement. This was itself posed as a sort of proof by contradiction from Einstein, Rosen, and Podolsky. This book is really, a fascinating history of these ideas. In the end, Einstein could not jettison the notion of scientific realism to accept non-locality, entanglement, or QM, as a whole. A bit tragic, as it may come about that his EPR Pair paper might end up being his most impactful work in the grander context of modern science. In summary, this book would serve an excellent supplement and guidebook for a more technical text, as it does delve fairly deeply for a lay text into the actual mechanics of QM. It puts many abstract and experimental results into historical context and time order, which I believe helps one learn the material. Highly recommend"
12,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67541301-kamarul-mansur,4,"Author starts his book with biographies of huge names of physicists, pioneers with their experiments and new discoveries in the world of physics. These are who has contributed to the search for particle entanglement. The author managed to explain what entanglement is from different view. Moving forward, the author talked about findings and experiments that in the end leads to the proof of particle entanglement. Although this book is more about the history of physics, some basic physics knowledge such as Young‚Äôs Experiments, Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the duality (particle / wave) needed before one is to dive his nose in this book by someone who is not familiar at all. But, don‚Äôt worry about having a slightest idea of it all. Do continue reading till the end because the author will discuss the actual meaning of this ‚Äúspooky‚Äù Entanglement / quantum physics."

Entanglement's early chapters provide some of the best explanations I have ever encountered of the entanglement phenomena as well as some other quantum mechanical concepts. However, later sections of the book get bogged down in minutiae. The authors covers various experiments in far too much detail to hold my attention. By the end, I felt I knew all I wanted to know about entanglement . . . and quite a bit more."

17,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107959714-irina-goldberg,5,Excellent book! It had me on the edge of my seat!
18,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10145524-charles-daney,5,"The author, one of my Facebook friends, died almost one year ago. This is one of his best books. Amir, like the fine science writer he was, covered a diversity of topics well ‚Äì including my favorite, mathematics. I enjoyed his Fermat's Last Theorem: Unlocking the Secret of an Ancient Mathematical Problem, even though it's a bit short and superficial ‚Äì and he confused elliptic curves and elliptic functions. (A common error.) I'm looking forward to reading My Search for Ramanujan: How I Learned to Count, which Amir co-authored with Ken Ono. Since Ono is a world-class expert on topics that interested Ramanujan, such as partition theory, their book should be excellent.Like all books Amir wrote himself, Entanglement is at an elementary level, intended for general readers. I think it does an excellent job with the subject matter. There are, however, better books on the subject of quantum entanglement for readers who are more conversant with quantum mechanics, such as Nicolas Gisin's Quantum Chance: Nonlocality, Teleportation and Other Quantum Marvels, which I reviewed here. Gisin led a group that performed a key experiment that verified the nonlocal character of quantum entanglement. That experiment receives a whole (short) chapter in Amir's book. But what may be the most noteworthy aspect of the book reviewed here is that it also describes several other very important experiments on entanglement, of which I don't know any other treatment at the elementary level. Among these is a fairly detailed treatment of ""triple entanglement"". That involves three entangled particles instead of the much more usual two. It's an important experiment, since it clearly demonstrates the inherent non-locality of quantum entanglement, without having to rely on Bell's Theorem.Amir's book starts out slowly and covers all the usual history of quantum mechanics, from Planck and Einstein onward. This includes the customary topics, such as the contributions of Bohr, Heisenberg, de Broglie, Schr√∂dinger, von Neumann, Dirac, Bohm, and Wheeler. This early history occupies the first half of the book, so that readers who're already familiar with the history may become impatient to get to the more recent ""good stuff"".Erwin Schr√∂dinger discovered the phenomenon of entanglement, and considered it the most significant aspect of quantum mechanics. He wrote ""Entanglement is not one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics."" Entanglement depends on another aspect of quantum mechanics, ""superposition"", which had been discovered earlier. The two terms should not be confused even though they are closely related. Superposition is the strange property that one or more quantum particles may have, in which the particles can actually be in multiple potentially observable simple states at the same time. (This property is what makes quantum computers possible and interesting.) Two particles that have interacted at one point in time can be in a joint state that is a superposition of states of both particles. In this case, the particles may be ""entangled"", so that a measurement of one particle will instantaneously determine what will be measured of the other particle, even if the two are millions of light-years apart when measured.Obviously, this is quite a peculiar phenomenon, and it sorely perplexed Einstein. Nevertheless, it has been rigorously verified numerous times since the 1970s. The details of many of these experiments occupy the second half of Amir's book. This part of the book requires much more careful reading than the first half, but it's well worth the effort. If one has any interest in learning about recent practical aspects of quantum technology ‚Äì such as quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation ‚Äì these are the details that one needs to develop a good understanding of. A reader can feel confident of the book's accuracy in dealing with these topics, since the author spent quite a lot of time discussing the experiments with a number of physicists who actually performed them."
19,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5720805-tom-schulte,4,"This is a quick, easy read with an enlightening high-level overview of the mysteries and advances in understanding quantum entanglement. This works very well as a an audio book, despites some tables and formulae. On the science side, I do not recall knowing that the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle could be demonstrated not only in sub-nucleon particles like the photon, but even in neutrons and atoms themselves. Making this book interesting is the colorful scientists like Bohr, Heisenberg, Feynman, Dirac, etc. Einstein gets a lot of space and it is interesting to think in the WWI era he outmoded classical, Newtonian physics only to see "
20,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7736248-wm-pope,3,"A reasonable introduction to quantum entanglement. The author tries to approach the material from several directions to make entanglement easier to understand. The book uses the people who have been involved with the topic to frame the different explanations. This helps understand that the space is evolving and the knowledge of entanglement is growing. I am not comfortable with the degree of assurance the author presents, not about entanglement itself, but about how entanglement fits into a larger cosmological scheme.The presentation on the limits of entanglement and why it can not be used for communication is good but would benefit from more and deeper explanations.Entanglement is a very quick read and worth the time. It will establish some familiarity with the topic and with the people who have historically been involved."

The author describes all the major breakthroughs in the world of quantum physics starting from Planck's quantisation of energy levels to the modern experimentation of the triple entanglement of particles performed in the late 20th century. The author also starts each chapter with a brief introduction to the life of each famous physicist whose contributions were accounted for in this book. All major protagonists of this baffling theory- Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, Heisenberg, Schr√∂dinger, Bell, Clauser etc. have been portrayed in almost a dramatic fashion which makes it enjoyable to read unlike other scientific history accounts."
22,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,3,"Quantum entanglement is a fascinating subject indeed. The implications of this phenomenon are far-reaching -- from unbreakable quantum encryption to teleportation. This among other quantum phenomena, left Einstein scratching his head. Either way, it serves as another piece of the puzzle towards finding a theory of everything (TOE). Trying to reconcile quantum mechanics with a theory of gravity is the current dilemma among scientists in the field, and this is but one finding to help fill in the blanks. I thought it was a good read, but would have preferred the book to go into more technical detail concerning its applications."

I was interested in the subject matter but the book (as it explains in the intro) tries (in multiple ways) to explain entanglement. I thought there was a lot of excess (although interesting), information about the scientists that worked on quantum mechanics. Since the topic is so heady and beyond me, I didn't absorb much about entanglement other than Feynman's diagram. A neat book, I wish I would have understood more."
24,0452284570,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15444846-hendrick-mcdonald,3,"An okay introduction to entanglement, but get lost in the history and experimental setups. The first 2/3 rds of the book focuses on general quantum physics history: Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Pauli etc. I recommend A Graphic Guide to Quantum Physics for that. The coverage of entanglement itself goes through interesting experiments, but the interesting results and what they mean, how to interpret them, gets lost in explaining the history and setup to the experiments, without even doing a worthwhile job of describing what each part does. So, its eh. "

I would *NOT* recommend this to an amateur of physics/quantum mechanics as it's definitely very heavy stuff, but if you are on that level it is solid. Some parts seem a little repetitive but that's part of what the author was going for (different perspectives on the same thing.)"
