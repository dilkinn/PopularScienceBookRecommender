0,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"Readable to the extreme. Loved the way the author stepped back from all the psychology popular stuff. He went to great length to show that all the 'go and become the hero', 'get it done' approach, 'don't say quits until you drop!' stuff can be counterproductive at times, though not always. Also loved the author's way of thinking. He basically employs the recipe for dealing with most tasks where one-size-fits-all answers are unlikely to work.Surprisingly memorable, with bright examples easing the reader into every discussion. Wow! A lot of things here make a lot of sense. Way more than I expected. PS I thought a lot on what exactly this book reminded me of, since this no straight self-help. And I remembered: the Freakonomics series is really similar to this one.Q: As far back as the 1800s, scientists like Philippe Tissié and August Bier noted that an unsound mind can help an athlete ignore pain and push his or her body beyond its naturally conservative limits.I don’t know about you, but my high school guidance counselor never told me that hallucinations, mailbox assaults, and generalized insanity were vital to being a world-renowned success at anything. I was told to do my homework, play by the rules, and be nice.All of which raises a serious question: What really produces success? (c)Q: Do “nice guys finish last”? Or first?Do quitters never win? Or is stubbornness the real enemy?Does confidence rule the day? When is it just delusion? (с)  Sounds like just the book I might love, since it looks at both sides of an argument, any argument!Q: In each chapter we’ll review both sides of the story. We’ll see the strengths of each perspective. So if anything seems like a slam-dunk or a contradiction, hang with me. Both angles will present their case, much like a trial. Then we’ll settle on the answer that gives the best upside with the least downside.In chapter 1, we’ll look at whether playing it safe and doing what we’re told really produces success. We’ll learn about what Harvard professor Gautam Mukunda calls “intensifiers.” Like Jure Robič’s insanity, intensifiers are qualities that, on average, are negative but in certain contexts produce sweeping benefits that devastate the competition. We’ll learn why valedictorians rarely become millionaires, why the best (and worst) U.S. presidents are the ones who subvert the system, and how our biggest weaknesses might actually be our greatest strengths.In chapter 2, we’ll find out when nice guys finish first as well as when Machiavelli was right on the money. We’ll talk to a Wharton School professor who believes in compassionate business and altruism, and a teacher at Stanford whose research shows hard work is overrated and kissing up is what gets promotions. We’ll look at pirates and prison gangs to see which rules even rule breakers follow, and find out how to strike the right balance between ambitiously getting ahead and being able to sleep at night.In chapter 3, we’ll dive into Navy SEAL training and explore the emerging science of grit and resilience. We’ll talk to economics Ph.D.s to calculate the best time to double our efforts and when to throw in the towel. Kung fu masters will teach us when being a flaky quitter is a great idea. And we’ll learn the silly word that can help us decide when to stick with something and when giving up is the best move.Chapter 4 looks at whether it really is “what you know” or “who you know.” We’ll see how the most networked employees are often the most productive but that the greatest experts almost invariably classify themselves as introverts (including an astounding 90 percent of top athletes). We’ll get insights from the most connected guy in Silicon Valley and learn how to network without feeling sleazy.In chapter 5, we’ll look at attitude. We’ll see how confidence can push us past what we think we’re capable of but how that needs to be balanced with a grounded view of the challenges ahead. We’ll learn how the emerging science of “mental contrasting” can help us determine when to go all in and when to think twice. Most important, we’ll look at new research that shows why the entire confidence paradigm might be problematic at its core.In chapter 6, we step back to view the big picture and try to see how success in career aligns with success in life—and when it doesn’t. Is there any place for work–life balance in our 24/7 go, go, go world? Harvard Business School’s Clayton Christensen and Genghis Khan provide examples of how to find peace in a fast-moving office. We’ll get lessons from tragic case studies of legends who achieved success but paid too steep a price, sacrificing family and happiness. (c)Q: So why are the number ones in high school so rarely the number ones in real life? There are two reasons. First, schools reward students who consistently do what they are told. Academic grades correlate only loosely with intelligence (standardized tests are better at measuring IQ). ... “Essentially, we are rewarding conformity and the willingness to go along with the system.” Many of the valedictorians admitted to not being the smartest kid in class, just the hardest worker. Others said that it was more an issue of giving teachers what they wanted than actually knowing the material better. Most of the subjects in the study were classified as “careerists”: they saw their job as getting good grades, not really as learning.The second reason is that schools reward being a generalist. There is little recognition of student passion or expertise. The real world, however, does the reverse. ... If you want to do well in school and you’re passionate about math, you need to stop working on it to make sure you get an A in history too. ... Shawn Achor’s research at Harvard shows that college grades aren’t any more predictive of subsequent life success than rolling dice. A study of over seven hundred American millionaires showed their average college GPA was 2.9. (c)  And with dice we could have expected a 2.5, if their grades vary between 0 and 5. Q: Winston Churchill should have never been prime minister of Great Britain. He wasn’t someone who “did everything right,” and it was shocking that he was elected. His contemporaries knew he was brilliant—but he was also a paranoid loose cannon who was impossible to deal with. ... Churchill was a maverick. He did not merely love his country; he displayed a clear paranoia toward any possible threat to the empire. He saw even Gandhi as a danger and was beyond outspoken in his opposition to what was a pacifist rebellion in India. He was the Chicken Little of Great Britain, passionately railing against all opposition to his country, great, small—or imagined. But this “bad” quality is the key to why he is one of the most revered leaders in world history.This Chicken Little was the only one who saw Hitler for the threat he was. Chamberlain, on the other hand, regarded Hitler as “a man who could be relied upon when he had given his word.” The entrenched British leadership was convinced appeasement was the way to quell the Nazis.When it mattered the most, Churchill’s paranoia was prescient. (c)Q: Gautam Mukunda speculated that the reason for the inconsistency in the research was there are actually two fundamentally different types of leaders. The first kind rises up through formal channels, getting promoted, playing by the rules, and meeting expectations. These leaders, like Neville Chamberlain, are “filtered.” The second kind doesn’t rise up through the ranks; they come in through the window: entrepreneurs who don’t wait for someone to promote them; U.S. vice presidents who are unexpectedly handed the presidency; leaders who benefit from a perfect storm of unlikely events, like the kind that got Abraham Lincoln elected. This group is “unfiltered.” By the time filtered candidates are in the running for the top spot, they have been so thoroughly vetted that they can be relied upon to make the standard, traditionally approved decisions. They are effectively indistinguishable from one another—and this is why much of the research showed little effect for leaders.But the unfiltered candidates have not been vetted by the system and cannot be relied upon to make the “approved” decisions—many would not even know what the approved decisions are. They do unexpected things, have different backgrounds, and are often unpredictable. Yet they bring change and make a difference. Often that difference is a negative. Since they don’t play by the rules, they often break the institutions they are guiding. A minority of unfiltered leaders are transformative, though, shedding organizations of their misguided beliefs and foolish consistencies, and turning them toward better horizons. These are the leaders that the research said have enormous positive impact. In his Ph.D. thesis, Mukunda applied his theory to all the U.S. presidents, evaluating which ones were filtered and which unfiltered, and whether or not they were great leaders. The results were overwhelming. His theory predicted presidential impact with an almost unheard of statistical confidence of 99 percent.The filtered leaders didn’t rock the boat. The unfiltered leaders couldn’t help but rock it. Often they broke things, but sometimes they broke things like slavery, as Abraham Lincoln did.Mukunda understood firsthand. His unconventional Ph.D. thesis made him an outlier in the academic job market. Despite a Harvard and MIT pedigree, he received only two job interviews after more than fifty applications.(c)Q: Glenn Gould was such a hypochondriac that if you sneezed while on a phone call with him, he’d immediately hang up. ... (c)Q: Let’s talk about orchids, dandelions, and hopeful monsters. (I know, I know, you talk about these things all the time and this is nothing new to you. Please indulge me.) (c)Q: Why do some people end up crazy-brilliant and others end up crazy-crazy? ... They seem to possess just the right amount of weirdness.(c)Q: Andrew Robinson, CEO of famed advertising agency BBDO, once said, “When your head is in a refrigerator and your feet on a burner, the average temperature is okay. I am always cautious about averages.”(c)Q: It’s a matter of basic statistics. When it comes to the extremes of performance, averages don’t matter; what matters is variance, those deviations from the norm. Almost universally, we humans try to filter out the worst to increase the average, but by doing this we also decrease variance. Chopping off the left side of the bell curve improves the average but there are always qualities that we think are in that left side that also are in the right. (c)Q: Would you hire a psychopath? No. And the research shows that psychopaths don’t do well on average. Most people would just stop there, but a study titled “Personality Characteristics of Successful Artists” showed that top performers in creative fields demonstrate markedly higher scores on measures of psychoticism than lesser artists. Another study from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology showed that successful U.S. presidents also demonstrate higher scores on psychopathic characteristics.Often intensifiers masquerade as positives because we give successful people the benefit of the doubt. It’s the old joke that poor people are crazy and rich people are “eccentric.” Traits like obsessiveness are framed as positives for those already in the successful camp and negatives for others. We all know some who benefit from perfectionism and others who are just “crazy.” (c)Q: Research by Gallup shows that the more hours per day you spend doing what you’re good at, the less stressed you feel and the more you laugh, smile, and feel you’re being treated with respect. (c)Q: Ask yourself, Which companies, institutions, and situations value what I do? Context affects everyone. (c)Q: We tend to think experts are experts just because of their unique skills and we forget the power of context, of knowing one’s way around, of the teams who support them, and the shorthand they develop together over time. (c)  And another thing about that is when the company you're with undergoes drastic changes, sometimes it's best to leave when you start feeling the 'pond' having undergone changes to the worse. Q: This was well illustrated by how Toyota helped a charity. The Food Bank for New York City relies on corporate donations to function. Toyota had donated money—until 2011 when they came up with a far better idea. Toyota’s engineers had dedicated countless hours to fine-tuning processes and realized that while any company could donate cash, they had something unique to offer: their expertise. So they decided to donate efficiency.Journalist Mona El-Naggar described the results:At a soup kitchen in Harlem, Toyota’s engineers cut down the wait time for dinner to 18 minutes from as long as 90. At a food pantry on Staten Island, they reduced the time people spent filling their bags to 6 minutes from 11. And at a warehouse in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where volunteers were packing boxes of supplies for victims of Hurricane Sandy, a dose of kaizen cut the time it took to pack one box to 11 seconds from 3 minutes. (c)  And that's a really inspiring thing about the whole kaizen thing. Q: Feeling powerless actually makes you dumber. (c)Q: Eighty percent of our evaluations of other people come down to two characteristics: warmth and competence. And a study from Teresa Amabile at Harvard called “Brilliant but Cruel” shows we assume the two are inversely related: if someone is too nice, we figure they must be less competent. In fact, being a jerk makes others see you as more powerful. Those who break rules are seen as having more power than those who obey. (c)Q: But hold on—it gets worse. Ass kissers aren’t the only ones who thrive. Jerks do too. (c) Q: Rude people also have better credit scores. (c)  Now that seems to be an urban legend. Q: A study bluntly titled “Bad Is Stronger than Good” shows that in a shocking number of areas bad things are more impactful and longer lasting than good things: “Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good . . . Hardly any exceptions (indicating greater power of good) can be found. Taken together, these findings suggest that bad is stronger than good, as a general principle across a broad range of psychological phenomena.” (c)  And here I and my fixation on happy endings go angry. Q: And I can’t help but mention that an informal study showed that ethics books are 25 percent more likely to be stolen than the average library book. (c)  Hilarious! Q: I’m going to stop now because my publisher won’t let this book be packaged with antidepressants. (c)  Or chocolate. Q: What happens when you go total Tony Soprano and start whacking everyone who causes problems? Everyone will respect you and no one will want to work with you. Being a mob boss who is too violent has an inherent irony to it. Would you want to work for someone whose response to late expense reports is two bullets to the head? I didn’t think so. (c)Q: These savvy businessmen of the oceans were not all crazed psychopaths with eye patches. In fact, according to Blackbeard expert Angus Konstam, that famed pirate, over the course of his career, killed exactly zero people. And there are no cases on record of anyone walking the plank. Nope. Not one.So why do we have this impression of them as bloodthirsty savages? It’s called marketing. It’s much easier, cheaper, and safer to have people surrender quickly because they’re terrified of you than it is to fight every battle, so pirates were sharp enough to cultivate a brand image of barbarity. (c)Q: Pirate ships were very democratic places. (c)Q:"
1,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Now, Rick recommended this one to me – and put it under the category of a ‘good business self-help book’ – which, well, it sort of is, but it sort of isn’t too. This is a bit more like a book that I might shelve under behavioural economics/psychology. There are things I didn’t particularly like about it, but we will get to that.Much of what it has to say that might do you some good involves thinking about the stuff you say to yourself about yourself. And the really nice thing this book will give you permission to do is to be kind to yourself – which, when all is said and done, really is something many of us need to be given permission to do. I think many of us are far more forgiving of other people than we are of ourselves – and that’s a pity, because most of us are much nicer people than we give ourselves credit for. Much nicer than some of the bastards we are forgiving towards…I’ve always had a problem with ideas like ‘the secret’ or ‘positive psychology’ or what I think of as optimism as ideology. I’m not particularly someone who basks in endless reserves of self-confidence, but that said, that doesn’t mean that I’m particularly attracted to people who do have endless stores of self-confidence either. The overly self-confident often strike me as fairly stupid. I much prefer people who are a bit more self-aware. Not least, as the author says here at some point, because when the overly self-confident do finally get to see themselves in a mirror, and see that their over-confidence wasn’t really based on anything, no matter how that works out, it generally doesn’t work out well – you know, the choices being either a crushing loss of confidence or denial.A lot of the advice in this book can be brought back to the notion of ‘deliberative practice’ – you know, you can be an expert in just about anything if you spend 10,000 hours practicing at it – as long as that practice is structure so as to always test your limits so as to exceed them – what Vygotsky called your ‘zone of proximal development’. The author quotes another education god in this – Bloom (the taxonomy man) in something I’ve only learnt recently that Bloom was interested in, what he called the two sigma problem. Bloom said that people who are taught one-on-one do much, much better at learning just about everything than people taught in group situations. He felt that a key task of education research ought to be to find out how to make that gap disappear. Let’s face it, very few of us are likely to get an education from an expert on a one-to-one basis, so finding out how to teach groups as effectively as in one-to-one teaching would be a pretty damn good thing for just about all of us. Bloom said that virtually anyone can learn virtually anything – as long as the conditions are right. This really is something we ought to know and believe. If we really did believe that, it would change our lives. In some ways this comes down to our bullshit beliefs around talent. We often think that talent is something we are born with – I can feel my eye twitching as I type that. The problem with believing something like that is that a single failure can be interpreted as a lack of natural ability. And that really is stupid. If Vygotsky is right about his idea that we learn the most when we are right at the cusp of our abilities, then failure is not just inevitable, it is also the only way we can learn anything. Natural ability isn’t about not failing, talent is in structuring the learning so that failing helps us improve, rather than being a huge kick in the guts. But while we might be able to learn anything, or even achieve anything, the other thing this book makes clear is that we can’t achieve everything – to achieve one thing has opportunity costs – and so we need to give up stuff to get stuff. I’m never going to do some of the stuff recommended here – map my time so I can see what is directed at achieving my goals compared to other stuff that isn’t – but I can see it makes sense.I really liked the discussion in this on people who totally dedicate themselves to becoming the best in their field – how this often involves cutting out all other things in their lives and almost by definition then becoming basically arse-holes. Whether it is Einstein, Newton, Kafka, some baseball guy, some navy guy – success often seems to be predicated on being a turd to just about everyone around you. Maybe that type of success isn’t always worth having?I also liked that telling stories to yourself and making things into games were seen as important aspects of succeeding. This was, in some ways, the ‘I think I can’ part of the book, but only in the sense that those who generally succeed do so by chunking tasks into winnable games and then playing at those as a game within a game. Doing that, and then being kind to yourself when things don’t quite work out – when you lose the match say – allows you to regroup and then focus on the next match. Now, this sort of brings me to the things I didn’t find all that good here. I found some of the stories a bit annoying. I find I get quite bored by sports stories – especially when I have no idea at all about the sport – I find sports insanely boring, so I struggle to give a stuff about some guy who could really hit a ball – what an ultimate waste of a life. I also find that silly bits of writing – in this case where the author does sort of cute talking to the reader – annoy me a bit more than it totally reasonable. I also think that the book places too much stress on ‘finding your vocation’ which I think is counter to some of the other arguments here. This reminded me of Aristotle – that everyone has their own natural ability and that they should find and do that. The problem is that, as the book makes clear later, people who do just one thing often end up pretty stuffed up. I’ve said this elsewhere, but I’m becoming more and more attracted to Marx’s idea that we should be many things, rather than just one thing, and that being many things is a kind of useful definition of what being a healthy human is.That said, this book does provide some useful advice. Not least, and to say it again, around the idea of being kind to yourself. Do that – do that often."

The best lessons in cooperation come from gang members, pirates and serial killers, continues Eric Barker in this how-to-strategize-and-be-successful guide. Sensational theories, but Barker, a former Hollywood screenwriter , uses stories, research studies and liberally quotes the gurus of productivity and psychology to buttress his analysis and advice . The book has 6 chapters, all with catchy subtitles like 'Does Playing by the Rules Pay Off ? Insight from Valedictorians, People Who Feel No Pain, and Piano Prodigies' . Or 'What We Can Learn About Walking the Tightrope Between Confidence and Delusion from Chess Masters, Secret Military Units, Kung Fu Con Artists, and People Who Cannot Feel Fear'In the chapter subtitled 'What Navy SEAL's, Video Games, Arranged Marriages, and Batman can Teach Us About Sticking it Out When Achieving Success is Hard' , Barker explains why playing games are important .""We can apply game mechanics to our lives and turn dull moments into fun ones "" he says quoting productivity guru Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi . A game is a win and data shows that consistently small wins are even better at producing happiness than occasionally bagging an elephant. Of course investing these games with meaning is key . Barker tells the story of how Steve Jobs lured John Sculley away from his great job as CEO of Pepsi. He asked him,""Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world?"" Meaningful doesn't have to be saving orphans or curing the sick. As long as your story is meaningful to you, it has power ""he says .Each chapter has parable-like stories , like those of Ashlyn Blocker the girl who feels no pain, Alfredo Hinojosa the brilliant immigrant , Michael Swango the killer doctor, Glenn Gould the obsessive pianist or Joe Simpson the survivor mountaineer . Barker quotes and liberally, from a galaxy of distinguished behavioural economists like Kahnemann and Dan Ariely, from literary figures like David Foster Wallace and icons like Charlie Chaplin and Albert Einstein.Then there's the advice , which appears at the end of each of the six chapters. Like 'Rule 1 :Pick the Right Pond Rule 2 : Cooperate first ' or 'Believing in yourself is Nice . Forgiving Yourself is Better ' . Chapter 6, the concluding chapter ends with stepping back to examine how career success aligns with success in life - where Harvard Business School Clayton Christensen and ( yes !) Mongol warrior Genghis Khan provide examples of how to find peace in a fast moving world . Most of Barker's advice( 'Know yourself. Network. Join Groups. Always Follow Up') is plain common sense and has been done to death . But Barker does manage to liven up the lectures . And if you like gimmicky , this screenwriter turned blogger turned author is up there. Plus he is prolific in his parables of modern day success. From the Navy Seals to Dalai Lama to Steve Job, each chapter has several stories. He quotes generously and is himself quotable - definitely the stuff of motivational presentations !"
3,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,3,Completely forgettable and totally unsurprising science behind everything I've already heard everywhere else. All the books in this genre should be called Kahneman and Tserversky lite. There's got to be some behavioral flaw to explain why I keep reading these books even though they tell me the same thing over and over again.
4,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22973889-ravi-raman,2,"[Abandanded 50% of the way through] It's rare that I abandon a book. However, this book was enough of a struggle to get through that I decided to cut my losses. It is not that book isn't well written (it is). It's not that it isn't slightly funny (it is). I gave up on reading it because the style was just not for me. Each chapter seemed to hop, skip and jump all over the place. The book covered all aspects of personal development...from work/life balance to networking to what makes people ""successful"" and more. Within each chapter the author seemed to both validate conventional wisdom but also spin a gladwell-ian yarn about conventional wisdom isn't the only truth. I ended up being confused about what the book was actually asserting! Further, much of the book was a collage of quotes and citings of other semi-famous non-fiction authors....from Charles Duhigg (Power of Habit) to Dan Coyle (Talent Code) to Eriksson (10,000 Hours / Peak) and more. I felt like I was being ""name dropped"" on constantly and it made the book tough to read.Sometimes, books can cover a broad subject like personal development and ""success"" and make it work (as in Mastery by Robert Greene, The Road to Character by Brooks or even Gladwell's work) but in this case it was too disjointed and scattered to continue with.

5,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887880-lorilin,4,"We all have ideas of what we think makes people successful. And though author Eric Barker claims to ""EXPLODE ALL THE MYTHS!!"" in this book, his ideas aren't actually all that crazy--and certainly not so crazy that we've never heard them before. In fact, I recognized more than a few ideas summarized from other books I've read (like Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, Just Enough: Tools for Creating Success in Your Work and Life, and the list goes on). The great thing about Barking Up the Wrong Tree, though, is that, not only is Barker a great story teller, he's also very clear, specific, and organized in the way he presents his information. In other words, he makes learning really, really fun.There are six chapters in the book. Chapter 1 talks about how people become successful--some by rising through the ranks over time, others by being so different and driven that they bust down the door and invite themselves to the party. Chapter 2 discusses the importance of being kind and giving (without being a martyr). Chapter 3 argues that knowing when to quit is just as important as having grit. Chapter 4 points out the many benefits of having a network, but emphasizes that it should be built by giving to others. Chapter 5 argues that self-compassion is more important than self-esteem. And Chapter 6 talks about the power of good close relationships.There is a lot of information to absorb in here, and it can be overwhelming, but Barking Up the Wrong Tree is still an incredibly interesting and educational book. I think my favorite part is the conclusion where Barker sums it all up:What's the most important thing to remember when it comes to success? Alignment. Success is not the result of any single quality; it's about alignment between who you are and where you choose to be. The right skill in the right role. A good person surrounded by other good people. A story that connects you with the world in a way that keeps you going. A network that helps you, and a job that leverages your natural introversion or extroversion. A level of confidence that keeps you going while learning and forgiving yourself for the inevitable failures. A balance between [happiness, achievement, significance, and legacy] that creates a well-rounded life with no regrets.At the end of the day, having a successful life really comes down to knowing who you are and finding a place where you can be exactly that. It's such a simple message, but a powerful one, too. See more of my reviews at www.BugBugBooks.com!ARC provided through Amazon Vine."

I mean those reviewers simply summarize the book and quote some of the book points or phrases without bringing their critical review of the book. What is the benefit of reading a book and never show your critical views about it? What I mean exactly are those reviewers who give these books “ Five Stars”!I personally think that this book is not worth it and it’s unbelievably overrated. The author has made some certain research papers thinking they would fit into this vague ideas. The author is jumping from here and there and I didn’t understand what he is trying to make. He took lots of ideas from other books like Thrive, Quiet: The Power of Introverts, and some others without bringing something new to the table. In his introduction, he talked about filtered and unfiltered students, and how millionaires have low GPA back in school where high-performance students end up with positions lower the CEOs. But the author never elaborated about filtered and unfiltered people; he jumped from one topic to another with no relation between them and without closing his points. He didn’t bring anything new to me other than his wonderful introduction that deceives you into thinking that next chapters would be awesome. I thought this book is boring and everything I have read is common sense and nothing much. The author was in hurry making this book because he wanted to compile all his unrelated ideas and thoughts into one book. I thought he could make it much better than if he had taken his time making this book. Lots of anecdotes and some humor yet the wisdom of the situations he mentioned are very common and known to even a high school student. And for those who gave this book 5 stars ! all I can say: “wow !! you are as the book stated … filtered”. I apologize."

So if you've read much about the science of happiness/success/effectiveness then this will not be ""surprising"" news. If you haven't read anything before and only want to read one book, then this might do the trick. The problem is that by skimming the surface of all these different studies, the author winds up sounding wishy-washy: extroversion, confidence, persistence are the secrets to a good life except when the exact opposites are better! In the end, the advice is to align with what's right for you, and that is basically the concept of Flow, so personally I would recommend just reading that to get an appreciation of where that advice comes from and a deeper understanding of the nuances.

12,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57315908-mart-roben,5,"Have you ever read a self-help book that gave you all the answers, only to find that real world is far too messy to make use of “simple truths”? Or, from the other side of the genre, have you read a self-help book preaching how everything is relative, leading to the inevitable conclusion that you should stop making choices and stop trying in life? “Barking Up the Wrong Tree” falls in the sweet-spot between the dumb templates and the blind acceptance.The book explores research about life decisions and offers bits that hold scientifically true. Rather than giving a success plan to follow, it envisages likely outcomes of alternative paths. A lot is psychologically hardwired (sorry, you can’t “fake it till you make it”), but there are small choices and possibilities to optimise.Barker presents facts in a delightfully counterintuitive way. (Turns out the best way to impede a workplace opportunist who takes advantage of colleagues’ good will is… gossip!) The author has done the hard work of original investigation. You could tell because his stories and examples are not the standard recycled ones usually found in popular psychology. I also enjoyed how statistical comparisons are used to make scientific findings more tangible. (Having few friends is more dangerous than obesity and is the equivalent health risk of smoking fifteen cigarettes a day.)A great read if you want to know how much (or how little) popular success maxims are supported by actual science."

15,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55660633-edwin-setiadi,5,"The funnest, the most out-of-the-box analysis, on the keys for successThis is the 1st book I've ever pre-ordered. I am a regular reader of the blog Barking Up The Wrong Tree, and I once thought would it be cool if Eric Barker can make a book out of these gems? And my God he did, and it did not disappoint one bit.Like Dale Carnegie, Eric Barker uses so many stories, book references and great quotations to make his points accross. There are stories such as how a poor boy in Mexico can become a world class neuro surgeon, how a clinically crazy person can win the enduring Race Across America, or how can an illiterate person in a horrible time and place and without proper education can conquer more land in 25 years than the Romans ever did in 400 years. There are also eye opening stories of how trust is completely lost in a Moldovan culture, how crimes create street gangs (and not the other way around) for protection, and how surprisingly civilised and organised pirates were.The author then back them up with numerous scientific findings to validate the points he is making, just like the approach of Daniel Kahneman. For example, there are scientific explanations on why some people never quit, why people have depression, and why people commit suicide. Moreover, there are explanations on why high achievers can sometimes have anxiety problem or even depression, why the number ones in high school (the valedictorians) so rarely become the number ones in real life, why beautiful people normally becomes more successful, why nice guys finish first and last (and not in the middle), and why high achievers are rarely active in their social media accounts.Along the way we'll learn so many amusing facts, such as how an IQ of 120 does not make much difference than 180, 2 and a half to 4 hours after we wake up is when our brains is at its sharpest, how Hedonic Adaptation explains why after a brief change everything change back to baseline (e.g. on diet and clean behaviour), how viagra started out as a medicine for angina that had a serendipitous ""side effect"", that the US once had an (almost official) emperor, Emperor Norton I. And we'll also gain some great wisdom like ""sometimes an ugly duckling can be a swan if it finds the right pond"" or ""life is noisy and complex, and we don't have perfect information about others and their motives. Writing people off can be due to just lack of clarity"", or ""things aren't as scary when we have our hands on the wheels.""All of these wealth of information are then knitted nicely to become the central theme of the book: to discover the core determinants of success, through considering both sides of the argument with extreme stories and scientific facts.In each individual chapters the book then provide concluding analysis, such as the importance of quiting something that is not good for you to make room and time for something good for you, the scientific explanation on luck as a function of choice, the disadvantages dreaming will cause on your wellbeing, effort and reality, the best predictor of our child's emotional well-being is whether they knew their family history, the importance of sleep and self-compassion, and many more.The author also gives us so many practical tools for us to work out the determinant factors for succcess, on our own unique way, such as Shawn Anchor's ""twenty second rule"", Cal Newport's ""shutdown ritual"", how to skillfully and sincerely use our network, figuring out whether we're filtered or unfiltered leader, the importance of setting a parameter in a negotiation, and the findings of Robert Epstein research on how to reduce stress, among many others.All in all, this book is the most complete analysis for its subject, using unorthodox approach and very amusing wide range of information that makes it very fun to read. What Freakonomics did for economics, Why Do Men Have Nipples? did for medicine, and Moonwalking With Einstein did with memory, Barking Up the Wrong Tree does it brilliantly with exploring the keys for success in the real world. I couldn't recommend it more."

However, upon further reflection, the book is loaded with the narrative fallacy—many of the success stories cannot be attributed to his principles but to luck.He looks at the most successful people; from a learning standpoint this is actually bad because, to quote nobel prize winner Daniel Kahneman (His comment on this other book, Built to Last, can equally apply here.):""The basic message of Built to Last and other similar books is that good managerial practices can be identified and that good practices will be rewarded by good results. Both messages are overstated. The comparison of firms that have been more or less successful is to a significant extent a comparison between firms that have been more or less lucky. Knowing the importance of luck, you should be particularly suspicious when highly consistent patterns emerge from the comparison of successful and less successful firms. In the presence of randomness, regular patterns can only be mirages.""Because luck plays a large role, the quality of leadership and management practices cannot be inferred reliably from observations of success. And even if you had perfect foreknowledge that a CEO has brilliant vision and extraordinary competence, you still would be unable to predict how the company will perform with much better accuracy than the flip of a coin. On the average, the gap in corporate profitability and stock returns between the outstanding firms and the less successful firms studied in Built to Last shrank to almost nothing in the period following the study. The average profitability of the companies identified in the famous In Search of Excellence dropped sharply as well within a short time. A study of Fortune's ""Most Admired Companies"" finds that over a twenty-year period, the firms with the worst ratings went on to earn much higher stock returns than the most admired firms."" (Thinking, Fast and Slow p. 207)Barker's stories are oversimplified, and he falls into the trap.Probably the most useful part of the book are the steps that Barker outlines. However, his quality of thinking is so low, that I'm starting to doubt the usefulness of those processes. :/"
17,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61887397-jami-lilo,5,What a thoughtful and entertaining book. This gem kept me engaged as I learned about pirates and prisons and valedictorians success rate right out of the gate. The author uses studies and facts to create arguments and then plays devils advocate to view a different side of the coin. The lessons are told in a conversational way and asks questions that you can think about yourself or talk to co-workers/ friends about. It's a great mix of science and psychology and applying the information in your every day life. I enjoyed this very much and the conversations it's helped me start with others.

The second thing is that science and common knowledge are so different in many ways. Remember your grandmother telling you not to sit in a draft, you will get sick. So this book was a must read.Well it does cover some interesting things. Time management, leisure and work balance, working smarter not harder, are all covered. While the book is aimed more at executives, many will find some good advice in here. Yes, working mom's and stay-at-home mom's will also find some great ways to balance their lives as well.As a parent I am able to apply some ideas to how to raise my kids. I know a book about success is not about parenting, but with two older teens entering adulthoood it has given me some perspective. The conclusion has some workbook activities that I will be trying out on myself, and encouraging my university student to do the same.So, yep I liked this book and do recommend it. "

For most part, what matters are these four metrics: 1. Happiness - having pleasure or contentment2. Achievement - achieving accomplishments3. Significance - having a positive impact on people4. Legacy - establishing values that help others find future successTo be truly successful, we need to spend our time on each of these week after week after week, and not put some of these on back burner for10 years because we are too busy spending our time on only one of these right now. And it's not a zero sum game. All of us can be successful!"
21,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,2,"I cannot remember how this book ended up in my 'to read' list. I don't generally read self-help or motivational books. The title suggested a contrarian outlook. Perhaps, that is what interested me in reading it. Still, I am always skeptical about books that try to tell you that they have decoded the path to something that has eluded many others. The standard wisdom on success practically includes everything from being a friendly, pleasant person to being a driven, singularly-focused individual. In between, the advice is to be a good listener and exude supreme confidence under most trying circumstances. Discipline, courage, and being yourself are some other traits that are supposed to make you successful. 'Discover who you are,' say some others. 'Love is the ultimate answer,' say yet others with supreme conviction. Hope, action, and focus are also qualities that contribute to success. Many others say that there is no one set of rules that brings achievement to everyone. Each one of us is supposed to have our specific key to success, and once we find it, success will follow. The title of this book says 'the Surprising Science Behind Why Everything You Know About Success Is (Mostly) Wrong.' I expected the author to suggest some compelling, contrarian scientific arguments to counter most of the keys mentioned above. But I was mostly disappointed, not only by the style but also the content. It would be a stretch to claim the author's arguments as science, even though the book has an extensive list of references. The book makes for breezy reading because it is a collection of stories. A book such as this would naturally invite the question of what success is. Depending on the definition, we would ask the follow-up question of whether there are any universally applicable ways of achieving success. Eric Barker answers that ""we get hung up on the heights of success we see in the media and forget that it's our definition of success that matters."" In other words, Barker says, ""what defines success for you is, well, up to you."" With such a flexible definition, it is easy to characterize most anecdotal events as successes or failures and then look at their causes.So, Barker's approach to researching the keys to success is through a large number of parables from modern-day success stories. There are anecdotes from the lives of famous people like Winston Churchill, Abraham Lincoln, Charlie Chaplin, Albert Einstein, Paul Erdos, and even Genghis Khan. Somewhat obscure people like Jure Robic, Michael Swango, and Glenn Gould also find mention as examples. Swango was particularly interesting as he was a doctor cum serial killer and very successful in his serial-killing. Barker makes an engaging analysis of what made him so good at killing!The book is full of quotes, arguments for and against a proposition, and then a resolution. My favorite quote from the book is the one attributed to Kurt Vonnegut, who said, ""We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be."" So, what does Eric Barker say are the keys to success? As far as I can gather, it is probably the following chunks:Whatever you want to accomplish, approach it as a game, define end goals, and work on them by reaching smaller intermediate goals. Networking with people and organizations is essential. Joining diverse groups helps to meet different people. Keep in touch through several communication channels such as email, phone, chat, etcBeing happy is vital to achieving success. Hence, working hard and obsessively must be balanced with other aspects of lifeYou must decide what you want. If you don't do it, the world outside will do it for you, and it may not be the right thing for youOptimism is necessary to pursue our cause, but pessimism is useful to identify problemsWe must be compassionate to ourselvesListen actively and be democraticConfidence is a result of success, not its causePursuing success demands a flexible approach where you adopt different strategies based on different situationsThere is a time to pursue success doggedly despite significant adversities, and then there is also a time to quit. For example, when a relationship is a wrong one or when you choose wrong goals, to begin with, it is better to quit when you realize itApart from many other such aphorisms, there is plenty of advice and quotes from Nobel Laureates like Daniel Kahnemann, behavioral scientists like Dan Ariely, and literary elites like David Wallace. Elsewhere, Eric Barker cites some examples and correlations with success in life that do not carry much conviction. He says that famous figures like Lincoln, Gandhi, Michaelangelo, and Mark Twain all lost a parent before age sixteen. The list of orphans who became spectacular successes is long and includes no fewer than fifteen British prime ministers. I don't know why becoming a prime-minister of Britain should be considered a success in life? Then, why not the PM of Nigeria or Mali? The author says that due to their unique personality and circumstances, these orphans overcompensated and turned tragedy into fuel for greatness. Is he saying that being an orphan increases our chances of success in life? Is it even ethical to contemplate such a possibility? If we take his example of Gandhi, his father died when he was sixteen, but his mother lived for another six years. In the 19th century India, the father usually exercised much control over his children's life and growth as an adult. One can say that Gandhi freed himself from this control at sixteen, and that is the reason why he could explore life in South Africa by age 24. But Gandhi did not become the Mahatma that we know today overnight. It happened over the next many decades through his life experience both in Africa and India. To attribute his father's death as a salient cause would be at best clutching at straws to explain Gandhi's rise.Then there is the quote, ""89 percent of achievers classify themselves as introverts, in sports, in music, etc. Only 6% feel they are extroverts, and the other 5% are in-between"". Does he suggest that becoming an introvert raises your chances of being an achiever? Can it be the other way around that we become introverts because of focusing on achievement and finding success? Barker says that the System does not vet ""unfiltered"" politicians, and so they cannot be relied upon to make the ""approved"" decisions. Hence they act in unexpected ways and are often unpredictable. Yet they bring change and shake up the System. They often break the institutions they lead. Donald Trump comes to mind as an example of an unfiltered politician. But, we cannot yet say that he is successful as President of the US. It is premature, at best. In the 1980s, India had an unfiltered politician in Rajiv Gandhi as prime minister. He came with a lot of expectations from the people to do the unexpected. However, in five years, the System showed him that, in a democracy, everyone has to fall in line at least partially if one wants to retain power in the next polls. One can say that even Donald Trump recognizes this as he comes up for re-election in 2020.A lot of the advice in the book feels like plain common sense. I didn't get much out of it as new insights. Still, some readers may find it fast-paced writing and useful advice. "
22,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26676040-michele-feng,5,"I was really intrigued by what was dictated by the ""eulogy values"" outlined in a section of this book. The final definition of success (legacy if you will) is in a person's eulogy. The values engraved as those expressed in eulogies are those that are personal stories that filter messiness of life, many of which bring meaning for life that consequently entail ""cognitive reappraisal"" for an optimistic life. In retrospect, I learned that to have ""grit"" is to just quit (not simply quit, yet strategically so). The ""WOOP"" framework (Wish, outcome, obstacle, plan) if so followed during the peak of anyone's challenges can find solutions without unnecessary and excess turmoil. In the end, I also learned that it is our PERSONAL DEFINITION OF SUCCESS THAT MATTERS THE MOST. The only determent to achieving this is the misplacement of time and effort. So pick your ""pond,"" where one can learn, strengthen and thrive. ""When you align your values with the employment of your signature skills in a context that reinforces these same strengths, you create a powerful and emotionally engaging force for achievement, significance, happiness and legacy.""

23,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4854227-rin,3,"I thought this book was about something else, but instead, it's one of those ""everything you know is wrong"" self-help books I've read 100 times before. I wouldn't have started it had I known that. After all, it did claim it was to discuss the ""science"" of success. However, what they meant was that they were going to use anecdotal stories to sing the same old song to people aiming to move up the corporate ladder. Don't get me wrong, i guess there's nothing wrong with that. I'm just tired of this genre."

But no, this IS a success is as easy as x book, more or less. I'm allergic to books like this and really didn't like it. I was familiar with most of the points he made, and after looking up who this guy is, I'm wondering why anyone should read or trust what this guy has to say. Yes, I should have looked this up before, but I listened to it as an audiobook so my opportunity cost was low."

For the most part, the writing style was not so great. It felt very poppy - here's some advice, and here's a bunch of information distilled from scientific studies to back it up, so now you have to believe my advice. My issue was that a lot of the connections between the studies and his advice seemed strained, if not forced. He also went on long tangents and brought them back to his main point in ways that seemed very contrived.Also, I felt like there was the issue of putting the cart before the horse, e.g. ""you should be nice to people, because nice people are more successful."" Whereas in the absence of a specific moral code, that which is considered good behavior is re-defined based on the author's definition of success, i.e. individual happiness (is what I got from reading it). That said, there was definitely stuff to learn here: - ok first, this was not really one of his main points, but he does say that most people are ambiverts, as opposed to true intro/extroverts - there's a study to back that up (of course). I'm happy he said that and I hope it gets more notice. In the past few years I've noticed it's become rather fashionable to broadcast one's own intro/extro-version, but it's at least remarkable that most of us don't truly fall into either category.- success typically coincides with lots of failure - as in, you have to try a lot, and fail a lot, to be successful. People who fear failure don't usually make it to the tippy-top level.- same goes for giving up. Some things are ok to give up, if they let you focus on something that you can do better at. Feel free to give up things that only add clutter.- use your strengths to make your strengths even stronger. It's good to turn a natural weakness into a strength, but don't do so at the expense of your existing strengths.- be optimistic/positive- gamifying situations is helpful and makes you feel like you have a modicum of control. This can help us be more effective in situations that don't feel doable or inherently rewarding - choose what you focus on, don't just let life happen to you. This was good advice.Overall, a quick read with good advice and a tone which will maybe kind of annoy you at times, but there's not much harm in reading the whole thing to see what you can get out of it."

31,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10603978-jina,5,"Highly recommend. In an easy-to-read style, Eric Barker summarizes and illustrates sociological research with engaging stories. To spoil the ending, the theme is that success in life is not a product of any one trait, but the alignment of your own unique qualities with your job and other aspects of your environment. For example, Glenn Gould was such a sensitive child that if he didn't have parents who were willing and able to provide him with the environment he needed, he probably would have ended up living on the streets instead of a world-famous musician.Key takeaways:* Know your strengths and weaknesses and play to your strengths. (Trite, but Barker illustrates the point well with profiles of people like Gould.)* Figure out which workplaces/clients and situations value your strengths.* When finding workplace fit, look at your potential future coworkers and figure out if you want to become like them. Because they odds are that they'll change you, not that you'll change them.* In negotiation, likability is the most important thing, not being ""tough as nails.""* Curious whether your kid will be successful? Whether kids know their family history is the number one indicator. (Still thinking about that one.)* The way to avoid burnout is actually not less activity but more: we need new challenges to be engaged. (I'd counter-suggest that if you're really far gone with burnout though, you can't engage. We now know that burnout is depression, and depression makes it so you can't enjoy the things you normally would get pleasure from.)* Where does grit come from? Celebrating ""small wins."" This goes with my theory that our lives tend to easily fall into a spiral pattern, and you can either spiral up or spiral down. (I was a bit gratified that near the end of the book, Barker writes, ""If you align your knowledge of yourself with your career and the people around you, it can form an upward spiral that leads to not only career success but also happiness and fulfillment."")* If you've heard of the 10,000 hours idea and wondered how people get there, it's an opportunity cost tradeoff. (Or if you play D&D, it's a min/max your stats kind of situation.) Olympic athletes are masters of this: they weigh every leisure activity against time spent mastering their sport. But on the flip side, Ted Williams and Albert Einstein were a--holes in their relationships.* Before you can be gritty at sticking to something, you'll need to try lots of things and quit most of them. The things you should quit are those that produce no value for you.* You might have heard that visualizing yourself as more fit or successful is the way to go. Actually, no, people who spend a lot of time visualizing make less progress toward their goals. It's like my friend who would enjoy smelling the food so much, she felt like she ate it. Instead of visualizing, think like a coder with a series of if-then statements: ""If X happens, I'll do Y.""* Mentors are vitally important in career advancement. Successful female executives had three and men had two.To return to the point about being an a--hole in relationships: workaholics achieve profound success in the public and professional spheres, but their personal lives are often a mess because you can't apply sequencing to relationships. ""By the time serious problems arise in relationships, it is often too late to repair them."" So work-life balance isn't just a slogan but something you need for a successful life.Sequencing is often recommended to women professionals with the idea being that you really grind on your career in your twenties so you have plenty of money and can then afford the time spent with your career in neutral when you're having kids. But Barker is against it in general. Instead, you need to monitor how you use your time and make sure you have balance between the four key areas of satisfaction: Happiness, Achievement, Significance (to others), and Legacy.Barker has some good points about time optimization: look for hot spots of time poorly spent and change those (have a plan rather than a vague idea of ""working less"") and also double down on the activities that give you a lot of bang for the buck. He mentions Cal Newport (""shallow work stops you from getting fired--but deep work is what gets you promoted"") and Dan Ariely (""We think that we make decisions on our own but the environment influences us to a great degree. Because of that we need to think about how to change our environment"").This interview with Barker touches on some of the main points in the book: https://growthlab.com/dandelions-and-..."
32,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15524919-william-moses-jr,5,"This book is a collection of disparate questions connected by the mechanism the author uses to explore them. Each chapter is an aggregation of some really neat research on a specific facet of what makes people's lives better. Barker presents two contrasting views in the research and then lays out the research backing up each view. It's really quite exciting because Barker is a good writer and keeps you hooked from beginning to end of the book.Chapter 1 is about what kind of environment is right for a person to thrive in. This is tricky to compress into a sentence or two, but essentially there are two types of people: those who might have an interesting gene mutation and those who don't. The ones without mutations might do fine in normal environments, but the ones with mutations need extra care in order for them to flourish. The trade-off is that under the right environments, these people with certain gene mutations might do extraordinarily well, much better than those without.Chapter 2 looks into when to be extra nice and when you don't have to be. Don't be an asshole, but also don't be that guy who has no time for himself because he's always helping everyone. Two hours a week of doing good deeds is optimum.Chapter 3 is all about knowing when to give up, knowing when not to, and figuring out how to build that most important personality trait called grit (hint: it's all about the story you tell yourself about yourself).Chapter 4 is the great introvert/extrovert battle. Extroverts look like they know what's up and this perception gets people to trust them and help them rise. But they might spend too much time schmoozing and less time doing. By contrast, introverts may not be too social, but they know their shit. The solution....know your shit, but also socialize so that others know that you know your shit.Chapter 5 is about believing in yourself and learning how to balance that fine edge between self-confidence and arrogance.Chapter 6 is about work-life balance. Some people work all the time, and they might do great. But the downside is they're probably less happy than those who have a better relationship with loved ones. There's also some research out there that there are massively diminishing returns when working more than 55 hours a week. In other words, it's possible to be really good at work if you put in enough work, and not feel guilty that you're not working hard enough when you're spending time building and maintaining relationships with people."

I liked how it was written, and I liked the way it reminded me or reinforced some of the ideas I knew or assumed. And in some ways, it's better when books repeat techniques to succeed: means there's some consensus around it and not just random guesses.And the most important quote to me was (not word for word): ""When you're joining a company, look at the people. You're going to become like they are, not the other way around"", and I saw it too—when bad culture 'eats' a good person."

Even IQ will not matter much beyond enough (e.g., 120). To succeed, it depends on what is your field. For instance, a successful salesman is likely an extrovert building up social networks that can enhance her chance. An introvert on the other hand has all the time (saved from bar hopping) he needs to become an expert. If you want to be good at your work, do more. Successful people often work 60hr weeks. Confidence helps improve your performance but overconfident people tend to treat others badly. If you want to be happy help your friends without expecting a reward."

The book is a collection of 'wisdoms' about current business activities and philosophies. Very well researched. I picked up a couple of ideas that I had not previously considered, and some were reinforced for me. Examples: flattery (even if not true) almost always works, productivity plunges after 55 hours per week, not getting enough sleep has the same effect as being drunk. Strong finishing element: you must set your own definition of success; success ""relative"" to others is a bad / impossible idea."

40,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55256837-eva-keiffenhem,4,"[ What I want to remember from this book:  - ""Schools reward students who consistently do what they are told. Academic grades correla"
41,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5906019-laureen,4,"When I was in school, good grades meant everything to me. It's where I found my worth, my stability, my personal assurance (accurate or not) that I'd do well later in life. I brought that same focus in raising my children: an emphasis on doing well academically. Good grades = success, right? Or at least a good shot at it?But, think back on those valedictorians from your graduating class. The best of the class, the ones we were sure were going to become millionaires and change the world. What are they doing today? I'd bet they're doing well for themselves, but did they reach the pinnacle of success? Are they changing the world? Well, according to Eric Barker's research, they do well, but rarely go on to become the visionaries, the CEOs, the inventers, the world changers. In fact, he contends that good grades often lead to mediocrity. According to Barker, those who achieve really good grades or score well on standardized tests have only proven they have figured out what school wants from them: that they be good at following rules. Barker argues that they are excellent sheep, not excellent thinkers.It's true- schools reward those that do what they're told. But Barker's research shows that life rewards those that shake things up. Barker contends that what makes you successful in the real world is being different, creative, passionate, visionary. It's most often those that did not do well in school or dropped out who become the millionaires, the billionaires, and go on to change the world (Bill Gates, Walt Disney, Benjamin Franklin, Steve Jobs, James Cameron, Steven Spielberg to name just a few). In fact, according to Barker's research, the average millionaire's GPA in high school was a 2.9. They were not interested in the rules, the way things had always been done, or conforming to what was asked of them. They thought differently, did things differently - and that doesn't often convert into an A.What about extroverts v. introverts when it comes to personal success? I always assumed leadership roles were reserved for the extroverts of the world, not bookworms like me. Extroverts can more easily rise to the top because they enjoy putting themselves out there and in front of the people that need to notice. While extroverts are eager to attend that happy hour where they can network, introverts prefer to take a pass (def me!) and instead code a site, read a book, finish up that project. While Barker confirms that those happy hour drinks will earn extroverts higher wages, it’s the introverts who become true experts in their fields.That makes a lot of sense. Introverts spend much more focused, intensive, private time into their work, developing and fine-tuning their expertise and skill. They're more likely to be disciplined and working furiously at their craft, while extroverts are making the rounds, talking to colleagues, closing that deal. Introverts become the ones sought after in the workforce for their knowledge and field-specific skills as opposed to their schmoozing. Barker emphasizes that one personality style is not better than the other in the workplace. What's important is recognizing your own style and ensuring you're in a position to maximize what you bring to the table.Another factor in personal success depends on the environment you choose. Barker encourages you to take a really good look at the people you're going to be working with. Like I've told my kids, ""You are who you hang out with."" Barker similarly says you're going to become like the people you work with; they aren't going to become like you. If they're negative, you'll eventually become negative too. No matter how good the opportunity is, if it doesn't fit who you are, it won't work.I've read a lot of professional development books lately, and few surprise me, but Barker's books dispelled many assumptions I had as to true markers of success. However, one thing I had to keep in mind the entire time I was reading this was remembering that we all have different definitions of success. Barker is entirely focused on the monetary, ladder-climbing, trail-blazing definition of success while I tend to embrace Ralph Waldo Emerson's:""To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.""With all due respect, I’ll keep that A."
42,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2780292-tadas-talaikis,3,"All is fine, research has something in it, but I can't resist the impression real insights are missing. Correlations doesn't mean you can construct real causes just summing up all the research into words play.I don't have time to ding into broader picture of this, just one example, biggest amount of ""success"" (what majority of people define) depends on environment starting inputs. In other words, be born in the richer family (or just country). All grits and efforts (i.e. alpha) will be greatly influenced by this one beta factor.Second example, someone should ""die"" to create ""success"". If you were born in poorer country, the easiest way to change beta factor is to relocate to richer country, but you would achieve nothing sort of ""success"" there, only your children will have such opportunity, due to ""home bias"". There are other deaths involved, but let's simplify this to this one.Third example, if situation is really bad, someone (usually parents) should work like hell to take their children to higher education. They don't have their own life. And if they're ugly idiots, their children often don't even have a chance to achieve something. Animals don;t think, they just fuck, and then some other ""higher race"" (environment) animal says ""it's ok, it all depends on grit, you can do anything, and if you can't, then I feel bad"". Something like that.Fourth example, in the future, ""measured productivity growth would be close to nil, but also irrelevant to improvement in human welfare"". So, what worked 50 years ago (I guess, provided examples in the book are from that age and plus group) wouldn't necessarily work in the future, if ever works today. The real median income growth over last 31 years in the U.S., despite ""high progress"" and so much work, was ~0.5% per year. Wow, that was great investment in life, isn't it?So, book, like many others, selects some outlier events and make assumptions too broad. The question here is how to increase variability for oneself? I don't know, I don't think variability is so good (in the long run, bigger variability dies quicker - returns to the mean). Those optimists...P.S. Friends just shared one of such ""research"" examples: ""Being optimistic. Seventy-one percent of the self-made millionaires in my study were optimistic about life. Their optimism infected everyone around them. They became magnets for other success-minded people."" Wow, stainless steel logic, assuming that correlation equals causation :-D"

I just loved reading the book. The book is also not too long and thus is able to keep the reader engaged. The author did not drag the book, by including unnecessary and irrelevant stuff. Moreover the book is prescriptive i.e. the author precisely tells you what you should do and what you should not do, he does not try to beat around the bush or give you a multiple choice option and ask you to decide for yourself, he describes each scenario and what you need to do if you find yourself in such a scenario.The author does not ask you to place relationships over success i.e. 10,000 but he gives you a fair warning about what happens when you ignore everything else and get three divorces to become the best hitter in a century.So the author kind of tells you what happens in the future when you make each kind of choice, thus giving a fair warning about the consequences.

53,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34022948-todd,3,"It’s a decent book. If some works are hedgehogs which say one message really effectively throughout, this is more of a fox which conveys several separate linked messages. Most of the time Barker, the author, is a highly persuasive writer. At its best, the book ties together a number of the findings from the literature, and makes use of persuasive anecdotes to illustrate and amplify the findings. And at his best, the author is well-conversant in a broad literature relating to success in business and life, succinctly highlights the findings, and tells informative narratives to round out and bolster the argument. At other times, there is a subtle shift; and rather than simply reviewing the science, he launches into ""self-help author mode"", begins offering prescriptive recommendations, and uses the findings to support and solidify those recommendations. Even if some of those recommendations are sound and are evidence-based, for me and perhaps some other readers as well, it was an unwelcome shift. I found this book on the goodreads 2017 Choice Awards Science & Technology nominees, so would have expected more popular science and less self-help fare. It would likely have been a better book had he committed to one route or the other rather than trying to straddle both. There was a lot of potential since the topic has been so less frequently addressed on the popular science side. Perhaps this books could have used a more thorough editor. Tonally, the author could be a little annoying at times; his attempts to be funny were often cringeworthy. This seems like a minor criticism but, like a movie that repeatedly falls flat trying to break down the fourth wall, it really pulled me out of the flow. In the end, perhaps the service the book does reviewing the literature and pairing that with entertaining and persuasive anecdotes outweighs its other flaws."

65,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52247297-thepagemaster,4,"One reason to read Barking Up The Wrong Tree is all of the fantastic accounts and descriptions of extrordinary individuals' habits and lifestyles. Many of them differ vastly, from the amphetamine fueled excentric pianist Glenn Gould to the historical conqueror Djinghis Kahn (real name appears to be Temujin), it is clear that there is more than one way of making one’s life count. Eric Barker, who is the author of this book certainly acknowledges that, which is one factor contributing to setting it apart from other books dealing with the secret of success that I’ve read.Being aware of the many different ways to do it and how important it is for the reading experience cannot be overstated. Few things infuriate me more than a self help book that falls in love with its own thesis, and in the process of doing so making the content and theories axiomatic. Accordingly, it was refreshing as well as motivating to read this bestseller. It’s one that in my opinion beyond any doubt has earned its sales.A lot of what the author writes about are things I have prior knowledge of. He explains the prisoner’s dilemma, talks about psychometric traits, the Dunning-Kruger effect, reciprocity, priorities, and much more. Much of this is stuff I have heard or read about when learning about psychology. Reading a book where the author appears to have read a lot of the same stuff as I have myself is surely a pleasant experience.Anyone reading a book about success will likely keep an eye out for whatever things they do and think that matches what some of the greats have done. There were lots of things like that in here. It is with a certain sense of satisfaction I can say that I do not suffer from smartphone distractions, social media, and excessive television use, which is something the author mentions one should avoid as it doesn’t serve the goals of highly ambitious people. Barker also tells us the importance of stories, and how our happiness to a large degree consists of what stories our own lives tell, to ourselves and to others. Apparently this is one of the keys in predicting what couples will file for a divorce and who will stay together indefinitely.The book covers such a broad range of perspectives and offers a veritable bonanza of examples, real and fictional, that I think everyone can get something out of reading this. I must say that I was skeptical as I opened the book for the first time, but after a chapter or two I was hooked. If there is anything negative to say, it would be that, like many other authors writing about success, this guy understates the importance of intelligence. The problem I have with it is that it tends to preach (well, preaching isn’t exactly what he does by any stretch of the imagination) the ”tabula rasa” outlook on humanity, which has been proven to be incorrect time and time again. At the same time though, the author expains in a well articulated manner that what we treasure in our pursuits is not so much having control as the feeling of having control, backing it up with references to the amygdala visavi prefrontal cortex. Ergo, if I believe that I can succeed, and I put the proper amount and quality of work in, indeed I can succeed. Furthermore, Barker goes at great length to clarify the importance of ”finding the right pond”. Regardless of intelligence, cognitive abilities, and other skills, being true to oneself, being realistic, and with the appropriate level of bravado (whether legit or not), one should find him or herself gravitating to the right field of work. Because of the things I’ve mentioned in this paragraph, not obsessing over the importance of IQ doesn’t hurt the credibility of the book much. 40 (yes, 40) pages of references should support that position.A sign one is reading a masterpiece of a book is that one reiterates and shares some of the information when engaging in social interaction, be it at work or otherwise. Another is feeling that reading it again would be rewarding. This one yielded both effects. Of the many things worthy of praise the reader can find in it is the writing style. It’s easy to follow while still being very articulate. It’s also not written without a sense of humor, and the author references back to earlier chapters in a very clever way that had me smiling on multiple occasions. In other words: Barker finds that elusive balance between facts and personal touch that very few manage to do. This is almost a perfect book, and a must read for sure.4.5/5"
66,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50877332-wes-de-silvestro,5,"Barking Up the Wrong Tree covers six common parables regarding success and discusses them in-depth. At first, I was tempted to contextualize each chapter as covering a ""myth"" regarding success where Barker busts or confirms these overstated one-liners. In reality though, he takes a much more nuanced view, choosing to discuss both sides of the issue and not always painting one as better than the other.I read this book quite fast while on a short January trip to Mexico City. Waiting in line at a pandería or while driving about in an Uber, I always found myself opening up iBooks to tackle a few more pages of this book. Barker writes in an incredibly colloquial manner, almost as if he's writing advice to a set of friends who receive his weekly email newsletter. Since Barking Up the Wrong Tree originally started as a blog adventure for him, the writing style makes sense. It's quite the readable book and is peppered with short little anecdotes that are insanely interesting and surprisingly novel (usually I've heard all of them before in these sort of books).This book is well-researched and backed up by a lot of examples. I honestly found valuable takeaways and actionable insights to adjust my behavior in every chapter. I was expecting a lot of redundancy, yet due to its structure, this book was devoid of much fluff. It was a real page-turner and quite the interesting read!What blew me away the most about Barking Up the Wrong Tree was the ending. The last 50 pages or so are fantastic. Barker essentially presents an argument for work-life balance that goes something like this: ""You need to decide on what matters to you in life. You will never be the best in a field unless you truly dedicate 100% of your life to that pursuit and fall up short in all other categories of existing. Give up on relationships, personal happiness, and balance if you want to be the best. For most people, this isn't what they really want. So you need to instead decide what is *good enough* for you. At what point will you stop and say enough is enough?""I found this insanely empowering and wonderfully written. Honestly, most of the work-life balance advice out there just advocates for drawing clear boundaries, but misses the point. Barker comes right out and says it: ""Achieving work-life balance means giving up being the best because there is always someone out there who doesn't value healthy balance as much as you do. There's always someone who will go the extra mile and beat you because you decided that balance was something you cared about. But that's okay because perfectionism is overrated."" How often do you hear this? Literally never. You never hear anyone admit that the reason work-life balance is so hard isn't because it's difficult to draw boundaries, but because we need to reframe our attitude about success altogether. Sure, you'll never be as rabidly successful as some other people out there, but their entire definition of success is different. Be confident in what you want and be comfortable having an impactful yet balanced life.Barking Up the Wrong Tree is a really refreshing book. Rather than providing tools and tricks to manage your time just slightly better than you usually can, the book seeks to actively transform your perspective about what success and time management are entirely. Read this book and question everything you know about success!"

The most surprising part of the book was the examples he chose for you to emulate - pirates, gang members, and raccoons for example. There are good tips here and I especially liked the stuff on work-life balance. To give you context, I am back in college after many years away and so thoughts of my future and what I want to do with it are looming large and I am fascinated by any book that purports to tell me how to proceed. This book doesn't fail to do that, it just wasn't as surprising as it advertised itself to be. Maybe if they hadn't oversold it so heavily it would have felt more surprising than it actually was. Was it useful? I think so. Did it bring anything new or different to the table? Well, the writing style was fresh and the examples were clever, but I'm not sure I learned anything I didn't already know. Was it worth the read? For me it was, but I'm a sucker for all things psychology. If you're not as fascinated as I am by psychology, maybe it won't be as much fun for you. I will say that I'm sick to death of titles that read like a prologue. Seriously, how many words does one title really need? In this case it actually set the book up for failure since it couldn't deliver on the promise.I give it three and a half stars from an ex psychology major but your mileage may differ."
70,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71874668-saarebas,4,"This is a fast and simple read without much of a challenge and frankly, predictable bottom lines... but it's not a bad book, just when you read self-help and success/productivity books, you should expect them to overlap,  a lot. PROS.- Looks at both sides of the argument, like Extroverts vs. Introverts or Never giving up Vs. Giving up. While providing the positive and negative to both. Overall it's an interesting and more unique approach that allows you to think about a lot of this as more of a spectrum than a black/white argument.- Funny, the narrative voice is easy to digest and even though a seasoned 'self-help' book lover will likely have heard most of these ideas, the voice is developed enough to be simply entertaining read.- Has interesting and insightful stories about people, which is arguably the most valuable part of this book. CONS.- The writing is disjointed in the sense that there's a lot of jumping from one point to the other. - Since such a small book tries to cover so many topics and ideas, there's hardly a dissection of them, just a brief glance before we are forced to move forward due to the fast pace. Also, can we just appreciate the sheer genius of a book being called ""Barking up the wrong tree"" when the author is Eric Barker. Comedic gold right there. "

The advantage is that it presents several opposing positions and analyzes them, actions such as working a lot or little, sleeping a lot or little, studying a lot or little, imposing on others or listening to them, giving to others or seeking to obtain things from them, etc.Perhaps the most important lesson of the book is that a leader is given in the right place at the right time. Bill Gates and Mike Zuckerberg would not only have been ordinary people in the Middle Ages, but would probably have been killed young. And Genghis Khan probably would not have been a leader in our time ...The lesson: look for what you like to do and do it as long as you can, enjoy it. Do it in the right place and at the right time.

72,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27524357-benjamin,4,"This is basically a summary and simultaneous critique of self help books. As such it has a lot going for it. It's main strength lies in concisely comparing both sides of an issue, such as extroversion vs, introversion, throwing in a few antidotes to keep your interest, and then seeking a synthesis or paradigm shift on the topic. As an example, it's not so such an issue of high or low self-esteem (both have major pitfalls) but self-compassion to allow yourself to fail and know when to be hard on yourself to achieve results.Also appreciated is a close and thoughtful look at ""successful"" people and what they had to sacrifice. In this way it avoids hero worship and survivor-ship bias while still seeing what us mere mortals can learn about getting ahead. If there's one flaw, it's that this is obviously aimed at middle class professionals with ample disposable income and/or job options. #Marxism"

Then, I wanted to read the chapter again to make sure I didn't forget anything.So, if conscious living is an interesting topic for you, read this book. Really. It's fun to read and so insightful. A very enjoyable synthesis of pop and some real science. It probably perfectly addresses the common ""millennial-aspirations"".Just do not consider it as prescription. See it more as an inspiration to work on any of the great life-related topics Eric mentions.If you have read a lot of books about productivity and any of the popular success-related topics, it is probably nothing too surprising.

It quotes extensively from other self help books, whereas I would have been more interested to read about original research. The author excels at telling short parables, and hinting that they reveal a ""science-based"" truth, but the book lacks the single-minded focus that Malcolm Gladwell brings to his books, where every story relates back to one concept like thin-slicing or practicing for 10,000 hours. Instead, Barker offers a handful of fairly generic proverbs as the book's organizing principles, and sometimes he strains to connect the science-ey examples to his proverbs. They are:1. Choose the field where you will compete. 2. Make friends. 3. Be generous. 4. Forgive. 5. Take risks. 6. Either show ""grit"" or change course, depending on the situation.One unfortunate authorial decision: He praises Genghis Khan's management techniques.

Through really interesting stories and great examples this author shares insights I had never considered and literally gave me one of the biggest a-ha moments I have had in a long, long time.

It interlaces and presents general knowledge in such a way that the author can fill several pages per chapter with absolute emptiness. The statements of each chapter can easily be limited to 1-2 lines. At this point I must praise the author. He has talents which make him useless as a writer, but which certainly hold enormous value elsewhere - selling the simplest facts as deeper insights. As a guru or politician he would be outstanding. The best tips from this book:- Know your weaknesses and use your strengths- It is important to set goals- A mentor and teacher can support your learning processCourageous and revolutionary.

Like most things balance is required for the long term, Eric Barker has done an amazing job highlighting and going in detail on both aspects of the story. Some things might seem contradictory but they are not, he's just giving both sides a fair argument, and implementation is up to you (balance). You have to read this to really appreciate some of the ideas in it. Thank you, Eric Barker, for this.

I found the examples very engaging which didn’t only illustrate the theories presented and made the book more relatable but also presented a lot of new facts about different people and events I was not aware of. I didn’t give this book 5 stars because I felt that the author was diving into too much details in his examples that eventually would bore me. Sometimes I felt like “ok, I got the point, let’s move on now” or sometimes it felt that the author was stating the obvious.Nevertheless, I think it’s a really good read either if one is looking for advise on how to progress in their career or needs a little push in order to start making things in life happen.

In this book, you can find plenty of examples that it's not a problem at all (maybe that asshole thing is:). "

95,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31099416-doug-bernard,5,One of the best I’ve read on the topic of directing your professional/life trajectory. The final chapter will be referenced frequently.

I'm even going to send it to the people who mentored me over the years as a thank you. It has so much of what I love from so many other books, all in one place. it's tough to encourage people to read a book, let alone 45 of your favorites. Now I don't have to. A good chunk of it is all right here."

101,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15744669-kit,1,"I got as far as the author revering Winston Churchill as being one of the greatest world leaders ever, without acknowledging his imperialist and racist policies towards Indians during WWII, and put the book down. That is to say, I didn’t make it past the first chapter. "
102,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51132878-chrisjan-gilfillan,5,What a book. So many questions answered. Especially those you didn’t think you had. 
103,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63009654-aneta,5,Great. For me this is one of 'it changed me' books.

105,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,5,"""Why elevators have mirrors?"" I had relatively low expectations about this book when reading the initial book description but I was pleasantly surprised, there were plenty of new interesting examples and mixing the principles from various other books. The book came from Michael Bungay Stainier's (The Coaching Habit) TOP20 recommendations list and so far the books from the list have not disappointed. I would say that it's to some degree similar to another book that I read some time ago: ""You are not so smart.."". Yet I did not find out what this guy has against Moldova...Got at least three new good quotes from the book:“Warren Buffett, “The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say no to almost everything.”Author Tony Schwartz says, “Energy, not time, is the fundamental currency of high performance.” (I have been focusing on maximizing my energy levels during the past few years). As Henry David Thoreau said, “The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.” “Warren Buffett sums that up: “I always worry about people who say, ‘I’m going to do this for ten years; I really don’t like it very well. And then I’ll do this . . .’ That’s a lot like saving sex up for your old age. Not a very good idea.”“As the old saying goes, “You can do anything once you stop trying to do everything.”“Following the rules doesn’t create success; it just eliminates extremes—both good and bad. While this is usually good and all but eliminates downside risk, it also frequently eliminates earthshaking accomplishments. It’s like putting a governor on your engine that stops the car from going over fifty-five; you’re far less likely to get into a lethal crash, but you won’t be setting any land speed records either. So if those who play by the rules don’t end up at the very top, who does?” “So what is meaning? Meaning, for the human mind, comes in the form of the stories we tell ourselves about the world. This is why so many people believe in fate or say things were “meant to be.” Having a story about the meaning of life helps us to cope with hard times. Not only do we naturally see the world this way, but frankly we can’t not tell stories.” “You need a personal definition of success. Looking around you to see if you’re succeeding is no longer a realistic option. Trying to be a relative success compared to others is dangerous. This means your level of effort and investment is determined by theirs, which keeps you running full speed all the time to keep up.” “The hard-charging Silicon Valley entrepreneur has become a respected, admired icon in the modern age. Do these descriptors match the stereotype? A ball of energy. Little need for sleep. A risk taker. Doesn’t suffer fools gladly. Confident and charismatic, bordering on hubristic. Boundlessly ambitious. Driven and restless. Absolutely. They’re also the traits associated with a clinical condition called hypomania. Johns Hopkins psychologist John Gartner has done work showing that’s not a coincidence. Full-blown mania renders people unable to function in normal society. But hypomania produces a relentless, euphoric, impulsive machine that explodes toward its goals while staying connected (even if only loosely) with reality."""

107,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8756914-anshul-agrawal,4,"This is a good book. Most claims are backed by studies so you are not reading anecdotal claims. One qualm that I have is that the language is over-simplified to make sure everyone understands it. If the author had described in a little bit of detail about some of the experiments, it would have been nice. But overall I would definitely suggest this book. "
108,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2142963-annie,5,Loved it!!!
109,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11798849-andrew-wong,5,This is easily my new favorite book! The author does such a phenomenal job of weaving fascinating insights into the world together with seemingly random yet intriguing narratives. I wish I could write a book like this.
110,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47796132-camilla-barrow,5,"Excellent book. I can't stop telling people to read it. I love how he tells both sides of the story. I also like to see the positives and negatives about what we usually consider ""right and wrong"". Author is candid and relatable. Highly recommend. Only reason I read this book is because I liked the narrator (same one as who did The subtle art of not giving a F***) am so glad I did though."
111,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47100455-tomasz-cholewa,5,"One of the best books I've read - so many facts based on research, interesting anectodes and many more. Very interesting and eye-opening on many aspects of so-called ""success"". I highly recommend! "
112,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23882275-lasse-olsen,5,"I bought this book because Tun Urban recommended it and hot damn I’m not disappointed. It’s easily my book of 2019. I’m bummed out that I’ve finished it, but it’s a book that deserves several re-reads because of all the stories and research. "
113,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91177171-ian,4,"Very enjoyable read, and challenges this traditional notion of what it is to be ""successful"""
114,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44237394-tm,5,"This is probably the best self-help book I've ever read. I was never bored whilst reading any section of this book (something that is inevitable, I find, when reading self-help books), and the author has a really nice sense of humor.I learned so many important things, and I never would have realized the importance of relationships. This book was extremely eye-opening, and I'm glad I picked this up. 10/10 would recommend!!!"
115,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5751309-alina-lundholm,4,I really hate how much longer it takes me to read nonfiction books because this was quite a nifty one. Shoutout to Max Joseph's Youtube video BOOKSTORES for introducing me to this author and book. Check this book and that video out for some excellent and thought-provoking material :)
116,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44656259-gemma-cortadellas,5,"Absolutely adored this book, the variety and the storytelling. He took stories and content from many different sources and put everything together beautifully. An amazing read on success from many points of view."
117,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28880221-heather,4,"This is a very comprehensive and entertaining summary on the research literature on success. He does a great job of using humor and stories to make the points. Because I read a ton of books in this area for me much of it of review, however in my opinion it would be a great choice for someone who wants to read one book on the subject that would have lots of takeaways. I don't do this often, but I will likely read it again to try to remember more of the main points."
118,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31999202-robert-sutherland,5,"The ""everything you've heard is wrong"" genre can be quite annoying. This one isn't, though. ""Barking Up the Wrong Tree"" gives ambiguous, situational answers to complicated questions. Is it better to be selfless or self-serving? It depends. Is it better to be excellent or just good enough? It depends. Grit or quit? It depends. You get the point. You can answer questions simply, or you can look at it from different angles. That's what Barker does. He doesn't present anything new--this is a ""greatest hits"" of research from many different studies, none his. But what he does is synthesize these into a coherent, entertaining personal betterment manual. Some of it is downright entertaining when learning about the surprisingly modern aspects of the economic system of pirates or the history of the 19th century Emperor of the United States. The best part of the book is that it can send you in so many different directions for your next read to dig deeper into some of these topics. Which one should I read next? It depends."
119,0062416170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1039571-joseph,5,"just read the first 2 chapters. I have read about game theory and the most optimal solution to it (tit for tat) elsewhere. This book summarizes many of such good concepts. I think it is a good read to provide an overview. Can delve further into the original source if any of the concepts interest you moreFinal reviewThe author talks about 5 to 6 topics, presenting both sides of the coin before drawing a line in the sand. I like all the topics, and as I have read in depth about game theory previously, his coverage on the topic aligned much with my previous understanding. I especially like the topic on optimism vs pessimism and his middle ground. ""Self compassion"" helps me a lot as I quickly put it into practice."
