1,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,2,"FINAL REVIEW: October 23, 2010 ""Proofiness"" by Charles Seife is a well-intentioned book that suffers a definite crisis of identity. The jacket blurb and author's introduction promise a guided tour of the seamy underworld of statistical malpractice, that is, an account of the most common ways data are misrepresented or misinterpreted in the media, either through carelessness or because of a deliberate effort to mislead. Seife is not the first author to consider the issue of misleading data analysis; his book carries on a tradition that dates back as far as Darrell Huff's ""How to Lie with Statistics"", with contributions from Edward Tufte (""The Visual Display of Quantitative Information""), or last year's excellent ""The Numbers Game: The Commonsense Guide to Understanding Numbers in the News, in Politics, and in Life"" by Michael Blastland and Andrew Dilnot. There is a major gap between what ""Proofiness"" promises and what Seife actually delivers. The first hundred pages are roughly what one might expect: graphical deception by use of misleading labels or scales, comparison of apples and oranges (e.g. dollar amounts unadjusted for inflation, absence of an appropriate control group, regression to the mean), cherry-picking of data, the tendency to interpret mere random variation as systematic, nonsensical conclusions obtained by extrapolating beyond the range of observed data, overstatement of the precision of measurements, the way in which humans are hard-wired to misinterpret risk and deal poorly with calculations involving risk. Seife's exposition of these topics is lively and clear (with the major caveat discussed below). About halfway through the chapter on risk, however, he makes a major detour. His discussion of the malfeasance of those involved in the Enron debacle, the Bernie Madoff pyramid scheme, the failures at AIG, Citigroup and other institutions, and the subsequent bailout efforts has almost nothing to do with statistical trickery, focusing instead on the public policy and regulatory issues raised by the financial meltdown. The next chapter, ""Poll Cats"" does return to the issues involved in conducting accurate sample surveys and presenting the data appropriately, with a reasonably clear discussion of systematic error versus random error. However, the following two chapters, ""Electile Dysfunction"" and ""An Unfair Vote"", taking up some 80 pages, really have little to do with data-related issues. Instead they provide a review of events surrounding the Florida vote count in the 2000 presidential election, the six-month circus that took place before Al Franken was eventually declared winner in the 2008 Minnesota Senate race, and a review of historical and present-day gerrymandering efforts whenever congressional redistricting comes up for discussion. Not that Seifen's review of the relevant events, and the issues they raise, is not interesting - it just seems to belong in a different book, as does the appendix in which he discusses electronic voting. In making this criticism, I take the view that fraud, malfeasance and corruption stemming from poor public policy, faulty regulatory mechanisms, or inadequate enforcement of existing protections, really are subjects for a different kind of book than that initially described by Seifen. Though the author does return to his initial remit in the final two chapters (discussing abuse of probability and statistical arguments within the judicial system, and for propaganda purposes), overall the book does not make a coherent whole.The caveat mentioned above, regarding Seife's exposition methods, is a major one, and prevents me from giving this book my endorsement, despite its good intentions. It's evident right there in the book's faux-cute title, ""Proofiness"". I wish I could say that the author offers a rigorous definition of exactly what he means by this invented term, but he doesn't. It remains unhelpfully vague throughout the book. Sadly, it's not the only example of authorial neologism run amok. ""Disestimation"", ""Potemkin numbers"", ""randumbness"", ""regression to the moon"", and the horrendous coinage ""causuistry""; each of these is a neologism that adds nothing to the discussion. Many of them lack a clear definition, or when a definition is offered, the term just seems to muddy the waters. For instance, Seife uses ""disestimation"" to mean ""overstatement of the precision of a number or measurement"", indicating an error related to precision. But the 'dis'-prefix clearly suggests a systematic error, as does the parallelism with ""misestimation"", which statisticians routinely use to indicate a systematic error. And while one applauds the author's efforts to educate his readership about the error of mistaking correlation for causation, the term ""causuistry"" is simply an abomination. I'm not sure where this recent trend for authors to invent their own faux-cutesy terminology, where none is needed, originates (possibly Malcolm Gladwell bears some of the responsibility), but I wish it would end. Though I am sympathetic to the author's stated aims, his execution was such that I cannot endorse this book. A better bet would be ""The Numbers Game: The Commonsense Guide to Understanding Numbers in the News, in Politics, and in Life"" by Michael Blastland and Andrew Dilnot. ***************************************************initial comments below:One of the benefits of retiring from my career as a statistician is that I no longer feel it's my personal responsibility to alert friends and colleagues to the myriad ways they are being misled or deceived by the kind of abominably poor summarization of data that's pretty much the norm these days. It's just as well - who wants to be that guy, the crank at the table who people start to inch away from surreptitiously, avoiding eye contact all the while?Not that I endorse misleading or deceptive data presentation - far from it. Now more than ever, as we all struggle to make sense of the avalanche of information that constantly assails us, the capacity for critical, intelligent interpretation is vital. So it's important to be able to see through the most prevalent fallacies in data interpretation, not to mention data presentation strategies deliberately intended to mislead. Sadly, just mentioning the word ""statistics"" has a demonstrable eye-glazing effect on all but the nerdiest adults. This latest book by Charles Seife has the laudable goal of overcoming the MEGO* reflex and educating the reader about some of the most common types of statistical malpractice out there, continuing a tradition established by such authors as Darrell Huff (""How to Lie With Statistics""), John Paulos (""Innumeracy"") or the authors of last year's highly successful  ""The Numbers Game"" (Michael Blastland and Andrew Dilnot).I will write a more complete review of this book in due course. For now, I can only remark that, although I was completely predisposed to like it, Charles Seife has already committed crimes against the language that are regrettable, to say the least. The hideous coinage ""Proofiness"" is an obvious example; the abominable term ""disestimation"" is another. It remains to be seen whether these lapses are merely aesthetic, or whether Seife is guilty of the greater sin of coining faux-cutesy terms with definitions so fuzzy that they're meaningless. *** MEGO = ""my eyes glaze over""** a Gladwellian tic that has, unfortunately, been widely copied."
2,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"As our society becomes ever-more data-driven, I am increasingly interested in reading books such as Proofiness: The Dark Arts of Mathematical Deception. I want to know how numbers, algorithms, data, and mathematics are being used (or abused) to make decisions, mount arguments, and influence the course of civilization. Sound lofty? Good. Charles Seife’s incisive and interesting writing brings this topic to life. With clear, topical examples, he shows us how misunderstanding or misplaced faith in numbers and measurements can lead to us making decisions on false pretenses.Seife begins by examining what we mean when we throw around big numbers, such as “sixty-five million years” as the age of a dinosaur fossil. He defines disestimation, a fallacy whereby we assume something is more accurate if it is more precise. Seife wants to establish from the outset that there are limitations to our ability to measure the real world, and that not being aware of these limitations is where a lot of people go wrong, even if they have no intention of misleading or misrepresenting. From there, Proofiness veers more into political territory. With occasional glances at advertising copy, Seife smoothly discusses problems with polling, vote-counting, etc., with examples from such high-profile events as the disputed election of Al Franken in Minnesota or Bush v. Gore in Florida, 2000.For a popular math book, there isn’t that much actual math in here (which I suspect most readers will consider a good thing). There’s some basic statistics and probability, nothing you haven’t seen before in high school, and then a little more intense discussion relegated to the appendices. Seife’s explanation how an “average” change in something like, say, salaries or taxes, can be very misleading is very appropriate for contemporary readers in an age where American politicians are trying to pass tax reform that only helps the wealthy.Speaking of relevance, parts of Proofiness do feel a little aged seven years on. Seife pulls from such events as the Vietnam War and OJ Simpson’s murder trial. This is the double-edged sword of trying to teach these concepts with real-world examples. I’d love to see an update to this book where he talks about the more recent presidential elections, or the Brexit referendum, etc. The subject matter here is still so relevant!As a mathematician, I can’t say I learned a lot from this book; it felt very familiar. But most of Seife’s explanations are lucid and lovely. I appreciate how he points out that both the left and right are guilty of proofiness—this is not a matter of political ideology but of desire for political power through any means necessary. For a lay reader, this book will probably be a welcome primer that doesn’t overstay its welcome but will leave you wanting to learn more.

3,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13166784-adrian-fridge,4,"Slightly outdated but still very, very enlightening.If you want to learn about the ways people twist math and statistics to meet their agendas, then there's a whole lot of good stuff in here. Stuff like the 2000 American presidential election or several of the cases Supreme Justice Scalia (now deceased) was a part of.I enjoyed the parts about statistical error versus systemic error, as in when the news media say their polls are within a 3% margin of error, they're talking about statistics. This error does not take into account the quality of the question or the pool of respondents, just the mathematical probability of chaos adding noise to the results.It also goes into causation versus correlation, cherry-picking, and the way sets of data are skewed to look more favorable than they really are.Simple language, nice charts/graphs for emphasis, and unbiased politics (the American system is corrupt from both sides).I have a few issues with tone (he takes this one anecdote about fossils a little too seriously to prove a point) and gender bias (the part about abortion, in particular, is a bit victim blamey), but those sections are small in comparison to the whole book. Overall this is a good read, especially nowadays with the 2016 election coming."
4,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,4,The book is worth reading for its expose of Supply Side economics and Anton Scalia's hypocrisy about capital punishment alone. I belong to neither party and am a skeptic. I suspect the hostility to this book by some is because of the dissection of these two myths they cherish.
5,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1598384-jim,4,In which it is noted the statistic that the average male has slept with seven women in his lifetime and and the average women has slept with four men in her lifetime.
6,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,4,"Fun, entertaining, wince-inducing, and informative.Pros: Increased awareness of the dominant ways numbers and statistics can be exploited/manipulated/colored to support statements which those same data do not actually support, or represent something as more meaningful than it really is.Cons: I kept getting visions of Stephen Colbert, because Seife has this thing for coining terms. It got me irritated quickly (please stop trying to be a hipster?!). Surely there are proper terms for these concepts he's enumerating, use them! Coining these made-up goofy words seemed to me almost like he was trying to pass these phenomena as his own novel discoveries. Nope. He's just a journalist (informed by his math education). I suppose doing this can make the point more memorable, especially for laypeople, but it also inhibits communication in that you need to have read his work in order to know his definitions and then relate.That nit aside, it's well worth the read. Better awareness of probability and statistics helps you to evaluate and understand presented data. Just knowing the common forms of manipulation of this data can go a long way toward insulating you from being told what to think, by someone who claims authority.The most memorable passages for me dealt with the terrible miscarriages of justice precipitated by ""The Prosecutor's Fallacy"". Failing to place probabilities in context with rates of incidence can lead thoughtful people straight off a judgmental cliff. It's motivated me to study this more."
7,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5077264-bill,2,"It was a decent treatment of an extremely important subject -- mathematical and statistical literacy -- with some very disheartening case studies. Enjoyable read, except...I would have given it three stars if not for the author's annoying decision to invent a cutesy vocabulary around the topic. The title was just the tip of that iceberg. Very distracting."
8,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2050909-tonstant-weader,5,"I would say this is my MUST READ of the year. It's a witty exploration of the many ways numbers mislead us. We are programmed to believe numbers. If someone tells you that x is faster than y, well, that could be debatable. But if they tell you that x is 3 times faster than y, we accept it. We even accept people telling us that this group of people is 2 times happier than that group when happiness is something we don't even know how to measure. A spoonful of sugar may help the medicine go down, but a number will make us swallow anything. Seife explores the many forms of mathematical fallacies that trap us and gives them clever names such as randumbness and causistry (a mathematical casuistry) and many others. He uses current and historical examples of proofiness and demonstrates again and again and again who the use and abuse of numbers and our credulous acceptance of numerical propaganda is damaging our lives, our health and our democracy. I loved Seife's early book, Zero, Biography of an Idea. This book brought less joy as some of the examples are infuriating, but he still has a clever and light touch that makes books about math easy and interesting. I must confess, though, that his information on the derailing of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1982 left me stunned and seething. To keep the story to its most basic level, fraudulent test results were knowingly cooked up and released by a hawkish neocon in the Reagan White House to a complicit and equally hawkish NYT reporter. The false data was successful in derailing the treaty (which remains stalled to this day) but subsequently it was proved that not only was the data false, but it was deliberately and knowingly falsified for the specific purpose of breaking down the peace talks. I have to ask if it would have made a difference 20 years later when the case for the Iraq War was being made if it were widely known that the 1982 leaker was Richard Perle and the conniving and complicit reporter responsible for the false stories that derailed the treaty was Judith Miller. Why were they able to say anything that anyone anywhere would take seriously? Why, when there were questions about the accuracy of the WMD stories did not one say RICHARD PERLE AND JUDITH MILLER LIED IN 1982? Did no one think that was relevant?"
9,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502486-ann-g,4,"Did you know that there is a statistical basis for an unequivocal legal decision of how the Gore/Bush presidential election should have been decided? Have you ever heard a drug company or a politician or pundit make a claim involving numbers and had a nagging feeling that something wasn't quite right? Have you ever heard one of those claims and not really questioned it? People who want to make a points or reach a certain outcome use - and abuse - numbers all the time. In this entertaining, accessible, yet highly informative book, Seife keys us into the many ways in which numbers are manipulated and just plain gotten wrong - some of which have far-reaching consequences indeed. However, it should be noted that Seife sometimes falls victim to the very things of which he warns, drawing unwarranted conclusions and oversimplifying some complicated discussions. I had some outside knowledge about a couple of technical issues; someone unfamiliar with the specific subjects he was discussing could easily accept his argument unquestioningly, which is precisely what he's warning against. This is a small quibble, however, as it happens rarely and doesn't take away from the main points Seife is making, namely that the presentation of numbers can drastically affect what they may seem to mean. And even if you're statistically well-educated, you'll learn something. (I still can't get over the answer to the election issue ...)"
10,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63946505-b-j-marshall,1,"Terrible book. The author is biased and makes nonsensical value judgments about the same misrepresentation of math being worse when applied to one side versus the other. For instance, claims that any proof exonerating an accused person is ""sacred."" Howls about miscalculation that indicates felony convictions are only wrong 0.027% of the time when his estimate is 5% of the time. As if a 95% success rate isn't pretty good.Moreover, on the technical side, he seems not to understand the difference between accuracy and precision. If he does, he never broaches it in the book, and mischaracterizes them together. In discussing polling, he talks about reducing the error of margin through large sample sizes, then states there are in fact much larger uncertainties because of systematic biases. This is really an issue of precision and accuracy not being linked in any way. His ""mathematical"" description of the 95% confidence interval in an appendix fails to be mathematical and barely even mentions confidence or that there are different intervals one could use.All in all, aside from the hilarious anecdote about the Lizard People ballot in the 2008 Minnesota election, this book is abysmal and unlikely to help anyone understand mathematical and statistical arguments more clearly. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!"
11,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3250760-chris-aldrich,4,"He doesn't prove that mathematics is essential for a democracy, but he certainly shows how the lack of proper use of mathematics can fray heavily at the edges!This was a great book to have read over a long Fourth of July holiday. Though many people may realize some of the broad general concepts in the book it's great to have a better structure for talking about things like Potemkin numbers, disestimation, fruit packing, cherry picking, apple polishing, comparing apples to oranges, causuistry, randnumbness, regression to the moon, tragedy of the commons, and moral hazard amongst others. If you didn't think mathematics was important to daily life or our democratic society, this book will certainly change your mind.Seife covers everything from polls, voting, politics, economics, marketing, law, and even health to show how numbers are misused in a modern world that can ill-afford to ignore what is really going on around us.This is a fantastic book for nearly everyone, but I'd highly recommend it for high school students while taking civics."
12,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,3,"Well, now we're all depressed. This book details the ways that governments, businesses, and journalists manipulate numbers to make them do or say what they want. This controls our behavior, disenfranchises people, and creates injustice of many kinds. I already knew most of these ways numbers are manipulated, but it's a valuable book for those that have not heard it before. I think in particular this should be one we have high school students read before we send them out into the world to work or study. My one complaint about this book is that Seife starts inventing his own silly words to refer to different types of lying with numbers. I found it really unnecessary and annoying. However, the rest of the content here is good and important to understand. To the unwary statistics can lie to you all the time."
13,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7820883-susan,5,"This book is EXCELLENT. I hate statistics and am forced to teach it again and again only because my students hate it even more than I do, and I enjoyed this book VERY much. In addition to being the first math book to make me laugh out loud, the writing is extremely clear and accessible, not to mention logically organized with plenty of real life examples. I did some background research and generally speaking math professors seem to tentatively approve of this book, so now I'm re-writing parts of my stats lecture based on stuff in this book. The case studies, I'm thinking, would be a great way to take the material from theoretical to applied, especially if I can integrate in current news articles."
14,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2798060-pamela-huxtable,4,"This was an extraordinary exposé of the deceptive nature of the numbers that inform us. Polls, advertising, the census, the judicial system - no one is exempt from the problems inherent in proofiness.Seife does an excellent job of keeping his terminology light and humorous. This is a welcome addition to a book that otherwise might be a depressing and overwhelming indictment of our political and juducial systems. The concepts are complicated, the stakes are high, and Seife communicates it all with style. I promise that you will never accept a number at face value again."
15,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35461072-rayfes-mondal,5,"Insightful. Elections aren't as simple as they seem and neither is the census. How people use mathematical ""proofiness"" to mislead others. This isn't a theoretical book. The real world examples are all too real and even though it was written almost 10 years ago it feels even more relevant today. "
16,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19658976-brett-t,2,"When his show premiered in 2005, comedian Stephen Colbert put the word ""truthiness"" into the English language as a description of something that sounds like it should be true but isn't. It's often used today when talking about how to state something so that it sounds like it is true, even if the speaker is uncertain or may even know it is likely false.In 2010, mathematician and science writer Charles Seife used the same concept to title his book on misleading uses of math Proofiness, holding that politicians, public relations spokespeople, advertisers and others often used what sounded like solid and irrefutable mathematics to make their claims look true. But although the numbers might be real, there were always caveats in their preparation that were left to the fine print (or even left out), and overly credulous media outlets would not do the checking necessary to question them.Seife spends the first third of the book talking directly about the ways that statistics can be manipulated and misunderstood. Survey size samples, margins of error, failure to adjust monetary amounts for inflation, lack of control groups, and so on are all brought out and Seife usually offers a real-world example of how they were used to mislead people. When he turns to elections, he points out how a small enough percentage gap between vote totals means that, for all practical purposes, the election is a tie. ""Systemic error"" in any method of tallying ballots prevents 100 percent accuracy -- so both the 2000 Florida presidential and the 2008 Minnesota senate elections should have been redone, because the size of the systemic error exceeded the gap between the candidates.But he also spends a lot of time talking about public policy regarding the 2008 financial crisis and the electoral politics of redistricting and gerrymandering, which seem to wander afield from the central discussion of the misuses and trickery of math in modern media and politics. They have a tangential relationship to the core subject, but the extensive sections on financial regulation policies, the disputed elections and gerrymandering feel more like illustrations run amok. Seife's book might best be paired with some other examinations of the same problems, which may win out in sharpness of focus but which lag significantly behind him in writing style, liveliness and clarity of explanation.Original available here."
17,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33670963-sarahj33,4,"There's a dangerous truth that every marketer and pundit instinctively knows, but that public often forgets - we will believe anything if there's a number attached to it. In Proofiness, Charles Seife is on a crusade to educate the world and stem the rising tide of mathematical malfeasance. With clarity, wit, and just the right amount of outrage, Proofiness is a fascinating and appalling look at how numbers are used and abused in our society. I personally found this book engrossing, and I think if it was required reading for society, it might solve a lot of problems. My one complaint is that Seife had cutesy names for a lot of the tactics he discussed - 'randumbness' was probably the worst. Although I suppose I should have seen that coming in a book called ""Proofiness."" Sometimes it was hard to tell what he was just making up words for and what were real terms. But other than that the writing was very clear, and helped me understand some concepts that I probably knew at one time but forgot when I went to theatre school. I don't think you have to particularly love reading about math to enjoy this book. As Seife frequently reminds the reader, the numbers in this book represent real things, not mathematical ideals, and it's the real world that suffers the consequences of misused math. Seife really hits his groove when talking about anything he perceives as unjust. Misrepresenting numbers for advertising purposes is bad enough, but then he devotes chapter-long tirades to various electoral strangenesses like that weird lizard, the gerrymander. Polls are an especially sore spot for him. I can only imagine the fits he's probably having over the republican presidential primary debates and their ""numbers."" (Disclaimer: Seife makes a valiant attempt to be non-partisan at all times in the book. His position is that every party is first and foremost concerned with their own self-interest.) I looked Seife up on twitter to see what he's been up to lately, and it seems likes he's pretty busy right now because he's suing the FDA for a Freedom of Information Act violation. Which would come as no surprise to anyone who has read this book. It's clear that this book arose out of Seife's deep passion for truth, and that's probably what makes it such good reading."
18,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3189888-bob,4,"Everybody wants to understand the world they live in, and we all rely on facts to help us do this. Unfortunately, what we identify as ""facts"" are too often not very reliable. Sometimes data is displayed in a graph with the axes chosen in such a way that the representation is effectively magnified; this was also described in How to Lie with Statistics by Darrell Huff. I've seen this same thing many times in my field of engineering, often from people who were not really aware that they were distorting the story.Worse, though, are the blatantly corrupt representations with Potemkin numbers: These are total fabrications produced by con artists, and they are intended to fool you into believing a conclusion that is completely unfounded. Senator McCarthy provided the the classic example of this when he claimed he had a list of 205 communists; he actually had not one single name. He was smart enough to make up an odd number, knowing odds are inherently more believable than evens, and he knew people would tend to accept his claim without demanding proof.You'd think we would have learned from McCarthy, but not so. As per the Bush-Gore election, which was undecided for weeks due to an extremely close count of the votes in Florida. This book discussed how all elections are prone to some degree of error, despite every intention for keeping the accuracy high. In the Bush-Gore case, the differences in the ballot counts were much smaller than the statistical errors to be expected from the tabulation process. Result? An absurd and expensive cost in dollars and time to resolve the most important election in the world.Polls are another area which was addressed. These, also, are highly prone to errors, even when done correctly by skilled practitioners. The author showed hoe polls and elections are similar processes in many respects, and they suffer from issues that are also similar.A quote (pg 11): ""Truthful numbers tend to come from good measurements. And a good measurement should be reproducible: repeat the measurement two or ten or five hundred times, you should get pretty much the same answer each time."" This is so very true."
19,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1253166-becca,2,"I'm not really sure for whom Seife wrote this book. The majority of people who like math and/or statistics will already be very aware of most of the statistical concepts that Seife introduces in his book: significant digits, the importance of looking closely at how axes are labelled, appropriate population sampling and correlation vs. causation. And the people who don't like math won't voluntarily read a book on math. So that leaves...I don't know: people who like math but are bad at it? Middle-schoolers? And unfortunately, this book won't work great for those people either, because rather than using the actual names for the mathematical concepts, like I did, Seife makes up terms so that if this is your first exposure to the concepts, you won't actually be able to communicate about them or google more about them. I think my turning point with Seife was in an appendix about the difference between sensitivity and positive predictive value, where I was originally annoyed that he didn't name-check Bayes and then realized that he also didn't mention sensitivity or positive predictive value in the entire appendix even once! This appendix was literally about how just knowing the sensitivity of a test without knowing the prevalence of disease results in not being able to predict the positive predictive value and he didn't use the names for a single one of those concepts.I found the latter half of the book more interesting: Seife largely moves away from mathematical concepts and investigates political hijinks, such as the Franken election, Bush v. Gore and gerrymandering. It doesn't really add to numeracy, nor have that many striking examples of ""proofiness,"" (except that humans can't count numbers to 6 digits worth of significant figures, which hopefully most people intuitively know) but it is interesting. Overall, it's not a bad book. I might give it to a child who was interested in math, but I don't think most adults will enjoy it very much."
20,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/925253-aimee,4,"Overall, I enoyed this book. It is a great look at how people and corporations lie (or conceal the whole truth) with numbers on a daily basis. Seife's book is written to be understandable by the reasonably intelligent lay person -- you don't need to be a total math geek to get what he's talking about. I particularly liked how Seife called pretty much the entire U.S. government onto the carpet for lying: Republicans, Democrats, even the Supreme Court (which was scary for me).There were only two downsides to the book for me. First, Seife coins a handful of cutesy terms that, while no one term itself was too crazy, take as a whole seemed to dillute the seriousness of his arguments. (The exception for me is ""proofiness"" which has a sort of like Colbert-esque fun to it.) Terms included: regression to the moon, randumbness, causuistry, and more.The second, more serious problem, and not necessarily a problem with the book itself, was that I finishing reading it feeling like I still didn't have a clear way to tell when someone was lying with numbers. Beyond things that are prima facie preposterous (Having children kills your brain cells.), how are we to know when numbers are cherry-picked, apple-polished or what-have-you? Are we supposed to track down the raw data behind every claim? Are we supposed to elect mathematicians to office? Are we just supposed to be disbelieving of *every* number that crosses our paths?I feel empowered and powerless at the same time..."
21,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253338-andrew,3,"I confess, I tend to be rather Pythagorean when I am describing the importance of mathematics. I admit, that this is not an entirely accurate description of the world. When we attempt to quantify philosophy and emotional states (or even what makes for the most perfect body type), we are abusing mathematics. The irony is that, while many people are math-phobic, we still trust anything that has a number attached to it. This book is horrifying in that points out the results of trusting numbers implicitly while not bothering to understand them. To learn that, technically, the 2000 election should have been decided by a coin toss and that the 2007 financial crisis was due to a whirlpool of poor data crunching [or expert data crunching to mislead] scares the daylights out of me.I appreciate that Mr. Seife is a journalist, and so he tries to remain as neutral in his descriptions as possible, while still managing to point out the insanity of the current situation. This book would make for an interesting assigned reading in either a stats or a economy/government class. Generating discussion and encouraging people to think about what they are reading. At the same time, it is hard to determine whether or not a use of numbers is necessarily 'proofy' without being willing to investigate the story behind the numbers.Of course, I feel that that was the point. We don't consider what we read and don't critically attack the information that comes our way. Especially if that information defends our biases, rather than challenging them."
22,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"A marvelous account of how people use numbers to their advantage. With a bit of hand-waving and mumbo-jumbo, you can use numerical data to prove almost anything you want. Bend numbers to your will like Humpty Dumpty with words and you can do some sinister things. The author splits this book into eight chapters with each one explaining how 'Proofiness' is ruining that particular area of inquiry.The main idea is that humans are bad with numbers. Rather than calculating risk and such things, we are terrible at probabilities and figuring. We tend to rely on rules of thumb and heuristics that generalize far too much. So by attaching a number to something, even if that number is spurious or wildly untrue, it makes it seem true and hard to dispose of. The book starts with a relatively old example; remember the McCarthy trials of the 1950s? Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin pulled a number out of his ass that he said represented the number of Communist spies in the State Department and claimed to have proof. The number gave the claim credence and seemed true, but was not. This began the Red Scare or it could have just been a part of it. Another example given is that of the Subprime mortgage lending bubble. Since humans are bad with risk, there are people that take advantage of that fact and sell bad stocks and stakes in companies.So anyway, I thought this book was great. It went by very quickly and was quite fascinating. It was also aggravating, since a lot of this 'Proofiness' results in unfair things happening."

24,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17554332-jan-morrison,1,"Now I know how bad a book has to be before I'll give it a 1.Chapter 1It's witty and interesting: a good 'hook' you might say. I realized pretty quickly that both the math and the epistemology are more appropriate for a high school student than a university educated adult. Being a high school teacher, though, I thought I'd keep reading and look for ways to incorporate the ideas into my classes. My students have to read a lot of business media so I thought I'd have them look for examples of each type of misleading math described by the author.Chapter 2Math wise, it's basic statistics, covered in the Ontario secondary school curriculum. Again the stories do a good job of bringing the concepts to life, and may be useful in a math classroom.Chapter 3The content of the examples switches to stories of financial fraud, an area in which I have done considerable reading. Unfortunately, it is clear that the author either doesn't understand the examples he is discussing or has just bent them so much to fit his thesis of 'risk management' that they're no longer accurate. I think what really bothers me is that the 4 events he references (Enron, Madoff, US subprime, and AIG) each offer much better examples of ill-used mathematical concepts than the ones he describes. Unfortunately chapter 3 made me doubt the integrity of the rest of the book so I stopped reading. I'm so glad this was a library book and I didn't actually purchase it!"
25,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4045369-henry,3,"Having taken physics courses in high school and as an undergrad, I realized that I've been taking one aspect of numbers lightly: how easy it is to misunderstand what they stand for. Proofiness reads like an introduction to a global issue, bringing in specific cases and introducing jargon to identify each issue. (As a tip to Barney Stinson, some of the terms demonstrated the author's visiativity.) Most of these issues with the so-called ""dark arts"" have been stressed out of me by my education, so when it was reintroduced to me, I was reminded how counter-intuitive some numbers are.That being said, Proofiness outlines some major issues with some major systems. America'a preference of being constitutional (sketchily at that) over being democratic especially shocked me (despite being one of the more dryer chapters of the book). Doing less to prepare the reader against such ""proofiness"" and more to expose past instances of it, Seife was able to slide in hints of cynicism, spite and humour without being overwhelmingly persuasive. The book does fall trap to the same fault as other ""precautionary tales"" however: exaggeration (or so it seemed). While the stories that the book covered were terrible; it can't be that bad. Right?"
26,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21768115-richard-sansing,3,"Decent summary of the usual topics: Part ""how to lie with statistics"", part a discussion of how to calculate and interpret poll results with a given ""margin of error"", part a discussion of systematic error (with a case study of Literary Gazette's projection of Landon over Roosevelt in 1936). Good discussion of measurement error in counting ballots, with a focus on the Florida recount in 2000 and the Minnesota Senate race in 2008. Makes a compelling case that the ""true"" difference in each race was substantially smaller than the measurement error inherent in the tabulation process. Offers the rather weird suggestion that both races should have been resolved via a coin flip! Finishes with discussions of the mathematics of gerrymandering and the misapplication of mathematics to questions of law. Gets some important things wrong, such as the story behind why Indiana nearly adopted legislation to define pi as something other than the irrational number that it is. (The real and much more interesting story is at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_....) If these topics are unfamiliar to you, the book is worth reading; otherwise, you won't learn much. "

Which, even though it makes watching the news or reading magazines decidedly less fun, isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But for such a (relatively) short read, Seife spent far too long explaining the basics and too little time going in-depth on the real-world implications of shoddy number-crunching. He could have used a read-through from someone more prone to sensation (even though part of his thesis is a condemnation of over-sensationalizing things). I think an edit from Michael Moore would have done him well. Personally, I’d prefer Seife in small doses—a weekly column debunking whatever statistic is currently being thrown around by pundits would probably be awesome—but the book is worth a full read only if you don’t feel up to snuff on your middle-school math (which, hey, many of us don’t). If you do, and still want the dirt, skip Chapters 1-3.[FULL REVIEW]"
28,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1146325-liz,5,"I knew studies could be funded to create ""proof"" of anything you like, but I never realized how often numbers are twisted, manipulated, cherry-picked, or pulled out of thin air in order to support propaganda. If I wasn't cynical before...this book destroyed any faith I had in the American political system and media. And it's not as if I had a whole lot of faith to start with in those things, but reading this was truly eye-opening. The author did a good job overall of being non-partisan so that readers walk away feeling genuine disgust with all political parties. While I have learned to be aware of false numbers and not believe anything that is ever shown via a media outlet, it is frustrating to think so few people might really have opinions based on actual facts without extensive research on their own, myself included. Who has time for all of that? So the takeaway? We live in a false Democracy and there is nothing we can do about it."

The latter part of the book explores the political manipulations involved with purportedly fair elections and in the functioning of deliberations of the Supreme Court. The author spares neither party in his analysis.It is all well and good to know intellectually that we are being manipulated, but we like to maintain a fantasy that in our free democracy we are more free of this than other countries. This is very wrong."

In one section not more than two pages go by for an entire chapter where he doesn't call Justice Antonin Scalia every nasty name he can dredge up. Too bad. We all need to know more about numbers and the author has the knack of explaining things mathematical and arithmetical. A good book ruined by self-indulgent and irrational ranting."

34,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,4,"This book suffers a little in the timeliness of its examples, since it was published in 2010. So much has happened since publication, that one wonders if the issue of mere misuse of numbers, counting, and mathematics in the public sphere still has the same importance, or if the emergence of a Chief Executive who daily makes false assertions without recourse to reasoning of any sort (specious or otherwise) renders the issue passé. This said, the bogus crowd size figures quoted on the occasion of Farrakhan’s so-called Million Man March serve as an unintentionally ironic foreshadowing of the controversy whipped up by 45’s absurd insistence that his inaugural crowds were the largest ever.Seife treats our often-garbled perception of risk, early in the book, citing Kahneman and studies that show (inter alia) how people completely invert their relative level of risk aversion depending on whether they are presented with the relevant facts in the form of death rates or survival rates. Throughout the book, Seife dishes out many off-handed slurs to the profession of journalism, as in the section on risk, where he cites numerous examples of “fearmongering.” He similarly savages journalists not only for their inane misunderstandings or misrepresentations of polling results, but also for their underlying motivations for doing so: “[t]o a journalist, a poll is a powerful mechanism for breaking out of the shackles that subtly bind him.” I did not realize, until after I had finished the book, that he is a professor of journalism at New York University!Although I am well acquainted with the concept of statistical margin of error, as a completely precise concept that is quite distinct from other sources of error, I was well entertained by Seif’s concise telling of how and why Literary Digest predicted that Republican Alf Landon would handily defeat FDR in 1936. It is a great story that well illustrates how the concept of “margin of error” is orthogonal to the problem of “unrepresentative sample.” Based on their enormous sample size, Literary Digest concluded that their margin of error was less than 1%. However, their predictions were off by more than 15%, because FDR supporters were significantly less likely to respond to the Literary Digest polling form than were disaffected Republicans. Seife was himself involved in controversies about the senatorial election contest between Al Franken and Norm Coleman, the controversy stemming from how astonishingly closely the voting results approached a perfect 50-50. Seife’s intimacy with the topic shows in the level of detail he provides for this episode. The important take-away idea for me is the fact that counting of votes is a human process in which errors are inevitable, and no amount of recounting, no matter how carefully done, is capable of reproducible resolution to single-digit precision. Thus, to say that one candidate received “1,573,354 votes” while his opponent received “1,275,409”, is to commit the sin of what Seife calls “disestimation”. Given the imprecision of the counting process, it would be better and more accurate to characterize such a result as “about 1,573,000 to 1,275,000.” The inescapable conclusion Seife draws is that both the Franken/Coleman result, and the far more consequential Bush/Gore result, were tie votes, and should have been decided by (in effect) a coin-flip. As Seife himself allows, this is “hard to swallow.” Indeed, it is hard for me to swallow, and this may explain the overwhelming complicity by politicians, journalists, and many people who ought to know better, in their treatment of such recount scenarios as capable of achieving arbitrary measurement resolution of the count. The Census gets some treatment, and along the way, so does Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia receives scathing, if brief, treatment in relation to his reasoning on at least two issues. With regards to census counts, Scalia wrote an “original intent” argument revolving around the definition of “enumerate”, to forbid the Census Bureau from using sampling theory to correct the figures reported to Congress. Seife frankly rates his argumentation as “specious.” Even more damningly, Seife shows Scalia’s apparent hypocrisy. Scalia appears to have lifted a bit of “proofiness” from an editorial in the New York Times. Seeking to deny the reality of studies showing race to be a significant predictive factor in capital murder cases, the writer, and Scalia, put the total number of felony convictions in ratio with the number of demonstrated false death-row convictions, and draw the unwarranted conclusion that the justice system as a whole has an accuracy rate of “99.973 percent.” This is a fallacious conclusion because it is comparing apples to oranges: the apples of capital felony cases to the oranges of all felony cases generally, including the vast majority of cases where defendants plead guilty. Seife imputes hypocrisy to Scalia by quoting an internal memo in which he (Scalia) appears to concede the point of racial bias in sentencing.Overall, it was a quick read, entertaining, and contained examples that are still fairly topical to an American audience. One does not need to be a math whiz to appreciate the points and the argumentation. "

And it was a well-written, breezy read overall.I did disagree on a couple points, and there was in particular a space flight section where the author amusingly made some of the same errors he had just been complaining about in previous pages, but a book that admits to human foibles and that gives its readers the tools to spot its own errors is easy to forgive for said errors.The author's habit of inventing words and terms in an authoritative tone, without admitting he is making them up himself, is a bit annoying.I do think most people, especially those with limited math experience or an aversion to math, would greatly benefit from reading this book. And it does not require any previous experience with math.It pains me that I found this shelved in my library's math section - on the one hand, yes, it's about numbers, but it's kept as math-light as possible. I would guess that most people who are likely to be browsing the math shelves already know a lot of this; it seems more likely it would find its intended audience in the journalism section, for instance.

His ability to bring to light so many new concepts that in reality also are frightening, while interjecting little bits of humor throughout actually made for an exceptionally entertaining read. There were multiple occasions when I actually burst out laughing because of the absurdity of something Seife was describing, or even just the way he was describing it. I think that as a result of reading this book, I have a heightened appreciation for those who are extremely skeptical about facts and statistics they are fed, and I think I myself am now going to be more cautious around and attuned to numbers that people arbitrarily throw around.

The author does write in an easy to read way and the explanations of the different types of ""proofiness"" are for the most part understandable and clear. The author's use of neologisms is at times amusing (randumbness) and at times cringe-worthy (causuistry). My objections are at the rather journalistic preference for witty one worded style over clarity of concept. This is particularly obvious when he defines causuistry as a subset of causistry which just muddies the already dirty water. He might as well as called it cum hoc ergo prompter hoc, the Latin named logical fallacy meaning correlation does not imply causation. While interesting, the book does have it's flaws; In my opinion he over attributes intentional malice in order to justify his understandable outrage at the misuse of numbers and the damage that can cause. After all, it's easier to be angry if it was intentional malice versus the far more common human traits of stupidity, laziness and self-centeredness. While I don't doubt some of it is intentional malice, I do believe that people aren't as crafty as he gives them credit. He seems to, at the end of the book, acknowledge that human nature is a large cause of the ""proofiness"" out there or at least to blame for our willingness to accept it.He does spend a lot of time on politics, particularly elections and it gets repetitive at some points. His footnotes are at times amusing and at times egoistic posturing. His part on the space exploration also ignores that, while the technology was dangerous, the inquiries into the accidents found that the major factor was serious managerial and organizational flaws within NASA. The dangers of the technology were well known and could have been mitigated or avoided if not for the organizational issues. It seems silly to assume that Virgin will have the same issues as they don't have the managerial structure of NASA. This is not to say the risks aren't downplayed, but this seems somewhat apples and oranges to me. Virgin will not use the same tech as the shuttle missions and will be doing suborbital space flight which is far different than orbital flights. Seems he is falling prey to the same proofiness he mentions.Still, I can't ignore the irony of wanting to believe what he writes, which by it's very content, should be taken at face value. That said, I will say it was an interesting start, but I reserve judgment until I've conducted further research. ;)"
47,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8765171-jkhickel,4,"You know what Charles Seife suggests that we do when an election is very close, like the razor-thin and highly controversial Bush-Gore voting results in 2000?Flip a coin.Proofiness demonstrates that there often comes a time when numbers subtract from our overall knowledge of a subject, rather than add. And when you are trying to parse eight-digit election results down to the last three digits, you've probably reached that point.This is particularly true for what Seife calls ""Potemkin numbers,"" which are pretty much made up numbers publicized by advocates on all sides. Seife takes on liberal global warming advocates who cherry-pick the data to make their favorite upcoming crisis look more dire, as well as conservatives in Texas who expose women to a flawed analysis linking abortions and breast cancer, before they can go ahead with an abortion themselves.Seife writes in a very engaging and easy-to-understand style, and this book provides a number of additional examples of statistical analysis gone accidentally or deliberately awry. It bogs down at the beginning, which is a bit of a rehash of the classic How To Lie With Statistics, and at the end, where Seife appears to pretty much advocate for his own political position on the death penalty. He also sees everything through a statistical lens. He seems to think, for example, that a ridiculous statistical analysis Alan Dershowitz provided to the jury in the O.J. Simpson trial turned the tide for O.J., when in fact I had never heard of this analysis until I read this book, and never heard it discussed in all the media hysteria or even the interviews with jurors. And Seife seems to strongly believe that if a statistical analysis demonstrates unequal treatment of U.S. citizens, then by definition it violates the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution, and the Supreme Court should automatically find it unconstitutional, without considering any other issues of language or precedent in law.But that's okay. Seife is passionate, which makes for great reading. And here is a sentence I never dreamed I'd ever type: I really appreciated the Appendices. The Appendix is usually skipover territory for me, but that's where Seife did a nice job of summarizing statistical analysis, the fundamentals of electronic voting, and the ""Prosecutor's Fallacy.""So overall, four thumbs up for Proofiness, as I continue my quest to read more of Seife's intelligent and engaging works. "
48,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31537194-john-meo,3,"Even for one who isn't interested in mathematics, this book is perfectly understandable and probably should be read. After all, the problems that the book brings up are intertwined with everything we do. The math is not complex at all, and contains concepts that anyone can understand. However, the importance of the ideas make it a book everyone should read -- media and statistics are thrown at us on a daily basis and many are utterly bogus. We must have the capacity to distinguish between fact and fiction, lies and truths. Charles Seife unveils the ways simple numbers deceive us is and how not to be fooled again. I am now much more skeptical of assertions without sources, research without repetition. If anything, those who are not interested in mathematics should have more reason to read this book.Seife discusses many strategies that reporters use to tease out the numbers they need or want. Potemkin numbers are flat out fake numbers, completely made up by the author. Cherry-picking is simply using evidence or picking studies that support their claims, and ignoring entirely reliable counter-evidence. Comparing apples to oranges is the strategy of calling to nonequivalent values equivalent, such as the surprising result of Bush spent more money than the previous forty-two presidents combined. Yes, that may be true, but it ignores inflation altogether. Apple polishing (yes, he had the theme of fruit in mind) is presenting correct charts but misrepresenting them to a point of rendering them misleading, such as sneakily changing the range on a graph. The most striking method of proofiness is elegantly summed up by Seife:""There’s an anecdote about an aging guide at a natural history museum. Every day, the guide gives tours of the exhibits, without fail ending with the most spectacular sight in the museum. It’s a skeleton of a fearsome dinosaur—a tyrannosaurus rex—that towers high over the wide-eyed tour group. One day, a teenager gestures at the skeleton and asks the guide, 'How old is it?'""'Sixty-five million and thirty-eight years old,' the guide responds proudly.""'How could you possibly know that?' the teenager shoots back.""'Simple! On the very first day that I started working at the museum, I asked a scientist the very same question. He told me that the skeleton was sixty-five million years old. That was thirty-eight years ago.'"""
49,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21173013-stephanie-fosnight-regester,5,"Near the end of this meaty, thoughtful, provocative book, Seife writes, ""The quest for knowledge is a quest for novelty, a search for a new set of data or a new idea that forces us to look at the world in a slightly different way than we did before. Knowledge-gathering is systematic demolition and reconstruction of our view of the world. It can be an unsettling and uncomfortable process.""Indeed. Reading Proofiness is an unsettling and uncomfortable process, as Seife gives compelling, mathematical evidence as to just how much of the actions of American democratic society, from elections to our criminal justice system to big business, are defended by bad math. Although Seife has unquestionably a liberal bias, his arguments are solid and convincing, and his evidence appears (to this non-mathematically inclined journalist) faultless. For the sake of balance I would have liked to see him apply his laser-gaze as much to Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, for example, as to Antonin Scalia, not because I dispute his conclusions about Scalia's myopic adherence to the death penalty, but because I'd like to see if the same inconsistencies riddle all of our justices. Seife seems to imply they do.Politics aside, Seife makes it clear that ""proofiness"" is detrimental to all of us. The chapter on moral hazard and tragedy of the commons has real-world implications in just about any news cycle and the election chapters were simply fascinating.The biggest question that Proofiness leaves me with is as to the nature of American democracy, and its benefits. Do they outweigh the risks? Today my English husband and I debated the merits of the American political system vs. the British system, and we both acknowledged that giving as much power and weight to the American citizenry makes it more liable to the types of problems Seife describes. Do we then say that a more limited government is better, overall, for the people? I'm not about to subscribe to this Machiavellian idea. I still believe in democracy. But after reading ""Proofiness"", I find myself compelled to search for a more complex answer as to why."
50,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22039713-bob-anderson,3,"So from the title and publisher’s description one might be lead to believe that Proofiness is ‘gimmick’ book, going through various situations in which mathematics is used, slyly or forcefully, to make people think things that are not true. Instead, the book opens with subjects similar to this (a formula for a ‘perfect butt’ and a projected overtaking by female sprinters of males via linear plots of the data are highlights in this early section), but Seife largely shifts gears to write about the use of statistics in public policy. The publishers sold this book short with its title and pitch; it’s not so much about how mathematics is used to deceive us, but how mathematics can reveal how we are being deceived. It takes no special rigor to float out a number with no basis in fact (your skin will be 74% more moisturized!) or to insist that Census numbers not be corrected for statistical flaws, but it does take careful use of the dark art to show how those ‘uncorrected’ numbers are wrong and actually already ‘corrected’ in a nearly-identical way. So many people and agencies use numbers, polls, trends and other projections from messy reality onto stark mathematical truth that the various distortions of truth that inevitably spring up cannot all stem from ignorance or from deceit, but the methods for seeing past them remain universal. In general, the idea is to remember how messy the world is, and that our ways of producing numbers from observations get messy and unclear as well. Be wary of unwarranted precision, and check sources and reasoning. The last appendix to this book, focusing on the prosecutor’s fallacy, draws the mind closer to Bayes’ Rule and its correct statement of conditional probabilities, but Seife neglects to go that extra step, which is disappointing because the absolute vs conditional probability distinction is crucial to understanding so many of the numbers disputes in the public policy sphere. If the intersection of public policy and mathematical tools interests you, this book is a nice toe-testing of those waters."
51,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51465664-joel-mitchell,3,"The first four chapters or so of this book provide a good popular-level summary of ways in which numbers can be made to lie. This part of the book offers some important concepts to keep in mind when determining whether the numbers in statistics/probability-based arguments, polls, alarmist scientific studies, etc. really demonstrate what you are being asked to believe.However, the farther one reads, the more the book resembles a political rant with occasional references to the original topics. Worse yet, the author does not seem to be above using ""proofiness"" to make his point (even in the less ranty first half). Just a few examples:pp. 73-74 - His ""proof"" that Virgin Galactic is likely to experience a huge number of fatalities is based on the fact that in the past a very different kind of space agency has had a 1% accident rate...this seems to fall under his own categories of ""comparing apples to oranges"" and possibly ""regression to the moon.""p. 89 - He tries to increase outrage at AIG's misuse of $85 billion bailout by pointing out $7,000 spent on golf - while certainly frivolous, one should realize how small $7,000 is compared to $85,000,000,000. Sounds like some form of what he calls ""disestimation"".pp. 17, 228 - He seems to dismiss certain statistics as completely fictitious and declare others to be more accurate based purely on whether they sound reasonable to him (if he has other reasons, he does not say so).Additionally, the book (especially the second half) is plagued by ad hominem, poisoning the well, and false dilemma arguments as the author clearly has a number of axes to grind. Overall, there is some very helpful information in the first half, but after about chapter four the author seems to lose focus."
52,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112265-katie,2,"This title of this book is a play on Stephen Colbert's concept of ""truthiness."" The author defines proofiness as manipulating numbers to prove something that you know in your gut to be true. Numbers are generally associated with factual information, so it is an easy way to promote an agenda. It was an interesting premise, but I was really disappointed in how it panned out.The first half of the book was not very interesting or ground-breaking. The author gives real life examples of how numbers have been manipulated to serve a particular purpose. He spends a lot of time addressing concepts I think I learned about in grade school: the difference between correlation and causation, the importance of having an accurate sample in polling, and how people can cherry-pick data to prove a particular point. There were some interesting parts in the middle of the book where the author discussed the Gore/Bush presidential election and the Franken/Coleman senatorial election. It is fascinating how the election process, which seems to be cut and dry, can actually be quite arbitrary, and the numbers are not really close to certain. Towards the end of the book the author starting to take on a very liberal bias. While I agreed with much of what he said, I think that he was guilty of the crime he was accusing so many others of: proofiness. He only presented data that proved his point. (He acknowledged this a little bit, but only in the footnotes.)The book did leave me a bit more skeptical about the numbers I hear on the news and other media, but other than that I didn't gain much from it. "
53,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223580-chris-witt,4,"Drags a little bit in the final chapter or two, but still an important (and entertaining) read. People hear statistics and take them as Gospel all the time without questioning them. Seife's book explains why most statistics and polls you hear are pretty much completely bogus.In the end, the author posits that the only way to prevent people from being hoodwinked and manipulated by the statistics they here is through greater mathematical sophistication. Which is all well and good, but I guess I'm a little bit too jaded to think that's going to happen. Most people aren't going to understand the mathematical concepts that are used in the book.Furthermore, in the present day, it's easier than ever for somebody to hold fast to their prejudices. There's always a news program or Internet site out there that will cater to whatever it is you want to believe and convincing somebody that what they want to believe is not necessarily equivalent to the truth is pretty near impossible now. The expansion of cable television and the rise of the Internet has seen to that. Again, I'm being jaded here, but I think the genie's out of the bottle on this one. By nature, human beings are resistant to change, and with the ""atomization"" of news sources (author's words) there's less reason than ever to expect them to.Aw, nuts. I ended on a downer...I'd recommend it most to:* Chronic worriers* Voters* People who regularly watch or read the news* Intellectually curious folk"
54,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1927559-annette,4,"Proofiness: The Dark Art of Mathematical Deception by Charles Seife examines the misuse of data and statistics in today's world. The book divides the concept of proofiness into a number of categories such as disestimation and fruit-packing. Although few of the examples will be surprising, the book does a nice job providing the ""big picture"" of this disturbing topic.[return][return]Seife defines proofiness as ""the art of using bogus mathematical arguments to prove something that you know in your heart is true - even when it's not"" (p. 4). He notes that proofiness is powerful because people are blind to the fact that every measurement is uncertain and impure in some respect.[return][return]Although the book contains many references to the use of proofiness in politics, he picks on both liberal and conservative groups to make his points. He uses examples from well-known scholarly journals as well as as advertising campaigns to show that proofiness is everywhere.[return][return]I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to review the ""dark art of mathematical deception"" or enjoys a good book focusing on issues related to the application of mathematics in the ""real world"". If you like this book, there are many others that explore deception found in other content areas such as science and map making."
55,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7071848-jeff-kissel,3,"A quick read that will lead you to doubt the truth of pretty much everything besides numbers themselves. An interesting book if you like social economics topics like Predictably Irrational et al, but coming from a different angle. Seife discusses different ways that data and numbers are misused and misinterpreted, either intentionally or not, and the severity of their impacts. He seems particularly focused on the ills of the current American democracy (and probably with good reason), but it leads to a somewhat repetitively dire narrative. Still the book is a worthwhile read to hopefully increase your awareness and skepticism of news, government, corporations and pretty much everyone else with an agenda.Other than a brief page or two at the very end devoted to discussing the need to raise the awareness of ""proofiness"" and to attempt to correct it (through the vague solution of a higher general understanding of mathematics by the general population), Seife offers few practical solutions to the problems proposed. I always prefer that books making social commentary at least attempt to provide solution instead of just dwelling on the negative, so that would my main gripe with this one.Overall though, I plan to check out some of Seife's other works as the book moved quickly and was thought provoking."
56,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/713607-tiffany-conner,4,"This was a fun book. Seriously, how many books do you know which contain a formula for the perfect butt? I am not kidding. It's in the book! This is not a book for serious mathematicians and scientists (though the author has a solid background in both), rather, it's a worthwhile examination of the many ways numbers are used to ""prove"" things in everyday life. Think of any of the recent ""studies"" you hear about on the news and then ask how much more likely are you to believe those stories if they are threaded with percentages and numbers? And then think of how quickly the same study is often contradicted with new evidence and new numbers. Quantitative information has a powerful hold over the average person. Seife shows how even for all of the benefits of seeing cold, hard numbers in support of controversial contentions (Like Joseph McCarthy's contention that he had in his hand a list of 200 Communists in the State Department! Would his ravings have been as significant if he'd just said, ""I have a list of a couple of Communists here!) Oftentimes numbers are no substitute for a closer, intelligent, and unbiased examination of the facts, something too many, too often, fail to do. "
57,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392101-scarlett-sims,4,"The basic premise of this one is how numbers and statistics are manipulated by the political establishment for their own gain, and how the public is manipulated as a result of that. It was quite a compelling read. What I particularly liked was Seife's non-partisan view. He described examples of both the left and right using numbers to skew thing toward their side. Seife details several ways in which numbers are used to deceive or warp the truth and gives some information of things to beware of. Being an intelligent person, this book was kind of preaching to the choir for me--I mean, I didn't slap my head and say, ""oh I get it look at statistics in context!""--but I certainly did learn new information.Another thing he said that I really liked was about how in this day and age, you really only have to ""consume"" news that is already skewed toward your own perspective. Fox News, Huffpo and everything in between. You don't even have to look at information you won't agree with. It's something Hunter and I have talked about before so that part rang especially true for me.I'd recommend this book to people with an interest in politics, statistics, math, and not being manipulated by pundits, media, and politicians."
58,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51991308-lisa,3,"This book was fine. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could, because I didn't NOT like it (2 stars) but I can't honestly say I liked it (3 stars) either. It was just kind of boring. There were some interesting little facts here and there, but the basic idea was that people misrepresent things to back up their point of view, and a lot of the time they do that using numbers. There's only so many ways to talk about that before it gets really repetitive. Don't immediately believe any polls, surveys, or numbers that anyone in the media throws out there, try to find the source, look for inaccuracies, all of that. Yeah, I get it. People are terrible and use math to make things look the way they want them to. Or they use science to make their point of view seem more correct. It seems like something that isn't going to stop. I appreciate the author trying to educate people about the issue, so they can be more informed the next time they here some bogus numbers, but it doesn't make for a super entertaining book. "
59,0670022160,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478131-larry,5,"In a way this is an update to How to Lie with Statistics byDarrell Huff, which was first published in 1954(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_L...).Seife has brought the subject up to date for a new audience (whoprobably never saw Huff) and should be required reading for anyone whoever reads or sees news, or listens to political ads or debates.Ideally, it should be required (with a test) as qualification forvoting, but perhaps that is going too far...Seife's bottom line is that you should seriously doubt any publishedstudy that you read that goes against common sense, and that prettymuch all numbers quoted during political debate are lies orintentionally misleading. He is not partisan; his examples come fromacross the political spectrum. Except that he drips vitriol when discussing Supreme Court Justice Scalia.It's something that every thinking person knows, but avoids thinking about when the numbers agree with one's views."
