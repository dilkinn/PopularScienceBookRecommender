 Luck favors the one who tries.
When I started reading it I never expected it to be this good. I was amazed and delighted to find this book to be exceptionally good. I have learned, which as it feels I had forgot , how to 'Learn to Learn'. It had shown me my flaws. It has shown me I was trying too hard, that it is 'easy that does it'. She starts with learning modes, that we have two important modes of thinking, focused-mode and diffused-mode. Focused-mode are highly attentive states which are limited to pre frontal cortex and diffused-modes are diffused throughout the brain. Only one mode can be active at a time. Focused mode is related to logical, sequential, analytical process. As soon as you concentrate on some thing , you are in focused mode. Whereas, when you are not concentrating, when you let your mind just wander, you are in diffused mode. Diffused mode is related to bigger-picture. Focused mode brings you the BRICKS and diffused mode is the MORTAR.To be attentive and try hard to get the problem inside your head is done by focused mode. Diffused-mode actually works in background under the layer of conscious awareness (and it is not that can ON and OFF, its always On whenever you are not concentrating,diffuse mode happens when you relax). Now she asserts that the learning happens when you toggle between these two modes. And then there is Einstellung effect: It refers to getting stuck in solving a problem or understanding a concept as a result of becoming fixated on a flawed approach. Switching modes from focused to diffuse can help free you from this effect. This made me a little more flexible regarding my thinking, and more patient too. And I've also found that sometimes initial ideas about problem solving can be very misleading. To figure out new ideas and solve problems, its important not only to focus initially, but also to subsequently turn our focus away from what we want to learn.In subsequent chapters the author deals with: * The problems of procrastination and how to deal with it. There were four chapters dedicated for it. (And it was here I found myself, a little, dragging the book).* Memory and how to enhance it. I remember one technique known as Memory Palace which was similar to Mind Palace shown in Sherlock TV series. It was here, once again, that I gained many insights which proved to be useful.* In the last chapters she gives miscellaneous tips and tricks for enhancing your learning and sculpting your brain.......................................................................The central theme of this book is the paradoxical nature of learning. Focused attention is indispensable for problem solving, yet it block our ability to solve problems. Persistence is key, but it can also leave us unnecessarily pounding our heads. Memorization is a critical aspect of acquiring expertise, but it can also keep us focused on the trees instead of forest. Metaphor allows us to acquire new concepts, but it can also keep us wedded to faulty conceptions. Our desire to figure things out right now is what prevents us from being able to figure things out. Reshaping your brain is under your control. The key is patient persistence: working knowledgeably with your brain's strengths and weaknesses. We can achieve startling insights into how to understand more simply, easily, and with less frustration: By understanding your brain's default settings- the natural way it learns and thinks, and taking advantage of this knowledge one can become an expert.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!"
1,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I first heard of this book from an online course given by the author, Barbara Oakley. The course is called ""Learning how to Learn"", and you can find it at coursera.Despite the title of the book, most of the advice here is appropriate for just about any subject. It is especially appropriate for subjects with concepts that might be difficult to grasp. And the book is most definitely geared toward students. There are highlights and questions at the end of each chapter, to reinforce the key points.There is a useful chapter on how to prepare for tests, and how to take tests. The advice is not always intuitive, but it is all common sense. Study groups are often beneficial. There are some situations, where they may be a waste of time.Much of the advice in the book is based on common sense. Don't cram for exams; study some each day, and don't overdo it. Lots of advice on how to make sure that you really understand the concepts. Re-reading material and highlighting key phrases is NOT very beneficial. Make up your own test questions, put them on flash cards with answers on the back. Flash cards are your friends. The book is filled with anecdotes and stories about educators, students, scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. These stories help make the book engaging, where otherwise it would be rather dry and uninteresting.The main theme of the book is that there are two modes of thinking; focused and diffuse. Focused thinking is what you do when you concentrate very hard to solve some problem. You need to remove yourself from distractions during focused thinking, and you probably should only perform focused thinking for a short amount of time; 25 minutes is recommended. Diffuse thinking, however, is somewhat more relaxed and actually creative. This kind of thinking allows your mind to wander in search of ""out of the box"" solutions to problems.If you are a student or even studying some subject on your own, then this book could be very helpful."
2,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29734319-amy-alkon,5,"This book IS a book on how to excel at math and science -- even if you previously flunked them. However, it is also much more. It's a book that is transformative for anyone who does creative work that requires writing and thinking and taking in information and creating something new out of it. The science on how to do optimal work in “A Mind For Numbers” has transformed my writing life from hellish to a tough job I love. Through what I learned from about diffuse mode thinking, I’m careful to put in daily work in reading, researching, and writing, especially on tough concepts. Our minds, as Dr. Oakley explains in the book, seem to do a lot of work in the “background” while we’re sleeping and doing things other than working. Each day, I find that I’m enjoying my work so much more because it isn’t a struggle; I, piece by piece, simply pull together tough concepts into a coherent and far better whole. Dr. Oakley’s book ultimately helped me enjoy what I do in a way I never could before, when I procrastinated and was stressed out and then tried to shoehorn a bunch of information I hadn't processed into something coherent. This book was a life-changer for me. --Amy Alkon, syndicated columnist and author, ""Good Manners for Nice People Who Sometimes Say F*ck"" (St. Martin's Press)"
3,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"I have read a few of these books at this point, I bought a bunch of them when I was on my productivity kick, so a lot of the information was things I already knew. I do think just knowing what to do isn't enough, it's very much the execution that ends up being the issue. That said I think this is one of the better ones. Some of the ideas are repetitive but it's clearly done intentionally to help anyone reading the book internalize those ideas, which is probably really important if this is someone's first time encountering these things. I do also think the advice is solid and the book delivers it in an accessible and easy to internalize fashion. Probably a good book for anyone that doesn't have the best habits or relationship with long term sustained learning, including myself. Mostly its been useful as I've been studying to help get me into a place where I find it easier to do my work. It kind of serves to prime me for what I need to do which helps with execution and maybe I can try to sustain this by replacing reading books on how to be efficient with just journaling and trying to be more mindful of my behavior. "
4,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058003-gabi,5,"The title of the book doesn't do it justice. This is a book about how to get good at anything, not just math and science. It's a light read because it's full of simple advice. But the stuff it teaches is effective, and I wish it had been taught to me back in 1997 when I was starting graduate school.If you find yourself checking your phone or screwing around on Facebook while you should be working, read this book. If you're having trouble learning stuff you need for work at a higher rate than you're forgetting it, read this book. Do so especially if you're young, because the longer the time you have left to reap the benefits, the more reading this book is worth to you.Read this book, put your butt on a reasonable schedule, get your sleep and exercise, and the chances are excellent that you will never want for satisfying, well-paid employment no matter your field. This is a book about making your zombies work for you, not about learning how to fight them."

Everyone should read this, every pupil/student in school.We learn all our lives and sometimes we have exams - this book will tell you how to prepare well. The title ""A Mind for Numbers"" is misleading, it's about learning in general. "
6,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1543408-j,1,"This book is not at all what it says on the cover, it's just more tired ""study tips"" the same as you would get from any Universities student resource center. There's nothing inherently specific about learning Math and honestly I found the book to be full of an awful lot of fluff... It's a rather shockingly callous thing to do considering how many people struggle with Math to continually dance around the one fact present, it just takes a lot of time and effort and work and you may simply never crack it. Terrible book. "
7,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48066-chazzle,2,"Probably some of the advice in the book is good. I just wasn't in the target audience. I like math, I'm very good at math, and this book is for those who struggle. I liked Paul Lockhart's book ""A Mathematician's Lament"" much, much better. In that one, he really makes you want to DO math, to DISCOVER mathematical truth, to LOVE math. In Barbara Oakley's book, she teaches you how to ""get by"", and maybe even ""get an A"". Much, much less inspirational. Where's the fun? Where's the love?"
8,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"I'm very fond of practical books, clearly written, that can be immediately applied. One thing, however, does need to be mentioned from the beginning: This is not only a book for those looking to excel in math and science. These tricks and methods can be used for any subject. My suspicion is that the ""math and science"" aspect of the title is a marketing ploy more than anything. That's a shame because there is a lot in this book that I hope to pass on to language learners and students of International Relations. Getting that out of the way, let's focus on the good. The book is clearly written, easy to follow, and frequently engaging. The book will introduce you to important concepts like: *the difference between focused and diffuse thinking (and how to switch between these modes);*using recall in your studying; *the idea of chunking concepts; *tricks for studying such as the Pomodoro technique and spaced repetition; *the value of walks and frequent breaks; and *ways to overcome procrastination. The book also helps you become a deeper learner, someone more in love with education. It does so by: *helping you understand yourself as a learner; *promoting the virtues of teamwork and providing tips for how to use partners and teammates; *promoting broad studying and creative exploration; *by promoting real education over vulgar grade accounting; and *by demonstrating how much science and math are like poetry. The book also asks you practice these methods by putting down the book and trying to recall key concepts, and by doing exercises for each chapter. Early in the book, there were also some mental exercises that I quite enjoyed. Now, a little bit of the bad. There really isn't that much. I felt like a lot of the ""testimonials"" in between the chapters and in the sidebar ""success stories"" gave the book a kind low-rent ""kitschy"" feel to it. It reminded me of self-help seminars, infomercials, the adverts of private colleges (which emphasize testimonial ""successes"" and overlook failures), and the other quasi-get-rich-quick, let's-find-short-cuts aesthetics of quasi-education. I feel like that aesthetic needs to be fought at all costs. I feel like that mentality is destroying education (and America for that matter). Education is hard work. There is no getting around that. And, as several other reviewers have pointed out, by only highlighting the successes, the author is being very unscientific (she is sampling on the dependent variable, as they say). The book is better than this. It's better than its cheap, attention-getting marketing ploys.Still -- overall, a great book for just about anyone who wants to improve their learning!"
9,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/991644-mark-bao,3,"tl;dr: Read if you want to learn general study skills, skip if you're interested in skills specifically for math/science.Why did the author write a book about getting better at numbers and math and science and not really talk specifically about how to get better at math and science? This book is 90% about general study skills with lackluster tie-ins to how it might work with math/science. Don't go into this thinking you'll learn stuff specific to math/science – you'll be disappointed.As an introductory book to study skills, it's not too bad, though it's overshadowed by more compelling books that specifically talk about general study skills like Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning and Cal Newport's books. Many of the productivity and study tips it mentions are good, but they fall into the classic non-fiction personal development book trap of telling you some common-sensical thing you should be doing and adding an anecdote in there. It's OK if it's common-sense advice, but it's not really that useful if it's common-sense advice without much follow-through information on how to implement that advice.Maybe it's just me. Admittedly, I've read a lot about productivity and study skills so most of this was a reminder at best, boring repetition at worst. If you've read books like Make It Stick or Cal Newport's books and want to get a more math- and science-focused advice on how to do better, don't pick this up. If you've read some but aren't sure, maybe pick up the audio version (which is what I did). Or go to a bookstore, skim through, and decide from there.It's not that there aren't gems in this book. There are a few. Diffuse mode vs. focused mode thinking, a core part of the book, is pretty interesting. The fact that the memory palace technique works well for unrelated things, which I never thought about. And some other ones that weren't so memorable. It's good for reminding you about all the productivity tips that you should be doing. But for me, there was nothing novel in here.I'm not sure what I'll read next to replace this. Here are some that I'm considering, if you're curious:• What Is Mathematics?: An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods• How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method• How to Think Like a Mathematician: A Companion to Undergraduate Mathematics• The Princeton Companion to Mathematics"
10,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26968661-bryn,5,"A fantastic book for understanding how we best learn complex concepts. Initially I thought because I already have college degrees in Math and CS that I didn't need to read this book. I though I already knew how to learn match and science. I was wrong.In retrospect, the subjects and classes that came easily to me were the classes in which I was practicing many of the good habits prescribed in this book. The subjects in which I struggled, were plagued by many of the bad habits and pitfalls outlined by Dr Oakley. In fact, I have resolved to revisit some of those subjects that proved difficult in school using these techniques. The book is written at a very easy reading level, making it very approachable for readers as young as 12. I will be testing this theory by making this book required reading for my kids before they start middle school.

13,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1644075-john,5,"A Mind for Numbers is a worthy addition to the ""owner's manual for the brain"" genre. It's billed as a description of how people who did not do well in math or science in school can learn to effectively study topics within those fields.As someone who did well in math and science in school, this book reminded me of many successful study habits, some cultivated on purpose and some by accident during my preprofessional academic career. The book also has some great ideas that run counter to the conventional wisdom (in this case, foolishness) of our day. I'll list these separately:Good study habits: - Building my ability to memorize scripts, movies, jokes, etc. (on purpose: I still love quoting things) - Not cramming (accidental: I never had the need, though I procrastinated on projects) - Reviewing before bed (on purpose, but only for subjects I was particularly interested in) - Reading ahead (on purpose, but driven by annoyance at how similar arithmetic lessons were from grades 1 through 3) - Focusing on the edge of my understanding rather than burning study time on mastered material (on purpose: I didn't like ""studying,"" so why would I waste ""study"" time on stuff I already knew?) - Teaching others (on purpose: helping someone understand new concepts makes you feel like a boss) - Paraphrasing (accidental: I never enjoyed the physical act of writing longhand, so I was often annoyed by any hint of verbosity in definitions or descriptions. I actually got in trouble once for not copying sections of my science textbook's glossary verbatim for an assignment!) - Joking about the material (accidental: you have to have a sense of humor) - Interleaving material (accidental: it just felt right. I never thought of myself as ""studying"" because ""studying"" was something that was supposed to feel miserable. I did my homework and I reviewed the syllabus before tests.)Good ideas: - Creativity is retrieving from long-term memory something that was never there - The necessary ping-pong between the brain's focused and diffuse modes - It's not a coincidence that we experience ""aha!"" insights when we step away from a problem we've been working hard for a while. Harness this phenomenon. - Memorization as critical to creativity and effective problem-solving. This is a big one for two reasons: 1. Some nonsense started getting popular around the turn of the 21st century that knowing facts is inconsequential so long as you know where to find them. 2. Memorization assignments fell out of fashion since they're confused with rote-learning. In fact, perfect memorization of longer scenes is *only* possible by ""chunking"" the details into an outline of overall concepts."
14,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48262626-tereza-hlad-kov,1,"I didn't like the way Barbara repeats over and over the same agruments for nearly trivial statements. For example she was able to write about 30 pages only about the fact that you need to sleep and relax in order to enhance your learning. For me, it seems like a 1000-year-old advice but she kept repeating it as if I haven't read it already 16 times before in this chapter. The entire book could be summarized in 5 pages. Although I must admit that I surely enjoyed reading her life story, about how she approached the math and the science which was in the beginning of the book."

It doesn’t matter if it’s a 7-year old’s problem with multiplication tables or a physics master student trying to understand thermodynamics in quantum systems. This is also a great book for everyone trying to learn anything new in their life. I am convinced that the majority of people would take a benefit in their personal and professional life from reading this book.I can’t say that every concept in this book was completely mind-blowing and new to me, but Barbara Oakley manages to explain why things that have worked for you for years are actually excellent learning strategies. This book also inspired me to use my planner more and it had a positive effect on my self-esteem (especially before and during exams). I am completely sure that, would I go through this book again, I’d notice advice that I haven’t put to practice yet and I’m planning to implement more of it to my life.

This book is about your personal productivity in tackling new concepts. This book is about your brain and tips and tricks about improving you “brain muscles” by doing well-established techniques like chunking, interleaving, space repetition, memory palaces and more.Here is a small example: how are you reading books? Are you highlighting key ideas? Maybe you’re like me and trying to highlight every useful piece of information. But study had shown that this technique not only useless, but could be harmful. You should try to understand the basic idea, try to recall it without looking into the book and only after that, you may highlight key pieced with some insightful notes on the martins.This is book is really well written and I highly recommend it for everyone who wants to be more efficient in their learning journeys."

It also stands well alone. The book should have had the same name as the course, this would have been more descriptive. The current title is somewhat misleading. This is a basic introduction to the science of learning. It can be of use both to the less brainy and the more brainy, but not so much to those who already have a broad overview of the cognitive sciences. Oakley is a popularizer, and good at it: The book has many memorable metaphors and images that help the reader recall the contents later. In this regard it practices what it preaches. I would recommend this book to everyone who is about to start college, and any who might be curious about the process of learning, unless they already have a broad but superficial understanding of this topic.

The science I got instead was ""memorizing avogadro's constant 6.022x10^7 by making it into a rhyme""(Avogadro's constant is actually 6.022x10^23)Two stars for being a general compilation of practical ideas about improving learning (Researchers say so, but your mileage may vary).

The book itself provides an excellent explanation of the core ideas of the course, plus some additional material and discussion questions. There were a few chapters near the end that didn't seem totally necessary, but overall I think this is an excellent resource, especially for students in STEM courses.My key takeaways from the book were: the importance of switching between focused thinking and diffuse thinking (shifting your attention so that your brain works in the background), the emphasis on repeating ideas over time and being patient in learning incrementally to build strong ideas, and the concept of ""chunking"", which solidifies a concept or strategy in your mind so that you can easily use it when you need it. Looking forward to applying some of these ideas as I continue to learn! "

Do not recommend. I was confused about the chapter structure, quotes and summaries.Yet learned something new as well. Hm, maybe some physics books are in order to cement what I just learned about?P.s. one of few subjective learnings about myself during this book is - I'm lazy! :D"
28,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901342-jacob,4,"There's actually precious little here that is specific to numbers, math, or science. It's actually a book about how to learn no matter what you're studying, and because of that it is super useful. Self-learning is actually one of my strengths, and I already knew many of the ""tricks"" in here, but this is the kind of thing that is always a good refresher and there's always something to learn.Top tricks include the fact that you have two mental states, focused and diffuse, and need both to really learn and gain insight into something. So focus on studying for a while and then do something which allows your brain to wander. It will process while you're ""not thinking"". Another biggie is that recall is better than review, i.e. you should close your book and try to say the material you're learning instead of reading the material in the book yet again.There are also discussions about setting good learning habits, how to read textbooks (hint: skimming the text for the main ideas before you read is still in vogue), and work in groups. The author includes lots of short stories about science students and teachers and their advice. The text is broken up with lots of blurbs that are probably meant to hold your interest, but for me they were so frequent they made it harder to keep focusing on the text. Also, there are a lot of metaphors in here for how your mind works. That's a good thing because metaphors really help you learn and remember, but a lot of the metaphors didn't work well for me in terms of illustrating the point and making it clear.The author brings up that some math teachers don't use examples because they feel like concrete examples make it harder for you to see the beauty and inner nature of what they are teaching, so they stay very abstract. That is the absolute worst way for me to try to learn. I need to see examples in order to grasp the meaning of the abstractions someone is talking about. For those who have given talks where I've pressed you to come up with examples of what you mean: I am NOT sorry. This book was also quite a bit like Your Memory: How It Works and How to Improve It, although that one is focused more exclusively on being able to memorize. It turns out, though, the line between memorizing something and learning something is not so distinct. You can't really learn something unless you've got a lot of it memorized, and it's actually a lot easier to memorize something if you learn about it."

While its intended application is for those studying mathematics and other STEM topics, the author puts forward (and I agree) that any of the techniques can be used for any topic of study. There is really no math covered in this book just study methods to improve learning and understanding.You'll likely find that several of the techniques covered are ones you've picked up over the years or at least heard about. However, I've yet to see a book that summarises so many techniques in one place.As anyone who has read my reviews knows, I enjoy a book more if the key points are summarised at the back for revision and to prompt recollection. I can gladly say this book has that as well.I did find some of the anecdotes and stories told in the book (to demonstrate application of the concepts discussed) didn't always hit their mark. The link was either somewhat tenuous or I felt the stories ended prematurely and I wanted to know more about the historical characters discussed -further history reading to add to the pile for me I suppose.The book is written in practical and everyday language and easy to understand. If you are thinking of taking up study after having a prolonged absence, I'd suggest giving this book a read first.4 out of 5 stars."

I am so glad I read this book!It leans more towards general studying techniques of math and science. But, it also focuses on a large amount of how to study and best retain any subject.A lot of things I already knew as I've read quite a few published papers in journals and universities.But, the section on test-taking is worth reading if you don't have time to read the whole book.The little snippets here and there interspersed throughout about scientists, doctors and teachers is fascinating in itself. Some of which I'd seen in published papers as one-line entries and it means so much more to me to know a little of their background. I felt like I was given an inside look at their lives.Also, the author, Barbara Oakley, kept everything interesting with bits of humor and funny diagrams.I'm trying to get my children to read this book. You really should read this book."
31,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40473382-ibrahim-niftiyev,2,"This book is not about what it tells. This is very funny and disrespectful towards the reader. All right, I enjoyed those parts related to the success stories of the author, however, the product is not what the package indicates. In this case, you devote your energy and time for the planned stuff but you do not experience it. At first, I thought it will be about how to use some kind of techniques regarded mathematical practicality and mentality. Then, over the time I saw that it is just a personal development recommendation, extremely ordinary ones actually, so, it is a huge deviation from the main intention which plots in the mind of the reader. It could be written in a way which could make it better and more valuable than it is right now. I can mention various negative sides of my reading experience of this book but I do not see a point. With a high share of the tolerance - 2 stars. "
32,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2166338-amelia,0,"I picked up this book because I am trying to re-learn some things. In terms of learning strategies, there were only a handful of things in here that I don't know and practice already (study groups!), but it would be a good, accessible introduction for a high school student who hasn't yet learned how to learn difficult subjects. Interestingly, a lot of the advice here mirrors common advice for writers (fiction writers working on commercial novels, in particular) and things I read in the book Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less.

34,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84372-conrad-zero,5,"No matter your goal for learning, this book is the first one you should read. It's not just for numbers, and not just for engineers.

36,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318-bharat,4,"Oakley begins by describing a childhood story of how she flunked at school in Mathematics and Sciences, but goes on to become a professor of engineering, where she has to employ Maths in her daily job.Given the dysfunctional educational system in which kids are forced to stress more on understanding the material, they often end up cramming the subject leading to improper digestion which comes back to bite them in the adulthood, i.e. they have to revise these materials. Oakley's book shows how to remedy those mistakes in re-learning those materials.But, the central crown in this book is a solid narrative on how the human brain assimilates the learning and how it can retain it for longer periods in the long-term memory by making use of chunking of information aided by repetition, practise and recalling the material systematically. Finally, there are many anecdotes and pointers as to how celebrated scientists and successful people were able to pioneer such thoughts that led to landmark discoveries.In a nutshell, this ranks as one of the best books that I have read in the recent times that is so simple, intuitive and delivers a compelling narrative backed by years of scientific research into the human memory."
37,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,4,"A Mind for Numbers (2014) by Barbara Oakley is a book on how to study and more particularly how to study math. It's adapted from a course on how to learn to learn.Oakley did poorly at math in high school, stopped doing it and joined the army where she became a Russian translator. There she learned how to learn. After being in the Signal Core she decided she wanted to learn how the systems she was using worked so she got an Electrical Engineering degree and used her improved learning skills to learn math, which had eluded her previously and she went on to get a PhD.The looks at how to get an overview, create chunks of knowledge and revise them so that they become embedded in your mind in a framework that enables you to keep the knowledge and understand math. Working through math in periods of focussed time and then relaxing and using diffuse thinking to get to more creative solutions is carefully described. It's a well written, carefully constructed book that would have been a great help to me when studying. The book is full of anecdotes of people who have overcome study difficulties and learnt material deeply. It's very much worth reading."
38,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21772228-wei-ting,5,"I hold Barbara Oakley's story close to my heart. She went from flunking every math and science subject in school to becoming a professor of engineering at Oakland University. How did she do it? With concrete steps and strategies that she's more than happy to share with us in this brilliant book about the science of learning. Learning about how my brain works has helped me see my sruggles in school more clearly, and find ways to overcome them. Had I read this book in my high school years, I wouldn't have cried so much over math exams. Where were you back then, Barbara? I know this is only one of the many books out there about learning how to learn, but trust me on this: Unlike the usual self-help motivational ted-talkish crap, it is an incredibly practical book. If you are trying to learn anything, this is the book for you."
39,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16313015-dorotea,2,"The advice is good and I’d definitely recommend the book if you (1) are prone to procrastination and (2) don’t know how to study. I pretty much agree with everything she says, but it doesn’t come as news to me. True, I am fairly good at studying and I have always had a sound method. Yet I struggle with economics and I thought the book could help me. Just like her, I too feel that ‘the students around me mostly seemed to have a natural knack for seeing the solutions, while I was stumbling into walls’.Mainly the theory is quite clear but I fail in its applications (although not always, because I did extremely well in industrial organization). I know that there isn’t much to do except repeat the 5/6 exercises I have and really understand the meaning behind every passage, but it still doesn’t work when I find in the exam a completely different problem. Eh. "

Repeating the same point again and again throughout a chapter. Sometimes two.3. The questions and summary at the end of every chapter felt like I'm in school again and reading a textbook for my finals! Doesn't help with either math or science specifically but has general tips and tricks for learning/memorizing any subject which I'll admit are absolutely perfect for a high school student. For everyone else, it's like a revision on how to learn stuff. You know and have experienced/implemented them all at some point. Basically, read, sleep, recall, REPEAT."

Now I am retired and read textbooks for fun.After reading this book, I plan to change the way I approach math textbooks. Instead of trying to work from cover to cover, I will bounce around in my book collection, solving various kinds of problems, focusing on problem solving instead of re-reading. Vector calculus is more fun than crossword puzzles."

Didn't like.It's definitely written in an interesting way, but it's the same as with every other personal development book. The same ideas recycled over and over again. It's a pity. It looked very promising."

We're still in the infancy of understanding neural development, but one thing is becoming clear -we can make significant changes in our brain by changing how we think.»«We develop a passion for what we are good at. The mistake is thinking that if we aren’t good at something, we do not have and can never develop a passion for it.» Gran libro para aprender a estudiar. Puede parecer algo raro para decir a los 30, habiendo atravesado toda la educación formal obligatoria y transitado gran parte de una carrera universitaria -que terminé dejando por falta de interés en la práctica profesional-, pero si consideramos que uno de los temas principales del libro es que, si se hacen bien las cosas, uno nunca deja de aprender, tal vez no lo sea tanto. El primer examen que desaprobé fue en quinto grado: un cinco en matemática. A partir de ahí, todo se hizo cuesta arriba. Desde ese momento en adelante, mi poca predisposición al esfuerzo (jamás había tenido que estudiar ya que siempre me había alcanzado solo con ir a clases), buenos profesores que no entendían por qué estaba tan negada y seguían alentándome pese a que yo ya había decidido que era mala en la materia, profesores particulares, malos profesores y altibajos emocionales y académicos fueron sucediéndose a lo largo del resto de mi vida escolar. El resultado: salí del colegio con baches terribles de formación, un poco debido al deficiente sistema educativo y mucho a causa de esa negación que siempre hizo que se me nublara la vista al menor contacto con los números.Hoy, varios años después y embarcada de manera autodidacta en el aprendizaje de diversos temas relacionados, por ejemplo, con la programación y las finanzas, lamento muchísimo no haber sido capaz de reconocer la importancia que tienen las matemáticas y las ciencias duras en eso que llamamos vida real. Y, por suerte, mi actitud ha cambiado mucho también. Es por eso que cuando vi el título de este libro, supe que tenía que leerlo.A través de sus páginas y apoyada en un buen número de citas y referencias científicas y académicas, Oakley nos enseña qué pasa en el cerebro cuando estudiamos, cómo mejorar el rendimiento y cómo dejar de procrastinar, entre otros. Para los que necesitamos no solo saber qué, si no el por qué de las cosas, creo que constituye un recurso de gran valor y puede aportar mucho al aprendizaje de nuevos temas."

For someone who has lived through this, this book really hit home for me.The standout point in the book for me was the true meaning of persistence. Persistence is not sticking to a problem till you don’t get the solution. It actually is the ability to step back for a bit and come back to it, again and again.Wonderful reminder of efficient learning habits backed with well explained neuroscience. "

The more exotic, an unrealistic the better.Tim Ferris is the master of this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeVvr...Keanu Reeves shooting:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCIgp...Tod Sampson’s body hackhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyFol...And so on.Tim Ferris at least sells his stuff as “meta-learning” (teaching you how to learn) but I think it’s really just watching him do stuff.2)	A grand unified theory for books about learning (my GUTBAL).OK, there’s actually a spectrum of books about learning.On one end of the spectrum we have learning porn. Watching other people do it.On the other end of the spectrum, we have basic learning materials (textbooks, manuals, instructional). Doing it yourself.Somewhere in the middle we have books which are a bit of both – a bit about learning something specific, a bit about learning in general, and maybe some popular science thrown in.I’d maybe put Moonwalking with Einstein in this category, and this book is definitely in that middle zone.(OK, not the greatest GUTBAL ever)3)	The review itself.Good book. It’s only a little bit about maths and science, and a lot more about learning, problem-solving, different modes of attention, distributed practice, and dealing with procrastination.I thought the cognitive psychology-lite was very good, and it was mixed with practical tips from some very good educators.If you gave this to someone in last year of high school, or first few years of uni AND they implemented the suggestions, you’d be doing them a huge favour."

There are some good insights in this book, but really, it is subject agnostic, and the author could have doubled her sales figures by giving the book a neutral title.There ARE good, actionable practices in here, and moving forward I will do my best to be mindful of them and put them into practice, but really, at the end of the day this is a book on how to study, and how to take tests.That, and the fact the ideas are illustrated by surfing zombies and flying mules make clear this book was written specifically for first-year undergraduates.As an adult self-learner, I felt I had to separate a lot of wheat from chaff to get value from its lessons."

56,039916524X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,5,"I wish I had read this in school, because I would've approached the entire process of learning very differently. Turns out this book was published in 2014, the year I graduated from my masters :) But better late than never! Many of us already know about the limits of our working memory - how it can hold about 7 items to focus on at once. But what good is that knowledge without actionable insight? This is Dr. Oakley's forte. She breaks down how we can use our knowledge of basic brain functions to enhance our learning. Essentially we have a working memory and a long term memory. Former is more about focus in the moment, whereas latter is about storing our knowledge neatly so that we can access it when need be (think files organised in folders on your laptop's hard drive). In order to benefit from both simultaneously, one needs to practice 'chunking' - the idea that instead of focusing on the 7 independent files, we strengthen our ability to 'work' with 7 folders (each with multiple files) at once. How do we do this? By building in focus and diffused learning in tandem. We need to focus on the independent files (say in 'chunks' of 7), but then allow ourselves to step away to a relaxation/fun activity to let our brain form more creative connections between these independent files (connections that might be invisible to the focused brain). This helps us be creative by finding relationships where there may have been nothing obvious in the first place. Dr. Oakley's book is a complement to Newport's Deep Work as it breaks down the reasoning behind Newport’s proposed mechanism of uninterrupted focus. Couldn't recommend this highly enough! P.S. For anyone who has read this, I'm sure you noticed that this review is in itself an exercise of a mini-mental test that forces me to recall what I've read :P Just making the author proud!"

I would think ""Make it stick"" giving more systemic reasons about new discoveries of efficient learning methods. Still I find those either new in this books or I get more impressed of repeated methods.1. Basically we have 2 nodes to learn, ""Focused mode"" vs. ""Diffuse Mode"". Often leaning is paradoxical. Too focus we get stuck, too lag we lost focus and can not achieve something.2. Make Planner Journal to list the ToDO Tasks lists to prevent procrastination3.

This is why teaches often says that the first time they ever really understood the materials was when they had to teach it. - my words: try let your child explains to you, instead of doing exercise.6. p215 What a wonderful stimulant it would be for the beginner if his instructor, instead of amazing and dismaying him with sublimity of great past achievements, would reveal instead of the origin of each scientific discovery, the series of errors and missteps that preceded it - information that, from a human perspective, is essential to an accurate explanation of discovery.7. p232 ..But too much concern for creating a ""safe environment"" for criticism actually kills the ability to think constructively and creatively, because you're focusing on the other people rather than material on hand. You want to remember that criticism, whether you are giving or receiving it, isn't really about you. It's about what you are trying to understand. In a related vain, people often don't realize that competition can be a good thing - competition is an intense form of collaboration that can help bring out people's best.
