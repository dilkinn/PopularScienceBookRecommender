I was wrong. This book actually enhanced, perfected and debugged many of the ideas I'd read in previous books. Self-control is the single most important factor that can be measured early in childhood and virtually predicts the child's fortune in his/her years to come. Bad news is the default efficiency of one's willpower is determined by his/her genes and the nurturing environment between ages of 1 to 6. The good news is that this default willpower is malleable and can be cultivated through education and practice. What you will learn:In short, this book adds a new weapon to your arsenal for the battle against temptations. Do you want to know how to readily resist the temptation for the cheesecake in front of you? Do you want to know how to suppress the temptation for lighting your next cigarette? How about saving your marriage and not indulging in an infidelity? Well, you're gonna be equipped with the knowledge, and techniques to win the war of resistance in this book.Weapons:Now let's look at some of the weapons you can use in the war of temptation:1. Cool VS Hot: Whenever facing a tempting situation, like a piece of cake you want to avoid, there are two aspects to the situation, Hot and cold. The desirable attributes of the cake, its sweetness, taste, smell, look constitute the hot dimension and thinking in this hot manner, makes you crave more and more till you indulge. On the other hand, you could imagine the cake in a cool manner, for instance, you can imagine it being a picture, or even you can turn the delicious, yummy cake into a disgusting object by visualizing it, for example, to be filled with cockroaches. In essence:The power is not in the stimulus, however, but in how it is mentally appraised: if you change how you think about it, its impact on what you feel and do changes, The tempting chocolate mousse on the restaurant dessert tray loses its allure if you imagine a cockroach just snacked on it in the kitchen2. Disassociate yourself:  Whenever facing a hard situation (resisting a temptation or suffering a break up) imagin watching yourself from the eyes of another person. This way you shif the gears of your thoughts to a higher, cooler and more logical cognitive thinking. 3. Three stages of self-control: In all the self-control tactics, there exist three stages: First, you have to remember and actively keep in mind your chosen goal (if you eat the cake, you won't get fit). Second, you have to monitor your progress toward your goal and make the necessary corrections by shifting your attention and cognitions flexibly between goal-oriented thoughts and temptation=reducing techniques. Third, you have to inhibit impulsive responses like thinking about how appealing the temptations were or reaching out to touch them, that woyld prevent you from attaining your goal. 4. It all comes down to expectation: Till now, it was believed that for instance performing mentally-demanding tasks would lead to decision fatigue (running out of willpower). But now, it's discovered that it all comes down to your expectation, if you expect to get tired after a workout, you'll be tired, and if you expect to get energized after solving a math puzzle, you will be...5. Your future self If you vividly imaging your future self with your desired goal (being fit, not smoking etc.) and emotionally get engaged with this future picture of yours, you will far more likely to stay commited to your resolutions. To be completed ..."

That being said, it was interesting in the beginning and periodically throughout the book there were case studies that caught my attention. The downside was that there was very little practical guidance offered. It read like a scientific literature review on self-control. Not surprisingly, young children that are able to delay gratification in exchange for a larger reward later, exhibit greater success later in life with matters that require sacrifices and self-denial now for long-term gains later. I didn't find this to be the least bit surprising, although the review of case studies was interesting at times.Overall, it was a dry, tedious read for me. This is probably more of a reflection of my personal preferences than it is for this book. If you're a fan of non-fiction, self-help type of books, you might enjoy this one. I enjoyed it at first, but it quickly became repetitive and tiresome for me."
2,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/479086-chelsea,5,"This book holds a wonderfully invigorating message: new research has proven that we are not prisoners to nature, nor to nurture. If we want to, we can change those most stubborn attributes of willpower and fear. Our life situation may not have set us up to be college graduates, financially stable, healthy, or heroes, but we still can be. We decide. We are capable. The Marshmallow Test does not give you a thirty day plan to achieving your dreams. It does not provide recipes or an exercise regimen. It gives you the tools to create positive change, and it is up to you to use them. "
3,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7632558-dana,3,"This is a well written book, but it did not influence my self control. I thought that the information was displayed in an interesting and simple format and I enjoyed how the author attempted to get points across with real life stories.I picked up this book hoping it would help me learn better self control techniques, and while The Marshmallow Test did cover this, it mainly focused on the effects of biology when it came to self control, and a large part was about how to rear your child to have better self control. I felt that the tips for adults were nothing more than common sense.If you have a scientific interest in self control than I think this is a worthwhile read, but if you're looking for a book to help you achieve personal goals with control techniques I would keep looking. 3.5/5Note: I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review."
4,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,1,"Wow. This was about as fluffy as you can get.There were a few useful tips in the last chapter regarding making your future/final goal ""hot"" or real to you, and your current need to refrain ""cold"" by using strategies to think of other things, but that was it. I felt that the summaries of this research I'd read elsewhere were about as useful as this book.5.20.2015 update: Since I read the book, I came across an interesting critique: that there are kids who live in chaotic homes where there may be abuse, drug use, poverty, etc. For those kids, the smart/functional thing to do may be to eat the marshmallow right away, because a marshmallow you've eaten is worth two you're promised in the future -- the one in your mouth is the only one you can be assured of getting. The suggestion was that what this test actually tests is whether the kids grew up in stable homes where they could reliably trust what adults promised. And, therefore, the associations with future success are more reflective of initial SES than anything related to personal grit. Useful. Wish I could remember where I read it -- anyone know?8.5.2018 update: From Scientific American's Antigravity column this month: ""The new study, 'Revisiting the marshmallow Test: A Conceptual Replication Investigating Links between Early Delay of Gratification and Later Outcomes,' released May 25 online in _Psychological Science_, tested 10 times as many youngsters as the original research. And it found a much smaller association between delaying gratification and how the children turned out. the work also discovered a connection between higher family income and short-term self-control. Perhaps the rich kids showed up for the test stuffed."""
5,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49318921-shog-al-maskery,5,This is a book I really enjoyed from cover to cover. It helped me understand how we thought as children and how nature and nurture play a part in who we are today. It’s the book I wanted to finish but never wanted to end. Highly recommended! 
6,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1624588-bonny,4,"It is a bit ironic and telling that while reading The Marshmallow Test, I wanted Dr. Mischel to cut to the chase and just give me the tips and tricks that would enable me to gain more self-control. Even if I currently lack patience as an adult and probably would have been one of the children that wanted one marshmallow right now, he has written a book that gives me hope along with plenty of scientific explanation that self-control is a skill that I can develop, nurture and practice. I think the author does an excellent job of explaining what self-control is, where it is warranted, instances where it may be more appropriate not to delay gratification, and what we might gain in our lives if we are able to better hone our willpower. As every science and statistics student has learned, correlation does not imply causation, and Dr. Mischel gives a well-reasoned explanation of what the ability to delay gratification may be correlated with. The reader is left with a clear understanding that waiting to get two marshmallows later instead of gobbling one immediately does not cause an easy and worry-free life! As other reviewers have stated, this is not a self-help book with a series of steps to be followed, but it is thoughtful and thought-provoking writing from the man who has spent his life researching self-control and provided us with the tools he has discovered."
7,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4898958-christian-allen,2,"A book with far too much fat in need of trimming, this 300 pager could have been half that length or less. Unremarkable findings are presented as the latest and greatest in neuroscience and wrapped in psychobabble. If you're looking for a cute story of the original test at Stanford and some vague suggestions on enhancing self control this is your book. If you're looking for a to-the-point message and a how to guide backed by real data look elsewhere."
8,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"Mind provoking book!This book is absolutely essential to read for everyone. The author is a well known psychologist whose his work has been misunderstood widely by even psychologists. Which is pitty. I enjoyed and used the material of this book, daily. I will re-read this book in the future as it is a great source of strategies to self-control. "

10,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4719513-ali-sattari,4,"Fascinating read, I didn't expect to read such fundamental facts on will power, executive function and their broad effect on our various traits. I think I would read this at least once more, just to be sure I've absorbed the most!"
11,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,2,"This is an interesting book on self control. It starts by explaining the principles behind the ""Marshmallow Test' where a child is offered a treat that they can take now, or if they are prepared to wait for a short period of time then the proffered treat will increased. This simple test gives psychologists a tool to predict how a individual will behave much later in life and how successful they will be.Mischel then expands into other studies on behaviour that he has been involved in and covers some of the work undertaken in schools to teach self control, and methods that you can use at home to achieve the same goals.Was worth reading, and he covers a fascinating subject fairly well. But it does feel like you are reading a academic paper at times. I think that 2.5 stars is fair."
12,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3288454-aleksandar-mi-ovi,4,"A pretty great book that goes into the research that shows self-control can be learned. Genetics still play a part, but not as large a part as we once thought.The book is divided into 3 sections. The first section deals with the original marshmallow test and related research, while the second and third sections deal with applications and strategies. I would have liked it if the first section were shorter as it seemed far too long for the amount of research it had to present. More strategies and the discussion of why they work would have been welcome, but maybe that's the TELL-ME-HOW-TO-NOT-EAT-THE-CAKE-IN-FRONT-OF-ME side of my personality. With that said, the author is coherent, conversational, and really interesting. You'll find yourself learning all sorts of tangential things too, for example, an aspirin actually helps relieve emotional pain.Honestly, our minds are pretty amazing, and the book does a good job showing why. All in all, a fascinating read, and one I'd recommend to anyone interested in self control."
13,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,4,"Audiobook.I had very high SAT scores. Perhaps more importantly, I had very high PSAT scores (National Merit Scholar). I did take a Kaplan course to help prepare... but not everybody who took a Kaplan course did as well as I did... and I took the test a year younger than most. I used to credit homeschooling with my high academic performance. But... I have 3 siblings, and none of them did quite as well as me on standardized tests (though my younger brother did go on to get a PhD in music). So far as I know, no one else at my homeschool coop was ever a National Merit Scholar either. And, many public schoolers do become National Merit Scholars.For a long time, I have avoided thinking of myself as a ""High IQ"" person. For one thing, I don't even think IQ is a very well-defined scientific idea (Yes, We Have No Neutrons: An Eye-Opening Tour Through the Twists and Turns of Bad Science). Also, being brough up in a highly religious home, I supposed I internalized the idea that ""pride is a sin."" Or, maybe as a woman, I'm just more suceptible to ""impostor syndrome."" Even now, I like the idea of ""growth mindset"" as an explanation for why some people persist, and therefore achieve, beyond others who believe in ""fixed aptitude.""But, none of this seems to give a truly satisfying answer about why I achieved beyond others in many ways. Perhaps there truly is something different about me? Well, as a child in my family... I was always know as ""the good one,"" ""the responsible one,"" ""the compliant one,"" etc. I never took a ""Marshmallow Test,"" but I imagine if I had I would have been one of those who waited. The original takeaway from this book is that those who performed well on ""The Marshmallow Test"" as pre-schoolers, had innate self-control that served them well for years to come (specifically: it correlated well with high SAT scores). And those who did poorly on the test, were bad at self-control, and continued to be for years to come. However, this book is all about analyzing what strategies are used by the children who succeeded, and exploring if and how they can be taught to others: this book certainly thinks that people can be taught to be ""good Marshmallow Testers""!I also babysat quite as bit when I was younger... my go to strategy was always: keep the kids busy having fun! If they are having fun in a way that you have provided... they won't be getting into trouble. Well, that is the distraction technique talked about in this book too. Also, being able to imagine (activating the hot system) various positive outcomes (in the future) resulting from various efforts kept me focused (in the present) many times. (In highschool, I had a crush on Han Solo and wanted to be Princess Leia, partly because Han Solo liked her. The scene right before their first kiss, she is welding. WELDING! I then somehow associated technical aptitude with romance... like, be really good at math/science/technology, and Han Solo will fall in love with you. Talk about activating the HOT system ;-) lol)But, recently it has been found (as with everything in the social sciences lately, it seems!) that the original study was flawed. Well... maybe the subsequent studies were flawed too? He also mentions the concept of Decision Fatigue, which I've also now heard was based on questionable research. Perhaps I should hold a moratorium on reading any more social science books for a while... (ah, I also just read the other day that The Stanford Prison Experiment was a fraud! Well, there goes: The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil; maybe The Science of Evil: On Empathy and the Origins of Cruelty is still worthwhile???)"
14,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,4,"I’ve lately been quite taken with the idea that one of the biggest secrets of an ultimately happy life isthe development of self-control. If you haven’t heard about this fascinating study, let me sum it up for you: Children are taken to an isolated room and presented with one marshmallow. If the child is willing to wait for a time period until the researcher returns to the room and is able to avoid eating the one marshmallow, he will be given two marshmallows. Some children could do it; some could not. It was interesting to read about the extreme measures some children took in order to avoid eating the single marshmallow until the researcher returned. Many years later, the same children were again assessed, this time as adults. Those children who had delayed gratification were found to be much more successful in completing schooling, in marrying, in raising children, and in life in general. Remarkable.Mischel tells the story of his original research and examines where the research has led and where it is continuing to go. And it has led to some breathtaking places. Idle Grasshoppersand Busy Ants. Thinking Hot and Cold. Protecting the Hurt Self: Self-Distancing. Will Fatigue. And on and on. I loved reading this book. Now if we can just figure out some good ways to teach children howto wait for those two marshmallows we could have a better world."
15,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27758986-kate,5,"I won a copy of this book on Goodreads and I absolutely loved this book! I wasn't familiar with Dr. Mischel's pioneering research on self-control and delayed gratification until reading this book. The Marshmallow Test was created by Dr. Mischel over 40 years ago at Stanford University. Dr. Mischel's research used preschoolers in order to understand the relationship between delaying instant gratification and the cognitive processes used to achieve self-control. Only 30% of the preschoolers were able to delay gratification in order to receive a reward of two marshmallows. Subsequently, Dr. Mischel then followed these preschoolers later in life and discovered that being able to delay gratification resulted in higher test scores, better coping skills, and higher levels of achievement. This book is a very significant contribution to our understanding of the importance of self-control and how to better develop these skills. Since we live in an a society that is very oriented toward instant gratification, the timing of the release of The Marshmallow Test couldn't have come at a better time. "
16,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2112005-natalia,3,"This is a great book if you aren't familiar with the area of executive function (self-control, etc.). I am so I didn't feel like I learned anything new but it was still fun. I think he makes a good case that we can literally never have to utter the words ""nature vs. nurture"" again because it's both, it's always both, and we know it's always both. So no more wondering. Mmmk everyone? "

18,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27728850-alexandra,2,"I chose to read ""The Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self-Control"" by Walter Mischel for two reasons. One- I learned about the study in school and I was interested in learning more. Two- I was hoping the conclusion of the book may help me gain a bit more self control, since I am a soon to be college student I think now is the time to improve on my self discipline. Unfortunately I did not find any solid advice on improving self control in this book, all I ""learned"" was self control tactics i already knew, so I essentially learned nothing to help gain control over my life. This book was just an over all drag in my opinion, all it was, was a retelling of studies and it was rather repetitive. On the other hand in class when I learned about the Marshmallow test I didn't know it was a longitudinal study where the kids were later visited as adults. It fascinated me how the kids who waited for the two marshmallows were on average more successful in later years than those who ate the one marshmallow instantly. I have conflicting feelings based on this book. On one hand it was boring with all the facts, stats and information, which made is hard to get excited about reading when I knew it was summer and I could be doing a million other things or reading another more captivating book. On the other hand, I love learning and being able to talk about this phenomenon with what this book informed me on. In the end my experience with the book was rather ironic. Stop reading and choose another? Or use my self discipline to finish the book? In the end I forced myself to finish... so maybe that was Walter Mischel's goal, to teach discipline by making the reader need discipline to finish reading his boring book. Overall I would not recommend the book due to its repetition... just research the study on Google and save yourself the time. "
19,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20456312-bonnie-samuel,4,"This is a really interesting book! It's not exactly what I was expecting, since most of the focus is on past research studies on children, as opposed to a how-to guide for adults, but I really enjoyed reading it. It shows that self-control can be learned and improved upon, that ""this is just how I am"" isn't really a valid way to excuse behaviors that hurt relationships or personal success and happiness. That's not how you are. That's how you want to be. I could see a lot of myself and my sister in the various scenarios in the book. I would be the one waiting as long as it took for the researcher to come back in the room so I could have two cookies, while she would be the one ringing the bell almost immediately, unable to wait and deciding she would take just the one cookie right now. "
20,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43461633-om-manghani,4,"A nice book, I think Mischel did a good job of getting across his point about willpower, and really hammering it home at the end. Some of the strategies that he talked about were quite fascinating. I liked how he was able to apply his main claim to so many different realms of life, which I did not even think we're possible. He applied self-control to relationships, managing money, and more. In these situations, I would think of self control as a less important tool, but he showed me how important it really is. That being said, almost the whole book was research based, and lacked the different dimensions of a narrative nonfiction book. If he were to connect to the reader more, I think I would have it enjoyed it that much more. "

There are some.You get to know how one part of the brain, labeled the hot brain, reacts immediately to stimuli, while the prefrontal cortex, or the cool brain, can exercise self-control.

23,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61295421-iggy,1,I skim read this because it was dull and repetitive. The content just doesn't suit a story-telling format. It would have been better as an extended article or even just left as a research paper.
24,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4481148-sue,3,"You know that willpower you are trying to employ to resist that extra dessert? I have bad news for you. The ability to resist temptation was already determined within your personality by the time you attended preschool. But before you throw in the towel and say, ""I knew it. This effort is hopeless,"" I have more news for you. Self-control skills, both cognitive and emotional, can be learned, enhanced, and harnessed so that they become automatically activated when you need them. So put down that cupcake and stop blaming your biology, your parents, and/or your cultural upbringing!This book is divided into 3 parts. Though the first part (focusing primarily on the ability to delay gratification and how it develops) is interesting, the book didn't become ""real"" for me until about half way through Part II when the author began to offer specific strategies that have been successfully used -- both with adults and with children -- to build self-control skills. In fact, some of the strategies were very similar to techniques that therapists use to build functional ""emotional regulation"" skills in children with autism (who often have a very hard time saying ""no"" to their immediate desires). At this point, I began marking pages for re-reading and reference so that I could incorporate the strategies that were new to me into my occupational therapy sessions. So, the take-away for this book: If you like reading about the psychology of human development, you may enjoy it. If you work with children who have self-regulation problems, you may find it useful. If you are DETERMINED to improve your own self-control, you will possibly find some useful advice and definitely find some useful strategies, IF you put them into practice. (Ah, and there's the rub -- motivation has to be strong, and motivation can be very hard to come by in the middle of a pandemic when sweatpants are the fashion of the day and cupcakes on the counter look so much more tempting than carrots in the fridge.

25,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16882379-raphael-lysander,2,"It is a nice read. However, Mr. Mischel, like many psychology authors sadly, makes an experiment and suddenly it becomes the solution and cure for many psychological problems like depression and anxiety... And many other things.While many hasty conclusions were based on this experiment regardless of the small statistical presentation I was surprised that non of the follows was considered to complete the understanding of self control:1- the experiment tests whether a child would delay a small treat now for a larger treat later. The thing here is that the larger treat is granted for sure if the child waited,and while it is interesting to study why some kids didn't wait, it is very important to see what would happen if the promise of larger treat was not 100 percent granted.2- how would those children who waited will react in social pressure? If they were with other kids who couldn't wait and eat the small treat in front of them, would they still have the self control to delay gratification? 3- what if, instead of a reward, there was a punishment? Would they still have the same self control and how is it compared to the reward case?4- Dr. Mischel describes those who delay gratification as having better ""cooling"" brains contrary to those who are ""hot"" to act. But where delayed gratification, as a praised quality, stops and where passion starts? And where self control ends and fear of taking actions begins? The experiment seems to draw no such lines.So taking those points in consideration, and that other wider experiment deemed this one's result about future success to be invalid, you wonder: what did this experiment really measured? "
26,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"If you want to watch some small kids deal with the test that gives this book its name, you can see it here. Basically, the children are given a marshmallow, and then offered two choices:1) eat the marshmallow2) wait until the researcher comes back, and if they haven't eaten the marshmallow, they can have a second oneThe researcher would leave the room, but of course the child was secretly observed (in the original case, using a one-way mirror). The original intent of the experiment was to see what would impact how long the child could wait; for example, what if they see a picture of the marshmallow instead of having an actual marshmallow in front of them?However, after a few years had passed, it occurred to the original experimenter that he could go back and see if the ability of a 3 or 4 year old child to postpone enjoyment of a marshmallow (in order to get two), could predict anything else about life success. It turns out, it predicted quite a lot. Walter Mischel's original experiment has since been replicated, and extended, in several other settings, including other countries. It has also been widely reported on, and Mischel claims to have decided to write this book, because he was troubled by some of the interpretations he saw of it.In particular, he found some of the summaries of his work made it sound as if the ability to delay gratification were an inborn trait, and fated you for either success or failure in life. It turns out that one's ability to delay gratification, is modifiable by quite a lot, and does not simply measure some inborn ability for self-restraint. For example, if the experimenter breaks a promise to the child just prior to the marshmallow test, this reduces the amount of time they can wait, and if the subject is told to imagine the marshmallow as being framed, like a picture, rather than being a real marshmallow, this increases the amount of time they can wait.Much of Mischel's book discusses the difference between the brain's ""hot"" and ""cool"" systems. The ""hot"" system is responsible for generating immediate responses, such as ""stomp on the brakes to avoid hitting that person"". The ""cool"" system is responsible for more reasoned and rational responses, such as, well, ""don't eat that marshmallow yet, the lady said we could have two if we wait"". He looks at various coping strategies for helping your ""cool"" system to override your ""hot"" system, when you're trying to lose weight, quit smoking, save money, and so forth. He also looks at how things like a chaotic school environment can erode your ability to delay gratification, since chaos tends to make us suspicious of our ability to predict the future, and that in turn erodes our ability to sacrifice present gratification for future gain. Thus, for example, if a nation is wracked by civil war, or a child attends a school which is underfunded and poorly run, the impact on the ability of those who grew up in that environment to delay gratification can be long-lived.He also spends a fair amount of time examining how some people can have great self-control in some contexts, but not in others. For example, he says, powerful politicians who are laid low by a penchant for illicit romance, prostitutes, illegal drugs, and so forth. I tend to think that the explanation here is simpler than Mischel does. He thinks that one's ability to empower the ""cool"" system depends on building up habits and strategies of thinking that don't always transfer between different contexts. I think it's more that powerful men do these things because they think they can get away with it, and often they do. But this is a minor quibble with a mostly well-written book, with a self-deprecating and humorous author's voice that is quick to give credit to the many other researchers who have helped with or extended his work. Mischel has worked for decades at a topic of psychology that is of both fundamental and also widespread practical importance: how to achieve self-control. Given how many other psychologists have done work that is either unsound scientifically, or not very relevant to our own personal lives, we should be thankful to Mischel for showing how it should be done. That he has written a thoroughly readable and entertaining book about it is a great bonus (even if, like myself, you're not all that keen on marshmallows)."
27,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"The Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self-Control by Walter MischelThe ""marshmallow test"" is one of the few psychological experiments that has permeated into large parts of the public consciousness. In the original experiment, done by Walter Mischel and his colleagues in the 1960s at Stanford, young children aged seven to nine would be asked to choose from an assortment of treats. Options included the eponymous marshmallows, but tykes could choose a cookies or whatever they found most tempting. The experimenter placed one of the treats on the table at which the child was seated. The game was that the experimenter was going to exit the otherwise empty room and the child could either choose to eat the single treat or wait until the experimenter returned 15 minutes later, at which time he or she would be given TWO of the treats. It was a test of how well the child could delay gratification. Through follow-up research, Mischel found that children who developed more effective strategies for delaying their marshmallow-related gratifications grew up to be more successful, healthier, and more well adapted to the difficulties of life. This book is an examination of why this is the case. There are chapters on what Mischel calls the ""hot and cold systems"" that underlie our thinking and how we deal with temptation. Other chapters deal with differences in how people react to threats, negative self-image, tragedies, and failure. Throughout each of these the author ties the concepts back to the marshmallow test and subsequent research in that line. I found the book interesting and appreciated how Mischel pushed out from the original topic of delay gratification to deal with so many other things that stem from it. There's some interesting things in there about clinical psychology and what the ""cool system"" has to do with anxieties, fears, and maintaining good self-perception. Mischel is clearly an expert in this stuff, having spent decades studying it and making friends or colleagues out of others who share his interests. I liked hearing about experiments and interventions ranging from the Standford psychology labs (where a horrifying clown tried to entice children with quaint toys) to the inner city schools of New York during the 1980s (where one child literally tried to light Mischel on fire). The only complaint I have about the book is that it doesn't tell stories as well as other books of this type sometimes do. We get some of this when it comes directly from Mischel's experiences and history, but where other authors might tell stories about people or situations that support their thesis and recommendations, we rarely get that here. As a result, large swaths of the book become a bit of a slog with just descriptions of experimental procedures or theory to get us through. A narrative or two mixed in with a relatable person or familiar event would have made the book more enjoyable and even more practical."
28,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577651-said-almaskery,4,"The book is important, but I have to say it could have been written better. I am comparing this with ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"".Nevertheless there were very good insights on what makes a person more capable of controlling his ""hot"" temper and shifting it into the ""cool"" zone. I would recommend the book for anyone who would like to understand what makes him what he wants on the spot and cannot wait or delay the gratification. The book could have been a 5 star with the informative content, but I felt there was somehow repetition and unneeded examples. Enjoy!"

My complaint is that far too much time was used in going over the study again and again, and then the children's responses. Far too little about adulthood and more examples of how behaviors can be set and overcome...or not."

31,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"Reading The Marshmallow Test is rewarding. The book is not perfect, but it is thought-provoking. First, about the experiment. The big hype about the Marshmallow Test centers around the correlation between childhood self-control and lifetime achievements. But when Mischel first designed the experiment, he focused on something else: how various conditions affect self-control. I find the devised experimental conditions intriguing. For example, Mischel found children's waiting time doubled when they are suggested to think about the marshmallow's ""cool"" aspect (its shape and puffiness) instead of its ""hot"" aspect (its taste). In another test condition, prompting children to recall a bitter experience makes them reach for candies almost immediately. But to my disappointment, Mischel did not talk about the sample size of the follow-up studies. He also skipped mentioning he did not control for the social-economic status of the kids in finding the correlation between waiting time and achievement. (A replication study found such correlation was reduced by 2/3 after controlling family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment.) He offered only limited arguments against critiques of his studies. As a result, questions kept emerging as I read his book. Apart from self-control, does longer waiting time reflects other qualities, such as stronger short-term memory, or higher ability to internalize social norms? If so, did those qualities instead of self-control make the willing-to-wait kids score higher in SAT? I understand I was reading a general audience book instead of a literature review. But still. I also wish Mischel could have combed through concepts more carefully. At one point in the book, he starts to talk about ""executive function"" as an interchangeable term of self-control. But is it? What are the differences and relationships between self control, impulse control, gratification delay, conscientiousness, and executive function? Which of them is the marshmallow test measuring? Intuitively, I understand what self-control means. But I still wish to take a look under its hood. Complaints apart, I find many discussions about self-control by Mischel intriguing. For example, he listed experiment evidence to argue that the ""cross-situational consistency of personality"" is an illusion. Instead, he claims that we each have a ""behavioral signature""—what we predictably do if particular situational triggers occur. The takeaway is that one should not label oneself as having great or little self-control. Instead, one should try to identify the exact hot spots that trigger impulsive reactions and make ""If-Then"" implementation plans ahead of time. By the same logic, Mischel argues that when we need to deal with behavior problems, it is often enough just to treat the ""symptom"" without digging deep into underlying causes such as early childhood traumas, of which the individual was unconscious. It is also interesting to know Mischel does not believe in ""ego depletion"". He claimed that students who were depleted in the experiments simply do not have enough motivation to comply with the experimenters' unrelenting demands for them to do boring tasks. He cited studies that show when students were primed to believe perseverance on tough tasks is energizing rather than depleting, they do not suffer from will fatigue. Mischel does not teach step-to-step tips like authors of self-help books. But I did learn useful principles and tricks. Other than ""identifying behavioral signatures"" which I mentioned above, I also learned it's helpful to resist temptation if one could change the mental presentation of the temptation. One could also create a psychological distance to a situation by imagining how someone else would behave. The fundamental principle Mischel summarized is simple but powerful: cool the ""now"", heat the ""later."" It is easy to note the first half of the principle, but I did not think of the second: to take the future into account, it helps to make it vivid. Bottom line: even though I am not fully convinced of many conclusions by the author, I think he poses interesting questions. Stray observations:• Mischel decided to follow up with the kids after he noticed a pattern in his daughters' suppertime discussion about them. His three daughters knew the experiment subjects personally because they were of similar ages and attended the same school as them. In fact, his daughters all participated in the experiment themselves. I wonder how long they have waited for the marshmallow…• Even though he has written a textbook about personality, Mischel claims that as he takes the limitation of commonly used personality tests seriously, he has resolved never to create one himself. "
32,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"This is probably the most cited test from the books that I have read during the past 3 years as almost every book about willpower, self-control cognitive psychology mentions it. There wasn't completely new factual information for me but some interesting angles and terms used for improving self-control (distractions, concentrating on the future).“the ability to delay immediate gratification for the sake of future consequences is an acquirable cognitive skill.” Our self-control depends on two systems that are functioning in our body: one that instantly reacts to our environment (HOT), and one that controls our behavior (COOL).We choose the situations in which we exercise our self-control (not consistent across the board). Our self-control skills start developing when we’re very young, and they continue to be determined by our environment as we get older. This continuous development process means our ability to control ourselves is fluid. Anyone can improve his or her skills by focusing on the future and strategically using distractions.*The part of our brain that regulates self-control develops as we grow.*Our environment shapes our self-control abilities. *How much self-control we have depends on the context, but it is ultimately unlimited.*The result of a child's performance in the Marshmallow Test correlates with their self-control as an adult.*Children should be taught that they're capable of making their own decisions and that those decisions have consequences. *You can improve your self-control skills by concentrating on the future and putting distance between you and your temptation.

I picked up this book because I was attracted to the title “the marshmallow test” At first I didn’t expect that content would be about human behaviour, but then seeing that it was about the understanding of self control so I found it’s even more interesting. Self-control is one of everyone’s weakness, I believe. So how can we control ourselves? This book gave us a very clear picture of it in easy way, I mean not academically. The experiment on children about delaying of gratification blown my mind. For those who are keen to know about how we think and act and really want to be a better human! Especially, if you are looking for the way to get out from the circle of unhealthy lifestyle such as smoking, eating, heartbroken, anxiety and so on, this book could let yourself know yourself more.

There were interesting pieces of information, and cool case studies, but in my opinion it was far too long. Main points from the book:1. Some people are better than others to resist temptation and regulate painful emotions 2. These differences become visible as early as preschool age, and can predict outcomes over course of life 3. The traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you have or don’t have a lot of is false.. self control can be learned, improved, enhanced.. 4. We don’t have to be the victims of our social and biological histories 5. Self control involves strategies and insight, goals and motivation The most helpful advice I came away with is that we have more control over our environment and even genetics than we think we do. The “I think I can” idea is very powerful, and plays a huge part in our lives."

Some good observations are made, and the book may be useful source material. The audio book was read by Alan Alda.This got a pretty favorable review when released; I added it to my to-read list immediately. Walter Mischel devised the original study, and his anecdotes are a good addition. He also reports on related studies and derivatives. Asked frequently about this study, he emphasizes that correlation is not causation.He also leans into self-help, suggesting action for parents, teachers, and selves. While there are some good observations here, they can be lost in a sea of discussions of nature and nurture. At times the psychological study descriptions can also be quite dry. 2½ stars."

I'm sure I'll be returning to these pages as they contain a plethora of insights related to the very concise topic of self-control, many of which are essential to understanding the actions of ourselves and others.

The book could have some more practical examples, but nonetheless the basic is still the same, as is the thousand year old truth, delay of gratification for higher rewards.

44,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20880982-thethousanderclub,3,"I first heard about the marshmallow test in 2010 while listening Dieter F. Uchtdorf's conference address titled Continue in Patience. I thought the concept was fascinating at the time, and over the years I have stumbled across various accounts of the tests and their impact on the academic community, as well as public policy debates. The Marshmallow Test, written by Walter Mischel, is a deeper dive into the origins of the famous study and the subsequent academic work which has been done to confirm and challenge its findings.The reader will immediately notice how the marshmallow test and its findings are far more nuanced than how its often reported in the media. It's not that the findings are incorrect or distorted, it's that the story is so much richer and more complex than a headline. I found this to be the most intriguing and valuable aspect of The Marshmallow Test. I love taking a deeper dive into assumptions. When it comes to human nature and human behavior generally, there are a lot of assumptions and even intellectual biases. Mischel takes a special interest in the nature versus nurture debate, and he points toward a bevy of academic research to support his findings. As I am wont to do, I accept the premises and conclusions of most academic research with limited skepticism because there is always another view, another study, and another reasonable opinion to suggest a contrarian viewpoint.Although all of the material is interesting, the writing isn't noticeably poignant. Mischel appears to be much more of a researcher than an author. In addition, The Marshmallow Test probably could have been a bit shorter. The main point of the book was made repeatedly and in different contexts. A few stories and a few research studies probably could have been omitted and the results would have been the same. Having said that, Mischel does spare the reader the graphs and charts which usually accompany a book like this. I enjoy looking at those and trying to understand the data at a more granular level, but it wasn't necessary for this book, which is mostly written for the layman. In conclusion, the marshmallow test is a very, very interesting academic study which deserves some attention, especially in the context of public policy, such as education. The debate over nature versus nurture is a fundamental one, and the results from Mischel's work and others contributes in a significant way to the debate. The Marshmallow Test was a nice look behind the curtain of a particular set of academic studies, and you have interest in something like that then this book is worth perusing. Otherwise, it may be a bit of slog.http://thethousanderclub.blogspot.com/"
45,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40311431-samantha-welker,5,"This book was a horrible choice to read at night before going to bed. It was so thought-provoking and full of interesting scientific facts that it got my wheels turning before I was trying to fall asleep. My only complaint about this book was that it did focus a bit too much on children and how to shape and mold their ""hot"" and ""cold"" impulses that manage their levels of self control. If I were a parent, I would find it fascinating, but it did harp on that a bit long for a single gal like me.Some of my favorite tid bits (without giving too much away) from this book were:Contextualized Self-Control: Why do we have self control over somethings, but not others? President Clinton had the self-control and delay ability to win a Rhodes scholarship, attain a Yale law degree and be elected president, but had no ability or willingness to exert self control for junk food and White House interns.The Tired Will: Are there limits to how much self-control and delay of gratification we can exert before will fatigue takes over? This is extremely important to think about in terms of how to self-regulateBorn with it or Worked for it: A recent topic of discussion with my boss, The Marshmallow Test argues that the traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you either have a lot or you don't (or can't do much about it either way) is false. Self control skills, both cognitive and emotional, can be learned, enhanced, and harnessed so that they become automatically activated when you need them. It's the failure to develop these self-control skills, and the lack of goals, values and social support needed to use it constructively that shapes a human being. To summarize, what I got most out of this book was the answer to the question of whether human nature is, at its core, malleable or fixed. Some people see self-control ability, willpower, intelligence and other characteristics as ""fixed"", unchangeable traits from the very start of life. They read the experimental evidence that executive function and self-control improve after educational interventions and interpret that as short-term effects unlikely to make a long-term difference, just little tricks that don't change inborn traits. If we allow the evidence to make a difference in our personal view points of individuals, we are able to understand and learn more about those around us and their actions and the motivation behind them.

46,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20310432-joshua,5,"This is a well-researched book that delves into the phycology and (philosophy to an extent) of the question regarding (Self-)control. The control in question is not just our ability to delay gratification or to quite an addiction, it is the ability of control over our lives. It explores the well-known debate nature vs nurture and what factors determines an individual’s characters. It is splendid and goes beyond self-control to also examine human nature. Very informative and well articulated with great examples."
47,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13082865-snehil,4,"""योगयुक्तो विशुद्धात्मा विजितात्मा जितेन्द्रियः।सर्वभूतात्मभूतात्मा कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते॥७॥""This above is a very small part of a very ancient philosophical song. The first sentence here means that the object of life is to have control over your basic instincts rather than our basic instincts controlling our behavior/life. Th book, "" The Marshmallow test"" is about the relationship between our ability to control our basic instinctive actions (controlled by hot system of the brain, mostly reactionary) and our long term success. I had first learnt about the Marshmallow test in 1990's and had found it pretty impressive. It always remained somewhere in the back of my mind. Only after reading this book, I learnt that the author has dedicated all his research life to explaining the basis of this test. That is exactly what this book explains. It is a fascinating journey and makes a lot of sense.I had an expectation that this book would elaborate on what made a child do better in these tests. The author did spend some time talking about nature and nurture's role but there seemed to be lack of data with regard to this. This is understandable as collection of this data could only be observational studies and not experiments and observational studies come with a lot of confounding variables. So, the author focused more experiments that justified some training techniques to deal with problem behaviors or to help people who would have scored lower on the test. At times, where the data was missing, the author used anecdotal evidence to support his thesis, which wasn't really needed and reduced the credibility of the book. There was a bit of inconsistency with respect to how much the author wanted to share. In certain cases the author would give a gist of the experimental design and then elaborate on the results but at other times he would only give the results without giving any details about the experimental designs and methods, which was disappointing. A couple of times, I found serious confounding in the experiments which made the conclusions pretty dubious.Despite the limitations mentioned above, it still was a sensible book and did give a lot of insight into human behavior. It partly validated the above mentioned philosophy, if at all that philosophy needed validation."
48,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226133-bookworm,3,"Would you wait for the marshmallows? In an experiment that is now well-known, researchers tested the self-control of children that were presented with a treat (marshmallows, Oreos, etc.). The premise was simple. Could they wait 20 minutes or so and therefore get extra treats to eat later? Or did they lack the patience and eat them anyway? Researchers found that this translated to later development: the children who waited (for however long) were more likely to be described as more disciplined in school, have higher SAT scores, have a lower BMI as adults as as having distinctly different brain scans later in life. Working backwards, the researchers also found that this happened with younger children too. Babies and toddlers who could comfort themselves with toys or other distractions when separated from a parent would become marshmallow-waiters. That said, Mischel emphasizes that this is not fate and describes how people who might have initially tested as being more impatient may have found ways of coping, strategies to change, etc. These involve role-playing scenarios, positive thinking, thinking through one's actions to the end result, etc. In part two he gets into more science-y jargon which I found boring. Part 1 (which summarizes most of the findings and walks through the experiments) was very conversational, very interesting. But Part 2 lost me. In Part 3 Mischel then tries to translate the results to larger world settings. How can schools and the educational system help teach children such skills? He clearly shows how slightly older children (8-10 were the ages of the children when Mischel first meets/talks to them) than those in the Marshmallow Experiment (who are around pre-school age) can adapt and change, but it involves their own personal desires plus a little bit of outside help (in this case it's KIPP, or the Knowledge is Power Program). As a child's brain is more malleable than an adults, it's key to get to them early. It was a pleasant read, although as I mentioned it was somewhat uneven in readability. But definitely a good pick up for anyone who has any interest in any of the themes or concepts that this famous ""Marshmallow Experiment"" covers."

I was hoping this book would help me learn better self-control techniques, but it was mostly science-driven.If you are looking for practical guidance to help achieve control techniques, this one might not be for you; however, if you have a scientific interest, then it's a worthwhile read.  My rating: 3 out of 5 marshmallows"
50,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46619134-maria-gonzalez,4," ""The marshmallow test,"" by Walter Mischel, Walter was observing whether the kids were mastering self-control. The marshmallow test was taken place at the Bing Nursery school of Stanford University with children between six months through five years of age. The marshmallow test had sixteen boy participants and sixteen girl participants, each participant was given one marshmallow and explained that if they waited fifteen minutes then they would either get one Oreo cookie, another marshmallow, or a pretzel stick, but if children were to unpatient to wait for fifteen minutes then they would not receive another treat. the researchers of the marshmallow test found out that children who were able to wait for fifteen minutes in order to receive another treat were most likely to get better SAT scores, would have better life outcomes, and a better education. The child's decision to either wait for fifteen minutes or to just give up due to their temptation to eat the delicious marshmallow, it all depended on their age, and background ethnicity.  What I liked about the book was that it explained self-control between children and adults and also because Walter put his observations towards the marshmallow test in a very entertaining hilarious descriptive way. this book was very good due to its long term analysis towards the study it's self, which I also gained more knowledge towards the overall meaning of the marshmallow test especially with the development strategies and the mechanisms of self-control. Another reason why I love the marshmallow book was because my psychology teacher first brought up the marshmallow experiment during my intro to psychology class, which made the class even more interesting. I didn't hate the book because I gained new knowledge from the experiment and because I was also very interested in the experiment ever since my intro to psychology class. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in psychology because it's a very fluffy, easy book to read. "
51,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18980203-charles-eliot,4,"""The Marshmallow Test"" takes its name from psychological studies, beginning in the 1960s and still continuing, which investigated self-control in very young children. The child subject was left alone in a room with a marshmallow, and told that if she didn't touch the marshmallow before the investigator returned, she could have two marshmallows. Kids showed different degrees of ability to resist temptation, and variations of the test probed the coping skills the kids employed. Over time a general framework emerged. We all have what the author, Walter Mischel, calls ""hot"" and ""cold"" responses. Hot responses are rapid, instinctive, urgent and emotional. Cold responses are analytical, objective, slow, and thoughtful. (This lines up almost exactly with Daniel Kahneman's insights in ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"") The key to exerting self-control is to cool down the response to the present, and heat up the response to the future. In other words, making the future gain more tempting than the present temptation. There are plenty of small and helpful tricks for this. One trick is to objectify the present temptation (""imagine the marshmallow with a frame around it and think of it as a picture of a marshmallow, not the real thing"") while drawing attention to the visceral pleasure of the future achievement (""it's going to be so cool to have two marshmallows to eat""). The most important trick of all is the ""if ... then"" trick, where you imagine what you will do if tempted. ""If ... then"" thinking has the effect of immediately derailing your hot response. The important message of The Marshmallow Test is that self-control is not entirely, or even predominantly, innate, but is a learned skill built on the brain's plasticity. The learning starts very early, and can continue throughout life. "
52,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,3,"Expanding upon a fascinating experiment conducted at the Bing Nursery School in Stanford University many decades ago, Walter Mischel expounds on the benefits derived by delaying instant gratification for future success. The famous experiment, now popular as ""The Marshmallow Test"" primarily aimed to put to test the will power of little children who were asked to choose between two alternatives. While under the first option, they could immediately take a candy/sweet/marshmallow (as per their preference) that was kept on a table, they were presented with a second choice under which they could lay claim to grab 2 candies/sweets/marshmallows if they could resist their desires by a mere 20 minutes.A researcher would leave the room with a child sitting alone in front of the table upon which the candies were kept. If the child, having wrestled out by temptation decided to pick the candy, all he/she had to do was ring a bill kept on the table, hearing which the researcher would return to the room and allow the child to take one sweet of his/choice. However if the child was successfully able to resist the allure of the sweet for all of 20 minutes, the researcher would enter the room after the designated time limit and gift the winner any 2 sweets of the victor's choice.This simple experiment shed enormously valuable insights into the workings of the human behaviour and led the way to identifying many improvements that usually go on to embellish the living of a person, a classic example being the ability to stop smoking after being addicted to nicotine for an imperceptibly long period.This books makes essential reading for anyone who is interested in gaining control over the more rustic senses thereby setting a focused path towards progression both in career as well as in life.""The Mashmallow Test"" - A fulfilling and rich after taste!"

Amygdala is Latin for almond shaped.Use of the ""strange situation"" test where toddlers are briefly introduced to a stranger and then left with that person with other toys and distractions was a key indicator of whether the child could activate distraction strategies later in the marshmallow testing.Mischel's colleague Carole Dweck at UCLA has two models: incremental growth where a child does not believe that their capacity is limited and ""entity theorists"" that see their capacity as determined at birth.  Mischel asked questions in the 70s of the children to determine their mindsets.Carl Jung famously said that people study what they are not good at.Aversive counter conditioning is a strategy wherein an individual uses a disgusting sensory object to use the hot system to their advantage in dissuading them from pursuing a temptation.  The author used the example of a can of spent cigarette butts where smelling it was absolutely nauseating.ToM is an abbreviation for Theory of mind which is the important mental ability that begins in early childhood allowing us to understand that our beliefs may be false and that the way things appear may not be reality.  Theory of mind helps us to see that other people might no perceive the same scene or event the way that we do.The author also spoke volumes about development of executive function and if-then scenario development that could be used to harness the power of the hot/emotional/reactive system to avoid temptations."

Maybe its because I want to take a fresh perspective on the new year. The Marshmallow Test was a very interesting read. The way the author personalized the scientific data made The Marshmallow Test an easy and compelling read. By testing pre-school children in their ability to resist one marshmallow for a specific amount of time for a reward of two marshmallows the author takes a deeper look at people's hot and cold systems and how they influence self control. The study found that the more stress in a child's early development can impact the development of the cold system that impedes a child's ability resist temptation and increases impulsive decisions. This increased impulsiveness can lead to a more difficult life and poor long term planning. The good news: you can, even as an adult, condition your cold system to cool off your hot system and make better, more informed decisions about your life. By incorporating coping strategies like using ""If, Then"" and thinking about your decisions in a way that brings to life how those decisions will impact your daily life can help you better understand the impact of any potential decisions and help you make better informed decisions.The Marshmallow Test is a good read because it not only explains the scientific studies in an easy to understand way but it also provides real world coping skills that can be used by adults and children alike. If you're going to start your year off with a self-help book make it one that will actually be able to help you and I think The Marshmallow Test is just the book you're looking for. Pick up The Marshmallow Test you won't be disappointed. "

Any book that talks about the importance of self-control and delayed gratification is going to be good but not popular in todays society of fast food and get rich quick schemes. Walter Mischel talks about his marshmallow test and the different research that has been done since the 1960's in the field of self-control. For those that don't know, the marshmallow test says, if you don't have one marshmallow now you can have two later. Other topics that are discussed are persistence, optimism, thinking about our future self to make wise decisions in the present moment, and helping cool down hot emotions that can lead to destructive impulsive behaviors. I liked the book a lot because it gives useful strategies to curbing undesired appetites and how to prepare for the future. Walter uses data to back up all his information which is always a plus. He is a highly recognized and praised professor in the field of psychology and after reading this book I can see why. I hardly write reviews but thought I should exercise some self-control and write one for ""The Marshmallow Test."" Buy this book and you won't regret it! "

Fortunately, evolution moves very slowly and human nature has changed very little in the last hundred (or thousand for that matter) years, so this advice is compatible with previous research-based parenting books.

I have related to it in all aspects of self-help, and a refresher to my psychology knowledge. The only drawback I did, was buying a scientific and a self help book as ebook. It didn't do it justice and it became a tedious read for me.I am happy with the way the author constructed his book, and labeled / went though what each chapter will contain. Albeit the title highlights on self-success, he was mostly focusing on children in the upbringing process and not the adult population or their set of problems, which I appreciate for those becoming parents, but it did not address the adult population entirely. Nonetheless, he had great techniques offered throughout the book that any will be able to take away and apply it in their life. (For example If-Then, keeping a mental dairy to understand your stressors..etc)There were some moments in the book that really hit me. When the the therapist asked his client, whom he felt the world was falling apart, and the therapist just asked ""would you like to?""I would definitely go over it and refresh my memory over the content offered in this book and try to apply it my own life.

59,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"The Marshmallow Test by Walter Mischel is an inquiry into the workings of self-control. In a now classic experiment, Dr. Mischel determined that many factors controlled by the Prefrontal Cortex can manifest themselves in children as young as four, perhaps even earlier. The Marshmallow Test itself can only be administered to children of a certain age, or else the child might not understand the instructions.The Test itself is ingenious and quite simple; offer the child a treat of some kind, it doesn’t have to be a marshmallow and tell the child that if they wait for around ten minutes they can have two marshmallows instead of one. Surprisingly, it was found that this determines a great many things later on in life. Self-control and willpower are instrumental in deciding SAT scores, whether or not the person will get in trouble, and whether the person will participate in risky behaviors or not.In the 1960s it wasn’t thought to be the case, but willpower can be strengthened like any muscle. The key is to think of willpower as something that is determined by effort and not by birth. Countless studies starting with this one have shown this to be the case. Thus, this book was fascinating."

61,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"Reading The Marshmallow Test is rewarding. The book is not perfect, but it is thought-provoking. First, about the experiment. The big hype about the Marshmallow Test centers around the correlation between childhood self-control and lifetime achievements. But when Mischel first designed the experiment, he focused on something else: how various conditions affect self-control. I find the devised experimental conditions intriguing. For example, Mischel found children's waiting time doubled when they are suggested to think about the marshmallow's ""cool"" aspect (its shape and puffiness) instead of its ""hot"" aspect (its taste). In another test condition, prompting children to recall a bitter experience makes them reach for candies almost immediately. But to my disappointment, Mischel did not talk about the sample size of the follow-up studies. He also skipped mentioning he did not control for the social-economic status of the kids in finding the correlation between waiting time and achievement. (A replication study found such correlation was reduced by 2/3 after controlling family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment.) He offered only limited arguments against critiques of his studies. As a result, questions kept emerging as I read his book. Apart from self-control, does longer waiting time reflects other qualities, such as stronger short-term memory, or higher ability to internalize social norms? If so, did those qualities instead of self-control make the willing-to-wait kids score higher in SAT? I understand I was reading a general audience book instead of a literature review. But still. I also wish Mischel could have combed through concepts more carefully. At one point in the book, he starts to talk about ""executive function"" as an interchangeable term of self-control. But is it? What are the differences and relationships between self control, impulse control, gratification delay, conscientiousness, and executive function? Which of them is the marshmallow test measuring? Intuitively, I understand what self-control means. But I still wish to take a look under its hood. Complaints apart, I find many discussions about self-control by Mischel intriguing. For example, he listed experiment evidence to argue that the ""cross-situational consistency of personality"" is an illusion. Instead, he claims that we each have a ""behavioral signature""—what we predictably do if particular situational triggers occur. The takeaway is that one should not label oneself as having great or little self-control. Instead, one should try to identify the exact hot spots that trigger impulsive reactions and make ""If-Then"" implementation plans ahead of time. By the same logic, Mischel argues that when we need to deal with behavior problems, it is often enough just to treat the ""symptom"" without digging deep into underlying causes such as early childhood traumas, of which the individual was unconscious. It is also interesting to know Mischel does not believe in ""ego depletion"". He claimed that students who were depleted in the experiments simply do not have enough motivation to comply with the experimenters' unrelenting demands for them to do boring tasks. He cited studies that show when students were primed to believe perseverance on tough tasks is energizing rather than depleting, they do not suffer from will fatigue. Mischel does not teach step-to-step tips like authors of self-help books. But I did learn useful principles and tricks. Other than ""identifying behavioral signatures"" which I mentioned above, I also learned it's helpful to resist temptation if one could change the mental presentation of the temptation. One could also create a psychological distance to a situation by imagining how someone else would behave. The fundamental principle Mischel summarized is simple but powerful: cool the ""now"", heat the ""later."" It is easy to note the first half of the principle, but I did not think of the second: to take the future into account, it helps to make it vivid. Bottom line: even though I am not fully convinced of many conclusions by the author, I think he poses interesting questions. Stray observations:• Mischel decided to follow up with the kids after he noticed a pattern in his daughters' suppertime discussion about them. His three daughters knew the experiment subjects personally because they were of similar ages and attended the same school as them. In fact, his daughters all participated in the experiment themselves. I wonder how long they have waited for the marshmallow…• Even though he has written a textbook about personality, Mischel claims that as he takes the limitation of commonly used personality tests seriously, he has resolved never to create one himself.

There wasn't completely new factual information for me but some interesting angles and terms used for improving self-control (distractions, concentrating on the future).“the ability to delay immediate gratification for the sake of future consequences is an acquirable cognitive skill.” Our self-control depends on two systems that are functioning in our body: one that instantly reacts to our environment (HOT), and one that controls our behavior (COOL).We choose the situations in which we exercise our self-control (not consistent across the board). Our self-control skills start developing when we’re very young, and they continue to be determined by our environment as we get older. This continuous development process means our ability to control ourselves is fluid. Anyone can improve his or her skills by focusing on the future and strategically using distractions.*The part of our brain that regulates self-control develops as we grow.*Our environment shapes our self-control abilities. *How much self-control we have depends on the context, but it is ultimately unlimited.*The result of a child's performance in the Marshmallow Test correlates with their self-control as an adult.*Children should be taught that they're capable of making their own decisions and that those decisions have consequences. *You can improve your self-control skills by concentrating on the future and putting distance between you and your temptation.

Self-control is one of everyone’s weakness, I believe. So how can we control ourselves? This book gave us a very clear picture of it in easy way, I mean not academically. The experiment on children about delaying of gratification blown my mind. For those who are keen to know about how we think and act and really want to be a better human!

There were interesting pieces of information, and cool case studies, but in my opinion it was far too long. Main points from the book:1. Some people are better than others to resist temptation and regulate painful emotions 2. These differences become visible as early as preschool age, and can predict outcomes over course of life 3. The traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you have or don’t have a lot of is false.. self control can be learned, improved, enhanced.. 4. We don’t have to be the victims of our social and biological histories 5. Self control involves strategies and insight, goals and motivation The most helpful advice I came away with is that we have more control over our environment and even genetics than we think we do.

Walter Mischel devised the original study, and his anecdotes are a good addition. He also reports on related studies and derivatives. Asked frequently about this study, he emphasizes that correlation is not causation.He also leans into self-help, suggesting action for parents, teachers, and selves.

74,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20880982-thethousanderclub,3,"I first heard about the marshmallow test in 2010 while listening Dieter F. Uchtdorf's conference address titled Continue in Patience. I thought the concept was fascinating at the time, and over the years I have stumbled across various accounts of the tests and their impact on the academic community, as well as public policy debates. The Marshmallow Test, written by Walter Mischel, is a deeper dive into the origins of the famous study and the subsequent academic work which has been done to confirm and challenge its findings.The reader will immediately notice how the marshmallow test and its findings are far more nuanced than how its often reported in the media. It's not that the findings are incorrect or distorted, it's that the story is so much richer and more complex than a headline. I found this to be the most intriguing and valuable aspect of The Marshmallow Test. I love taking a deeper dive into assumptions. When it comes to human nature and human behavior generally, there are a lot of assumptions and even intellectual biases. Mischel takes a special interest in the nature versus nurture debate, and he points toward a bevy of academic research to support his findings. As I am wont to do, I accept the premises and conclusions of most academic research with limited skepticism because there is always another view, another study, and another reasonable opinion to suggest a contrarian viewpoint.Although all of the material is interesting, the writing isn't noticeably poignant. Mischel appears to be much more of a researcher than an author. In addition, The Marshmallow Test probably could have been a bit shorter. The main point of the book was made repeatedly and in different contexts. A few stories and a few research studies probably could have been omitted and the results would have been the same. Having said that, Mischel does spare the reader the graphs and charts which usually accompany a book like this. I enjoy looking at those and trying to understand the data at a more granular level, but it wasn't necessary for this book, which is mostly written for the layman. In conclusion, the marshmallow test is a very, very interesting academic study which deserves some attention, especially in the context of public policy, such as education. The debate over nature versus nurture is a fundamental one, and the results from Mischel's work and others contributes in a significant way to the debate. The Marshmallow Test was a nice look behind the curtain of a particular set of academic studies, and you have interest in something like that then this book is worth perusing. Otherwise, it may be a bit of slog.http://thethousanderclub.blogspot.com/"
75,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40311431-samantha-welker,5,"This book was a horrible choice to read at night before going to bed. It was so thought-provoking and full of interesting scientific facts that it got my wheels turning before I was trying to fall asleep. My only complaint about this book was that it did focus a bit too much on children and how to shape and mold their ""hot"" and ""cold"" impulses that manage their levels of self control. If I were a parent, I would find it fascinating, but it did harp on that a bit long for a single gal like me.Some of my favorite tid bits (without giving too much away) from this book were:Contextualized Self-Control: Why do we have self control over somethings, but not others? President Clinton had the self-control and delay ability to win a Rhodes scholarship, attain a Yale law degree and be elected president, but had no ability or willingness to exert self control for junk food and White House interns.The Tired Will: Are there limits to how much self-control and delay of gratification we can exert before will fatigue takes over? This is extremely important to think about in terms of how to self-regulateBorn with it or Worked for it: A recent topic of discussion with my boss, The Marshmallow Test argues that the traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you either have a lot or you don't (or can't do much about it either way) is false. Self control skills, both cognitive and emotional, can be learned, enhanced, and harnessed so that they become automatically activated when you need them. It's the failure to develop these self-control skills, and the lack of goals, values and social support needed to use it constructively that shapes a human being. To summarize, what I got most out of this book was the answer to the question of whether human nature is, at its core, malleable or fixed. Some people see self-control ability, willpower, intelligence and other characteristics as ""fixed"", unchangeable traits from the very start of life. They read the experimental evidence that executive function and self-control improve after educational interventions and interpret that as short-term effects unlikely to make a long-term difference, just little tricks that don't change inborn traits. If we allow the evidence to make a difference in our personal view points of individuals, we are able to understand and learn more about those around us and their actions and the motivation behind them.

The control in question is not just our ability to delay gratification or to quite an addiction, it is the ability of control over our lives. It explores the well-known debate nature vs nurture and what factors determines an individual’s characters. It is splendid and goes beyond self-control to also examine human nature. Very informative and well articulated with great examples."

The first sentence here means that the object of life is to have control over your basic instincts rather than our basic instincts controlling our behavior/life. Th book, "" The Marshmallow test"" is about the relationship between our ability to control our basic instinctive actions (controlled by hot system of the brain, mostly reactionary) and our long term success. I had first learnt about the Marshmallow test in 1990's and had found it pretty impressive. It always remained somewhere in the back of my mind. Only after reading this book, I learnt that the author has dedicated all his research life to explaining the basis of this test. That is exactly what this book explains. It is a fascinating journey and makes a lot of sense.I had an expectation that this book would elaborate on what made a child do better in these tests. The author did spend some time talking about nature and nurture's role but there seemed to be lack of data with regard to this. This is understandable as collection of this data could only be observational studies and not experiments and observational studies come with a lot of confounding variables. So, the author focused more experiments that justified some training techniques to deal with problem behaviors or to help people who would have scored lower on the test. At times, where the data was missing, the author used anecdotal evidence to support his thesis, which wasn't really needed and reduced the credibility of the book. There was a bit of inconsistency with respect to how much the author wanted to share. In certain cases the author would give a gist of the experimental design and then elaborate on the results but at other times he would only give the results without giving any details about the experimental designs and methods, which was disappointing. A couple of times, I found serious confounding in the experiments which made the conclusions pretty dubious.Despite the limitations mentioned above, it still was a sensible book and did give a lot of insight into human behavior. It partly validated the above mentioned philosophy, if at all that philosophy needed validation."
78,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226133-bookworm,3,"Would you wait for the marshmallows? In an experiment that is now well-known, researchers tested the self-control of children that were presented with a treat (marshmallows, Oreos, etc.). The premise was simple. Could they wait 20 minutes or so and therefore get extra treats to eat later? Or did they lack the patience and eat them anyway? Researchers found that this translated to later development: the children who waited (for however long) were more likely to be described as more disciplined in school, have higher SAT scores, have a lower BMI as adults as as having distinctly different brain scans later in life. Working backwards, the researchers also found that this happened with younger children too. Babies and toddlers who could comfort themselves with toys or other distractions when separated from a parent would become marshmallow-waiters. That said, Mischel emphasizes that this is not fate and describes how people who might have initially tested as being more impatient may have found ways of coping, strategies to change, etc. These involve role-playing scenarios, positive thinking, thinking through one's actions to the end result, etc. In part two he gets into more science-y jargon which I found boring. Part 1 (which summarizes most of the findings and walks through the experiments) was very conversational, very interesting. But Part 2 lost me. In Part 3 Mischel then tries to translate the results to larger world settings. How can schools and the educational system help teach children such skills? He clearly shows how slightly older children (8-10 were the ages of the children when Mischel first meets/talks to them) than those in the Marshmallow Experiment (who are around pre-school age) can adapt and change, but it involves their own personal desires plus a little bit of outside help (in this case it's KIPP, or the Knowledge is Power Program). As a child's brain is more malleable than an adults, it's key to get to them early. It was a pleasant read, although as I mentioned it was somewhat uneven in readability. But definitely a good pick up for anyone who has any interest in any of the themes or concepts that this famous ""Marshmallow Experiment"" covers."

The marshmallow test had sixteen boy participants and sixteen girl participants, each participant was given one marshmallow and explained that if they waited fifteen minutes then they would either get one Oreo cookie, another marshmallow, or a pretzel stick, but if children were to unpatient to wait for fifteen minutes then they would not receive another treat. the researchers of the marshmallow test found out that children who were able to wait for fifteen minutes in order to receive another treat were most likely to get better SAT scores, would have better life outcomes, and a better education. The child's decision to either wait for fifteen minutes or to just give up due to their temptation to eat the delicious marshmallow, it all depended on their age, and background ethnicity.  What I liked about the book was that it explained self-control between children and adults and also because Walter put his observations towards the marshmallow test in a very entertaining hilarious descriptive way. this book was very good due to its long term analysis towards the study it's self, which I also gained more knowledge towards the overall meaning of the marshmallow test especially with the development strategies and the mechanisms of self-control. Another reason why I love the marshmallow book was because my psychology teacher first brought up the marshmallow experiment during my intro to psychology class, which made the class even more interesting. I didn't hate the book because I gained new knowledge from the experiment and because I was also very interested in the experiment ever since my intro to psychology class. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in psychology because it's a very fluffy, easy book to read. "
81,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18980203-charles-eliot,4,"""The Marshmallow Test"" takes its name from psychological studies, beginning in the 1960s and still continuing, which investigated self-control in very young children. The child subject was left alone in a room with a marshmallow, and told that if she didn't touch the marshmallow before the investigator returned, she could have two marshmallows. Kids showed different degrees of ability to resist temptation, and variations of the test probed the coping skills the kids employed. Over time a general framework emerged. We all have what the author, Walter Mischel, calls ""hot"" and ""cold"" responses. Hot responses are rapid, instinctive, urgent and emotional. Cold responses are analytical, objective, slow, and thoughtful. (This lines up almost exactly with Daniel Kahneman's insights in ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"") The key to exerting self-control is to cool down the response to the present, and heat up the response to the future. In other words, making the future gain more tempting than the present temptation. There are plenty of small and helpful tricks for this. One trick is to objectify the present temptation (""imagine the marshmallow with a frame around it and think of it as a picture of a marshmallow, not the real thing"") while drawing attention to the visceral pleasure of the future achievement (""it's going to be so cool to have two marshmallows to eat""). The most important trick of all is the ""if ... then"" trick, where you imagine what you will do if tempted. ""If ... then"" thinking has the effect of immediately derailing your hot response. The important message of The Marshmallow Test is that self-control is not entirely, or even predominantly, innate, but is a learned skill built on the brain's plasticity. The learning starts very early, and can continue throughout life. "
82,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,3,"Expanding upon a fascinating experiment conducted at the Bing Nursery School in Stanford University many decades ago, Walter Mischel expounds on the benefits derived by delaying instant gratification for future success. The famous experiment, now popular as ""The Marshmallow Test"" primarily aimed to put to test the will power of little children who were asked to choose between two alternatives. While under the first option, they could immediately take a candy/sweet/marshmallow (as per their preference) that was kept on a table, they were presented with a second choice under which they could lay claim to grab 2 candies/sweets/marshmallows if they could resist their desires by a mere 20 minutes.A researcher would leave the room with a child sitting alone in front of the table upon which the candies were kept. If the child, having wrestled out by temptation decided to pick the candy, all he/she had to do was ring a bill kept on the table, hearing which the researcher would return to the room and allow the child to take one sweet of his/choice. However if the child was successfully able to resist the allure of the sweet for all of 20 minutes, the researcher would enter the room after the designated time limit and gift the winner any 2 sweets of the victor's choice.This simple experiment shed enormously valuable insights into the workings of the human behaviour and led the way to identifying many improvements that usually go on to embellish the living of a person, a classic example being the ability to stop smoking after being addicted to nicotine for an imperceptibly long period.This books makes essential reading for anyone who is interested in gaining control over the more rustic senses thereby setting a focused path towards progression both in career as well as in life.""The Mashmallow Test"" - A fulfilling and rich after taste!"
83,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4325293-zebulon,5,"Cool and Hot thinking was shown to greatly impact the ability of the children to delay their gratification.  Cool thinking is associated with the pre-frontal area of the brain whereas hot thinking is associated with the amygdala. Amygdala is Latin for almond shaped.Use of the ""strange situation"" test where toddlers are briefly introduced to a stranger and then left with that person with other toys and distractions was a key indicator of whether the child could activate distraction strategies later in the marshmallow testing.Mischel's colleague Carole Dweck at UCLA has two models: incremental growth where a child does not believe that their capacity is limited and ""entity theorists"" that see their capacity as determined at birth.  Mischel asked questions in the 70s of the children to determine their mindsets.Carl Jung famously said that people study what they are not good at.Aversive counter conditioning is a strategy wherein an individual uses a disgusting sensory object to use the hot system to their advantage in dissuading them from pursuing a temptation.  The author used the example of a can of spent cigarette butts where smelling it was absolutely nauseating.ToM is an abbreviation for Theory of mind which is the important mental ability that begins in early childhood allowing us to understand that our beliefs may be false and that the way things appear may not be reality.  Theory of mind helps us to see that other people might no perceive the same scene or event the way that we do.The author also spoke volumes about development of executive function and if-then scenario development that could be used to harness the power of the hot/emotional/reactive system to avoid temptations."
84,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9979214-israel,4,"I always seem to read these type of ""self-help"" books at the beginning of each year. I don't know why? Maybe its because I want to take a fresh perspective on the new year. The Marshmallow Test was a very interesting read. The way the author personalized the scientific data made The Marshmallow Test an easy and compelling read. By testing pre-school children in their ability to resist one marshmallow for a specific amount of time for a reward of two marshmallows the author takes a deeper look at people's hot and cold systems and how they influence self control. The study found that the more stress in a child's early development can impact the development of the cold system that impedes a child's ability resist temptation and increases impulsive decisions. This increased impulsiveness can lead to a more difficult life and poor long term planning. The good news: you can, even as an adult, condition your cold system to cool off your hot system and make better, more informed decisions about your life. By incorporating coping strategies like using ""If, Then"" and thinking about your decisions in a way that brings to life how those decisions will impact your daily life can help you better understand the impact of any potential decisions and help you make better informed decisions.The Marshmallow Test is a good read because it not only explains the scientific studies in an easy to understand way but it also provides real world coping skills that can be used by adults and children alike. If you're going to start your year off with a self-help book make it one that will actually be able to help you and I think The Marshmallow Test is just the book you're looking for. Pick up The Marshmallow Test you won't be disappointed. "

Any book that talks about the importance of self-control and delayed gratification is going to be good but not popular in todays society of fast food and get rich quick schemes. Walter Mischel talks about his marshmallow test and the different research that has been done since the 1960's in the field of self-control. For those that don't know, the marshmallow test says, if you don't have one marshmallow now you can have two later. Other topics that are discussed are persistence, optimism, thinking about our future self to make wise decisions in the present moment, and helping cool down hot emotions that can lead to destructive impulsive behaviors. I liked the book a lot because it gives useful strategies to curbing undesired appetites and how to prepare for the future. Walter uses data to back up all his information which is always a plus. He is a highly recognized and praised professor in the field of psychology and after reading this book I can see why. I hardly write reviews but thought I should exercise some self-control and write one for ""The Marshmallow Test."" Buy this book and you won't regret it! "

Decades passed, a child (one) was born and the idea shelved for so many years came back up again when I read The Marshmallow Test.Fear not, this book is all about the delay of gratification and tenacity/grit in making more successful and determined humans; not at all as ethically challenged as my twenty y.o. diet bifurcated family!This book reminds me what I missed from Psych as an undergrad, and frankly updated many of the psychology paradigms (e.g. solve the root problem / medical model of care) that have been redirected to more behavioral solutions via research in the 20 years since my program. I like the book so much because it pushes against the fatalistic assumptions about genetic limitations to success and rightly advocates means for improving performance on the marshmallow test of life for everyone, provided certain cognitive-behavioral steps are integrated into an examined life.This book should be required reading for public school teachers...And yes, I will be trying out the Marshmallow test on our daughter next year!"

Fortunately, evolution moves very slowly and human nature has changed very little in the last hundred (or thousand for that matter) years, so this advice is compatible with previous research-based parenting books. The one my wife and I used decades ago offers similar advice with reference to different research: Children: The Challenge - now celebrating its golden anniversary, though still readily available in reprint.I can highly recommend Mischel's book for its sound advice and up-to-date review of the current research. The title not withstanding, this book offers a broad survey of current research.

I have related to it in all aspects of self-help, and a refresher to my psychology knowledge. The only drawback I did, was buying a scientific and a self help book as ebook. It didn't do it justice and it became a tedious read for me.I am happy with the way the author constructed his book, and labeled / went though what each chapter will contain. Albeit the title highlights on self-success, he was mostly focusing on children in the upbringing process and not the adult population or their set of problems, which I appreciate for those becoming parents, but it did not address the adult population entirely. Nonetheless, he had great techniques offered throughout the book that any will be able to take away and apply it in their life. (For example If-Then, keeping a mental dairy to understand your stressors..etc)There were some moments in the book that really hit me. When the the therapist asked his client, whom he felt the world was falling apart, and the therapist just asked ""would you like to?""I would definitely go over it and refresh my memory over the content offered in this book and try to apply it my own life. I was happy with this read."
89,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"The Marshmallow Test by Walter Mischel is an inquiry into the workings of self-control. In a now classic experiment, Dr. Mischel determined that many factors controlled by the Prefrontal Cortex can manifest themselves in children as young as four, perhaps even earlier. The Marshmallow Test itself can only be administered to children of a certain age, or else the child might not understand the instructions.The Test itself is ingenious and quite simple; offer the child a treat of some kind, it doesn’t have to be a marshmallow and tell the child that if they wait for around ten minutes they can have two marshmallows instead of one. Surprisingly, it was found that this determines a great many things later on in life. Self-control and willpower are instrumental in deciding SAT scores, whether or not the person will get in trouble, and whether the person will participate in risky behaviors or not.In the 1960s it wasn’t thought to be the case, but willpower can be strengthened like any muscle. The key is to think of willpower as something that is determined by effort and not by birth. Countless studies starting with this one have shown this to be the case. Thus, this book was fascinating."

91,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"Reading The Marshmallow Test is rewarding. The book is not perfect, but it is thought-provoking. First, about the experiment. The big hype about the Marshmallow Test centers around the correlation between childhood self-control and lifetime achievements. But when Mischel first designed the experiment, he focused on something else: how various conditions affect self-control. I find the devised experimental conditions intriguing. For example, Mischel found children's waiting time doubled when they are suggested to think about the marshmallow's ""cool"" aspect (its shape and puffiness) instead of its ""hot"" aspect (its taste). In another test condition, prompting children to recall a bitter experience makes them reach for candies almost immediately. But to my disappointment, Mischel did not talk about the sample size of the follow-up studies. He also skipped mentioning he did not control for the social-economic status of the kids in finding the correlation between waiting time and achievement. (A replication study found such correlation was reduced by 2/3 after controlling family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment.) He offered only limited arguments against critiques of his studies. As a result, questions kept emerging as I read his book. Apart from self-control, does longer waiting time reflects other qualities, such as stronger short-term memory, or higher ability to internalize social norms? If so, did those qualities instead of self-control make the willing-to-wait kids score higher in SAT? I understand I was reading a general audience book instead of a literature review. But still. I also wish Mischel could have combed through concepts more carefully. At one point in the book, he starts to talk about ""executive function"" as an interchangeable term of self-control. But is it? What are the differences and relationships between self control, impulse control, gratification delay, conscientiousness, and executive function? Which of them is the marshmallow test measuring? Intuitively, I understand what self-control means. But I still wish to take a look under its hood. Complaints apart, I find many discussions about self-control by Mischel intriguing. For example, he listed experiment evidence to argue that the ""cross-situational consistency of personality"" is an illusion. Instead, he claims that we each have a ""behavioral signature""—what we predictably do if particular situational triggers occur. The takeaway is that one should not label oneself as having great or little self-control. Instead, one should try to identify the exact hot spots that trigger impulsive reactions and make ""If-Then"" implementation plans ahead of time. By the same logic, Mischel argues that when we need to deal with behavior problems, it is often enough just to treat the ""symptom"" without digging deep into underlying causes such as early childhood traumas, of which the individual was unconscious. It is also interesting to know Mischel does not believe in ""ego depletion"". He claimed that students who were depleted in the experiments simply do not have enough motivation to comply with the experimenters' unrelenting demands for them to do boring tasks. He cited studies that show when students were primed to believe perseverance on tough tasks is energizing rather than depleting, they do not suffer from will fatigue. Mischel does not teach step-to-step tips like authors of self-help books. But I did learn useful principles and tricks. Other than ""identifying behavioral signatures"" which I mentioned above, I also learned it's helpful to resist temptation if one could change the mental presentation of the temptation. One could also create a psychological distance to a situation by imagining how someone else would behave. The fundamental principle Mischel summarized is simple but powerful: cool the ""now"", heat the ""later."" It is easy to note the first half of the principle, but I did not think of the second: to take the future into account, it helps to make it vivid. Bottom line: even though I am not fully convinced of many conclusions by the author, I think he poses interesting questions. Stray observations:• Mischel decided to follow up with the kids after he noticed a pattern in his daughters' suppertime discussion about them. His three daughters knew the experiment subjects personally because they were of similar ages and attended the same school as them. In fact, his daughters all participated in the experiment themselves. I wonder how long they have waited for the marshmallow…• Even though he has written a textbook about personality, Mischel claims that as he takes the limitation of commonly used personality tests seriously, he has resolved never to create one himself.

92,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"This is probably the most cited test from the books that I have read during the past 3 years as almost every book about willpower, self-control cognitive psychology mentions it. There wasn't completely new factual information for me but some interesting angles and terms used for improving self-control (distractions, concentrating on the future).“the ability to delay immediate gratification for the sake of future consequences is an acquirable cognitive skill.” Our self-control depends on two systems that are functioning in our body: one that instantly reacts to our environment (HOT), and one that controls our behavior (COOL).We choose the situations in which we exercise our self-control (not consistent across the board). Our self-control skills start developing when we’re very young, and they continue to be determined by our environment as we get older. This continuous development process means our ability to control ourselves is fluid. Anyone can improve his or her skills by focusing on the future and strategically using distractions.*The part of our brain that regulates self-control develops as we grow.*Our environment shapes our self-control abilities. *How much self-control we have depends on the context, but it is ultimately unlimited.*The result of a child's performance in the Marshmallow Test correlates with their self-control as an adult.*Children should be taught that they're capable of making their own decisions and that those decisions have consequences. *You can improve your self-control skills by concentrating on the future and putting distance between you and your temptation.

I picked up this book because I was attracted to the title “the marshmallow test” At first I didn’t expect that content would be about human behaviour, but then seeing that it was about the understanding of self control so I found it’s even more interesting. Self-control is one of everyone’s weakness, I believe. So how can we control ourselves? This book gave us a very clear picture of it in easy way, I mean not academically. The experiment on children about delaying of gratification blown my mind. For those who are keen to know about how we think and act and really want to be a better human!

There were interesting pieces of information, and cool case studies, but in my opinion it was far too long. Main points from the book:1. Some people are better than others to resist temptation and regulate painful emotions 2. These differences become visible as early as preschool age, and can predict outcomes over course of life 3. The traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you have or don’t have a lot of is false.. self control can be learned, improved, enhanced.. 4. We don’t have to be the victims of our social and biological histories 5. Self control involves strategies and insight, goals and motivation The most helpful advice I came away with is that we have more control over our environment and even genetics than we think we do. The “I think I can” idea is very powerful, and plays a huge part in our lives."

Some good observations are made, and the book may be useful source material. The audio book was read by Alan Alda.This got a pretty favorable review when released; I added it to my to-read list immediately. Walter Mischel devised the original study, and his anecdotes are a good addition. He also reports on related studies and derivatives. Asked frequently about this study, he emphasizes that correlation is not causation.He also leans into self-help, suggesting action for parents, teachers, and selves. While there are some good observations here, they can be lost in a sea of discussions of nature and nurture. At times the psychological study descriptions can also be quite dry. 2½ stars."

I'm sure I'll be returning to these pages as they contain a plethora of insights related to the very concise topic of self-control, many of which are essential to understanding the actions of ourselves and others.

104,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20880982-thethousanderclub,3,"I first heard about the marshmallow test in 2010 while listening Dieter F. Uchtdorf's conference address titled Continue in Patience. I thought the concept was fascinating at the time, and over the years I have stumbled across various accounts of the tests and their impact on the academic community, as well as public policy debates. The Marshmallow Test, written by Walter Mischel, is a deeper dive into the origins of the famous study and the subsequent academic work which has been done to confirm and challenge its findings.The reader will immediately notice how the marshmallow test and its findings are far more nuanced than how its often reported in the media. It's not that the findings are incorrect or distorted, it's that the story is so much richer and more complex than a headline. I found this to be the most intriguing and valuable aspect of The Marshmallow Test. I love taking a deeper dive into assumptions. When it comes to human nature and human behavior generally, there are a lot of assumptions and even intellectual biases. Mischel takes a special interest in the nature versus nurture debate, and he points toward a bevy of academic research to support his findings. As I am wont to do, I accept the premises and conclusions of most academic research with limited skepticism because there is always another view, another study, and another reasonable opinion to suggest a contrarian viewpoint.Although all of the material is interesting, the writing isn't noticeably poignant. Mischel appears to be much more of a researcher than an author. In addition, The Marshmallow Test probably could have been a bit shorter. The main point of the book was made repeatedly and in different contexts. A few stories and a few research studies probably could have been omitted and the results would have been the same. Having said that, Mischel does spare the reader the graphs and charts which usually accompany a book like this. I enjoy looking at those and trying to understand the data at a more granular level, but it wasn't necessary for this book, which is mostly written for the layman. In conclusion, the marshmallow test is a very, very interesting academic study which deserves some attention, especially in the context of public policy, such as education. The debate over nature versus nurture is a fundamental one, and the results from Mischel's work and others contributes in a significant way to the debate. The Marshmallow Test was a nice look behind the curtain of a particular set of academic studies, and you have interest in something like that then this book is worth perusing. Otherwise, it may be a bit of slog.http://thethousanderclub.blogspot.com/"
105,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40311431-samantha-welker,5,"This book was a horrible choice to read at night before going to bed. It was so thought-provoking and full of interesting scientific facts that it got my wheels turning before I was trying to fall asleep. My only complaint about this book was that it did focus a bit too much on children and how to shape and mold their ""hot"" and ""cold"" impulses that manage their levels of self control. If I were a parent, I would find it fascinating, but it did harp on that a bit long for a single gal like me.Some of my favorite tid bits (without giving too much away) from this book were:Contextualized Self-Control: Why do we have self control over somethings, but not others? President Clinton had the self-control and delay ability to win a Rhodes scholarship, attain a Yale law degree and be elected president, but had no ability or willingness to exert self control for junk food and White House interns.The Tired Will: Are there limits to how much self-control and delay of gratification we can exert before will fatigue takes over? This is extremely important to think about in terms of how to self-regulateBorn with it or Worked for it: A recent topic of discussion with my boss, The Marshmallow Test argues that the traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you either have a lot or you don't (or can't do much about it either way) is false. Self control skills, both cognitive and emotional, can be learned, enhanced, and harnessed so that they become automatically activated when you need them. It's the failure to develop these self-control skills, and the lack of goals, values and social support needed to use it constructively that shapes a human being. To summarize, what I got most out of this book was the answer to the question of whether human nature is, at its core, malleable or fixed. Some people see self-control ability, willpower, intelligence and other characteristics as ""fixed"", unchangeable traits from the very start of life. They read the experimental evidence that executive function and self-control improve after educational interventions and interpret that as short-term effects unlikely to make a long-term difference, just little tricks that don't change inborn traits. If we allow the evidence to make a difference in our personal view points of individuals, we are able to understand and learn more about those around us and their actions and the motivation behind them.

Only after reading this book, I learnt that the author has dedicated all his research life to explaining the basis of this test. That is exactly what this book explains. It is a fascinating journey and makes a lot of sense.I had an expectation that this book would elaborate on what made a child do better in these tests. The author did spend some time talking about nature and nurture's role but there seemed to be lack of data with regard to this. This is understandable as collection of this data could only be observational studies and not experiments and observational studies come with a lot of confounding variables. So, the author focused more experiments that justified some training techniques to deal with problem behaviors or to help people who would have scored lower on the test. At times, where the data was missing, the author used anecdotal evidence to support his thesis, which wasn't really needed and reduced the credibility of the book. There was a bit of inconsistency with respect to how much the author wanted to share. In certain cases the author would give a gist of the experimental design and then elaborate on the results but at other times he would only give the results without giving any details about the experimental designs and methods, which was disappointing. A couple of times, I found serious confounding in the experiments which made the conclusions pretty dubious.Despite the limitations mentioned above, it still was a sensible book and did give a lot of insight into human behavior. It partly validated the above mentioned philosophy, if at all that philosophy needed validation."
108,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226133-bookworm,3,"Would you wait for the marshmallows? In an experiment that is now well-known, researchers tested the self-control of children that were presented with a treat (marshmallows, Oreos, etc.). The premise was simple. Could they wait 20 minutes or so and therefore get extra treats to eat later? Or did they lack the patience and eat them anyway? Researchers found that this translated to later development: the children who waited (for however long) were more likely to be described as more disciplined in school, have higher SAT scores, have a lower BMI as adults as as having distinctly different brain scans later in life. Working backwards, the researchers also found that this happened with younger children too. Babies and toddlers who could comfort themselves with toys or other distractions when separated from a parent would become marshmallow-waiters. That said, Mischel emphasizes that this is not fate and describes how people who might have initially tested as being more impatient may have found ways of coping, strategies to change, etc. These involve role-playing scenarios, positive thinking, thinking through one's actions to the end result, etc. In part two he gets into more science-y jargon which I found boring. Part 1 (which summarizes most of the findings and walks through the experiments) was very conversational, very interesting. But Part 2 lost me. In Part 3 Mischel then tries to translate the results to larger world settings. How can schools and the educational system help teach children such skills? He clearly shows how slightly older children (8-10 were the ages of the children when Mischel first meets/talks to them) than those in the Marshmallow Experiment (who are around pre-school age) can adapt and change, but it involves their own personal desires plus a little bit of outside help (in this case it's KIPP, or the Knowledge is Power Program). As a child's brain is more malleable than an adults, it's key to get to them early. It was a pleasant read, although as I mentioned it was somewhat uneven in readability. But definitely a good pick up for anyone who has any interest in any of the themes or concepts that this famous ""Marshmallow Experiment"" covers."
109,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77993397-nicole,3,"The Marshmallow Test is a well-documented study on self-control. The study mostly focuses on children and their willpower when faced with an immediate reward or a better reward in long-term; they are allowed to eat one treat now, or they can eat two treats later if they wait. The study itself is well-examined.My downfall to this book: I found some areas to be a bit repetitive and I did not get one of my initial expectations, ""understanding self-control and how to master it."" I was hoping this book would help me learn better self-control techniques, but it was mostly science-driven.If you are looking for practical guidance to help achieve control techniques, this one might not be for you; however, if you have a scientific interest, then it's a worthwhile read.  My rating: 3 out of 5 marshmallows"
110,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46619134-maria-gonzalez,4," ""The marshmallow test,"" by Walter Mischel, Walter was observing whether the kids were mastering self-control. The marshmallow test was taken place at the Bing Nursery school of Stanford University with children between six months through five years of age. The marshmallow test had sixteen boy participants and sixteen girl participants, each participant was given one marshmallow and explained that if they waited fifteen minutes then they would either get one Oreo cookie, another marshmallow, or a pretzel stick, but if children were to unpatient to wait for fifteen minutes then they would not receive another treat. the researchers of the marshmallow test found out that children who were able to wait for fifteen minutes in order to receive another treat were most likely to get better SAT scores, would have better life outcomes, and a better education. The child's decision to either wait for fifteen minutes or to just give up due to their temptation to eat the delicious marshmallow, it all depended on their age, and background ethnicity.  What I liked about the book was that it explained self-control between children and adults and also because Walter put his observations towards the marshmallow test in a very entertaining hilarious descriptive way. this book was very good due to its long term analysis towards the study it's self, which I also gained more knowledge towards the overall meaning of the marshmallow test especially with the development strategies and the mechanisms of self-control. Another reason why I love the marshmallow book was because my psychology teacher first brought up the marshmallow experiment during my intro to psychology class, which made the class even more interesting. I didn't hate the book because I gained new knowledge from the experiment and because I was also very interested in the experiment ever since my intro to psychology class. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in psychology because it's a very fluffy, easy book to read. "
111,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18980203-charles-eliot,4,"""The Marshmallow Test"" takes its name from psychological studies, beginning in the 1960s and still continuing, which investigated self-control in very young children. The child subject was left alone in a room with a marshmallow, and told that if she didn't touch the marshmallow before the investigator returned, she could have two marshmallows. Kids showed different degrees of ability to resist temptation, and variations of the test probed the coping skills the kids employed. Over time a general framework emerged. We all have what the author, Walter Mischel, calls ""hot"" and ""cold"" responses. Hot responses are rapid, instinctive, urgent and emotional. Cold responses are analytical, objective, slow, and thoughtful. (This lines up almost exactly with Daniel Kahneman's insights in ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"") The key to exerting self-control is to cool down the response to the present, and heat up the response to the future. In other words, making the future gain more tempting than the present temptation. There are plenty of small and helpful tricks for this. One trick is to objectify the present temptation (""imagine the marshmallow with a frame around it and think of it as a picture of a marshmallow, not the real thing"") while drawing attention to the visceral pleasure of the future achievement (""it's going to be so cool to have two marshmallows to eat""). The most important trick of all is the ""if ... then"" trick, where you imagine what you will do if tempted. ""If ... then"" thinking has the effect of immediately derailing your hot response. The important message of The Marshmallow Test is that self-control is not entirely, or even predominantly, innate, but is a learned skill built on the brain's plasticity. The learning starts very early, and can continue throughout life. "
112,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,3,"Expanding upon a fascinating experiment conducted at the Bing Nursery School in Stanford University many decades ago, Walter Mischel expounds on the benefits derived by delaying instant gratification for future success. The famous experiment, now popular as ""The Marshmallow Test"" primarily aimed to put to test the will power of little children who were asked to choose between two alternatives. While under the first option, they could immediately take a candy/sweet/marshmallow (as per their preference) that was kept on a table, they were presented with a second choice under which they could lay claim to grab 2 candies/sweets/marshmallows if they could resist their desires by a mere 20 minutes.A researcher would leave the room with a child sitting alone in front of the table upon which the candies were kept. If the child, having wrestled out by temptation decided to pick the candy, all he/she had to do was ring a bill kept on the table, hearing which the researcher would return to the room and allow the child to take one sweet of his/choice. However if the child was successfully able to resist the allure of the sweet for all of 20 minutes, the researcher would enter the room after the designated time limit and gift the winner any 2 sweets of the victor's choice.This simple experiment shed enormously valuable insights into the workings of the human behaviour and led the way to identifying many improvements that usually go on to embellish the living of a person, a classic example being the ability to stop smoking after being addicted to nicotine for an imperceptibly long period.This books makes essential reading for anyone who is interested in gaining control over the more rustic senses thereby setting a focused path towards progression both in career as well as in life.""The Mashmallow Test"" - A fulfilling and rich after taste!"
113,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4325293-zebulon,5,"Cool and Hot thinking was shown to greatly impact the ability of the children to delay their gratification.  Cool thinking is associated with the pre-frontal area of the brain whereas hot thinking is associated with the amygdala. Amygdala is Latin for almond shaped.Use of the ""strange situation"" test where toddlers are briefly introduced to a stranger and then left with that person with other toys and distractions was a key indicator of whether the child could activate distraction strategies later in the marshmallow testing.Mischel's colleague Carole Dweck at UCLA has two models: incremental growth where a child does not believe that their capacity is limited and ""entity theorists"" that see their capacity as determined at birth.  Mischel asked questions in the 70s of the children to determine their mindsets.Carl Jung famously said that people study what they are not good at.Aversive counter conditioning is a strategy wherein an individual uses a disgusting sensory object to use the hot system to their advantage in dissuading them from pursuing a temptation.  The author used the example of a can of spent cigarette butts where smelling it was absolutely nauseating.ToM is an abbreviation for Theory of mind which is the important mental ability that begins in early childhood allowing us to understand that our beliefs may be false and that the way things appear may not be reality.  Theory of mind helps us to see that other people might no perceive the same scene or event the way that we do.The author also spoke volumes about development of executive function and if-then scenario development that could be used to harness the power of the hot/emotional/reactive system to avoid temptations."
114,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9979214-israel,4,"I always seem to read these type of ""self-help"" books at the beginning of each year. I don't know why? Maybe its because I want to take a fresh perspective on the new year. The Marshmallow Test was a very interesting read. The way the author personalized the scientific data made The Marshmallow Test an easy and compelling read. By testing pre-school children in their ability to resist one marshmallow for a specific amount of time for a reward of two marshmallows the author takes a deeper look at people's hot and cold systems and how they influence self control. The study found that the more stress in a child's early development can impact the development of the cold system that impedes a child's ability resist temptation and increases impulsive decisions. This increased impulsiveness can lead to a more difficult life and poor long term planning. The good news: you can, even as an adult, condition your cold system to cool off your hot system and make better, more informed decisions about your life. By incorporating coping strategies like using ""If, Then"" and thinking about your decisions in a way that brings to life how those decisions will impact your daily life can help you better understand the impact of any potential decisions and help you make better informed decisions.The Marshmallow Test is a good read because it not only explains the scientific studies in an easy to understand way but it also provides real world coping skills that can be used by adults and children alike. If you're going to start your year off with a self-help book make it one that will actually be able to help you and I think The Marshmallow Test is just the book you're looking for. Pick up The Marshmallow Test you won't be disappointed. "

Any book that talks about the importance of self-control and delayed gratification is going to be good but not popular in todays society of fast food and get rich quick schemes. Walter Mischel talks about his marshmallow test and the different research that has been done since the 1960's in the field of self-control. For those that don't know, the marshmallow test says, if you don't have one marshmallow now you can have two later. Other topics that are discussed are persistence, optimism, thinking about our future self to make wise decisions in the present moment, and helping cool down hot emotions that can lead to destructive impulsive behaviors. I liked the book a lot because it gives useful strategies to curbing undesired appetites and how to prepare for the future. Walter uses data to back up all his information which is always a plus. He is a highly recognized and praised professor in the field of psychology and after reading this book I can see why. I hardly write reviews but thought I should exercise some self-control and write one for ""The Marshmallow Test."" Buy this book and you won't regret it! "

Fortunately, evolution moves very slowly and human nature has changed very little in the last hundred (or thousand for that matter) years, so this advice is compatible with previous research-based parenting books. The one my wife and I used decades ago offers similar advice with reference to different research: Children: The Challenge - now celebrating its golden anniversary, though still readily available in reprint.I can highly recommend Mischel's book for its sound advice and up-to-date review of the current research.

I have related to it in all aspects of self-help, and a refresher to my psychology knowledge. The only drawback I did, was buying a scientific and a self help book as ebook. It didn't do it justice and it became a tedious read for me.I am happy with the way the author constructed his book, and labeled / went though what each chapter will contain. Albeit the title highlights on self-success, he was mostly focusing on children in the upbringing process and not the adult population or their set of problems, which I appreciate for those becoming parents, but it did not address the adult population entirely. Nonetheless, he had great techniques offered throughout the book that any will be able to take away and apply it in their life. (For example If-Then, keeping a mental dairy to understand your stressors..etc)There were some moments in the book that really hit me. When the the therapist asked his client, whom he felt the world was falling apart, and the therapist just asked ""would you like to?""I would definitely go over it and refresh my memory over the content offered in this book and try to apply it my own life.

119,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"The Marshmallow Test by Walter Mischel is an inquiry into the workings of self-control. In a now classic experiment, Dr. Mischel determined that many factors controlled by the Prefrontal Cortex can manifest themselves in children as young as four, perhaps even earlier. The Marshmallow Test itself can only be administered to children of a certain age, or else the child might not understand the instructions.The Test itself is ingenious and quite simple; offer the child a treat of some kind, it doesn’t have to be a marshmallow and tell the child that if they wait for around ten minutes they can have two marshmallows instead of one. Surprisingly, it was found that this determines a great many things later on in life. Self-control and willpower are instrumental in deciding SAT scores, whether or not the person will get in trouble, and whether the person will participate in risky behaviors or not.In the 1960s it wasn’t thought to be the case, but willpower can be strengthened like any muscle. The key is to think of willpower as something that is determined by effort and not by birth. Countless studies starting with this one have shown this to be the case. Thus, this book was fascinating."

121,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"Reading The Marshmallow Test is rewarding. The book is not perfect, but it is thought-provoking. First, about the experiment. The big hype about the Marshmallow Test centers around the correlation between childhood self-control and lifetime achievements. But when Mischel first designed the experiment, he focused on something else: how various conditions affect self-control. I find the devised experimental conditions intriguing. For example, Mischel found children's waiting time doubled when they are suggested to think about the marshmallow's ""cool"" aspect (its shape and puffiness) instead of its ""hot"" aspect (its taste). In another test condition, prompting children to recall a bitter experience makes them reach for candies almost immediately. But to my disappointment, Mischel did not talk about the sample size of the follow-up studies. He also skipped mentioning he did not control for the social-economic status of the kids in finding the correlation between waiting time and achievement. (A replication study found such correlation was reduced by 2/3 after controlling family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment.) He offered only limited arguments against critiques of his studies. As a result, questions kept emerging as I read his book. Apart from self-control, does longer waiting time reflects other qualities, such as stronger short-term memory, or higher ability to internalize social norms? If so, did those qualities instead of self-control make the willing-to-wait kids score higher in SAT? I understand I was reading a general audience book instead of a literature review. But still. I also wish Mischel could have combed through concepts more carefully. At one point in the book, he starts to talk about ""executive function"" as an interchangeable term of self-control. But is it? What are the differences and relationships between self control, impulse control, gratification delay, conscientiousness, and executive function? Which of them is the marshmallow test measuring? Intuitively, I understand what self-control means. But I still wish to take a look under its hood. Complaints apart, I find many discussions about self-control by Mischel intriguing. For example, he listed experiment evidence to argue that the ""cross-situational consistency of personality"" is an illusion. Instead, he claims that we each have a ""behavioral signature""—what we predictably do if particular situational triggers occur. The takeaway is that one should not label oneself as having great or little self-control. Instead, one should try to identify the exact hot spots that trigger impulsive reactions and make ""If-Then"" implementation plans ahead of time. By the same logic, Mischel argues that when we need to deal with behavior problems, it is often enough just to treat the ""symptom"" without digging deep into underlying causes such as early childhood traumas, of which the individual was unconscious. It is also interesting to know Mischel does not believe in ""ego depletion"". He claimed that students who were depleted in the experiments simply do not have enough motivation to comply with the experimenters' unrelenting demands for them to do boring tasks. He cited studies that show when students were primed to believe perseverance on tough tasks is energizing rather than depleting, they do not suffer from will fatigue. Mischel does not teach step-to-step tips like authors of self-help books. But I did learn useful principles and tricks. Other than ""identifying behavioral signatures"" which I mentioned above, I also learned it's helpful to resist temptation if one could change the mental presentation of the temptation. One could also create a psychological distance to a situation by imagining how someone else would behave. The fundamental principle Mischel summarized is simple but powerful: cool the ""now"", heat the ""later."" It is easy to note the first half of the principle, but I did not think of the second: to take the future into account, it helps to make it vivid. Bottom line: even though I am not fully convinced of many conclusions by the author, I think he poses interesting questions. Stray observations:• Mischel decided to follow up with the kids after he noticed a pattern in his daughters' suppertime discussion about them. His three daughters knew the experiment subjects personally because they were of similar ages and attended the same school as them. In fact, his daughters all participated in the experiment themselves. I wonder how long they have waited for the marshmallow…• Even though he has written a textbook about personality, Mischel claims that as he takes the limitation of commonly used personality tests seriously, he has resolved never to create one himself.

122,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"This is probably the most cited test from the books that I have read during the past 3 years as almost every book about willpower, self-control cognitive psychology mentions it. There wasn't completely new factual information for me but some interesting angles and terms used for improving self-control (distractions, concentrating on the future).“the ability to delay immediate gratification for the sake of future consequences is an acquirable cognitive skill.” Our self-control depends on two systems that are functioning in our body: one that instantly reacts to our environment (HOT), and one that controls our behavior (COOL).We choose the situations in which we exercise our self-control (not consistent across the board). Our self-control skills start developing when we’re very young, and they continue to be determined by our environment as we get older. This continuous development process means our ability to control ourselves is fluid. Anyone can improve his or her skills by focusing on the future and strategically using distractions.*The part of our brain that regulates self-control develops as we grow.*Our environment shapes our self-control abilities. *How much self-control we have depends on the context, but it is ultimately unlimited.*The result of a child's performance in the Marshmallow Test correlates with their self-control as an adult.*Children should be taught that they're capable of making their own decisions and that those decisions have consequences. *You can improve your self-control skills by concentrating on the future and putting distance between you and your temptation.

I picked up this book because I was attracted to the title “the marshmallow test” At first I didn’t expect that content would be about human behaviour, but then seeing that it was about the understanding of self control so I found it’s even more interesting. Self-control is one of everyone’s weakness, I believe. So how can we control ourselves? This book gave us a very clear picture of it in easy way, I mean not academically. The experiment on children about delaying of gratification blown my mind. For those who are keen to know about how we think and act and really want to be a better human!

There were interesting pieces of information, and cool case studies, but in my opinion it was far too long. Main points from the book:1. Some people are better than others to resist temptation and regulate painful emotions 2. These differences become visible as early as preschool age, and can predict outcomes over course of life 3. The traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you have or don’t have a lot of is false.. self control can be learned, improved, enhanced.. 4. We don’t have to be the victims of our social and biological histories 5. Self control involves strategies and insight, goals and motivation The most helpful advice I came away with is that we have more control over our environment and even genetics than we think we do. The “I think I can” idea is very powerful, and plays a huge part in our lives."

The audio book was read by Alan Alda.This got a pretty favorable review when released; I added it to my to-read list immediately. Walter Mischel devised the original study, and his anecdotes are a good addition. He also reports on related studies and derivatives. Asked frequently about this study, he emphasizes that correlation is not causation.He also leans into self-help, suggesting action for parents, teachers, and selves. While there are some good observations here, they can be lost in a sea of discussions of nature and nurture. At times the psychological study descriptions can also be quite dry. 2½ stars."

I'm sure I'll be returning to these pages as they contain a plethora of insights related to the very concise topic of self-control, many of which are essential to understanding the actions of ourselves and others.

Uchtdorf's conference address titled Continue in Patience. I thought the concept was fascinating at the time, and over the years I have stumbled across various accounts of the tests and their impact on the academic community, as well as public policy debates. The Marshmallow Test, written by Walter Mischel, is a deeper dive into the origins of the famous study and the subsequent academic work which has been done to confirm and challenge its findings.The reader will immediately notice how the marshmallow test and its findings are far more nuanced than how its often reported in the media. It's not that the findings are incorrect or distorted, it's that the story is so much richer and more complex than a headline. I found this to be the most intriguing and valuable aspect of The Marshmallow Test. I love taking a deeper dive into assumptions. When it comes to human nature and human behavior generally, there are a lot of assumptions and even intellectual biases. Mischel takes a special interest in the nature versus nurture debate, and he points toward a bevy of academic research to support his findings. As I am wont to do, I accept the premises and conclusions of most academic research with limited skepticism because there is always another view, another study, and another reasonable opinion to suggest a contrarian viewpoint.Although all of the material is interesting, the writing isn't noticeably poignant. Mischel appears to be much more of a researcher than an author. In addition, The Marshmallow Test probably could have been a bit shorter. The main point of the book was made repeatedly and in different contexts. A few stories and a few research studies probably could have been omitted and the results would have been the same. Having said that, Mischel does spare the reader the graphs and charts which usually accompany a book like this. I enjoy looking at those and trying to understand the data at a more granular level, but it wasn't necessary for this book, which is mostly written for the layman. In conclusion, the marshmallow test is a very, very interesting academic study which deserves some attention, especially in the context of public policy, such as education. The debate over nature versus nurture is a fundamental one, and the results from Mischel's work and others contributes in a significant way to the debate. The Marshmallow Test was a nice look behind the curtain of a particular set of academic studies, and you have interest in something like that then this book is worth perusing. Otherwise, it may be a bit of slog.http://thethousanderclub.blogspot.com/"
135,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40311431-samantha-welker,5,"This book was a horrible choice to read at night before going to bed. It was so thought-provoking and full of interesting scientific facts that it got my wheels turning before I was trying to fall asleep. My only complaint about this book was that it did focus a bit too much on children and how to shape and mold their ""hot"" and ""cold"" impulses that manage their levels of self control. If I were a parent, I would find it fascinating, but it did harp on that a bit long for a single gal like me.Some of my favorite tid bits (without giving too much away) from this book were:Contextualized Self-Control: Why do we have self control over somethings, but not others? President Clinton had the self-control and delay ability to win a Rhodes scholarship, attain a Yale law degree and be elected president, but had no ability or willingness to exert self control for junk food and White House interns.The Tired Will: Are there limits to how much self-control and delay of gratification we can exert before will fatigue takes over? This is extremely important to think about in terms of how to self-regulateBorn with it or Worked for it: A recent topic of discussion with my boss, The Marshmallow Test argues that the traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you either have a lot or you don't (or can't do much about it either way) is false. Self control skills, both cognitive and emotional, can be learned, enhanced, and harnessed so that they become automatically activated when you need them. It's the failure to develop these self-control skills, and the lack of goals, values and social support needed to use it constructively that shapes a human being. To summarize, what I got most out of this book was the answer to the question of whether human nature is, at its core, malleable or fixed. Some people see self-control ability, willpower, intelligence and other characteristics as ""fixed"", unchangeable traits from the very start of life. They read the experimental evidence that executive function and self-control improve after educational interventions and interpret that as short-term effects unlikely to make a long-term difference, just little tricks that don't change inborn traits. If we allow the evidence to make a difference in our personal view points of individuals, we are able to understand and learn more about those around us and their actions and the motivation behind them.

The control in question is not just our ability to delay gratification or to quite an addiction, it is the ability of control over our lives. It explores the well-known debate nature vs nurture and what factors determines an individual’s characters. It is splendid and goes beyond self-control to also examine human nature. Very informative and well articulated with great examples."

The first sentence here means that the object of life is to have control over your basic instincts rather than our basic instincts controlling our behavior/life. Th book, "" The Marshmallow test"" is about the relationship between our ability to control our basic instinctive actions (controlled by hot system of the brain, mostly reactionary) and our long term success. I had first learnt about the Marshmallow test in 1990's and had found it pretty impressive. It always remained somewhere in the back of my mind. Only after reading this book, I learnt that the author has dedicated all his research life to explaining the basis of this test. That is exactly what this book explains. It is a fascinating journey and makes a lot of sense.I had an expectation that this book would elaborate on what made a child do better in these tests. The author did spend some time talking about nature and nurture's role but there seemed to be lack of data with regard to this. This is understandable as collection of this data could only be observational studies and not experiments and observational studies come with a lot of confounding variables. So, the author focused more experiments that justified some training techniques to deal with problem behaviors or to help people who would have scored lower on the test. At times, where the data was missing, the author used anecdotal evidence to support his thesis, which wasn't really needed and reduced the credibility of the book. There was a bit of inconsistency with respect to how much the author wanted to share. In certain cases the author would give a gist of the experimental design and then elaborate on the results but at other times he would only give the results without giving any details about the experimental designs and methods, which was disappointing. A couple of times, I found serious confounding in the experiments which made the conclusions pretty dubious.Despite the limitations mentioned above, it still was a sensible book and did give a lot of insight into human behavior. It partly validated the above mentioned philosophy, if at all that philosophy needed validation."
138,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226133-bookworm,3,"Would you wait for the marshmallows? In an experiment that is now well-known, researchers tested the self-control of children that were presented with a treat (marshmallows, Oreos, etc.). The premise was simple. Could they wait 20 minutes or so and therefore get extra treats to eat later? Or did they lack the patience and eat them anyway? Researchers found that this translated to later development: the children who waited (for however long) were more likely to be described as more disciplined in school, have higher SAT scores, have a lower BMI as adults as as having distinctly different brain scans later in life. Working backwards, the researchers also found that this happened with younger children too. Babies and toddlers who could comfort themselves with toys or other distractions when separated from a parent would become marshmallow-waiters. That said, Mischel emphasizes that this is not fate and describes how people who might have initially tested as being more impatient may have found ways of coping, strategies to change, etc. These involve role-playing scenarios, positive thinking, thinking through one's actions to the end result, etc. In part two he gets into more science-y jargon which I found boring. Part 1 (which summarizes most of the findings and walks through the experiments) was very conversational, very interesting. But Part 2 lost me. In Part 3 Mischel then tries to translate the results to larger world settings. How can schools and the educational system help teach children such skills? He clearly shows how slightly older children (8-10 were the ages of the children when Mischel first meets/talks to them) than those in the Marshmallow Experiment (who are around pre-school age) can adapt and change, but it involves their own personal desires plus a little bit of outside help (in this case it's KIPP, or the Knowledge is Power Program). As a child's brain is more malleable than an adults, it's key to get to them early. It was a pleasant read, although as I mentioned it was somewhat uneven in readability. But definitely a good pick up for anyone who has any interest in any of the themes or concepts that this famous ""Marshmallow Experiment"" covers."
139,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77993397-nicole,3,"The Marshmallow Test is a well-documented study on self-control. The study mostly focuses on children and their willpower when faced with an immediate reward or a better reward in long-term; they are allowed to eat one treat now, or they can eat two treats later if they wait. The study itself is well-examined.My downfall to this book: I found some areas to be a bit repetitive and I did not get one of my initial expectations, ""understanding self-control and how to master it."" I was hoping this book would help me learn better self-control techniques, but it was mostly science-driven.If you are looking for practical guidance to help achieve control techniques, this one might not be for you; however, if you have a scientific interest, then it's a worthwhile read.  My rating: 3 out of 5 marshmallows"
140,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46619134-maria-gonzalez,4," ""The marshmallow test,"" by Walter Mischel, Walter was observing whether the kids were mastering self-control. The marshmallow test was taken place at the Bing Nursery school of Stanford University with children between six months through five years of age. The marshmallow test had sixteen boy participants and sixteen girl participants, each participant was given one marshmallow and explained that if they waited fifteen minutes then they would either get one Oreo cookie, another marshmallow, or a pretzel stick, but if children were to unpatient to wait for fifteen minutes then they would not receive another treat. the researchers of the marshmallow test found out that children who were able to wait for fifteen minutes in order to receive another treat were most likely to get better SAT scores, would have better life outcomes, and a better education. The child's decision to either wait for fifteen minutes or to just give up due to their temptation to eat the delicious marshmallow, it all depended on their age, and background ethnicity.  What I liked about the book was that it explained self-control between children and adults and also because Walter put his observations towards the marshmallow test in a very entertaining hilarious descriptive way. this book was very good due to its long term analysis towards the study it's self, which I also gained more knowledge towards the overall meaning of the marshmallow test especially with the development strategies and the mechanisms of self-control. Another reason why I love the marshmallow book was because my psychology teacher first brought up the marshmallow experiment during my intro to psychology class, which made the class even more interesting. I didn't hate the book because I gained new knowledge from the experiment and because I was also very interested in the experiment ever since my intro to psychology class. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in psychology because it's a very fluffy, easy book to read. "
141,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18980203-charles-eliot,4,"""The Marshmallow Test"" takes its name from psychological studies, beginning in the 1960s and still continuing, which investigated self-control in very young children. The child subject was left alone in a room with a marshmallow, and told that if she didn't touch the marshmallow before the investigator returned, she could have two marshmallows. Kids showed different degrees of ability to resist temptation, and variations of the test probed the coping skills the kids employed. Over time a general framework emerged. We all have what the author, Walter Mischel, calls ""hot"" and ""cold"" responses. Hot responses are rapid, instinctive, urgent and emotional. Cold responses are analytical, objective, slow, and thoughtful. (This lines up almost exactly with Daniel Kahneman's insights in ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"") The key to exerting self-control is to cool down the response to the present, and heat up the response to the future. In other words, making the future gain more tempting than the present temptation. There are plenty of small and helpful tricks for this. One trick is to objectify the present temptation (""imagine the marshmallow with a frame around it and think of it as a picture of a marshmallow, not the real thing"") while drawing attention to the visceral pleasure of the future achievement (""it's going to be so cool to have two marshmallows to eat""). The most important trick of all is the ""if ... then"" trick, where you imagine what you will do if tempted. ""If ... then"" thinking has the effect of immediately derailing your hot response. The important message of The Marshmallow Test is that self-control is not entirely, or even predominantly, innate, but is a learned skill built on the brain's plasticity. The learning starts very early, and can continue throughout life. "
142,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,3,"Expanding upon a fascinating experiment conducted at the Bing Nursery School in Stanford University many decades ago, Walter Mischel expounds on the benefits derived by delaying instant gratification for future success. The famous experiment, now popular as ""The Marshmallow Test"" primarily aimed to put to test the will power of little children who were asked to choose between two alternatives. While under the first option, they could immediately take a candy/sweet/marshmallow (as per their preference) that was kept on a table, they were presented with a second choice under which they could lay claim to grab 2 candies/sweets/marshmallows if they could resist their desires by a mere 20 minutes.A researcher would leave the room with a child sitting alone in front of the table upon which the candies were kept. If the child, having wrestled out by temptation decided to pick the candy, all he/she had to do was ring a bill kept on the table, hearing which the researcher would return to the room and allow the child to take one sweet of his/choice. However if the child was successfully able to resist the allure of the sweet for all of 20 minutes, the researcher would enter the room after the designated time limit and gift the winner any 2 sweets of the victor's choice.This simple experiment shed enormously valuable insights into the workings of the human behaviour and led the way to identifying many improvements that usually go on to embellish the living of a person, a classic example being the ability to stop smoking after being addicted to nicotine for an imperceptibly long period.This books makes essential reading for anyone who is interested in gaining control over the more rustic senses thereby setting a focused path towards progression both in career as well as in life.""The Mashmallow Test"" - A fulfilling and rich after taste!"
143,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4325293-zebulon,5,"Cool and Hot thinking was shown to greatly impact the ability of the children to delay their gratification.  Cool thinking is associated with the pre-frontal area of the brain whereas hot thinking is associated with the amygdala. Amygdala is Latin for almond shaped.Use of the ""strange situation"" test where toddlers are briefly introduced to a stranger and then left with that person with other toys and distractions was a key indicator of whether the child could activate distraction strategies later in the marshmallow testing.Mischel's colleague Carole Dweck at UCLA has two models: incremental growth where a child does not believe that their capacity is limited and ""entity theorists"" that see their capacity as determined at birth.  Mischel asked questions in the 70s of the children to determine their mindsets.Carl Jung famously said that people study what they are not good at.Aversive counter conditioning is a strategy wherein an individual uses a disgusting sensory object to use the hot system to their advantage in dissuading them from pursuing a temptation.  The author used the example of a can of spent cigarette butts where smelling it was absolutely nauseating.ToM is an abbreviation for Theory of mind which is the important mental ability that begins in early childhood allowing us to understand that our beliefs may be false and that the way things appear may not be reality.  Theory of mind helps us to see that other people might no perceive the same scene or event the way that we do.The author also spoke volumes about development of executive function and if-then scenario development that could be used to harness the power of the hot/emotional/reactive system to avoid temptations."

Maybe its because I want to take a fresh perspective on the new year. The Marshmallow Test was a very interesting read. The way the author personalized the scientific data made The Marshmallow Test an easy and compelling read. By testing pre-school children in their ability to resist one marshmallow for a specific amount of time for a reward of two marshmallows the author takes a deeper look at people's hot and cold systems and how they influence self control. The study found that the more stress in a child's early development can impact the development of the cold system that impedes a child's ability resist temptation and increases impulsive decisions. This increased impulsiveness can lead to a more difficult life and poor long term planning. The good news: you can, even as an adult, condition your cold system to cool off your hot system and make better, more informed decisions about your life. By incorporating coping strategies like using ""If, Then"" and thinking about your decisions in a way that brings to life how those decisions will impact your daily life can help you better understand the impact of any potential decisions and help you make better informed decisions.The Marshmallow Test is a good read because it not only explains the scientific studies in an easy to understand way but it also provides real world coping skills that can be used by adults and children alike.

Any book that talks about the importance of self-control and delayed gratification is going to be good but not popular in todays society of fast food and get rich quick schemes. Walter Mischel talks about his marshmallow test and the different research that has been done since the 1960's in the field of self-control. For those that don't know, the marshmallow test says, if you don't have one marshmallow now you can have two later. Other topics that are discussed are persistence, optimism, thinking about our future self to make wise decisions in the present moment, and helping cool down hot emotions that can lead to destructive impulsive behaviors. I liked the book a lot because it gives useful strategies to curbing undesired appetites and how to prepare for the future. Walter uses data to back up all his information which is always a plus. He is a highly recognized and praised professor in the field of psychology and after reading this book I can see why.

Fortunately, evolution moves very slowly and human nature has changed very little in the last hundred (or thousand for that matter) years, so this advice is compatible with previous research-based parenting books.

I have related to it in all aspects of self-help, and a refresher to my psychology knowledge. The only drawback I did, was buying a scientific and a self help book as ebook. It didn't do it justice and it became a tedious read for me.I am happy with the way the author constructed his book, and labeled / went though what each chapter will contain. Albeit the title highlights on self-success, he was mostly focusing on children in the upbringing process and not the adult population or their set of problems, which I appreciate for those becoming parents, but it did not address the adult population entirely. Nonetheless, he had great techniques offered throughout the book that any will be able to take away and apply it in their life. (For example If-Then, keeping a mental dairy to understand your stressors..etc)There were some moments in the book that really hit me. When the the therapist asked his client, whom he felt the world was falling apart, and the therapist just asked ""would you like to?""I would definitely go over it and refresh my memory over the content offered in this book and try to apply it my own life.

149,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"The Marshmallow Test by Walter Mischel is an inquiry into the workings of self-control. In a now classic experiment, Dr. Mischel determined that many factors controlled by the Prefrontal Cortex can manifest themselves in children as young as four, perhaps even earlier. The Marshmallow Test itself can only be administered to children of a certain age, or else the child might not understand the instructions.The Test itself is ingenious and quite simple; offer the child a treat of some kind, it doesn’t have to be a marshmallow and tell the child that if they wait for around ten minutes they can have two marshmallows instead of one. Surprisingly, it was found that this determines a great many things later on in life. Self-control and willpower are instrumental in deciding SAT scores, whether or not the person will get in trouble, and whether the person will participate in risky behaviors or not.In the 1960s it wasn’t thought to be the case, but willpower can be strengthened like any muscle. The key is to think of willpower as something that is determined by effort and not by birth. Countless studies starting with this one have shown this to be the case. Thus, this book was fascinating."

151,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"Reading The Marshmallow Test is rewarding. The book is not perfect, but it is thought-provoking. First, about the experiment. The big hype about the Marshmallow Test centers around the correlation between childhood self-control and lifetime achievements. But when Mischel first designed the experiment, he focused on something else: how various conditions affect self-control. I find the devised experimental conditions intriguing. For example, Mischel found children's waiting time doubled when they are suggested to think about the marshmallow's ""cool"" aspect (its shape and puffiness) instead of its ""hot"" aspect (its taste). In another test condition, prompting children to recall a bitter experience makes them reach for candies almost immediately. But to my disappointment, Mischel did not talk about the sample size of the follow-up studies. He also skipped mentioning he did not control for the social-economic status of the kids in finding the correlation between waiting time and achievement. (A replication study found such correlation was reduced by 2/3 after controlling family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment.) He offered only limited arguments against critiques of his studies. As a result, questions kept emerging as I read his book. Apart from self-control, does longer waiting time reflects other qualities, such as stronger short-term memory, or higher ability to internalize social norms? If so, did those qualities instead of self-control make the willing-to-wait kids score higher in SAT? I understand I was reading a general audience book instead of a literature review. But still. I also wish Mischel could have combed through concepts more carefully. At one point in the book, he starts to talk about ""executive function"" as an interchangeable term of self-control. But is it? What are the differences and relationships between self control, impulse control, gratification delay, conscientiousness, and executive function? Which of them is the marshmallow test measuring? Intuitively, I understand what self-control means. But I still wish to take a look under its hood. Complaints apart, I find many discussions about self-control by Mischel intriguing. For example, he listed experiment evidence to argue that the ""cross-situational consistency of personality"" is an illusion. Instead, he claims that we each have a ""behavioral signature""—what we predictably do if particular situational triggers occur. The takeaway is that one should not label oneself as having great or little self-control. Instead, one should try to identify the exact hot spots that trigger impulsive reactions and make ""If-Then"" implementation plans ahead of time. By the same logic, Mischel argues that when we need to deal with behavior problems, it is often enough just to treat the ""symptom"" without digging deep into underlying causes such as early childhood traumas, of which the individual was unconscious. It is also interesting to know Mischel does not believe in ""ego depletion"". He claimed that students who were depleted in the experiments simply do not have enough motivation to comply with the experimenters' unrelenting demands for them to do boring tasks. He cited studies that show when students were primed to believe perseverance on tough tasks is energizing rather than depleting, they do not suffer from will fatigue. Mischel does not teach step-to-step tips like authors of self-help books. But I did learn useful principles and tricks. Other than ""identifying behavioral signatures"" which I mentioned above, I also learned it's helpful to resist temptation if one could change the mental presentation of the temptation. One could also create a psychological distance to a situation by imagining how someone else would behave. The fundamental principle Mischel summarized is simple but powerful: cool the ""now"", heat the ""later."" It is easy to note the first half of the principle, but I did not think of the second: to take the future into account, it helps to make it vivid. Bottom line: even though I am not fully convinced of many conclusions by the author, I think he poses interesting questions. Stray observations:• Mischel decided to follow up with the kids after he noticed a pattern in his daughters' suppertime discussion about them. His three daughters knew the experiment subjects personally because they were of similar ages and attended the same school as them. In fact, his daughters all participated in the experiment themselves. I wonder how long they have waited for the marshmallow…• Even though he has written a textbook about personality, Mischel claims that as he takes the limitation of commonly used personality tests seriously, he has resolved never to create one himself.

There wasn't completely new factual information for me but some interesting angles and terms used for improving self-control (distractions, concentrating on the future).“the ability to delay immediate gratification for the sake of future consequences is an acquirable cognitive skill.” Our self-control depends on two systems that are functioning in our body: one that instantly reacts to our environment (HOT), and one that controls our behavior (COOL).We choose the situations in which we exercise our self-control (not consistent across the board). Our self-control skills start developing when we’re very young, and they continue to be determined by our environment as we get older. This continuous development process means our ability to control ourselves is fluid. Anyone can improve his or her skills by focusing on the future and strategically using distractions.*The part of our brain that regulates self-control develops as we grow.*Our environment shapes our self-control abilities. *How much self-control we have depends on the context, but it is ultimately unlimited.*The result of a child's performance in the Marshmallow Test correlates with their self-control as an adult.*Children should be taught that they're capable of making their own decisions and that those decisions have consequences. *You can improve your self-control skills by concentrating on the future and putting distance between you and your temptation.

Self-control is one of everyone’s weakness, I believe. So how can we control ourselves? This book gave us a very clear picture of it in easy way, I mean not academically. The experiment on children about delaying of gratification blown my mind. For those who are keen to know about how we think and act and really want to be a better human!

There were interesting pieces of information, and cool case studies, but in my opinion it was far too long. Main points from the book:1. Some people are better than others to resist temptation and regulate painful emotions 2. These differences become visible as early as preschool age, and can predict outcomes over course of life 3. The traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you have or don’t have a lot of is false.. self control can be learned, improved, enhanced.. 4. We don’t have to be the victims of our social and biological histories 5. Self control involves strategies and insight, goals and motivation The most helpful advice I came away with is that we have more control over our environment and even genetics than we think we do. The “I think I can” idea is very powerful, and plays a huge part in our lives."

Some good observations are made, and the book may be useful source material. The audio book was read by Alan Alda.This got a pretty favorable review when released; I added it to my to-read list immediately. Walter Mischel devised the original study, and his anecdotes are a good addition. He also reports on related studies and derivatives. Asked frequently about this study, he emphasizes that correlation is not causation.He also leans into self-help, suggesting action for parents, teachers, and selves. While there are some good observations here, they can be lost in a sea of discussions of nature and nurture. At times the psychological study descriptions can also be quite dry. 2½ stars."

The research undertaken by Walter Mischel and his colleagues on executive function and delaying gratification is incredibly important, and it is detailed clearly in this book. The author is direct and balanced in his tone, and while it is at times a little dry for my tastes, I'm sure this is necessary for a lot of people to take the content seriously. I'm sure I'll be returning to these pages as they contain a plethora of insights related to the very concise topic of self-control, many of which are essential to understanding the actions of ourselves and others. I can wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone interested in psychology and social economics - it's easy to read, well articulated and while seemingly intuitive it is undoubtedly mind-expanding."

The book could have some more practical examples, but nonetheless the basic is still the same, as is the thousand year old truth, delay of gratification for higher rewards.

164,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20880982-thethousanderclub,3,"I first heard about the marshmallow test in 2010 while listening Dieter F. Uchtdorf's conference address titled Continue in Patience. I thought the concept was fascinating at the time, and over the years I have stumbled across various accounts of the tests and their impact on the academic community, as well as public policy debates. The Marshmallow Test, written by Walter Mischel, is a deeper dive into the origins of the famous study and the subsequent academic work which has been done to confirm and challenge its findings.The reader will immediately notice how the marshmallow test and its findings are far more nuanced than how its often reported in the media. It's not that the findings are incorrect or distorted, it's that the story is so much richer and more complex than a headline. I found this to be the most intriguing and valuable aspect of The Marshmallow Test. I love taking a deeper dive into assumptions. When it comes to human nature and human behavior generally, there are a lot of assumptions and even intellectual biases. Mischel takes a special interest in the nature versus nurture debate, and he points toward a bevy of academic research to support his findings. As I am wont to do, I accept the premises and conclusions of most academic research with limited skepticism because there is always another view, another study, and another reasonable opinion to suggest a contrarian viewpoint.Although all of the material is interesting, the writing isn't noticeably poignant. Mischel appears to be much more of a researcher than an author. In addition, The Marshmallow Test probably could have been a bit shorter. The main point of the book was made repeatedly and in different contexts. A few stories and a few research studies probably could have been omitted and the results would have been the same. Having said that, Mischel does spare the reader the graphs and charts which usually accompany a book like this. I enjoy looking at those and trying to understand the data at a more granular level, but it wasn't necessary for this book, which is mostly written for the layman. In conclusion, the marshmallow test is a very, very interesting academic study which deserves some attention, especially in the context of public policy, such as education. The debate over nature versus nurture is a fundamental one, and the results from Mischel's work and others contributes in a significant way to the debate. The Marshmallow Test was a nice look behind the curtain of a particular set of academic studies, and you have interest in something like that then this book is worth perusing. Otherwise, it may be a bit of slog.http://thethousanderclub.blogspot.com/"
165,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40311431-samantha-welker,5,"This book was a horrible choice to read at night before going to bed. It was so thought-provoking and full of interesting scientific facts that it got my wheels turning before I was trying to fall asleep. My only complaint about this book was that it did focus a bit too much on children and how to shape and mold their ""hot"" and ""cold"" impulses that manage their levels of self control. If I were a parent, I would find it fascinating, but it did harp on that a bit long for a single gal like me.Some of my favorite tid bits (without giving too much away) from this book were:Contextualized Self-Control: Why do we have self control over somethings, but not others? President Clinton had the self-control and delay ability to win a Rhodes scholarship, attain a Yale law degree and be elected president, but had no ability or willingness to exert self control for junk food and White House interns.The Tired Will: Are there limits to how much self-control and delay of gratification we can exert before will fatigue takes over? This is extremely important to think about in terms of how to self-regulateBorn with it or Worked for it: A recent topic of discussion with my boss, The Marshmallow Test argues that the traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you either have a lot or you don't (or can't do much about it either way) is false. Self control skills, both cognitive and emotional, can be learned, enhanced, and harnessed so that they become automatically activated when you need them. It's the failure to develop these self-control skills, and the lack of goals, values and social support needed to use it constructively that shapes a human being. To summarize, what I got most out of this book was the answer to the question of whether human nature is, at its core, malleable or fixed. Some people see self-control ability, willpower, intelligence and other characteristics as ""fixed"", unchangeable traits from the very start of life. They read the experimental evidence that executive function and self-control improve after educational interventions and interpret that as short-term effects unlikely to make a long-term difference, just little tricks that don't change inborn traits. If we allow the evidence to make a difference in our personal view points of individuals, we are able to understand and learn more about those around us and their actions and the motivation behind them.

The control in question is not just our ability to delay gratification or to quite an addiction, it is the ability of control over our lives. It explores the well-known debate nature vs nurture and what factors determines an individual’s characters. It is splendid and goes beyond self-control to also examine human nature. Very informative and well articulated with great examples."

The first sentence here means that the object of life is to have control over your basic instincts rather than our basic instincts controlling our behavior/life. Th book, "" The Marshmallow test"" is about the relationship between our ability to control our basic instinctive actions (controlled by hot system of the brain, mostly reactionary) and our long term success. I had first learnt about the Marshmallow test in 1990's and had found it pretty impressive. It always remained somewhere in the back of my mind. Only after reading this book, I learnt that the author has dedicated all his research life to explaining the basis of this test. That is exactly what this book explains. It is a fascinating journey and makes a lot of sense.I had an expectation that this book would elaborate on what made a child do better in these tests. The author did spend some time talking about nature and nurture's role but there seemed to be lack of data with regard to this. This is understandable as collection of this data could only be observational studies and not experiments and observational studies come with a lot of confounding variables. So, the author focused more experiments that justified some training techniques to deal with problem behaviors or to help people who would have scored lower on the test. At times, where the data was missing, the author used anecdotal evidence to support his thesis, which wasn't really needed and reduced the credibility of the book. There was a bit of inconsistency with respect to how much the author wanted to share. In certain cases the author would give a gist of the experimental design and then elaborate on the results but at other times he would only give the results without giving any details about the experimental designs and methods, which was disappointing. A couple of times, I found serious confounding in the experiments which made the conclusions pretty dubious.Despite the limitations mentioned above, it still was a sensible book and did give a lot of insight into human behavior. It partly validated the above mentioned philosophy, if at all that philosophy needed validation."
168,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226133-bookworm,3,"Would you wait for the marshmallows? In an experiment that is now well-known, researchers tested the self-control of children that were presented with a treat (marshmallows, Oreos, etc.). The premise was simple. Could they wait 20 minutes or so and therefore get extra treats to eat later? Or did they lack the patience and eat them anyway? Researchers found that this translated to later development: the children who waited (for however long) were more likely to be described as more disciplined in school, have higher SAT scores, have a lower BMI as adults as as having distinctly different brain scans later in life. Working backwards, the researchers also found that this happened with younger children too. Babies and toddlers who could comfort themselves with toys or other distractions when separated from a parent would become marshmallow-waiters. That said, Mischel emphasizes that this is not fate and describes how people who might have initially tested as being more impatient may have found ways of coping, strategies to change, etc. These involve role-playing scenarios, positive thinking, thinking through one's actions to the end result, etc. In part two he gets into more science-y jargon which I found boring. Part 1 (which summarizes most of the findings and walks through the experiments) was very conversational, very interesting. But Part 2 lost me. In Part 3 Mischel then tries to translate the results to larger world settings. How can schools and the educational system help teach children such skills? He clearly shows how slightly older children (8-10 were the ages of the children when Mischel first meets/talks to them) than those in the Marshmallow Experiment (who are around pre-school age) can adapt and change, but it involves their own personal desires plus a little bit of outside help (in this case it's KIPP, or the Knowledge is Power Program). As a child's brain is more malleable than an adults, it's key to get to them early. It was a pleasant read, although as I mentioned it was somewhat uneven in readability. But definitely a good pick up for anyone who has any interest in any of the themes or concepts that this famous ""Marshmallow Experiment"" covers."

I was hoping this book would help me learn better self-control techniques, but it was mostly science-driven.If you are looking for practical guidance to help achieve control techniques, this one might not be for you; however, if you have a scientific interest, then it's a worthwhile read.  My rating: 3 out of 5 marshmallows"
170,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46619134-maria-gonzalez,4," ""The marshmallow test,"" by Walter Mischel, Walter was observing whether the kids were mastering self-control. The marshmallow test was taken place at the Bing Nursery school of Stanford University with children between six months through five years of age. The marshmallow test had sixteen boy participants and sixteen girl participants, each participant was given one marshmallow and explained that if they waited fifteen minutes then they would either get one Oreo cookie, another marshmallow, or a pretzel stick, but if children were to unpatient to wait for fifteen minutes then they would not receive another treat. the researchers of the marshmallow test found out that children who were able to wait for fifteen minutes in order to receive another treat were most likely to get better SAT scores, would have better life outcomes, and a better education. The child's decision to either wait for fifteen minutes or to just give up due to their temptation to eat the delicious marshmallow, it all depended on their age, and background ethnicity.  What I liked about the book was that it explained self-control between children and adults and also because Walter put his observations towards the marshmallow test in a very entertaining hilarious descriptive way. this book was very good due to its long term analysis towards the study it's self, which I also gained more knowledge towards the overall meaning of the marshmallow test especially with the development strategies and the mechanisms of self-control. Another reason why I love the marshmallow book was because my psychology teacher first brought up the marshmallow experiment during my intro to psychology class, which made the class even more interesting. I didn't hate the book because I gained new knowledge from the experiment and because I was also very interested in the experiment ever since my intro to psychology class. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in psychology because it's a very fluffy, easy book to read. "
171,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18980203-charles-eliot,4,"""The Marshmallow Test"" takes its name from psychological studies, beginning in the 1960s and still continuing, which investigated self-control in very young children. The child subject was left alone in a room with a marshmallow, and told that if she didn't touch the marshmallow before the investigator returned, she could have two marshmallows. Kids showed different degrees of ability to resist temptation, and variations of the test probed the coping skills the kids employed. Over time a general framework emerged. We all have what the author, Walter Mischel, calls ""hot"" and ""cold"" responses. Hot responses are rapid, instinctive, urgent and emotional. Cold responses are analytical, objective, slow, and thoughtful. (This lines up almost exactly with Daniel Kahneman's insights in ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"") The key to exerting self-control is to cool down the response to the present, and heat up the response to the future. In other words, making the future gain more tempting than the present temptation. There are plenty of small and helpful tricks for this. One trick is to objectify the present temptation (""imagine the marshmallow with a frame around it and think of it as a picture of a marshmallow, not the real thing"") while drawing attention to the visceral pleasure of the future achievement (""it's going to be so cool to have two marshmallows to eat""). The most important trick of all is the ""if ... then"" trick, where you imagine what you will do if tempted. ""If ... then"" thinking has the effect of immediately derailing your hot response. The important message of The Marshmallow Test is that self-control is not entirely, or even predominantly, innate, but is a learned skill built on the brain's plasticity. The learning starts very early, and can continue throughout life. "
172,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,3,"Expanding upon a fascinating experiment conducted at the Bing Nursery School in Stanford University many decades ago, Walter Mischel expounds on the benefits derived by delaying instant gratification for future success. The famous experiment, now popular as ""The Marshmallow Test"" primarily aimed to put to test the will power of little children who were asked to choose between two alternatives. While under the first option, they could immediately take a candy/sweet/marshmallow (as per their preference) that was kept on a table, they were presented with a second choice under which they could lay claim to grab 2 candies/sweets/marshmallows if they could resist their desires by a mere 20 minutes.A researcher would leave the room with a child sitting alone in front of the table upon which the candies were kept. If the child, having wrestled out by temptation decided to pick the candy, all he/she had to do was ring a bill kept on the table, hearing which the researcher would return to the room and allow the child to take one sweet of his/choice. However if the child was successfully able to resist the allure of the sweet for all of 20 minutes, the researcher would enter the room after the designated time limit and gift the winner any 2 sweets of the victor's choice.This simple experiment shed enormously valuable insights into the workings of the human behaviour and led the way to identifying many improvements that usually go on to embellish the living of a person, a classic example being the ability to stop smoking after being addicted to nicotine for an imperceptibly long period.This books makes essential reading for anyone who is interested in gaining control over the more rustic senses thereby setting a focused path towards progression both in career as well as in life.""The Mashmallow Test"" - A fulfilling and rich after taste!"
173,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4325293-zebulon,5,"Cool and Hot thinking was shown to greatly impact the ability of the children to delay their gratification.  Cool thinking is associated with the pre-frontal area of the brain whereas hot thinking is associated with the amygdala. Amygdala is Latin for almond shaped.Use of the ""strange situation"" test where toddlers are briefly introduced to a stranger and then left with that person with other toys and distractions was a key indicator of whether the child could activate distraction strategies later in the marshmallow testing.Mischel's colleague Carole Dweck at UCLA has two models: incremental growth where a child does not believe that their capacity is limited and ""entity theorists"" that see their capacity as determined at birth.  Mischel asked questions in the 70s of the children to determine their mindsets.Carl Jung famously said that people study what they are not good at.Aversive counter conditioning is a strategy wherein an individual uses a disgusting sensory object to use the hot system to their advantage in dissuading them from pursuing a temptation.  The author used the example of a can of spent cigarette butts where smelling it was absolutely nauseating.ToM is an abbreviation for Theory of mind which is the important mental ability that begins in early childhood allowing us to understand that our beliefs may be false and that the way things appear may not be reality.  Theory of mind helps us to see that other people might no perceive the same scene or event the way that we do.The author also spoke volumes about development of executive function and if-then scenario development that could be used to harness the power of the hot/emotional/reactive system to avoid temptations."

Maybe its because I want to take a fresh perspective on the new year. The Marshmallow Test was a very interesting read. The way the author personalized the scientific data made The Marshmallow Test an easy and compelling read. By testing pre-school children in their ability to resist one marshmallow for a specific amount of time for a reward of two marshmallows the author takes a deeper look at people's hot and cold systems and how they influence self control. The study found that the more stress in a child's early development can impact the development of the cold system that impedes a child's ability resist temptation and increases impulsive decisions. This increased impulsiveness can lead to a more difficult life and poor long term planning. The good news: you can, even as an adult, condition your cold system to cool off your hot system and make better, more informed decisions about your life. By incorporating coping strategies like using ""If, Then"" and thinking about your decisions in a way that brings to life how those decisions will impact your daily life can help you better understand the impact of any potential decisions and help you make better informed decisions.The Marshmallow Test is a good read because it not only explains the scientific studies in an easy to understand way but it also provides real world coping skills that can be used by adults and children alike.

Any book that talks about the importance of self-control and delayed gratification is going to be good but not popular in todays society of fast food and get rich quick schemes. Walter Mischel talks about his marshmallow test and the different research that has been done since the 1960's in the field of self-control. For those that don't know, the marshmallow test says, if you don't have one marshmallow now you can have two later. Other topics that are discussed are persistence, optimism, thinking about our future self to make wise decisions in the present moment, and helping cool down hot emotions that can lead to destructive impulsive behaviors. I liked the book a lot because it gives useful strategies to curbing undesired appetites and how to prepare for the future. Walter uses data to back up all his information which is always a plus.

Fortunately, evolution moves very slowly and human nature has changed very little in the last hundred (or thousand for that matter) years, so this advice is compatible with previous research-based parenting books.

I have related to it in all aspects of self-help, and a refresher to my psychology knowledge. The only drawback I did, was buying a scientific and a self help book as ebook. It didn't do it justice and it became a tedious read for me.I am happy with the way the author constructed his book, and labeled / went though what each chapter will contain. Albeit the title highlights on self-success, he was mostly focusing on children in the upbringing process and not the adult population or their set of problems, which I appreciate for those becoming parents, but it did not address the adult population entirely. Nonetheless, he had great techniques offered throughout the book that any will be able to take away and apply it in their life. (For example If-Then, keeping a mental dairy to understand your stressors..etc)There were some moments in the book that really hit me. When the the therapist asked his client, whom he felt the world was falling apart, and the therapist just asked ""would you like to?""I would definitely go over it and refresh my memory over the content offered in this book and try to apply it my own life.

179,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"The Marshmallow Test by Walter Mischel is an inquiry into the workings of self-control. In a now classic experiment, Dr. Mischel determined that many factors controlled by the Prefrontal Cortex can manifest themselves in children as young as four, perhaps even earlier. The Marshmallow Test itself can only be administered to children of a certain age, or else the child might not understand the instructions.The Test itself is ingenious and quite simple; offer the child a treat of some kind, it doesn’t have to be a marshmallow and tell the child that if they wait for around ten minutes they can have two marshmallows instead of one. Surprisingly, it was found that this determines a great many things later on in life. Self-control and willpower are instrumental in deciding SAT scores, whether or not the person will get in trouble, and whether the person will participate in risky behaviors or not.In the 1960s it wasn’t thought to be the case, but willpower can be strengthened like any muscle. The key is to think of willpower as something that is determined by effort and not by birth. Countless studies starting with this one have shown this to be the case. Thus, this book was fascinating."

181,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"Reading The Marshmallow Test is rewarding. The book is not perfect, but it is thought-provoking. First, about the experiment. The big hype about the Marshmallow Test centers around the correlation between childhood self-control and lifetime achievements. But when Mischel first designed the experiment, he focused on something else: how various conditions affect self-control. I find the devised experimental conditions intriguing. For example, Mischel found children's waiting time doubled when they are suggested to think about the marshmallow's ""cool"" aspect (its shape and puffiness) instead of its ""hot"" aspect (its taste). In another test condition, prompting children to recall a bitter experience makes them reach for candies almost immediately. But to my disappointment, Mischel did not talk about the sample size of the follow-up studies. He also skipped mentioning he did not control for the social-economic status of the kids in finding the correlation between waiting time and achievement. (A replication study found such correlation was reduced by 2/3 after controlling family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment.) He offered only limited arguments against critiques of his studies. As a result, questions kept emerging as I read his book. Apart from self-control, does longer waiting time reflects other qualities, such as stronger short-term memory, or higher ability to internalize social norms? If so, did those qualities instead of self-control make the willing-to-wait kids score higher in SAT? I understand I was reading a general audience book instead of a literature review. But still. I also wish Mischel could have combed through concepts more carefully. At one point in the book, he starts to talk about ""executive function"" as an interchangeable term of self-control. But is it? What are the differences and relationships between self control, impulse control, gratification delay, conscientiousness, and executive function? Which of them is the marshmallow test measuring? Intuitively, I understand what self-control means. But I still wish to take a look under its hood. Complaints apart, I find many discussions about self-control by Mischel intriguing. For example, he listed experiment evidence to argue that the ""cross-situational consistency of personality"" is an illusion. Instead, he claims that we each have a ""behavioral signature""—what we predictably do if particular situational triggers occur. The takeaway is that one should not label oneself as having great or little self-control. Instead, one should try to identify the exact hot spots that trigger impulsive reactions and make ""If-Then"" implementation plans ahead of time. By the same logic, Mischel argues that when we need to deal with behavior problems, it is often enough just to treat the ""symptom"" without digging deep into underlying causes such as early childhood traumas, of which the individual was unconscious. It is also interesting to know Mischel does not believe in ""ego depletion"". He claimed that students who were depleted in the experiments simply do not have enough motivation to comply with the experimenters' unrelenting demands for them to do boring tasks. He cited studies that show when students were primed to believe perseverance on tough tasks is energizing rather than depleting, they do not suffer from will fatigue. Mischel does not teach step-to-step tips like authors of self-help books. But I did learn useful principles and tricks. Other than ""identifying behavioral signatures"" which I mentioned above, I also learned it's helpful to resist temptation if one could change the mental presentation of the temptation. One could also create a psychological distance to a situation by imagining how someone else would behave. The fundamental principle Mischel summarized is simple but powerful: cool the ""now"", heat the ""later."" It is easy to note the first half of the principle, but I did not think of the second: to take the future into account, it helps to make it vivid. Bottom line: even though I am not fully convinced of many conclusions by the author, I think he poses interesting questions. Stray observations:• Mischel decided to follow up with the kids after he noticed a pattern in his daughters' suppertime discussion about them. His three daughters knew the experiment subjects personally because they were of similar ages and attended the same school as them. In fact, his daughters all participated in the experiment themselves. I wonder how long they have waited for the marshmallow…• Even though he has written a textbook about personality, Mischel claims that as he takes the limitation of commonly used personality tests seriously, he has resolved never to create one himself.

There wasn't completely new factual information for me but some interesting angles and terms used for improving self-control (distractions, concentrating on the future).“the ability to delay immediate gratification for the sake of future consequences is an acquirable cognitive skill.” Our self-control depends on two systems that are functioning in our body: one that instantly reacts to our environment (HOT), and one that controls our behavior (COOL).We choose the situations in which we exercise our self-control (not consistent across the board). Our self-control skills start developing when we’re very young, and they continue to be determined by our environment as we get older. This continuous development process means our ability to control ourselves is fluid. Anyone can improve his or her skills by focusing on the future and strategically using distractions.*The part of our brain that regulates self-control develops as we grow.*Our environment shapes our self-control abilities. *How much self-control we have depends on the context, but it is ultimately unlimited.*The result of a child's performance in the Marshmallow Test correlates with their self-control as an adult.*Children should be taught that they're capable of making their own decisions and that those decisions have consequences. *You can improve your self-control skills by concentrating on the future and putting distance between you and your temptation.

I picked up this book because I was attracted to the title “the marshmallow test” At first I didn’t expect that content would be about human behaviour, but then seeing that it was about the understanding of self control so I found it’s even more interesting. Self-control is one of everyone’s weakness, I believe. So how can we control ourselves? This book gave us a very clear picture of it in easy way, I mean not academically. The experiment on children about delaying of gratification blown my mind. For those who are keen to know about how we think and act and really want to be a better human! Especially, if you are looking for the way to get out from the circle of unhealthy lifestyle such as smoking, eating, heartbroken, anxiety and so on, this book could let yourself know yourself more.

There were interesting pieces of information, and cool case studies, but in my opinion it was far too long. Main points from the book:1. Some people are better than others to resist temptation and regulate painful emotions 2. These differences become visible as early as preschool age, and can predict outcomes over course of life 3. The traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you have or don’t have a lot of is false.. self control can be learned, improved, enhanced.. 4. We don’t have to be the victims of our social and biological histories 5. Self control involves strategies and insight, goals and motivation The most helpful advice I came away with is that we have more control over our environment and even genetics than we think we do. The “I think I can” idea is very powerful, and plays a huge part in our lives."

Some good observations are made, and the book may be useful source material. The audio book was read by Alan Alda.This got a pretty favorable review when released; I added it to my to-read list immediately. Walter Mischel devised the original study, and his anecdotes are a good addition. He also reports on related studies and derivatives. Asked frequently about this study, he emphasizes that correlation is not causation.He also leans into self-help, suggesting action for parents, teachers, and selves. While there are some good observations here, they can be lost in a sea of discussions of nature and nurture. At times the psychological study descriptions can also be quite dry. 2½ stars."

I'm sure I'll be returning to these pages as they contain a plethora of insights related to the very concise topic of self-control, many of which are essential to understanding the actions of ourselves and others.

194,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20880982-thethousanderclub,3,"I first heard about the marshmallow test in 2010 while listening Dieter F. Uchtdorf's conference address titled Continue in Patience. I thought the concept was fascinating at the time, and over the years I have stumbled across various accounts of the tests and their impact on the academic community, as well as public policy debates. The Marshmallow Test, written by Walter Mischel, is a deeper dive into the origins of the famous study and the subsequent academic work which has been done to confirm and challenge its findings.The reader will immediately notice how the marshmallow test and its findings are far more nuanced than how its often reported in the media. It's not that the findings are incorrect or distorted, it's that the story is so much richer and more complex than a headline. I found this to be the most intriguing and valuable aspect of The Marshmallow Test. I love taking a deeper dive into assumptions. When it comes to human nature and human behavior generally, there are a lot of assumptions and even intellectual biases. Mischel takes a special interest in the nature versus nurture debate, and he points toward a bevy of academic research to support his findings. As I am wont to do, I accept the premises and conclusions of most academic research with limited skepticism because there is always another view, another study, and another reasonable opinion to suggest a contrarian viewpoint.Although all of the material is interesting, the writing isn't noticeably poignant. Mischel appears to be much more of a researcher than an author. In addition, The Marshmallow Test probably could have been a bit shorter. The main point of the book was made repeatedly and in different contexts. A few stories and a few research studies probably could have been omitted and the results would have been the same. Having said that, Mischel does spare the reader the graphs and charts which usually accompany a book like this. I enjoy looking at those and trying to understand the data at a more granular level, but it wasn't necessary for this book, which is mostly written for the layman. In conclusion, the marshmallow test is a very, very interesting academic study which deserves some attention, especially in the context of public policy, such as education. The debate over nature versus nurture is a fundamental one, and the results from Mischel's work and others contributes in a significant way to the debate. The Marshmallow Test was a nice look behind the curtain of a particular set of academic studies, and you have interest in something like that then this book is worth perusing. Otherwise, it may be a bit of slog.http://thethousanderclub.blogspot.com/"
195,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40311431-samantha-welker,5,"This book was a horrible choice to read at night before going to bed. It was so thought-provoking and full of interesting scientific facts that it got my wheels turning before I was trying to fall asleep. My only complaint about this book was that it did focus a bit too much on children and how to shape and mold their ""hot"" and ""cold"" impulses that manage their levels of self control. If I were a parent, I would find it fascinating, but it did harp on that a bit long for a single gal like me.Some of my favorite tid bits (without giving too much away) from this book were:Contextualized Self-Control: Why do we have self control over somethings, but not others? President Clinton had the self-control and delay ability to win a Rhodes scholarship, attain a Yale law degree and be elected president, but had no ability or willingness to exert self control for junk food and White House interns.The Tired Will: Are there limits to how much self-control and delay of gratification we can exert before will fatigue takes over? This is extremely important to think about in terms of how to self-regulateBorn with it or Worked for it: A recent topic of discussion with my boss, The Marshmallow Test argues that the traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you either have a lot or you don't (or can't do much about it either way) is false. Self control skills, both cognitive and emotional, can be learned, enhanced, and harnessed so that they become automatically activated when you need them. It's the failure to develop these self-control skills, and the lack of goals, values and social support needed to use it constructively that shapes a human being. To summarize, what I got most out of this book was the answer to the question of whether human nature is, at its core, malleable or fixed. Some people see self-control ability, willpower, intelligence and other characteristics as ""fixed"", unchangeable traits from the very start of life. They read the experimental evidence that executive function and self-control improve after educational interventions and interpret that as short-term effects unlikely to make a long-term difference, just little tricks that don't change inborn traits. If we allow the evidence to make a difference in our personal view points of individuals, we are able to understand and learn more about those around us and their actions and the motivation behind them.

The control in question is not just our ability to delay gratification or to quite an addiction, it is the ability of control over our lives. It explores the well-known debate nature vs nurture and what factors determines an individual’s characters. It is splendid and goes beyond self-control to also examine human nature. Very informative and well articulated with great examples."

The first sentence here means that the object of life is to have control over your basic instincts rather than our basic instincts controlling our behavior/life. Th book, "" The Marshmallow test"" is about the relationship between our ability to control our basic instinctive actions (controlled by hot system of the brain, mostly reactionary) and our long term success. I had first learnt about the Marshmallow test in 1990's and had found it pretty impressive. It always remained somewhere in the back of my mind. Only after reading this book, I learnt that the author has dedicated all his research life to explaining the basis of this test. That is exactly what this book explains. It is a fascinating journey and makes a lot of sense.I had an expectation that this book would elaborate on what made a child do better in these tests. The author did spend some time talking about nature and nurture's role but there seemed to be lack of data with regard to this. This is understandable as collection of this data could only be observational studies and not experiments and observational studies come with a lot of confounding variables. So, the author focused more experiments that justified some training techniques to deal with problem behaviors or to help people who would have scored lower on the test. At times, where the data was missing, the author used anecdotal evidence to support his thesis, which wasn't really needed and reduced the credibility of the book. There was a bit of inconsistency with respect to how much the author wanted to share. In certain cases the author would give a gist of the experimental design and then elaborate on the results but at other times he would only give the results without giving any details about the experimental designs and methods, which was disappointing. A couple of times, I found serious confounding in the experiments which made the conclusions pretty dubious.Despite the limitations mentioned above, it still was a sensible book and did give a lot of insight into human behavior. It partly validated the above mentioned philosophy, if at all that philosophy needed validation."
198,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226133-bookworm,3,"Would you wait for the marshmallows? In an experiment that is now well-known, researchers tested the self-control of children that were presented with a treat (marshmallows, Oreos, etc.). The premise was simple. Could they wait 20 minutes or so and therefore get extra treats to eat later? Or did they lack the patience and eat them anyway? Researchers found that this translated to later development: the children who waited (for however long) were more likely to be described as more disciplined in school, have higher SAT scores, have a lower BMI as adults as as having distinctly different brain scans later in life. Working backwards, the researchers also found that this happened with younger children too. Babies and toddlers who could comfort themselves with toys or other distractions when separated from a parent would become marshmallow-waiters. That said, Mischel emphasizes that this is not fate and describes how people who might have initially tested as being more impatient may have found ways of coping, strategies to change, etc. These involve role-playing scenarios, positive thinking, thinking through one's actions to the end result, etc. In part two he gets into more science-y jargon which I found boring. Part 1 (which summarizes most of the findings and walks through the experiments) was very conversational, very interesting. But Part 2 lost me. In Part 3 Mischel then tries to translate the results to larger world settings. How can schools and the educational system help teach children such skills? He clearly shows how slightly older children (8-10 were the ages of the children when Mischel first meets/talks to them) than those in the Marshmallow Experiment (who are around pre-school age) can adapt and change, but it involves their own personal desires plus a little bit of outside help (in this case it's KIPP, or the Knowledge is Power Program). As a child's brain is more malleable than an adults, it's key to get to them early. It was a pleasant read, although as I mentioned it was somewhat uneven in readability. But definitely a good pick up for anyone who has any interest in any of the themes or concepts that this famous ""Marshmallow Experiment"" covers."

The study itself is well-examined.My downfall to this book: I found some areas to be a bit repetitive and I did not get one of my initial expectations, ""understanding self-control and how to master it."" I was hoping this book would help me learn better self-control techniques, but it was mostly science-driven.If you are looking for practical guidance to help achieve control techniques, this one might not be for you; however, if you have a scientific interest, then it's a worthwhile read.  My rating: 3 out of 5 marshmallows"
200,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46619134-maria-gonzalez,4," ""The marshmallow test,"" by Walter Mischel, Walter was observing whether the kids were mastering self-control. The marshmallow test was taken place at the Bing Nursery school of Stanford University with children between six months through five years of age. The marshmallow test had sixteen boy participants and sixteen girl participants, each participant was given one marshmallow and explained that if they waited fifteen minutes then they would either get one Oreo cookie, another marshmallow, or a pretzel stick, but if children were to unpatient to wait for fifteen minutes then they would not receive another treat. the researchers of the marshmallow test found out that children who were able to wait for fifteen minutes in order to receive another treat were most likely to get better SAT scores, would have better life outcomes, and a better education. The child's decision to either wait for fifteen minutes or to just give up due to their temptation to eat the delicious marshmallow, it all depended on their age, and background ethnicity.  What I liked about the book was that it explained self-control between children and adults and also because Walter put his observations towards the marshmallow test in a very entertaining hilarious descriptive way. this book was very good due to its long term analysis towards the study it's self, which I also gained more knowledge towards the overall meaning of the marshmallow test especially with the development strategies and the mechanisms of self-control. Another reason why I love the marshmallow book was because my psychology teacher first brought up the marshmallow experiment during my intro to psychology class, which made the class even more interesting. I didn't hate the book because I gained new knowledge from the experiment and because I was also very interested in the experiment ever since my intro to psychology class. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in psychology because it's a very fluffy, easy book to read. "
201,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18980203-charles-eliot,4,"""The Marshmallow Test"" takes its name from psychological studies, beginning in the 1960s and still continuing, which investigated self-control in very young children. The child subject was left alone in a room with a marshmallow, and told that if she didn't touch the marshmallow before the investigator returned, she could have two marshmallows. Kids showed different degrees of ability to resist temptation, and variations of the test probed the coping skills the kids employed. Over time a general framework emerged. We all have what the author, Walter Mischel, calls ""hot"" and ""cold"" responses. Hot responses are rapid, instinctive, urgent and emotional. Cold responses are analytical, objective, slow, and thoughtful. (This lines up almost exactly with Daniel Kahneman's insights in ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"") The key to exerting self-control is to cool down the response to the present, and heat up the response to the future. In other words, making the future gain more tempting than the present temptation. There are plenty of small and helpful tricks for this. One trick is to objectify the present temptation (""imagine the marshmallow with a frame around it and think of it as a picture of a marshmallow, not the real thing"") while drawing attention to the visceral pleasure of the future achievement (""it's going to be so cool to have two marshmallows to eat""). The most important trick of all is the ""if ... then"" trick, where you imagine what you will do if tempted. ""If ... then"" thinking has the effect of immediately derailing your hot response. The important message of The Marshmallow Test is that self-control is not entirely, or even predominantly, innate, but is a learned skill built on the brain's plasticity. The learning starts very early, and can continue throughout life. "
202,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,3,"Expanding upon a fascinating experiment conducted at the Bing Nursery School in Stanford University many decades ago, Walter Mischel expounds on the benefits derived by delaying instant gratification for future success. The famous experiment, now popular as ""The Marshmallow Test"" primarily aimed to put to test the will power of little children who were asked to choose between two alternatives. While under the first option, they could immediately take a candy/sweet/marshmallow (as per their preference) that was kept on a table, they were presented with a second choice under which they could lay claim to grab 2 candies/sweets/marshmallows if they could resist their desires by a mere 20 minutes.A researcher would leave the room with a child sitting alone in front of the table upon which the candies were kept. If the child, having wrestled out by temptation decided to pick the candy, all he/she had to do was ring a bill kept on the table, hearing which the researcher would return to the room and allow the child to take one sweet of his/choice. However if the child was successfully able to resist the allure of the sweet for all of 20 minutes, the researcher would enter the room after the designated time limit and gift the winner any 2 sweets of the victor's choice.This simple experiment shed enormously valuable insights into the workings of the human behaviour and led the way to identifying many improvements that usually go on to embellish the living of a person, a classic example being the ability to stop smoking after being addicted to nicotine for an imperceptibly long period.This books makes essential reading for anyone who is interested in gaining control over the more rustic senses thereby setting a focused path towards progression both in career as well as in life.""The Mashmallow Test"" - A fulfilling and rich after taste!"
203,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4325293-zebulon,5,"Cool and Hot thinking was shown to greatly impact the ability of the children to delay their gratification.  Cool thinking is associated with the pre-frontal area of the brain whereas hot thinking is associated with the amygdala. Amygdala is Latin for almond shaped.Use of the ""strange situation"" test where toddlers are briefly introduced to a stranger and then left with that person with other toys and distractions was a key indicator of whether the child could activate distraction strategies later in the marshmallow testing.Mischel's colleague Carole Dweck at UCLA has two models: incremental growth where a child does not believe that their capacity is limited and ""entity theorists"" that see their capacity as determined at birth.  Mischel asked questions in the 70s of the children to determine their mindsets.Carl Jung famously said that people study what they are not good at.Aversive counter conditioning is a strategy wherein an individual uses a disgusting sensory object to use the hot system to their advantage in dissuading them from pursuing a temptation.  The author used the example of a can of spent cigarette butts where smelling it was absolutely nauseating.ToM is an abbreviation for Theory of mind which is the important mental ability that begins in early childhood allowing us to understand that our beliefs may be false and that the way things appear may not be reality.  Theory of mind helps us to see that other people might no perceive the same scene or event the way that we do.The author also spoke volumes about development of executive function and if-then scenario development that could be used to harness the power of the hot/emotional/reactive system to avoid temptations."

Maybe its because I want to take a fresh perspective on the new year. The Marshmallow Test was a very interesting read. The way the author personalized the scientific data made The Marshmallow Test an easy and compelling read. By testing pre-school children in their ability to resist one marshmallow for a specific amount of time for a reward of two marshmallows the author takes a deeper look at people's hot and cold systems and how they influence self control. The study found that the more stress in a child's early development can impact the development of the cold system that impedes a child's ability resist temptation and increases impulsive decisions. This increased impulsiveness can lead to a more difficult life and poor long term planning. The good news: you can, even as an adult, condition your cold system to cool off your hot system and make better, more informed decisions about your life. By incorporating coping strategies like using ""If, Then"" and thinking about your decisions in a way that brings to life how those decisions will impact your daily life can help you better understand the impact of any potential decisions and help you make better informed decisions.The Marshmallow Test is a good read because it not only explains the scientific studies in an easy to understand way but it also provides real world coping skills that can be used by adults and children alike.

Walter Mischel talks about his marshmallow test and the different research that has been done since the 1960's in the field of self-control. For those that don't know, the marshmallow test says, if you don't have one marshmallow now you can have two later. Other topics that are discussed are persistence, optimism, thinking about our future self to make wise decisions in the present moment, and helping cool down hot emotions that can lead to destructive impulsive behaviors. I liked the book a lot because it gives useful strategies to curbing undesired appetites and how to prepare for the future. Walter uses data to back up all his information which is always a plus.

Fortunately, evolution moves very slowly and human nature has changed very little in the last hundred (or thousand for that matter) years, so this advice is compatible with previous research-based parenting books.

I have related to it in all aspects of self-help, and a refresher to my psychology knowledge. The only drawback I did, was buying a scientific and a self help book as ebook. It didn't do it justice and it became a tedious read for me.I am happy with the way the author constructed his book, and labeled / went though what each chapter will contain. Albeit the title highlights on self-success, he was mostly focusing on children in the upbringing process and not the adult population or their set of problems, which I appreciate for those becoming parents, but it did not address the adult population entirely. Nonetheless, he had great techniques offered throughout the book that any will be able to take away and apply it in their life. (For example If-Then, keeping a mental dairy to understand your stressors..etc)There were some moments in the book that really hit me. When the the therapist asked his client, whom he felt the world was falling apart, and the therapist just asked ""would you like to?""I would definitely go over it and refresh my memory over the content offered in this book and try to apply it my own life.

In a now classic experiment, Dr. Mischel determined that many factors controlled by the Prefrontal Cortex can manifest themselves in children as young as four, perhaps even earlier. The Marshmallow Test itself can only be administered to children of a certain age, or else the child might not understand the instructions.The Test itself is ingenious and quite simple; offer the child a treat of some kind, it doesn’t have to be a marshmallow and tell the child that if they wait for around ten minutes they can have two marshmallows instead of one. Surprisingly, it was found that this determines a great many things later on in life. Self-control and willpower are instrumental in deciding SAT scores, whether or not the person will get in trouble, and whether the person will participate in risky behaviors or not.In the 1960s it wasn’t thought to be the case, but willpower can be strengthened like any muscle. The key is to think of willpower as something that is determined by effort and not by birth. Countless studies starting with this one have shown this to be the case. Thus, this book was fascinating."

211,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"Reading The Marshmallow Test is rewarding. The book is not perfect, but it is thought-provoking. First, about the experiment. The big hype about the Marshmallow Test centers around the correlation between childhood self-control and lifetime achievements. But when Mischel first designed the experiment, he focused on something else: how various conditions affect self-control. I find the devised experimental conditions intriguing. For example, Mischel found children's waiting time doubled when they are suggested to think about the marshmallow's ""cool"" aspect (its shape and puffiness) instead of its ""hot"" aspect (its taste). In another test condition, prompting children to recall a bitter experience makes them reach for candies almost immediately. But to my disappointment, Mischel did not talk about the sample size of the follow-up studies. He also skipped mentioning he did not control for the social-economic status of the kids in finding the correlation between waiting time and achievement. (A replication study found such correlation was reduced by 2/3 after controlling family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment.) He offered only limited arguments against critiques of his studies. As a result, questions kept emerging as I read his book. Apart from self-control, does longer waiting time reflects other qualities, such as stronger short-term memory, or higher ability to internalize social norms? If so, did those qualities instead of self-control make the willing-to-wait kids score higher in SAT? I understand I was reading a general audience book instead of a literature review. But still. I also wish Mischel could have combed through concepts more carefully. At one point in the book, he starts to talk about ""executive function"" as an interchangeable term of self-control. But is it? What are the differences and relationships between self control, impulse control, gratification delay, conscientiousness, and executive function? Which of them is the marshmallow test measuring? Intuitively, I understand what self-control means. But I still wish to take a look under its hood. Complaints apart, I find many discussions about self-control by Mischel intriguing. For example, he listed experiment evidence to argue that the ""cross-situational consistency of personality"" is an illusion. Instead, he claims that we each have a ""behavioral signature""—what we predictably do if particular situational triggers occur. The takeaway is that one should not label oneself as having great or little self-control. Instead, one should try to identify the exact hot spots that trigger impulsive reactions and make ""If-Then"" implementation plans ahead of time. By the same logic, Mischel argues that when we need to deal with behavior problems, it is often enough just to treat the ""symptom"" without digging deep into underlying causes such as early childhood traumas, of which the individual was unconscious. It is also interesting to know Mischel does not believe in ""ego depletion"". He claimed that students who were depleted in the experiments simply do not have enough motivation to comply with the experimenters' unrelenting demands for them to do boring tasks. He cited studies that show when students were primed to believe perseverance on tough tasks is energizing rather than depleting, they do not suffer from will fatigue. Mischel does not teach step-to-step tips like authors of self-help books. But I did learn useful principles and tricks. Other than ""identifying behavioral signatures"" which I mentioned above, I also learned it's helpful to resist temptation if one could change the mental presentation of the temptation. One could also create a psychological distance to a situation by imagining how someone else would behave. The fundamental principle Mischel summarized is simple but powerful: cool the ""now"", heat the ""later."" It is easy to note the first half of the principle, but I did not think of the second: to take the future into account, it helps to make it vivid. Bottom line: even though I am not fully convinced of many conclusions by the author, I think he poses interesting questions. Stray observations:• Mischel decided to follow up with the kids after he noticed a pattern in his daughters' suppertime discussion about them. His three daughters knew the experiment subjects personally because they were of similar ages and attended the same school as them. In fact, his daughters all participated in the experiment themselves. I wonder how long they have waited for the marshmallow…• Even though he has written a textbook about personality, Mischel claims that as he takes the limitation of commonly used personality tests seriously, he has resolved never to create one himself.

There wasn't completely new factual information for me but some interesting angles and terms used for improving self-control (distractions, concentrating on the future).“the ability to delay immediate gratification for the sake of future consequences is an acquirable cognitive skill.” Our self-control depends on two systems that are functioning in our body: one that instantly reacts to our environment (HOT), and one that controls our behavior (COOL).We choose the situations in which we exercise our self-control (not consistent across the board). Our self-control skills start developing when we’re very young, and they continue to be determined by our environment as we get older. This continuous development process means our ability to control ourselves is fluid. Anyone can improve his or her skills by focusing on the future and strategically using distractions.*The part of our brain that regulates self-control develops as we grow.*Our environment shapes our self-control abilities. *How much self-control we have depends on the context, but it is ultimately unlimited.*The result of a child's performance in the Marshmallow Test correlates with their self-control as an adult.*Children should be taught that they're capable of making their own decisions and that those decisions have consequences. *You can improve your self-control skills by concentrating on the future and putting distance between you and your temptation.

I picked up this book because I was attracted to the title “the marshmallow test” At first I didn’t expect that content would be about human behaviour, but then seeing that it was about the understanding of self control so I found it’s even more interesting. Self-control is one of everyone’s weakness, I believe. So how can we control ourselves? This book gave us a very clear picture of it in easy way, I mean not academically. The experiment on children about delaying of gratification blown my mind. For those who are keen to know about how we think and act and really want to be a better human! Especially, if you are looking for the way to get out from the circle of unhealthy lifestyle such as smoking, eating, heartbroken, anxiety and so on, this book could let yourself know yourself more.

There were interesting pieces of information, and cool case studies, but in my opinion it was far too long. Main points from the book:1. Some people are better than others to resist temptation and regulate painful emotions 2. These differences become visible as early as preschool age, and can predict outcomes over course of life 3. The traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you have or don’t have a lot of is false.. self control can be learned, improved, enhanced.. 4. We don’t have to be the victims of our social and biological histories 5. Self control involves strategies and insight, goals and motivation The most helpful advice I came away with is that we have more control over our environment and even genetics than we think we do. The “I think I can” idea is very powerful, and plays a huge part in our lives."

Some good observations are made, and the book may be useful source material. The audio book was read by Alan Alda.This got a pretty favorable review when released; I added it to my to-read list immediately. Walter Mischel devised the original study, and his anecdotes are a good addition. He also reports on related studies and derivatives. Asked frequently about this study, he emphasizes that correlation is not causation.He also leans into self-help, suggesting action for parents, teachers, and selves. While there are some good observations here, they can be lost in a sea of discussions of nature and nurture. At times the psychological study descriptions can also be quite dry. 2½ stars."

I'm sure I'll be returning to these pages as they contain a plethora of insights related to the very concise topic of self-control, many of which are essential to understanding the actions of ourselves and others.

224,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20880982-thethousanderclub,3,"I first heard about the marshmallow test in 2010 while listening Dieter F. Uchtdorf's conference address titled Continue in Patience. I thought the concept was fascinating at the time, and over the years I have stumbled across various accounts of the tests and their impact on the academic community, as well as public policy debates. The Marshmallow Test, written by Walter Mischel, is a deeper dive into the origins of the famous study and the subsequent academic work which has been done to confirm and challenge its findings.The reader will immediately notice how the marshmallow test and its findings are far more nuanced than how its often reported in the media. It's not that the findings are incorrect or distorted, it's that the story is so much richer and more complex than a headline. I found this to be the most intriguing and valuable aspect of The Marshmallow Test. I love taking a deeper dive into assumptions. When it comes to human nature and human behavior generally, there are a lot of assumptions and even intellectual biases. Mischel takes a special interest in the nature versus nurture debate, and he points toward a bevy of academic research to support his findings. As I am wont to do, I accept the premises and conclusions of most academic research with limited skepticism because there is always another view, another study, and another reasonable opinion to suggest a contrarian viewpoint.Although all of the material is interesting, the writing isn't noticeably poignant. Mischel appears to be much more of a researcher than an author. In addition, The Marshmallow Test probably could have been a bit shorter. The main point of the book was made repeatedly and in different contexts. A few stories and a few research studies probably could have been omitted and the results would have been the same. Having said that, Mischel does spare the reader the graphs and charts which usually accompany a book like this. I enjoy looking at those and trying to understand the data at a more granular level, but it wasn't necessary for this book, which is mostly written for the layman. In conclusion, the marshmallow test is a very, very interesting academic study which deserves some attention, especially in the context of public policy, such as education. The debate over nature versus nurture is a fundamental one, and the results from Mischel's work and others contributes in a significant way to the debate. The Marshmallow Test was a nice look behind the curtain of a particular set of academic studies, and you have interest in something like that then this book is worth perusing. Otherwise, it may be a bit of slog.http://thethousanderclub.blogspot.com/"
225,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40311431-samantha-welker,5,"This book was a horrible choice to read at night before going to bed. It was so thought-provoking and full of interesting scientific facts that it got my wheels turning before I was trying to fall asleep. My only complaint about this book was that it did focus a bit too much on children and how to shape and mold their ""hot"" and ""cold"" impulses that manage their levels of self control. If I were a parent, I would find it fascinating, but it did harp on that a bit long for a single gal like me.Some of my favorite tid bits (without giving too much away) from this book were:Contextualized Self-Control: Why do we have self control over somethings, but not others? President Clinton had the self-control and delay ability to win a Rhodes scholarship, attain a Yale law degree and be elected president, but had no ability or willingness to exert self control for junk food and White House interns.The Tired Will: Are there limits to how much self-control and delay of gratification we can exert before will fatigue takes over? This is extremely important to think about in terms of how to self-regulateBorn with it or Worked for it: A recent topic of discussion with my boss, The Marshmallow Test argues that the traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you either have a lot or you don't (or can't do much about it either way) is false. Self control skills, both cognitive and emotional, can be learned, enhanced, and harnessed so that they become automatically activated when you need them. It's the failure to develop these self-control skills, and the lack of goals, values and social support needed to use it constructively that shapes a human being. To summarize, what I got most out of this book was the answer to the question of whether human nature is, at its core, malleable or fixed. Some people see self-control ability, willpower, intelligence and other characteristics as ""fixed"", unchangeable traits from the very start of life. They read the experimental evidence that executive function and self-control improve after educational interventions and interpret that as short-term effects unlikely to make a long-term difference, just little tricks that don't change inborn traits. If we allow the evidence to make a difference in our personal view points of individuals, we are able to understand and learn more about those around us and their actions and the motivation behind them.

226,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20310432-joshua,5,"This is a well-researched book that delves into the phycology and (philosophy to an extent) of the question regarding (Self-)control. The control in question is not just our ability to delay gratification or to quite an addiction, it is the ability of control over our lives. It explores the well-known debate nature vs nurture and what factors determines an individual’s characters. It is splendid and goes beyond self-control to also examine human nature. Very informative and well articulated with great examples."
227,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13082865-snehil,4,"""योगयुक्तो विशुद्धात्मा विजितात्मा जितेन्द्रियः।सर्वभूतात्मभूतात्मा कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते॥७॥""This above is a very small part of a very ancient philosophical song. The first sentence here means that the object of life is to have control over your basic instincts rather than our basic instincts controlling our behavior/life. Th book, "" The Marshmallow test"" is about the relationship between our ability to control our basic instinctive actions (controlled by hot system of the brain, mostly reactionary) and our long term success. I had first learnt about the Marshmallow test in 1990's and had found it pretty impressive. It always remained somewhere in the back of my mind. Only after reading this book, I learnt that the author has dedicated all his research life to explaining the basis of this test. That is exactly what this book explains. It is a fascinating journey and makes a lot of sense.I had an expectation that this book would elaborate on what made a child do better in these tests. The author did spend some time talking about nature and nurture's role but there seemed to be lack of data with regard to this. This is understandable as collection of this data could only be observational studies and not experiments and observational studies come with a lot of confounding variables. So, the author focused more experiments that justified some training techniques to deal with problem behaviors or to help people who would have scored lower on the test. At times, where the data was missing, the author used anecdotal evidence to support his thesis, which wasn't really needed and reduced the credibility of the book. There was a bit of inconsistency with respect to how much the author wanted to share. In certain cases the author would give a gist of the experimental design and then elaborate on the results but at other times he would only give the results without giving any details about the experimental designs and methods, which was disappointing. A couple of times, I found serious confounding in the experiments which made the conclusions pretty dubious.Despite the limitations mentioned above, it still was a sensible book and did give a lot of insight into human behavior. It partly validated the above mentioned philosophy, if at all that philosophy needed validation."
228,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226133-bookworm,3,"Would you wait for the marshmallows? In an experiment that is now well-known, researchers tested the self-control of children that were presented with a treat (marshmallows, Oreos, etc.). The premise was simple. Could they wait 20 minutes or so and therefore get extra treats to eat later? Or did they lack the patience and eat them anyway? Researchers found that this translated to later development: the children who waited (for however long) were more likely to be described as more disciplined in school, have higher SAT scores, have a lower BMI as adults as as having distinctly different brain scans later in life. Working backwards, the researchers also found that this happened with younger children too. Babies and toddlers who could comfort themselves with toys or other distractions when separated from a parent would become marshmallow-waiters. That said, Mischel emphasizes that this is not fate and describes how people who might have initially tested as being more impatient may have found ways of coping, strategies to change, etc. These involve role-playing scenarios, positive thinking, thinking through one's actions to the end result, etc. In part two he gets into more science-y jargon which I found boring. Part 1 (which summarizes most of the findings and walks through the experiments) was very conversational, very interesting. But Part 2 lost me. In Part 3 Mischel then tries to translate the results to larger world settings. How can schools and the educational system help teach children such skills? He clearly shows how slightly older children (8-10 were the ages of the children when Mischel first meets/talks to them) than those in the Marshmallow Experiment (who are around pre-school age) can adapt and change, but it involves their own personal desires plus a little bit of outside help (in this case it's KIPP, or the Knowledge is Power Program). As a child's brain is more malleable than an adults, it's key to get to them early. It was a pleasant read, although as I mentioned it was somewhat uneven in readability. But definitely a good pick up for anyone who has any interest in any of the themes or concepts that this famous ""Marshmallow Experiment"" covers."

I was hoping this book would help me learn better self-control techniques, but it was mostly science-driven.If you are looking for practical guidance to help achieve control techniques, this one might not be for you; however, if you have a scientific interest, then it's a worthwhile read.  My rating: 3 out of 5 marshmallows"
230,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46619134-maria-gonzalez,4," ""The marshmallow test,"" by Walter Mischel, Walter was observing whether the kids were mastering self-control. The marshmallow test was taken place at the Bing Nursery school of Stanford University with children between six months through five years of age. The marshmallow test had sixteen boy participants and sixteen girl participants, each participant was given one marshmallow and explained that if they waited fifteen minutes then they would either get one Oreo cookie, another marshmallow, or a pretzel stick, but if children were to unpatient to wait for fifteen minutes then they would not receive another treat. the researchers of the marshmallow test found out that children who were able to wait for fifteen minutes in order to receive another treat were most likely to get better SAT scores, would have better life outcomes, and a better education. The child's decision to either wait for fifteen minutes or to just give up due to their temptation to eat the delicious marshmallow, it all depended on their age, and background ethnicity.  What I liked about the book was that it explained self-control between children and adults and also because Walter put his observations towards the marshmallow test in a very entertaining hilarious descriptive way. this book was very good due to its long term analysis towards the study it's self, which I also gained more knowledge towards the overall meaning of the marshmallow test especially with the development strategies and the mechanisms of self-control. Another reason why I love the marshmallow book was because my psychology teacher first brought up the marshmallow experiment during my intro to psychology class, which made the class even more interesting. I didn't hate the book because I gained new knowledge from the experiment and because I was also very interested in the experiment ever since my intro to psychology class. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in psychology because it's a very fluffy, easy book to read. "
231,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18980203-charles-eliot,4,"""The Marshmallow Test"" takes its name from psychological studies, beginning in the 1960s and still continuing, which investigated self-control in very young children. The child subject was left alone in a room with a marshmallow, and told that if she didn't touch the marshmallow before the investigator returned, she could have two marshmallows. Kids showed different degrees of ability to resist temptation, and variations of the test probed the coping skills the kids employed. Over time a general framework emerged. We all have what the author, Walter Mischel, calls ""hot"" and ""cold"" responses. Hot responses are rapid, instinctive, urgent and emotional. Cold responses are analytical, objective, slow, and thoughtful. (This lines up almost exactly with Daniel Kahneman's insights in ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"") The key to exerting self-control is to cool down the response to the present, and heat up the response to the future. In other words, making the future gain more tempting than the present temptation. There are plenty of small and helpful tricks for this. One trick is to objectify the present temptation (""imagine the marshmallow with a frame around it and think of it as a picture of a marshmallow, not the real thing"") while drawing attention to the visceral pleasure of the future achievement (""it's going to be so cool to have two marshmallows to eat""). The most important trick of all is the ""if ... then"" trick, where you imagine what you will do if tempted. ""If ... then"" thinking has the effect of immediately derailing your hot response. The important message of The Marshmallow Test is that self-control is not entirely, or even predominantly, innate, but is a learned skill built on the brain's plasticity. The learning starts very early, and can continue throughout life. "
232,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,3,"Expanding upon a fascinating experiment conducted at the Bing Nursery School in Stanford University many decades ago, Walter Mischel expounds on the benefits derived by delaying instant gratification for future success. The famous experiment, now popular as ""The Marshmallow Test"" primarily aimed to put to test the will power of little children who were asked to choose between two alternatives. While under the first option, they could immediately take a candy/sweet/marshmallow (as per their preference) that was kept on a table, they were presented with a second choice under which they could lay claim to grab 2 candies/sweets/marshmallows if they could resist their desires by a mere 20 minutes.A researcher would leave the room with a child sitting alone in front of the table upon which the candies were kept. If the child, having wrestled out by temptation decided to pick the candy, all he/she had to do was ring a bill kept on the table, hearing which the researcher would return to the room and allow the child to take one sweet of his/choice. However if the child was successfully able to resist the allure of the sweet for all of 20 minutes, the researcher would enter the room after the designated time limit and gift the winner any 2 sweets of the victor's choice.This simple experiment shed enormously valuable insights into the workings of the human behaviour and led the way to identifying many improvements that usually go on to embellish the living of a person, a classic example being the ability to stop smoking after being addicted to nicotine for an imperceptibly long period.This books makes essential reading for anyone who is interested in gaining control over the more rustic senses thereby setting a focused path towards progression both in career as well as in life.""The Mashmallow Test"" - A fulfilling and rich after taste!"
233,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4325293-zebulon,5,"Cool and Hot thinking was shown to greatly impact the ability of the children to delay their gratification.  Cool thinking is associated with the pre-frontal area of the brain whereas hot thinking is associated with the amygdala. Amygdala is Latin for almond shaped.Use of the ""strange situation"" test where toddlers are briefly introduced to a stranger and then left with that person with other toys and distractions was a key indicator of whether the child could activate distraction strategies later in the marshmallow testing.Mischel's colleague Carole Dweck at UCLA has two models: incremental growth where a child does not believe that their capacity is limited and ""entity theorists"" that see their capacity as determined at birth.  Mischel asked questions in the 70s of the children to determine their mindsets.Carl Jung famously said that people study what they are not good at.Aversive counter conditioning is a strategy wherein an individual uses a disgusting sensory object to use the hot system to their advantage in dissuading them from pursuing a temptation.  The author used the example of a can of spent cigarette butts where smelling it was absolutely nauseating.ToM is an abbreviation for Theory of mind which is the important mental ability that begins in early childhood allowing us to understand that our beliefs may be false and that the way things appear may not be reality.  Theory of mind helps us to see that other people might no perceive the same scene or event the way that we do.The author also spoke volumes about development of executive function and if-then scenario development that could be used to harness the power of the hot/emotional/reactive system to avoid temptations."

Maybe its because I want to take a fresh perspective on the new year. The Marshmallow Test was a very interesting read. The way the author personalized the scientific data made The Marshmallow Test an easy and compelling read. By testing pre-school children in their ability to resist one marshmallow for a specific amount of time for a reward of two marshmallows the author takes a deeper look at people's hot and cold systems and how they influence self control. The study found that the more stress in a child's early development can impact the development of the cold system that impedes a child's ability resist temptation and increases impulsive decisions. This increased impulsiveness can lead to a more difficult life and poor long term planning. The good news: you can, even as an adult, condition your cold system to cool off your hot system and make better, more informed decisions about your life. By incorporating coping strategies like using ""If, Then"" and thinking about your decisions in a way that brings to life how those decisions will impact your daily life can help you better understand the impact of any potential decisions and help you make better informed decisions.The Marshmallow Test is a good read because it not only explains the scientific studies in an easy to understand way but it also provides real world coping skills that can be used by adults and children alike. If you're going to start your year off with a self-help book make it one that will actually be able to help you and I think The Marshmallow Test is just the book you're looking for.

Any book that talks about the importance of self-control and delayed gratification is going to be good but not popular in todays society of fast food and get rich quick schemes. Walter Mischel talks about his marshmallow test and the different research that has been done since the 1960's in the field of self-control. For those that don't know, the marshmallow test says, if you don't have one marshmallow now you can have two later. Other topics that are discussed are persistence, optimism, thinking about our future self to make wise decisions in the present moment, and helping cool down hot emotions that can lead to destructive impulsive behaviors. I liked the book a lot because it gives useful strategies to curbing undesired appetites and how to prepare for the future. Walter uses data to back up all his information which is always a plus.

Decades passed, a child (one) was born and the idea shelved for so many years came back up again when I read The Marshmallow Test.Fear not, this book is all about the delay of gratification and tenacity/grit in making more successful and determined humans; not at all as ethically challenged as my twenty y.o. diet bifurcated family!This book reminds me what I missed from Psych as an undergrad, and frankly updated many of the psychology paradigms (e.g. solve the root problem / medical model of care) that have been redirected to more behavioral solutions via research in the 20 years since my program. I like the book so much because it pushes against the fatalistic assumptions about genetic limitations to success and rightly advocates means for improving performance on the marshmallow test of life for everyone, provided certain cognitive-behavioral steps are integrated into an examined life.This book should be required reading for public school teachers...And yes, I will be trying out the Marshmallow test on our daughter next year!"

Fortunately, evolution moves very slowly and human nature has changed very little in the last hundred (or thousand for that matter) years, so this advice is compatible with previous research-based parenting books. The one my wife and I used decades ago offers similar advice with reference to different research: Children: The Challenge - now celebrating its golden anniversary, though still readily available in reprint.I can highly recommend Mischel's book for its sound advice and up-to-date review of the current research. The title not withstanding, this book offers a broad survey of current research. If parents want to focus their parenting, either of these boos will provide an excellent basis for the personal style that parents must synthesize to provide a consistent and supportive environment for their children.For more: http://1book42day.blogspot.com/2014/1..."

I have related to it in all aspects of self-help, and a refresher to my psychology knowledge. The only drawback I did, was buying a scientific and a self help book as ebook. It didn't do it justice and it became a tedious read for me.I am happy with the way the author constructed his book, and labeled / went though what each chapter will contain. Albeit the title highlights on self-success, he was mostly focusing on children in the upbringing process and not the adult population or their set of problems, which I appreciate for those becoming parents, but it did not address the adult population entirely. Nonetheless, he had great techniques offered throughout the book that any will be able to take away and apply it in their life. (For example If-Then, keeping a mental dairy to understand your stressors..etc)There were some moments in the book that really hit me. When the the therapist asked his client, whom he felt the world was falling apart, and the therapist just asked ""would you like to?""I would definitely go over it and refresh my memory over the content offered in this book and try to apply it my own life. I was happy with this read."
239,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"The Marshmallow Test by Walter Mischel is an inquiry into the workings of self-control. In a now classic experiment, Dr. Mischel determined that many factors controlled by the Prefrontal Cortex can manifest themselves in children as young as four, perhaps even earlier. The Marshmallow Test itself can only be administered to children of a certain age, or else the child might not understand the instructions.The Test itself is ingenious and quite simple; offer the child a treat of some kind, it doesn’t have to be a marshmallow and tell the child that if they wait for around ten minutes they can have two marshmallows instead of one. Surprisingly, it was found that this determines a great many things later on in life. Self-control and willpower are instrumental in deciding SAT scores, whether or not the person will get in trouble, and whether the person will participate in risky behaviors or not.In the 1960s it wasn’t thought to be the case, but willpower can be strengthened like any muscle. The key is to think of willpower as something that is determined by effort and not by birth. Countless studies starting with this one have shown this to be the case. Thus, this book was fascinating."
240,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8012677-tessa,3,"Very repetitive at times, but not a useless read. It was interesting, but I knew some of the studies from other books so it wasn't very new for me either. Some might enjoy it more."
241,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"Reading The Marshmallow Test is rewarding. The book is not perfect, but it is thought-provoking. First, about the experiment. The big hype about the Marshmallow Test centers around the correlation between childhood self-control and lifetime achievements. But when Mischel first designed the experiment, he focused on something else: how various conditions affect self-control. I find the devised experimental conditions intriguing. For example, Mischel found children's waiting time doubled when they are suggested to think about the marshmallow's ""cool"" aspect (its shape and puffiness) instead of its ""hot"" aspect (its taste). In another test condition, prompting children to recall a bitter experience makes them reach for candies almost immediately. But to my disappointment, Mischel did not talk about the sample size of the follow-up studies. He also skipped mentioning he did not control for the social-economic status of the kids in finding the correlation between waiting time and achievement. (A replication study found such correlation was reduced by 2/3 after controlling family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment.) He offered only limited arguments against critiques of his studies. As a result, questions kept emerging as I read his book. Apart from self-control, does longer waiting time reflects other qualities, such as stronger short-term memory, or higher ability to internalize social norms? If so, did those qualities instead of self-control make the willing-to-wait kids score higher in SAT? I understand I was reading a general audience book instead of a literature review. But still. I also wish Mischel could have combed through concepts more carefully. At one point in the book, he starts to talk about ""executive function"" as an interchangeable term of self-control. But is it? What are the differences and relationships between self control, impulse control, gratification delay, conscientiousness, and executive function? Which of them is the marshmallow test measuring? Intuitively, I understand what self-control means. But I still wish to take a look under its hood. Complaints apart, I find many discussions about self-control by Mischel intriguing. For example, he listed experiment evidence to argue that the ""cross-situational consistency of personality"" is an illusion. Instead, he claims that we each have a ""behavioral signature""—what we predictably do if particular situational triggers occur. The takeaway is that one should not label oneself as having great or little self-control. Instead, one should try to identify the exact hot spots that trigger impulsive reactions and make ""If-Then"" implementation plans ahead of time. By the same logic, Mischel argues that when we need to deal with behavior problems, it is often enough just to treat the ""symptom"" without digging deep into underlying causes such as early childhood traumas, of which the individual was unconscious. It is also interesting to know Mischel does not believe in ""ego depletion"". He claimed that students who were depleted in the experiments simply do not have enough motivation to comply with the experimenters' unrelenting demands for them to do boring tasks. He cited studies that show when students were primed to believe perseverance on tough tasks is energizing rather than depleting, they do not suffer from will fatigue. Mischel does not teach step-to-step tips like authors of self-help books. But I did learn useful principles and tricks. Other than ""identifying behavioral signatures"" which I mentioned above, I also learned it's helpful to resist temptation if one could change the mental presentation of the temptation. One could also create a psychological distance to a situation by imagining how someone else would behave. The fundamental principle Mischel summarized is simple but powerful: cool the ""now"", heat the ""later."" It is easy to note the first half of the principle, but I did not think of the second: to take the future into account, it helps to make it vivid. Bottom line: even though I am not fully convinced of many conclusions by the author, I think he poses interesting questions. Stray observations:• Mischel decided to follow up with the kids after he noticed a pattern in his daughters' suppertime discussion about them. His three daughters knew the experiment subjects personally because they were of similar ages and attended the same school as them. In fact, his daughters all participated in the experiment themselves. I wonder how long they have waited for the marshmallow…• Even though he has written a textbook about personality, Mischel claims that as he takes the limitation of commonly used personality tests seriously, he has resolved never to create one himself.

There wasn't completely new factual information for me but some interesting angles and terms used for improving self-control (distractions, concentrating on the future).“the ability to delay immediate gratification for the sake of future consequences is an acquirable cognitive skill.” Our self-control depends on two systems that are functioning in our body: one that instantly reacts to our environment (HOT), and one that controls our behavior (COOL).We choose the situations in which we exercise our self-control (not consistent across the board). Our self-control skills start developing when we’re very young, and they continue to be determined by our environment as we get older. This continuous development process means our ability to control ourselves is fluid. Anyone can improve his or her skills by focusing on the future and strategically using distractions.*The part of our brain that regulates self-control develops as we grow.*Our environment shapes our self-control abilities. *How much self-control we have depends on the context, but it is ultimately unlimited.*The result of a child's performance in the Marshmallow Test correlates with their self-control as an adult.*Children should be taught that they're capable of making their own decisions and that those decisions have consequences. *You can improve your self-control skills by concentrating on the future and putting distance between you and your temptation.

I picked up this book because I was attracted to the title “the marshmallow test” At first I didn’t expect that content would be about human behaviour, but then seeing that it was about the understanding of self control so I found it’s even more interesting. Self-control is one of everyone’s weakness, I believe. So how can we control ourselves? This book gave us a very clear picture of it in easy way, I mean not academically. The experiment on children about delaying of gratification blown my mind. For those who are keen to know about how we think and act and really want to be a better human!

There were interesting pieces of information, and cool case studies, but in my opinion it was far too long. Main points from the book:1. Some people are better than others to resist temptation and regulate painful emotions 2. These differences become visible as early as preschool age, and can predict outcomes over course of life 3. The traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you have or don’t have a lot of is false.. self control can be learned, improved, enhanced.. 4. We don’t have to be the victims of our social and biological histories 5. Self control involves strategies and insight, goals and motivation The most helpful advice I came away with is that we have more control over our environment and even genetics than we think we do. The “I think I can” idea is very powerful, and plays a huge part in our lives."

Some good observations are made, and the book may be useful source material. The audio book was read by Alan Alda.This got a pretty favorable review when released; I added it to my to-read list immediately. Walter Mischel devised the original study, and his anecdotes are a good addition. He also reports on related studies and derivatives. Asked frequently about this study, he emphasizes that correlation is not causation.He also leans into self-help, suggesting action for parents, teachers, and selves. While there are some good observations here, they can be lost in a sea of discussions of nature and nurture. At times the psychological study descriptions can also be quite dry. 2½ stars."

I'm sure I'll be returning to these pages as they contain a plethora of insights related to the very concise topic of self-control, many of which are essential to understanding the actions of ourselves and others.

254,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20880982-thethousanderclub,3,"I first heard about the marshmallow test in 2010 while listening Dieter F. Uchtdorf's conference address titled Continue in Patience. I thought the concept was fascinating at the time, and over the years I have stumbled across various accounts of the tests and their impact on the academic community, as well as public policy debates. The Marshmallow Test, written by Walter Mischel, is a deeper dive into the origins of the famous study and the subsequent academic work which has been done to confirm and challenge its findings.The reader will immediately notice how the marshmallow test and its findings are far more nuanced than how its often reported in the media. It's not that the findings are incorrect or distorted, it's that the story is so much richer and more complex than a headline. I found this to be the most intriguing and valuable aspect of The Marshmallow Test. I love taking a deeper dive into assumptions. When it comes to human nature and human behavior generally, there are a lot of assumptions and even intellectual biases. Mischel takes a special interest in the nature versus nurture debate, and he points toward a bevy of academic research to support his findings. As I am wont to do, I accept the premises and conclusions of most academic research with limited skepticism because there is always another view, another study, and another reasonable opinion to suggest a contrarian viewpoint.Although all of the material is interesting, the writing isn't noticeably poignant. Mischel appears to be much more of a researcher than an author. In addition, The Marshmallow Test probably could have been a bit shorter. The main point of the book was made repeatedly and in different contexts. A few stories and a few research studies probably could have been omitted and the results would have been the same. Having said that, Mischel does spare the reader the graphs and charts which usually accompany a book like this. I enjoy looking at those and trying to understand the data at a more granular level, but it wasn't necessary for this book, which is mostly written for the layman. In conclusion, the marshmallow test is a very, very interesting academic study which deserves some attention, especially in the context of public policy, such as education. The debate over nature versus nurture is a fundamental one, and the results from Mischel's work and others contributes in a significant way to the debate. The Marshmallow Test was a nice look behind the curtain of a particular set of academic studies, and you have interest in something like that then this book is worth perusing. Otherwise, it may be a bit of slog.http://thethousanderclub.blogspot.com/"
255,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40311431-samantha-welker,5,"This book was a horrible choice to read at night before going to bed. It was so thought-provoking and full of interesting scientific facts that it got my wheels turning before I was trying to fall asleep. My only complaint about this book was that it did focus a bit too much on children and how to shape and mold their ""hot"" and ""cold"" impulses that manage their levels of self control. If I were a parent, I would find it fascinating, but it did harp on that a bit long for a single gal like me.Some of my favorite tid bits (without giving too much away) from this book were:Contextualized Self-Control: Why do we have self control over somethings, but not others? President Clinton had the self-control and delay ability to win a Rhodes scholarship, attain a Yale law degree and be elected president, but had no ability or willingness to exert self control for junk food and White House interns.The Tired Will: Are there limits to how much self-control and delay of gratification we can exert before will fatigue takes over? This is extremely important to think about in terms of how to self-regulateBorn with it or Worked for it: A recent topic of discussion with my boss, The Marshmallow Test argues that the traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you either have a lot or you don't (or can't do much about it either way) is false. Self control skills, both cognitive and emotional, can be learned, enhanced, and harnessed so that they become automatically activated when you need them. It's the failure to develop these self-control skills, and the lack of goals, values and social support needed to use it constructively that shapes a human being. To summarize, what I got most out of this book was the answer to the question of whether human nature is, at its core, malleable or fixed. Some people see self-control ability, willpower, intelligence and other characteristics as ""fixed"", unchangeable traits from the very start of life. They read the experimental evidence that executive function and self-control improve after educational interventions and interpret that as short-term effects unlikely to make a long-term difference, just little tricks that don't change inborn traits. If we allow the evidence to make a difference in our personal view points of individuals, we are able to understand and learn more about those around us and their actions and the motivation behind them.

256,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20310432-joshua,5,"This is a well-researched book that delves into the phycology and (philosophy to an extent) of the question regarding (Self-)control. The control in question is not just our ability to delay gratification or to quite an addiction, it is the ability of control over our lives. It explores the well-known debate nature vs nurture and what factors determines an individual’s characters. It is splendid and goes beyond self-control to also examine human nature. Very informative and well articulated with great examples."
257,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13082865-snehil,4,"""योगयुक्तो विशुद्धात्मा विजितात्मा जितेन्द्रियः।सर्वभूतात्मभूतात्मा कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते॥७॥""This above is a very small part of a very ancient philosophical song. The first sentence here means that the object of life is to have control over your basic instincts rather than our basic instincts controlling our behavior/life. Th book, "" The Marshmallow test"" is about the relationship between our ability to control our basic instinctive actions (controlled by hot system of the brain, mostly reactionary) and our long term success. I had first learnt about the Marshmallow test in 1990's and had found it pretty impressive. It always remained somewhere in the back of my mind. Only after reading this book, I learnt that the author has dedicated all his research life to explaining the basis of this test. That is exactly what this book explains. It is a fascinating journey and makes a lot of sense.I had an expectation that this book would elaborate on what made a child do better in these tests. The author did spend some time talking about nature and nurture's role but there seemed to be lack of data with regard to this. This is understandable as collection of this data could only be observational studies and not experiments and observational studies come with a lot of confounding variables. So, the author focused more experiments that justified some training techniques to deal with problem behaviors or to help people who would have scored lower on the test. At times, where the data was missing, the author used anecdotal evidence to support his thesis, which wasn't really needed and reduced the credibility of the book. There was a bit of inconsistency with respect to how much the author wanted to share. In certain cases the author would give a gist of the experimental design and then elaborate on the results but at other times he would only give the results without giving any details about the experimental designs and methods, which was disappointing. A couple of times, I found serious confounding in the experiments which made the conclusions pretty dubious.Despite the limitations mentioned above, it still was a sensible book and did give a lot of insight into human behavior. It partly validated the above mentioned philosophy, if at all that philosophy needed validation."
258,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226133-bookworm,3,"Would you wait for the marshmallows? In an experiment that is now well-known, researchers tested the self-control of children that were presented with a treat (marshmallows, Oreos, etc.). The premise was simple. Could they wait 20 minutes or so and therefore get extra treats to eat later? Or did they lack the patience and eat them anyway? Researchers found that this translated to later development: the children who waited (for however long) were more likely to be described as more disciplined in school, have higher SAT scores, have a lower BMI as adults as as having distinctly different brain scans later in life. Working backwards, the researchers also found that this happened with younger children too. Babies and toddlers who could comfort themselves with toys or other distractions when separated from a parent would become marshmallow-waiters. That said, Mischel emphasizes that this is not fate and describes how people who might have initially tested as being more impatient may have found ways of coping, strategies to change, etc. These involve role-playing scenarios, positive thinking, thinking through one's actions to the end result, etc. In part two he gets into more science-y jargon which I found boring. Part 1 (which summarizes most of the findings and walks through the experiments) was very conversational, very interesting. But Part 2 lost me. In Part 3 Mischel then tries to translate the results to larger world settings. How can schools and the educational system help teach children such skills? He clearly shows how slightly older children (8-10 were the ages of the children when Mischel first meets/talks to them) than those in the Marshmallow Experiment (who are around pre-school age) can adapt and change, but it involves their own personal desires plus a little bit of outside help (in this case it's KIPP, or the Knowledge is Power Program). As a child's brain is more malleable than an adults, it's key to get to them early. It was a pleasant read, although as I mentioned it was somewhat uneven in readability. But definitely a good pick up for anyone who has any interest in any of the themes or concepts that this famous ""Marshmallow Experiment"" covers."

I was hoping this book would help me learn better self-control techniques, but it was mostly science-driven.If you are looking for practical guidance to help achieve control techniques, this one might not be for you; however, if you have a scientific interest, then it's a worthwhile read.  My rating: 3 out of 5 marshmallows"
260,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46619134-maria-gonzalez,4," ""The marshmallow test,"" by Walter Mischel, Walter was observing whether the kids were mastering self-control. The marshmallow test was taken place at the Bing Nursery school of Stanford University with children between six months through five years of age. The marshmallow test had sixteen boy participants and sixteen girl participants, each participant was given one marshmallow and explained that if they waited fifteen minutes then they would either get one Oreo cookie, another marshmallow, or a pretzel stick, but if children were to unpatient to wait for fifteen minutes then they would not receive another treat. the researchers of the marshmallow test found out that children who were able to wait for fifteen minutes in order to receive another treat were most likely to get better SAT scores, would have better life outcomes, and a better education. The child's decision to either wait for fifteen minutes or to just give up due to their temptation to eat the delicious marshmallow, it all depended on their age, and background ethnicity.  What I liked about the book was that it explained self-control between children and adults and also because Walter put his observations towards the marshmallow test in a very entertaining hilarious descriptive way. this book was very good due to its long term analysis towards the study it's self, which I also gained more knowledge towards the overall meaning of the marshmallow test especially with the development strategies and the mechanisms of self-control. Another reason why I love the marshmallow book was because my psychology teacher first brought up the marshmallow experiment during my intro to psychology class, which made the class even more interesting. I didn't hate the book because I gained new knowledge from the experiment and because I was also very interested in the experiment ever since my intro to psychology class. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in psychology because it's a very fluffy, easy book to read. "
261,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18980203-charles-eliot,4,"""The Marshmallow Test"" takes its name from psychological studies, beginning in the 1960s and still continuing, which investigated self-control in very young children. The child subject was left alone in a room with a marshmallow, and told that if she didn't touch the marshmallow before the investigator returned, she could have two marshmallows. Kids showed different degrees of ability to resist temptation, and variations of the test probed the coping skills the kids employed. Over time a general framework emerged. We all have what the author, Walter Mischel, calls ""hot"" and ""cold"" responses. Hot responses are rapid, instinctive, urgent and emotional. Cold responses are analytical, objective, slow, and thoughtful. (This lines up almost exactly with Daniel Kahneman's insights in ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"") The key to exerting self-control is to cool down the response to the present, and heat up the response to the future. In other words, making the future gain more tempting than the present temptation. There are plenty of small and helpful tricks for this. One trick is to objectify the present temptation (""imagine the marshmallow with a frame around it and think of it as a picture of a marshmallow, not the real thing"") while drawing attention to the visceral pleasure of the future achievement (""it's going to be so cool to have two marshmallows to eat""). The most important trick of all is the ""if ... then"" trick, where you imagine what you will do if tempted. ""If ... then"" thinking has the effect of immediately derailing your hot response. The important message of The Marshmallow Test is that self-control is not entirely, or even predominantly, innate, but is a learned skill built on the brain's plasticity. The learning starts very early, and can continue throughout life. "
262,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,3,"Expanding upon a fascinating experiment conducted at the Bing Nursery School in Stanford University many decades ago, Walter Mischel expounds on the benefits derived by delaying instant gratification for future success. The famous experiment, now popular as ""The Marshmallow Test"" primarily aimed to put to test the will power of little children who were asked to choose between two alternatives. While under the first option, they could immediately take a candy/sweet/marshmallow (as per their preference) that was kept on a table, they were presented with a second choice under which they could lay claim to grab 2 candies/sweets/marshmallows if they could resist their desires by a mere 20 minutes.A researcher would leave the room with a child sitting alone in front of the table upon which the candies were kept. If the child, having wrestled out by temptation decided to pick the candy, all he/she had to do was ring a bill kept on the table, hearing which the researcher would return to the room and allow the child to take one sweet of his/choice. However if the child was successfully able to resist the allure of the sweet for all of 20 minutes, the researcher would enter the room after the designated time limit and gift the winner any 2 sweets of the victor's choice.This simple experiment shed enormously valuable insights into the workings of the human behaviour and led the way to identifying many improvements that usually go on to embellish the living of a person, a classic example being the ability to stop smoking after being addicted to nicotine for an imperceptibly long period.This books makes essential reading for anyone who is interested in gaining control over the more rustic senses thereby setting a focused path towards progression both in career as well as in life.""The Mashmallow Test"" - A fulfilling and rich after taste!"

Amygdala is Latin for almond shaped.Use of the ""strange situation"" test where toddlers are briefly introduced to a stranger and then left with that person with other toys and distractions was a key indicator of whether the child could activate distraction strategies later in the marshmallow testing.Mischel's colleague Carole Dweck at UCLA has two models: incremental growth where a child does not believe that their capacity is limited and ""entity theorists"" that see their capacity as determined at birth.  Mischel asked questions in the 70s of the children to determine their mindsets.Carl Jung famously said that people study what they are not good at.Aversive counter conditioning is a strategy wherein an individual uses a disgusting sensory object to use the hot system to their advantage in dissuading them from pursuing a temptation.  The author used the example of a can of spent cigarette butts where smelling it was absolutely nauseating.ToM is an abbreviation for Theory of mind which is the important mental ability that begins in early childhood allowing us to understand that our beliefs may be false and that the way things appear may not be reality.  Theory of mind helps us to see that other people might no perceive the same scene or event the way that we do.The author also spoke volumes about development of executive function and if-then scenario development that could be used to harness the power of the hot/emotional/reactive system to avoid temptations."

Maybe its because I want to take a fresh perspective on the new year. The Marshmallow Test was a very interesting read. The way the author personalized the scientific data made The Marshmallow Test an easy and compelling read. By testing pre-school children in their ability to resist one marshmallow for a specific amount of time for a reward of two marshmallows the author takes a deeper look at people's hot and cold systems and how they influence self control. The study found that the more stress in a child's early development can impact the development of the cold system that impedes a child's ability resist temptation and increases impulsive decisions. This increased impulsiveness can lead to a more difficult life and poor long term planning. The good news: you can, even as an adult, condition your cold system to cool off your hot system and make better, more informed decisions about your life. By incorporating coping strategies like using ""If, Then"" and thinking about your decisions in a way that brings to life how those decisions will impact your daily life can help you better understand the impact of any potential decisions and help you make better informed decisions.The Marshmallow Test is a good read because it not only explains the scientific studies in an easy to understand way but it also provides real world coping skills that can be used by adults and children alike. If you're going to start your year off with a self-help book make it one that will actually be able to help you and I think The Marshmallow Test is just the book you're looking for. Pick up The Marshmallow Test you won't be disappointed. "

Any book that talks about the importance of self-control and delayed gratification is going to be good but not popular in todays society of fast food and get rich quick schemes. Walter Mischel talks about his marshmallow test and the different research that has been done since the 1960's in the field of self-control. For those that don't know, the marshmallow test says, if you don't have one marshmallow now you can have two later. Other topics that are discussed are persistence, optimism, thinking about our future self to make wise decisions in the present moment, and helping cool down hot emotions that can lead to destructive impulsive behaviors. I liked the book a lot because it gives useful strategies to curbing undesired appetites and how to prepare for the future. Walter uses data to back up all his information which is always a plus. He is a highly recognized and praised professor in the field of psychology and after reading this book I can see why. I hardly write reviews but thought I should exercise some self-control and write one for ""The Marshmallow Test."" Buy this book and you won't regret it! "

Fortunately, evolution moves very slowly and human nature has changed very little in the last hundred (or thousand for that matter) years, so this advice is compatible with previous research-based parenting books. The one my wife and I used decades ago offers similar advice with reference to different research: Children: The Challenge - now celebrating its golden anniversary, though still readily available in reprint.I can highly recommend Mischel's book for its sound advice and up-to-date review of the current research.

I have related to it in all aspects of self-help, and a refresher to my psychology knowledge. The only drawback I did, was buying a scientific and a self help book as ebook. It didn't do it justice and it became a tedious read for me.I am happy with the way the author constructed his book, and labeled / went though what each chapter will contain. Albeit the title highlights on self-success, he was mostly focusing on children in the upbringing process and not the adult population or their set of problems, which I appreciate for those becoming parents, but it did not address the adult population entirely. Nonetheless, he had great techniques offered throughout the book that any will be able to take away and apply it in their life. (For example If-Then, keeping a mental dairy to understand your stressors..etc)There were some moments in the book that really hit me. When the the therapist asked his client, whom he felt the world was falling apart, and the therapist just asked ""would you like to?""I would definitely go over it and refresh my memory over the content offered in this book and try to apply it my own life.

269,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"The Marshmallow Test by Walter Mischel is an inquiry into the workings of self-control. In a now classic experiment, Dr. Mischel determined that many factors controlled by the Prefrontal Cortex can manifest themselves in children as young as four, perhaps even earlier. The Marshmallow Test itself can only be administered to children of a certain age, or else the child might not understand the instructions.The Test itself is ingenious and quite simple; offer the child a treat of some kind, it doesn’t have to be a marshmallow and tell the child that if they wait for around ten minutes they can have two marshmallows instead of one. Surprisingly, it was found that this determines a great many things later on in life. Self-control and willpower are instrumental in deciding SAT scores, whether or not the person will get in trouble, and whether the person will participate in risky behaviors or not.In the 1960s it wasn’t thought to be the case, but willpower can be strengthened like any muscle. The key is to think of willpower as something that is determined by effort and not by birth. Countless studies starting with this one have shown this to be the case. Thus, this book was fascinating."

271,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"Reading The Marshmallow Test is rewarding. The book is not perfect, but it is thought-provoking. First, about the experiment. The big hype about the Marshmallow Test centers around the correlation between childhood self-control and lifetime achievements. But when Mischel first designed the experiment, he focused on something else: how various conditions affect self-control. I find the devised experimental conditions intriguing. For example, Mischel found children's waiting time doubled when they are suggested to think about the marshmallow's ""cool"" aspect (its shape and puffiness) instead of its ""hot"" aspect (its taste). In another test condition, prompting children to recall a bitter experience makes them reach for candies almost immediately. But to my disappointment, Mischel did not talk about the sample size of the follow-up studies. He also skipped mentioning he did not control for the social-economic status of the kids in finding the correlation between waiting time and achievement. (A replication study found such correlation was reduced by 2/3 after controlling family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment.) He offered only limited arguments against critiques of his studies. As a result, questions kept emerging as I read his book. Apart from self-control, does longer waiting time reflects other qualities, such as stronger short-term memory, or higher ability to internalize social norms? If so, did those qualities instead of self-control make the willing-to-wait kids score higher in SAT? I understand I was reading a general audience book instead of a literature review. But still. I also wish Mischel could have combed through concepts more carefully. At one point in the book, he starts to talk about ""executive function"" as an interchangeable term of self-control. But is it? What are the differences and relationships between self control, impulse control, gratification delay, conscientiousness, and executive function? Which of them is the marshmallow test measuring? Intuitively, I understand what self-control means. But I still wish to take a look under its hood. Complaints apart, I find many discussions about self-control by Mischel intriguing. For example, he listed experiment evidence to argue that the ""cross-situational consistency of personality"" is an illusion. Instead, he claims that we each have a ""behavioral signature""—what we predictably do if particular situational triggers occur. The takeaway is that one should not label oneself as having great or little self-control. Instead, one should try to identify the exact hot spots that trigger impulsive reactions and make ""If-Then"" implementation plans ahead of time. By the same logic, Mischel argues that when we need to deal with behavior problems, it is often enough just to treat the ""symptom"" without digging deep into underlying causes such as early childhood traumas, of which the individual was unconscious. It is also interesting to know Mischel does not believe in ""ego depletion"". He claimed that students who were depleted in the experiments simply do not have enough motivation to comply with the experimenters' unrelenting demands for them to do boring tasks. He cited studies that show when students were primed to believe perseverance on tough tasks is energizing rather than depleting, they do not suffer from will fatigue. Mischel does not teach step-to-step tips like authors of self-help books. But I did learn useful principles and tricks. Other than ""identifying behavioral signatures"" which I mentioned above, I also learned it's helpful to resist temptation if one could change the mental presentation of the temptation. One could also create a psychological distance to a situation by imagining how someone else would behave. The fundamental principle Mischel summarized is simple but powerful: cool the ""now"", heat the ""later."" It is easy to note the first half of the principle, but I did not think of the second: to take the future into account, it helps to make it vivid. Bottom line: even though I am not fully convinced of many conclusions by the author, I think he poses interesting questions. Stray observations:• Mischel decided to follow up with the kids after he noticed a pattern in his daughters' suppertime discussion about them. His three daughters knew the experiment subjects personally because they were of similar ages and attended the same school as them. In fact, his daughters all participated in the experiment themselves. I wonder how long they have waited for the marshmallow…• Even though he has written a textbook about personality, Mischel claims that as he takes the limitation of commonly used personality tests seriously, he has resolved never to create one himself.

There wasn't completely new factual information for me but some interesting angles and terms used for improving self-control (distractions, concentrating on the future).“the ability to delay immediate gratification for the sake of future consequences is an acquirable cognitive skill.” Our self-control depends on two systems that are functioning in our body: one that instantly reacts to our environment (HOT), and one that controls our behavior (COOL).We choose the situations in which we exercise our self-control (not consistent across the board). Our self-control skills start developing when we’re very young, and they continue to be determined by our environment as we get older. This continuous development process means our ability to control ourselves is fluid. Anyone can improve his or her skills by focusing on the future and strategically using distractions.*The part of our brain that regulates self-control develops as we grow.*Our environment shapes our self-control abilities. *How much self-control we have depends on the context, but it is ultimately unlimited.*The result of a child's performance in the Marshmallow Test correlates with their self-control as an adult.*Children should be taught that they're capable of making their own decisions and that those decisions have consequences. *You can improve your self-control skills by concentrating on the future and putting distance between you and your temptation.

Self-control is one of everyone’s weakness, I believe. So how can we control ourselves? This book gave us a very clear picture of it in easy way, I mean not academically. The experiment on children about delaying of gratification blown my mind. For those who are keen to know about how we think and act and really want to be a better human!

There were interesting pieces of information, and cool case studies, but in my opinion it was far too long. Main points from the book:1. Some people are better than others to resist temptation and regulate painful emotions 2. These differences become visible as early as preschool age, and can predict outcomes over course of life 3. The traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you have or don’t have a lot of is false.. self control can be learned, improved, enhanced.. 4. We don’t have to be the victims of our social and biological histories 5. Self control involves strategies and insight, goals and motivation The most helpful advice I came away with is that we have more control over our environment and even genetics than we think we do. The “I think I can” idea is very powerful, and plays a huge part in our lives."

Walter Mischel devised the original study, and his anecdotes are a good addition. He also reports on related studies and derivatives. Asked frequently about this study, he emphasizes that correlation is not causation.He also leans into self-help, suggesting action for parents, teachers, and selves.

I'm sure I'll be returning to these pages as they contain a plethora of insights related to the very concise topic of self-control, many of which are essential to understanding the actions of ourselves and others.

284,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20880982-thethousanderclub,3,"I first heard about the marshmallow test in 2010 while listening Dieter F. Uchtdorf's conference address titled Continue in Patience. I thought the concept was fascinating at the time, and over the years I have stumbled across various accounts of the tests and their impact on the academic community, as well as public policy debates. The Marshmallow Test, written by Walter Mischel, is a deeper dive into the origins of the famous study and the subsequent academic work which has been done to confirm and challenge its findings.The reader will immediately notice how the marshmallow test and its findings are far more nuanced than how its often reported in the media. It's not that the findings are incorrect or distorted, it's that the story is so much richer and more complex than a headline. I found this to be the most intriguing and valuable aspect of The Marshmallow Test. I love taking a deeper dive into assumptions. When it comes to human nature and human behavior generally, there are a lot of assumptions and even intellectual biases. Mischel takes a special interest in the nature versus nurture debate, and he points toward a bevy of academic research to support his findings. As I am wont to do, I accept the premises and conclusions of most academic research with limited skepticism because there is always another view, another study, and another reasonable opinion to suggest a contrarian viewpoint.Although all of the material is interesting, the writing isn't noticeably poignant. Mischel appears to be much more of a researcher than an author. In addition, The Marshmallow Test probably could have been a bit shorter. The main point of the book was made repeatedly and in different contexts. A few stories and a few research studies probably could have been omitted and the results would have been the same. Having said that, Mischel does spare the reader the graphs and charts which usually accompany a book like this. I enjoy looking at those and trying to understand the data at a more granular level, but it wasn't necessary for this book, which is mostly written for the layman. In conclusion, the marshmallow test is a very, very interesting academic study which deserves some attention, especially in the context of public policy, such as education. The debate over nature versus nurture is a fundamental one, and the results from Mischel's work and others contributes in a significant way to the debate. The Marshmallow Test was a nice look behind the curtain of a particular set of academic studies, and you have interest in something like that then this book is worth perusing. Otherwise, it may be a bit of slog.http://thethousanderclub.blogspot.com/"
285,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40311431-samantha-welker,5,"This book was a horrible choice to read at night before going to bed. It was so thought-provoking and full of interesting scientific facts that it got my wheels turning before I was trying to fall asleep. My only complaint about this book was that it did focus a bit too much on children and how to shape and mold their ""hot"" and ""cold"" impulses that manage their levels of self control. If I were a parent, I would find it fascinating, but it did harp on that a bit long for a single gal like me.Some of my favorite tid bits (without giving too much away) from this book were:Contextualized Self-Control: Why do we have self control over somethings, but not others? President Clinton had the self-control and delay ability to win a Rhodes scholarship, attain a Yale law degree and be elected president, but had no ability or willingness to exert self control for junk food and White House interns.The Tired Will: Are there limits to how much self-control and delay of gratification we can exert before will fatigue takes over? This is extremely important to think about in terms of how to self-regulateBorn with it or Worked for it: A recent topic of discussion with my boss, The Marshmallow Test argues that the traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you either have a lot or you don't (or can't do much about it either way) is false. Self control skills, both cognitive and emotional, can be learned, enhanced, and harnessed so that they become automatically activated when you need them. It's the failure to develop these self-control skills, and the lack of goals, values and social support needed to use it constructively that shapes a human being. To summarize, what I got most out of this book was the answer to the question of whether human nature is, at its core, malleable or fixed. Some people see self-control ability, willpower, intelligence and other characteristics as ""fixed"", unchangeable traits from the very start of life. They read the experimental evidence that executive function and self-control improve after educational interventions and interpret that as short-term effects unlikely to make a long-term difference, just little tricks that don't change inborn traits. If we allow the evidence to make a difference in our personal view points of individuals, we are able to understand and learn more about those around us and their actions and the motivation behind them.

The control in question is not just our ability to delay gratification or to quite an addiction, it is the ability of control over our lives. It explores the well-known debate nature vs nurture and what factors determines an individual’s characters. It is splendid and goes beyond self-control to also examine human nature. Very informative and well articulated with great examples."
287,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13082865-snehil,4,"""योगयुक्तो विशुद्धात्मा विजितात्मा जितेन्द्रियः।सर्वभूतात्मभूतात्मा कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते॥७॥""This above is a very small part of a very ancient philosophical song. The first sentence here means that the object of life is to have control over your basic instincts rather than our basic instincts controlling our behavior/life. Th book, "" The Marshmallow test"" is about the relationship between our ability to control our basic instinctive actions (controlled by hot system of the brain, mostly reactionary) and our long term success. I had first learnt about the Marshmallow test in 1990's and had found it pretty impressive. It always remained somewhere in the back of my mind. Only after reading this book, I learnt that the author has dedicated all his research life to explaining the basis of this test. That is exactly what this book explains. It is a fascinating journey and makes a lot of sense.I had an expectation that this book would elaborate on what made a child do better in these tests. The author did spend some time talking about nature and nurture's role but there seemed to be lack of data with regard to this. This is understandable as collection of this data could only be observational studies and not experiments and observational studies come with a lot of confounding variables. So, the author focused more experiments that justified some training techniques to deal with problem behaviors or to help people who would have scored lower on the test. At times, where the data was missing, the author used anecdotal evidence to support his thesis, which wasn't really needed and reduced the credibility of the book. There was a bit of inconsistency with respect to how much the author wanted to share. In certain cases the author would give a gist of the experimental design and then elaborate on the results but at other times he would only give the results without giving any details about the experimental designs and methods, which was disappointing. A couple of times, I found serious confounding in the experiments which made the conclusions pretty dubious.Despite the limitations mentioned above, it still was a sensible book and did give a lot of insight into human behavior. It partly validated the above mentioned philosophy, if at all that philosophy needed validation."
288,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/226133-bookworm,3,"Would you wait for the marshmallows? In an experiment that is now well-known, researchers tested the self-control of children that were presented with a treat (marshmallows, Oreos, etc.). The premise was simple. Could they wait 20 minutes or so and therefore get extra treats to eat later? Or did they lack the patience and eat them anyway? Researchers found that this translated to later development: the children who waited (for however long) were more likely to be described as more disciplined in school, have higher SAT scores, have a lower BMI as adults as as having distinctly different brain scans later in life. Working backwards, the researchers also found that this happened with younger children too. Babies and toddlers who could comfort themselves with toys or other distractions when separated from a parent would become marshmallow-waiters. That said, Mischel emphasizes that this is not fate and describes how people who might have initially tested as being more impatient may have found ways of coping, strategies to change, etc. These involve role-playing scenarios, positive thinking, thinking through one's actions to the end result, etc. In part two he gets into more science-y jargon which I found boring. Part 1 (which summarizes most of the findings and walks through the experiments) was very conversational, very interesting. But Part 2 lost me. In Part 3 Mischel then tries to translate the results to larger world settings. How can schools and the educational system help teach children such skills? He clearly shows how slightly older children (8-10 were the ages of the children when Mischel first meets/talks to them) than those in the Marshmallow Experiment (who are around pre-school age) can adapt and change, but it involves their own personal desires plus a little bit of outside help (in this case it's KIPP, or the Knowledge is Power Program). As a child's brain is more malleable than an adults, it's key to get to them early. It was a pleasant read, although as I mentioned it was somewhat uneven in readability. But definitely a good pick up for anyone who has any interest in any of the themes or concepts that this famous ""Marshmallow Experiment"" covers."

I was hoping this book would help me learn better self-control techniques, but it was mostly science-driven.If you are looking for practical guidance to help achieve control techniques, this one might not be for you; however, if you have a scientific interest, then it's a worthwhile read.  My rating: 3 out of 5 marshmallows"
290,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46619134-maria-gonzalez,4," ""The marshmallow test,"" by Walter Mischel, Walter was observing whether the kids were mastering self-control. The marshmallow test was taken place at the Bing Nursery school of Stanford University with children between six months through five years of age. The marshmallow test had sixteen boy participants and sixteen girl participants, each participant was given one marshmallow and explained that if they waited fifteen minutes then they would either get one Oreo cookie, another marshmallow, or a pretzel stick, but if children were to unpatient to wait for fifteen minutes then they would not receive another treat. the researchers of the marshmallow test found out that children who were able to wait for fifteen minutes in order to receive another treat were most likely to get better SAT scores, would have better life outcomes, and a better education. The child's decision to either wait for fifteen minutes or to just give up due to their temptation to eat the delicious marshmallow, it all depended on their age, and background ethnicity.  What I liked about the book was that it explained self-control between children and adults and also because Walter put his observations towards the marshmallow test in a very entertaining hilarious descriptive way. this book was very good due to its long term analysis towards the study it's self, which I also gained more knowledge towards the overall meaning of the marshmallow test especially with the development strategies and the mechanisms of self-control. Another reason why I love the marshmallow book was because my psychology teacher first brought up the marshmallow experiment during my intro to psychology class, which made the class even more interesting. I didn't hate the book because I gained new knowledge from the experiment and because I was also very interested in the experiment ever since my intro to psychology class. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in psychology because it's a very fluffy, easy book to read. "
291,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18980203-charles-eliot,4,"""The Marshmallow Test"" takes its name from psychological studies, beginning in the 1960s and still continuing, which investigated self-control in very young children. The child subject was left alone in a room with a marshmallow, and told that if she didn't touch the marshmallow before the investigator returned, she could have two marshmallows. Kids showed different degrees of ability to resist temptation, and variations of the test probed the coping skills the kids employed. Over time a general framework emerged. We all have what the author, Walter Mischel, calls ""hot"" and ""cold"" responses. Hot responses are rapid, instinctive, urgent and emotional. Cold responses are analytical, objective, slow, and thoughtful. (This lines up almost exactly with Daniel Kahneman's insights in ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"") The key to exerting self-control is to cool down the response to the present, and heat up the response to the future. In other words, making the future gain more tempting than the present temptation. There are plenty of small and helpful tricks for this. One trick is to objectify the present temptation (""imagine the marshmallow with a frame around it and think of it as a picture of a marshmallow, not the real thing"") while drawing attention to the visceral pleasure of the future achievement (""it's going to be so cool to have two marshmallows to eat""). The most important trick of all is the ""if ... then"" trick, where you imagine what you will do if tempted. ""If ... then"" thinking has the effect of immediately derailing your hot response. The important message of The Marshmallow Test is that self-control is not entirely, or even predominantly, innate, but is a learned skill built on the brain's plasticity. The learning starts very early, and can continue throughout life. "
292,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,3,"Expanding upon a fascinating experiment conducted at the Bing Nursery School in Stanford University many decades ago, Walter Mischel expounds on the benefits derived by delaying instant gratification for future success. The famous experiment, now popular as ""The Marshmallow Test"" primarily aimed to put to test the will power of little children who were asked to choose between two alternatives. While under the first option, they could immediately take a candy/sweet/marshmallow (as per their preference) that was kept on a table, they were presented with a second choice under which they could lay claim to grab 2 candies/sweets/marshmallows if they could resist their desires by a mere 20 minutes.A researcher would leave the room with a child sitting alone in front of the table upon which the candies were kept. If the child, having wrestled out by temptation decided to pick the candy, all he/she had to do was ring a bill kept on the table, hearing which the researcher would return to the room and allow the child to take one sweet of his/choice. However if the child was successfully able to resist the allure of the sweet for all of 20 minutes, the researcher would enter the room after the designated time limit and gift the winner any 2 sweets of the victor's choice.This simple experiment shed enormously valuable insights into the workings of the human behaviour and led the way to identifying many improvements that usually go on to embellish the living of a person, a classic example being the ability to stop smoking after being addicted to nicotine for an imperceptibly long period.This books makes essential reading for anyone who is interested in gaining control over the more rustic senses thereby setting a focused path towards progression both in career as well as in life.""The Mashmallow Test"" - A fulfilling and rich after taste!"
293,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4325293-zebulon,5,"Cool and Hot thinking was shown to greatly impact the ability of the children to delay their gratification.  Cool thinking is associated with the pre-frontal area of the brain whereas hot thinking is associated with the amygdala. Amygdala is Latin for almond shaped.Use of the ""strange situation"" test where toddlers are briefly introduced to a stranger and then left with that person with other toys and distractions was a key indicator of whether the child could activate distraction strategies later in the marshmallow testing.Mischel's colleague Carole Dweck at UCLA has two models: incremental growth where a child does not believe that their capacity is limited and ""entity theorists"" that see their capacity as determined at birth.  Mischel asked questions in the 70s of the children to determine their mindsets.Carl Jung famously said that people study what they are not good at.Aversive counter conditioning is a strategy wherein an individual uses a disgusting sensory object to use the hot system to their advantage in dissuading them from pursuing a temptation.  The author used the example of a can of spent cigarette butts where smelling it was absolutely nauseating.ToM is an abbreviation for Theory of mind which is the important mental ability that begins in early childhood allowing us to understand that our beliefs may be false and that the way things appear may not be reality.  Theory of mind helps us to see that other people might no perceive the same scene or event the way that we do.The author also spoke volumes about development of executive function and if-then scenario development that could be used to harness the power of the hot/emotional/reactive system to avoid temptations."
294,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9979214-israel,4,"I always seem to read these type of ""self-help"" books at the beginning of each year. I don't know why? Maybe its because I want to take a fresh perspective on the new year. The Marshmallow Test was a very interesting read. The way the author personalized the scientific data made The Marshmallow Test an easy and compelling read. By testing pre-school children in their ability to resist one marshmallow for a specific amount of time for a reward of two marshmallows the author takes a deeper look at people's hot and cold systems and how they influence self control. The study found that the more stress in a child's early development can impact the development of the cold system that impedes a child's ability resist temptation and increases impulsive decisions. This increased impulsiveness can lead to a more difficult life and poor long term planning. The good news: you can, even as an adult, condition your cold system to cool off your hot system and make better, more informed decisions about your life. By incorporating coping strategies like using ""If, Then"" and thinking about your decisions in a way that brings to life how those decisions will impact your daily life can help you better understand the impact of any potential decisions and help you make better informed decisions.The Marshmallow Test is a good read because it not only explains the scientific studies in an easy to understand way but it also provides real world coping skills that can be used by adults and children alike. If you're going to start your year off with a self-help book make it one that will actually be able to help you and I think The Marshmallow Test is just the book you're looking for. Pick up The Marshmallow Test you won't be disappointed. "

Any book that talks about the importance of self-control and delayed gratification is going to be good but not popular in todays society of fast food and get rich quick schemes. Walter Mischel talks about his marshmallow test and the different research that has been done since the 1960's in the field of self-control. For those that don't know, the marshmallow test says, if you don't have one marshmallow now you can have two later. Other topics that are discussed are persistence, optimism, thinking about our future self to make wise decisions in the present moment, and helping cool down hot emotions that can lead to destructive impulsive behaviors. I liked the book a lot because it gives useful strategies to curbing undesired appetites and how to prepare for the future. Walter uses data to back up all his information which is always a plus. He is a highly recognized and praised professor in the field of psychology and after reading this book I can see why. I hardly write reviews but thought I should exercise some self-control and write one for ""The Marshmallow Test."" Buy this book and you won't regret it! "
296,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/326190-sheehan,4,"Many many moons ago, I used to joke that when I had kids I would wish for twins so I could run Piaget-style experiments on them; was definitely planning longitudinal vegetarian versus omnivore. Decades passed, a child (one) was born and the idea shelved for so many years came back up again when I read The Marshmallow Test.Fear not, this book is all about the delay of gratification and tenacity/grit in making more successful and determined humans; not at all as ethically challenged as my twenty y.o. diet bifurcated family!This book reminds me what I missed from Psych as an undergrad, and frankly updated many of the psychology paradigms (e.g. solve the root problem / medical model of care) that have been redirected to more behavioral solutions via research in the 20 years since my program. I like the book so much because it pushes against the fatalistic assumptions about genetic limitations to success and rightly advocates means for improving performance on the marshmallow test of life for everyone, provided certain cognitive-behavioral steps are integrated into an examined life.This book should be required reading for public school teachers...And yes, I will be trying out the Marshmallow test on our daughter next year!"
297,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6250660-don-o-goodreader,5,"The Marshmallow Test by Walter Mischel opens with the interesting observation that if a preschooler can wait 20 minutes for two marshmallows instead of grabbing one marshmallow now, psychologists can predict more success in life (by almost any measure) decades later.This observation is the basis of this excellent parenting manual based on the latest research. Fortunately, evolution moves very slowly and human nature has changed very little in the last hundred (or thousand for that matter) years, so this advice is compatible with previous research-based parenting books. The one my wife and I used decades ago offers similar advice with reference to different research: Children: The Challenge - now celebrating its golden anniversary, though still readily available in reprint.I can highly recommend Mischel's book for its sound advice and up-to-date review of the current research. The title not withstanding, this book offers a broad survey of current research. If parents want to focus their parenting, either of these boos will provide an excellent basis for the personal style that parents must synthesize to provide a consistent and supportive environment for their children.For more: http://1book42day.blogspot.com/2014/1..."
298,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16658225-remazera,4,"4 out 5 stars.Thanks to Dr. Walter for writing the book.I am very happy that I got the chance to read this book. I have related to it in all aspects of self-help, and a refresher to my psychology knowledge. The only drawback I did, was buying a scientific and a self help book as ebook. It didn't do it justice and it became a tedious read for me.I am happy with the way the author constructed his book, and labeled / went though what each chapter will contain. Albeit the title highlights on self-success, he was mostly focusing on children in the upbringing process and not the adult population or their set of problems, which I appreciate for those becoming parents, but it did not address the adult population entirely. Nonetheless, he had great techniques offered throughout the book that any will be able to take away and apply it in their life. (For example If-Then, keeping a mental dairy to understand your stressors..etc)There were some moments in the book that really hit me. When the the therapist asked his client, whom he felt the world was falling apart, and the therapist just asked ""would you like to?""I would definitely go over it and refresh my memory over the content offered in this book and try to apply it my own life. I was happy with this read."
299,0316230871,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"The Marshmallow Test by Walter Mischel is an inquiry into the workings of self-control. In a now classic experiment, Dr. Mischel determined that many factors controlled by the Prefrontal Cortex can manifest themselves in children as young as four, perhaps even earlier. The Marshmallow Test itself can only be administered to children of a certain age, or else the child might not understand the instructions.The Test itself is ingenious and quite simple; offer the child a treat of some kind, it doesn’t have to be a marshmallow and tell the child that if they wait for around ten minutes they can have two marshmallows instead of one. Surprisingly, it was found that this determines a great many things later on in life. Self-control and willpower are instrumental in deciding SAT scores, whether or not the person will get in trouble, and whether the person will participate in risky behaviors or not.In the 1960s it wasn’t thought to be the case, but willpower can be strengthened like any muscle. The key is to think of willpower as something that is determined by effort and not by birth. Countless studies starting with this one have shown this to be the case. Thus, this book was fascinating."
