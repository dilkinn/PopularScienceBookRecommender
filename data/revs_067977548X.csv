The days of sitting on a back porch waiting for the evening newspaper are long gone, as the pace of technology makes us more and more impatient.We may need to set aside formal time for deliberation, where once we used accidental time.The 19th Century really started the spurt with the Industrial Revolution, which changed people's lives so rapidly, previously contented rural inhabitants became impoverished urban denizens. The 20th Century brought so much advancement (telephones in every home, radio followed by TV, computers instead of typewriters, the Internet) that people started being eased out of jobs in favor of those workers who could master new machines and their new rules.We mistrust our machines all the more because we fall behind in learning how to use them.If the author thought life was accelerating as the 21st Century reared its head, then we must now be moving at the speed of light. James Gleick mentions 500 kbps as ""blazing speed""...now we just laugh at that. Faxes are a bewilderment to Generation Z and five-year plans are rarely discussed now (try 5-week plans). What this book gets so very right is our expectation of time. That is, we expect our phones to pull up data immediately. If that doesn't happen, temper tantrums ensue. Yet not that long ago, the expectation was that someone at a major corporation would actually answer your call and you could call a local library to ask a question in the hopes they had the answer. That's all gone. Now we no longer control time, it seems to control us.""Time is a gentle deity"", said Sophocles. Perhaps it was, for him. These days it cracks the whip.This book is a very good reminder of how our obsession with the shininess of new technology may be doing more to hurt than help us.Book Season = Year Round (10 seconds = eternity)"
1,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/787522-paul,4,"This book is great. The acceleration of society/culture by way of technology is a subject that interests me greatly, maybe more than any other, so this book was right up my alley. Perhaps the most amazing thing about Faster is, despite its being almost a decade old, it's still entirely relevant. Aside from the lack of talk about iPods an iPhones, it doesn't seem dated at all. This is especially noteworthy considering the book's premise, which claims that a decade, these days, is an eternity.If the book has one flaw, it's indicated by its subtitle. In only 280 pages, Gleick indeed covers just about everything that is currently being accelerated, so it almost reads like a collection of short essays. Which, ironically, is perfect for the society he claims we've all become, i.e. voracious consumers of small, easily-digestible bits of information who rarely pause to consider or process the information. Yes, the book is a rather easy read, and I would have preferred if he'd gone into some more detail, either technical or historical, or whatever, about certain topics, as someone like Paul Virilio does.Still, the book is an excellent survey of time, speed, technology, and culture acceleration. It's well-written, well-reasoned, and, I thought, entertaining (i.e. never dry). Some of my favorite topics covered were the airline industry and how it has come to manage its myriad flights, telephone operators, the wearing of wristwatches, and the concept of efficiency. It's rarely gloomy or preachy, which is rare, I've found, in cultural studies. Gleick even provides a super comprehensive bibliography (it takes up like 25 pages), so anyone who wants more detail will know where to look. Recommended. "
2,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/865950-david-cerruti,3,"After reading Gleick’s Chaos in 1989 and The Information this year, I was anticipating Faster. What a letdown. Chaos and The Information rocked. Faster just plodded along. In his profile, David Giltinan cites 10 common sources of disappointment in a book. The first is “Failed to match brilliance of author's previous work.” That was certainly the case here. Another distraction is this edition is an audio book, read by Gleick. His reading wasn’t engaging. The other GR reviews cover the content, how everything is speeding up. That seems like old news. One item of interest is how digital answering machines compress the message without raising the pitch. This technology also saves time for phone operators. Now that is a useful idea. I happened to be listening to Faster on an iPhone, which has a 2X speed button. In practice, it’s closer to 1 ½ X speed. With Gleick’s reading faster was better. I expect to thoroughly enjoy Gleick’s books on Feynman and Newton."
3,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/751292-tessa,2,"An OK book. It's written for a somewhat pop audience and contains few revelations. However there is an interesting section towards the end where he discusses the limits of speed and uses the example of the disabled ""close door"" buttons on newer skyscraper elevators which exist only so that people can press them and believe that they are causing the doors to close faster when they stay open for the same time regardless."
4,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2989615-lukasz-pruski,3,"""I put instant coffee in my microwave oven and almost went back in time.""(From a Steven Wright's stand-up routine)It is quite depressing to read a nineteen-year-old book that focuses on one of the things that are obviously wrong with our civilization and realize that the problem has gotten much worse since the publication. James Gleick's Faster was published in 1999 and its subtitle - The Acceleration of Just About Everything - aptly describes the topic. Mr. Gleick is the author of the wonderful Chaos: Making of a New Science, where the mathematical chaos theory is explained in a way accessible to general audience. I am also planning to re-read and review his Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman. While Faster is not on the same stellar level as the two other books, it is well written, absorbing, and readable. And of course the main thesis of the book - that we want to do things too fast for no reason whatsoever - is even more relevant today, in the age of Twitter.The book starts slowly: in the first 80 or so pages the author focuses on various topics related to time, like time standardization, time travel, watch technology and watch fashion (here he predicts the arrival of smart watches), slow-motion film and stroboscopic photography, but the only item that stands out for me is the critique of multi-tasking. These days people take pride in multi-tasking even more than in 1999, but at least today studies are available which unequivocally show that multi-tasking either does not save us any time or that the tasks that have been executed simultaneously with others are not executed as well as they would have been if we focused on one task at a time.Things get really interesting when the author begins discussing the Internet. It is nice that in a book that is almost 20 years old the observations about the Web revolution - these were its early days - do not sound dated at all. But it is a pity that the author could not talk about one of the most idiotic things that our civilization has ever produced - Twitter - as it was created in 2006. Twitter, the perfect embodiment of our ""religion of speed,"" allows short (140 characters) messages, which transform any actual, potentially worthwhile content into superficial and worthless ""sound bites."" The author offers quite an interesting perspective on the psychological and sociological ramifications of sound bites, which supports the contrarian point of view - one to which I wholeheartedly subscribe - that if anything can be said in a short sentence, it is not worth saying at all.Further chapters in the book focus on the issues related to ""saving time."" Mr. Gleick points out the illusory nature of time savings obtained by reading faster, cooking faster, and eating faster. He ridicules the time-saving-driven attempts to measure how much time we spend for all kinds of activities and perversely asks ""How much time can a person devote to time-saving?"" The passages that satirize the self-help genre of books like 365 Ways To Save Time are hilarious.One of the more interesting chapters is devoted to ""hand-held antiboredom devices"" like the remote. Mr. Gleick quotes Saul Bellow who saw a modern human's mental state ""an unbearable state of distraction:""  ""Remote control switches permit us to jump back and forth, mix up beginnings, middles and ends. Nothing happens in any sort of order... Distraction catches us all in the end and makes mental mincemeat of us.""  While Faster is not a great book in that it contains too much peripheral stuff and lacks cohesion, it is a really worthy read that may cause one to pause and think ""Wait, do I really need to hurry?""Three and a quarter stars. "
5,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17763301-andrew-carr,3,"It's pretty common to hear people say 2020 is such a fast year and compare it to turn of the century when Y2k and hanging chads in Florida seemed the world's biggest problems. 'Faster: The Acceleration of just about Everything' by James Gleick, published in the year 2000, is thus a useful time capsule in showing that back then everyone thought that life was far too fast as well.The theory that life is speeding up is widely held, even if the evidence for it is patchy and somewhat of a social construction thanks to everyone telling each other that yes, life is much faster these days. Gleick mounts the argument as well as can be, in part by showing how much a search for efficiency in time drives our choices - especially in relation to technology - and how rarely this actually translates into more time for the things we value. We're not victims of a faster world, we've deliberately built it and tell ourselves we need it, even as we resent parts of it, and overstate its importance. The role of time and feeling of speed are increasingly important in western culture. Unfortunately while Gleick is a good writer, this isn't a book of much value 20 years on. It's not as detailed about history as say 'About Time' by Adam Frank, nor as grounded in sociological evidence and broader critique as work such as 'Runaway World' by Anthony Giddens. Save your time, read something new. That's what a faster society would recommend anyway."
6,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16796821-thomson-kneeland,3,"This was a great, quick read, and though written in 1999, the ideas and issues presented are as pertinent as ever. An easy essay read on various facets of how technology is shaping society with mutitasking, emails, information overload and a sheer feeling of lack of time as our everyday pace quickens. Ten years later, the world has accelerated far more than even this book portends with flash trading, texting, twitter, digital downloads, and the enormous capacity of the web. But in essence, it is an examination of our sense of time and how technology shapes our vision of it and our feeling of productivity. It certainly was inspiring to read and make my own goals of taking myself out of that heightened acceleration as much as possible. The writing was a bit kitschy, with its emphasis on television, cable and more, but that's the world we live in (and a world I forego in terms of immersing myself in such media) and the actual writing itself could have been more in depth, it essentially read like a giant magazine article for the New Yorker or something. Definitely a ""pop"" book vs science. Worth a read regardless, as it doesnt take long to get through."
7,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,2,"Disappointing. I enjoyed 'The Information' by the same author, which I found well-rounded and offering depth and variety. This earlier offering by the American author failed to hold my interest and failed to really deliver on the theme set up quite adequately in the opening fifty or so pages. Gleick speaks at length about the increasing pace of modern life, but doesn't really make a coherent or particularly interesting point about it - it just comes over as a list of examples and facts about how things were slower and now are faster. On top of this, the book also felt a little US-centric and (as it was published in 1999, before the smart-phone revolution) curiously dated whilst trying to address a [then] modern phenomenon. I found it a little cynical in the focus on what has been lost with a pacier existence, as opposed to counterweighing what has been gained, and there wasn't a lot about it which hadn't already occurred to me or which I had previously read about. Yes, at the turn of the millennium it would've made for a more powerful and insightful commentary, but to me reading it in 2018 it wasn't that rewarding."
8,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,4,"I started out not quite impressed with this book. It looked like it was going to be vacant navel-gazing - reminiscing about a time in the past when things were ""slower"" and therefore better. But I'm glad I stuck with it, because it turned into a very thought-provoking story of what time means to us now. Lots has been written on the increasing speed of technological innovation and how this changes society, but much less has been written about what the effect is of moving fast. The author doesn't quite argue that we need to go slower, and he's not a luddite arguing we get rid of modern technology. All the same, a lot of topics worth thinking about are brought up. Though this was published 13 years ago, it has only become more relevant with time. "
9,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2301615-actionscientist,4,"I read this book during a week holiday in the Okavango Swamps (Botswana) at the turn of the Millennium ... after a decade of burning the candle at both ends and living Internet years. Gleick is one of the small handful of popular science writers able to spin a delightful series of yarns to make his point. His final big bit of advice: our species needs to learn how to squander copious amounts of time, again. A profound bit of advice, if one can find the time to think about it, let alone implement it. "
10,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22104779-knibbs,3,At the end I'm not really sure that it said much... But it was a reasonably interesting and engaging read. Inevitable dated parts. Could really have just stuck to the Brainpickings summary but it was a pleasant enough read.
11,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49055866-cezary-baraniecki,4,"Faster By: James GleickThe keeping of time was a right reserved to Emperor in ancient China. They set the calendar and marked the passing of time with complex water clocks, while the population carried on in blithe ignorance of the mechanical passing of time, well after clocks spread throughout the rest of the world. Gleick compares this state of being with our segmented, minute-by-minute life today and remarks: “if our watches are slave-chains, we don them eagerly”Faster is a book that explores the concept of speed as it can be applied to objects, the evolution of technology and, importantly, the pace of life. Having come to Faster through another of Gleick's book, The Information, you start to see a pattern to his writing: take a concept, deconstruct it and explore its many meanings, evaluate the moral significance we associate with this concept, and color it in with eclectic examples that loosely orbit the concept's center. In this sense, Gleick's mode of operation compares with the likes of Malcolm Gladwell. Yet if Gladwell frames vivid and deeply personal stories in order to suss out a factoid, Gleick takes a less sentimental approach, focusing instead on the concept at hand, filling it with esoteric facts, in brick-a-brac fashion.Gleick puts forward the idea that there is a sort of check-stop to speed in that it only progresses and rarely reverts. The mechanism around this process isn't made explicit but is hinted at in business: affairs were conducted over weeks, with correspondence taking days to be written and sent off. Lawyers were stereotypical associated with being lazy and slow. That is no longer an option with the advent of email, video chat, the telephone and billable hours. The pace of production has set a new “normal” and reverting to some prelapsarian era is only possible in post-Apocalyptic daydreams. Information is assumed to be more and more instantaneously accessible and acting on that information is a necessity, not an option. It's hard to even image, for example, that “two thousand people died in the 1815 battle of new Orleans a fortnight after the relevant peace treaty had been signed in London”.But what in what sense is it good to be fast? Are we supposed to be “hurried and hasty” or “living at high speed with athleticism and vigor”? What about being leisurely and present? What, exactly, is the right speed of life? Gleick offers interesting examples of how time is more and more a precious commodity and that it's use is more than even coming under rigorous scrutiny. Products are offered to save a minute here, a few seconds there. In one aside, he notes that an advertisement “'for women who don't have time for a yeast infection' – as though slackers might have time for that”. What are we putting our precious time into and where do these regained seconds go into?How we experience time as a society shifts with the advent of technologies that speed up life. This process isn't neatral in respect to the values that earlier societies had or even the activities that they engaged in. Books, once read in solitude, are now heard while engaging in another task; and the advent of companies offering audio summaries of books (Blinkist, for example) show that even multitasking can be sped up. Even the thought of sitting down to enjoy to an entire album, free of other distractions or activities, makes people restless. What it means to experience time is important. Our common intuitions tell us that we can use our time better, now that we have access to so many time saving technologies, now that we have so much choice on how to spend our time. But that doesn't actually bear out. In early user testing Sun Micro-systems did on early internet users, they found that people don't actually read articles on the internet as they do books. The conclusion reached was there there are simply too many options of what to engage with and lurking in everyone's mind as they are on a website is the idea that there is some other, better website that they might want to switch their attention to. In a coincidental finding that goes against economic theory, as it is understood today, adding choice decreased the happiness and fulfillment people experience.In conclusion, Gleick doesn't offer some milquetoast panacea: slow down and smell the roses! In many ways, how we spend our time is out of our control and the norms we feel around time are clearly set socially. At best, we are faced with the reality of the quick passing of time and our biological limits of squeezing more meaning out experienced time, as much as we may want to. We are forced to re-evaluate our intuitions, that faster is always better, that more choice means more happiness and fulfillment. The book succeeds in making the seemingly benign concept of speed exotic and interesting, diffused yet understandable. Gleick hints at a limit to going faster but what that limit is remains unclear."
12,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/903066-johnny,4,"Anyone familiar with other books by James Gleick (Chaos: Making and New Science and The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood) will quickly recognize the formula for Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything. Written at (approximately) the turn of the millennium, some of the material is dated, but as with most books by this author, the anecdotes, quotations, and insights are well worth considering it anew. For example, Gleick begins his discussion of time with interesting factoids about an urban source of impatience, elevators. “A good waiting time is in the neighborhood of fifteen seconds. Sometime around forty seconds, people start to get visibly upset.” (p. 27)In a similar vein, did you ever notice the well-worn walk buttons for traffic signals? They are continually used, yet, “At best, the push-to-walk button will eventually, within a minute or two, insert a ‘walk phase’ into an otherwise walkless cycle.” (p. 30) At a time when watches have largely become jewelry or transitioned to the computer as with the Apple Watch, it is fascinating to read about an Encyclopedia Britannica article still in print up till 1936 that offered instructions for repairing a watch would have been magnetized, “’twirl it rapidly around while retreating from the dynamo [source of the magnetism] and continue the motion till at a considerable distance.’” (p. 38)I was both amused and appalled at a Hitachi executive whose mantra was, “Speed is God, and time is the devil.” (p. 75) I could resonate with the metaphor on p. 90: “Try to distinguish between the little nattering demons that can fill every moment and the greater, quieter spirits which can enrich the passing hours.” And, I very much agree with and have experienced the reality in James Burke’s observation, “We will need to reskill ourselves constantly every decade just to keep a job.” (p. 81)As for factoids (for which Gleick is famous), did you know that the average U.S. citizen’s time commitment to filling out U.S. government forms averages to 4.5 minutes per day (p. 127)? Did you know that the average shelf life of a book in 1999 (surely even shorter today) was 60 days (p. 141)? For me, personally, it was fascinating to learn that one of the professors from my graduate school, Dr. Wayne E. Oates, officially coined the phrase, “workaholic.” (p. 153) Did you know that even a public radio station given a choice between a performance of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik which plays in 21 minutes and 31 seconds compared to another which plays in 20 minutes and 18 seconds that the shorter performance will invariably be chosen (p. 193)? Did you know that, at the turn of the millennium, software company support lines alone kept customers on hold 3 billion minutes per year (p. 234)?Perhaps the most alarming insight in Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything was the illustration of how fast technological change was obsoleting much of our digital archive of human wisdom in the digital age (p. 250). As a cautionary tale, Gleick quotes the historian and science-fiction author H. G. Wells about the advent of now obsolete microfilm. Wells said, “There is no practical obstacle whatever now to the creation of an efficient index to all human knowledge, ideas and achievements, to the creation, that is, of a complete planetary memory for all mankind.” (p. 254) In 1937, Wells had no idea how fast microfilm would become obsolete (p. 255). Yet, as proud as we are of the petabytes of valuable archival materials, there is tremendous danger of losing that data, too. Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything is a fascinating book both in entertaining narratives from the past and present, as well as thought-provoking commentary. Though outdated, it still stands up as a valuable resource."
13,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,5,"Twenty-first century life in the fast lane!James Gleick, author of the bestseller Chaos has created another compelling and often disturbing tale of the nature of our society. Faster characterizes our modern day thinking as overwhelmingly occupied with notions of time - time management, saving time, using time, keeping time, multi-tasking, channel surfing, high speed internet, moving sidewalks, high speed elevators, telephone speed dial functions, and, of course, the plethora of self-help books touting improvements in personal efficiency and productivity.A few pithy trenchant quotations from the book will illustrate Gleick's brilliant observation of the twenty-first century's morbid pre-occupation with time, speed and the generally unhealthy acceleration of life:""A medication is marketed `for women who don't have time for a yeast infection' - as though slackers might have time for that.""""There are ... places and objects that signify impatience. Doctors' anterooms. The DOOR CLOSE button in elevators, so often a placebo, with no function but to distract for a moment those riders to whom ten seconds seem an eternity.""""Marketers and technologists anticipate your desires with fast ovens, quick playback, quick freezing and fast credit. We bank the extra minutes that flow from these innovations, yet we feel impoverished and we cut back - on breakfast, on lunch, on sleep, on daydreams.""""It might seem that to save time means to preserve it, spare it, free it from some activity that might otherwise have consumed it in the hot flames of busy-ness. Yet time-saving books are constantly admonishing people to do things.""And yet, paradoxically, this notion of filling every millisecond of every day with productive activity is juxtaposed with the rather strange realization that:""Our idea of boredom - ennui, tedium, monotony, lassitude, mental doldrums - has been a modern invention. The word `boredom' barely existed even a century ago.""Boredom - as silence, as emptiness, as time unfilled - was a mental state all but inconceivable a hundred years ago. But perversely, with all of the activities available at our fingertips and the ability to access those activities in seconds, we find ourselves thirsting for more and more.I wonder what Gleick would think of the fact that there were times when I found his book so interesting that I was skimming ... just so I could absorb it more quickly. (Note to self: the next time I listen to a piece of classical music, I'm going to do nothing else. I'm going to listen to the music for its own sake). Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"
14,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10047973-stephen,2,"This book is a bit of a transitional fossil - ironic, given that it's about how ""everything's getting faster."" But that sentiment is, in my estimation, itself an artifact of the late 1980s through the 1990s. The analogous $CURRENT_YEAR narrative is about *scale* and *volume*, if anything - we don't notice the increases in Internet bandwidth because we're already downloading 4K-HD cat videos. But now we're worried about how many data points it takes for a machine learning algorithm to predict your behavior with 95% confidence, and the speed is just ""fast enough to be a problem."" In contrast to Gleick's portrait of the late-20th-c. Western world as go-go-go, the world from 2020 seems, at least on the physical plane, rather sluggish. Why go out when you can binge-watch Netflix and order out on Grubhub?As for the actual style, it's caught between the justifiably amazing CHAOS: MAKINGA NEW SCIENCE (1980s) and the more modern pop-sociology of a Malcom Gladwell C-suite read (2010s). Gleick has a rich vocabulary, but more than once I felt like he was gilding the lily, or getting a bit too jazzy with his narrative. The chapters kind of, sort of stitch together but don't quite form a coherent picture. I never could shake the doubt that these phenomena were all that important - more than a few examples, like multitasking while the dial-up modem connects to the Internet, have simply gone away. Contrast with CHAOS, where I felt like I had learned something insightful and surprising after every chapter.Overall, 2.5 stars rounded down. It's a quirky read for people who might enjoy a retrofuturism of their own lifetimes (speaking as a Nineties Kid) but it doesn't otherwise leave an impression."
15,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen,4,"There is a certain irony to the short chapters sporting catchy headings in FSTR – as the book cover popularly (or smugly?) has the title. “Prest-o! change-o!” and “On Your Mark, Get Set, Think” are as punny as they come; I'd almost argue they are Buzzfeed titles avant la lettre. In the afterword Gleick assures us that this is a book and, as such, a “slow device”, but you can't help but feel that he has been influenced in its design and structure by the subject matter. I guess there's no helping that when you immerse yourself in statistics about how every second counts. Make your chapters two pages longer and people will not be able to finish them on their daily commute! (or some such thought?) I read a rather depressing (and annoyingly written, to boot) article recently counting down how many visitors would still be reading after each paragraph. That is the sort of preoccupation that must be behind this one.Since we're on that subject: one of Faster's chapters is called “Jog More, Read Less,” and points out that we only spent sixteen minutes a day reading a book, on average (but almost thrice as much reading newspapers and magazines, and probably much more reading short messages online). The Jog More part of that title is elaborated on more broadly. To summarize: we spent a lot of time exercising, but how much of that time is actually spent exercising our muscles instead of just flexing them is not entirely clear. I smuggled in the culprit word there: “exercise.” While Gleick generally limits his disapproval of all the little facets of life in which we have sped up, it's not hard to guess what he really thinks, and sometimes he can't help himself. On the subject of treadmills: “as you head off for the eternal horizon on your treadmill, you must be aware that this march is almost by definition a waste of time”. Indeed. Rebecca Solnit, in her book Wanderlust, writing on the history of walking, pointed out the irony that we have first created machines to lighten our work load, and then created machines to even out the lightening of our work load. She quotes an Eduardo Galeano essay in which he engages Dominican fishermen to talk about a rowing machine. Needless to say, they are perplexed, and conclude that the “rowing is the only thing we don't like” about rowing. They like all the things that the modern gym doesn't allow: the sun beating on their bodies and the cool splashes of water.It doesn't necessarily help the book that Gleick starts with his strongest example, either. Point in case: the door close button. He borrowed it from Douglas Coupland, but he gets it right. “Anger at elevators rises within seconds, experience shows.” Although elevators are usually programmed to take only two to four seconds to close of their own, “the door close button in elevators is usually the one with the paint worn off”. I enjoyed the little factoid that most door close buttons are deactivated when the elevator is installed, and the buttons work only to relieve psychological stress. Since the doors close quickly anyway, no harm is done and no harm is even noticed.After the doors close, I felt – again, quite ironically – a little too much come at me, too quickly, in this book. Yes, Gleick seems to press the door close button too soon upon virtually every subject, whereas I sometimes prefered to dwell longer. Nevertheless, somewhere in the midle of the book, through an endless barrage of examples, Gleick hits upon a more overarching core. Or perhaps I do, perhaps I finally get what he's trying to say around the time the author hits “Internet time,” a subject I've been involving myself with for my thesis. “The Web and TV complement each other perfectly,” Gleick has some nobody from California say. “TV doesn't require much attention from the viewer. It fits perfectly into the spaces created by downloading Web pages.” This one's insightful because it's not true anymore for most people. The internet does not take time anymore downloading web pages. Even hi-res movies can be streamed without delay. If you take the time out of everything – if you make TV and newspapers and books into bite-size chunks – it makes sense that it will be impossible to concentrate on anything, since nothing continues to happen. Moreover, in the meantime, there are a myriad of other things that can start happening. In the past, we sometimes simply had to wait. “We humans used to feel like laggards, with nature marching briskly onward.” We had to adapt to the world, and this of course has been the fight technology has been fighting. “In our day of electric wires,” Mark Twain writes, as quoted by Gleick, “we turn it around. Man waits not for time nor tide.”This brings Gleick to his second-best example: the fermata. This is a notational sign in music used to prolong a note or rest indefinitely. Gleick points out that there are musicians around who can play any piece of music brilliantly, but choke on this sign. They just get uncomfortable with the silence, let alone the “indefinite” length of it.The last paragraph, appropriately called “The End,” is rather wonderful. It can be read independently of what came before, and would make for an excellent separate essay. Here, Gleick finally draws some conclusions himself, most importantly of which is the following realisation: “whenever we speed up the present, as a curious side effect we slow down the past. […] Peering back through history we see scenes in a kind of slow motion that did not exist then. We have invented it.” This is what it boils down to. There is another, comparable remark to make here, which Gleick omits. Whenever we think of the future, it doesn't slow down the present. Just because we fantasise about traveling at the speed of light, we do not suddenly get flustered about flying at the speed of sound. It is only when we experience the acceleration first-hand that we get restless with all that came before."
16,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6535391-jackie,1,"Horribly outdated by this point, Gleick's accounting of acceleration reads as a collection of new phrases/inventions/gadgets/foods/behaviors he's either annoyed with or bemused by. There were still some nuggets of interesting-ness that touched off different semi-enjoyable musings (how quickly humans adapt to new things - how doing something faster makes us inevitably imagine the old way of doing it felt horribly slow at the time - how human speech and then idea patterns are influenced by the world around them) but this could have been accomplished much better in article format. But even if there was an updated version that's just a short story in Wired, I wouldn't want to read it.Gleick's ""The Information"" was wonderful though so I'm going to continue picking up his books regardless."

Though I read this almost 20 years after it was written, the themes are very much still applicable and this would have been state of the art in 1999. Sprinkled throughout the text you can see portions that are interrelated, though not necessarily redundant to some of his other works. Some passages are inspired by Chaos, and others I can see as part of the foundation for The Information. Overall this was a great read. A bit nostalgic for me personally, and Gleick's narrative is informed, robust, and scientifically literate as usual. "

He has lots of short chapters that expound in this idea. Each feels like its meant to be a think-piece published in The New Yorker. Overall, it seems the author keeps trying to convince the reader how smart he is, how much of an observer of social trends he is, how he can wrap up our lives into a broad theme. In the end, he tries to say too much in each chapter, each paragraph, each sentence. He jumps from topic to topic. In the limit of trying to capture everything into a single theme, this book ends up being about nothing at all. Rather than remembering the theme, I’ve basically forgot everything written."

This book explains our perception of time, and the ways in which time - or at least our perception of it - has accelerated in the modern age. By the end of the book I was consciously trying to slow things down in my day: simply eat a meal without simultaneously reading or looking at my phone, sit there and do nothing but listen to music, knit quietly, even (gasp!) do nothing for a little bit. It really does make you feel more grounded. Whipping out your phone when you're ""bored"" does not relieve stress, it just contributes to information overload. The day feels slowed down and unhurried when you use these ""in-between"" times to just reflect and, yes, do nothing.I'm struggling to say something cool and original about it, but I think the book speaks for itself. :) Read it!These are some quotes I liked, which may not make sense out of context.""No one actually knew whether a trotting horse lifted all four hooves from the ground at any point in its stride."" - 57""But people don't really see motion that way, in blurs or strobe repetitions.

The multiplication of information pathways leads to positive feedback effects in the nature of frenzies."" - 86""The American company that promoted the Internet hardest in its early days, Sun Microsystems, conducted research in 1997 into how people read on the Web and concluded simply, 'They don't.'

I spotted this at my local library and thought I could use it as part of the 2017 Read Harder Challenge. It met the requirements for task #13 - Read a nonfiction book about technology.The chapter on the history of watches was quite interesting. Of course, as Gleick moved toward the then-current descriptions of watches circa 1999, I was amused that he accurately predicted the future of timepieces, speculating on the existence of something such as the Apple Watch.I hit a snag, though, when one of the discs ended up being damaged. Apparently, I had borrowed the only audio copy of the book in the entire library network. I decided to borrow a hardback version instead.For whatever reason, the book lost its charm. Maybe I needed John McDonough to read it to me in order to get past how dated the book seemed. When Gleick cited Windows 99 as cutting edge, I was done. I realize that the acceleration of life that Gleick documents and laments has only gotten worse as technology has improved. The issues he raised then are still relevant now. I just have too many other books on my TBR list to spend more time on his insights. Does that qualify as ironic? "
28,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3255414-jay,4,"I read this book while eating various meals, while sitting in the car waiting for a school bus to arrive, while brushing my teeth (even while flossing), while also being a spectator at various events, and to fill in many many different odd moments that came along (for I am never without a book). I layered the reading of this book with many different experiences, making more of my minutes and seconds since I can't erase any more of my free time... there just isn't any left. While reading this book, I finished about 23 other books, and I read at least part of many more. I would have listened to this book while driving, too, if I had been able to find the audiobook version.This book discusses many different ways people pay attention to their movements to vaporize any wasted motion. I mean, a person that cooks things in the microwave for 2:22 instead of 2:30?! Come on! Don't they realize that the""start"" button is part of the sequence and drawing a line toward the ""start"" button makes better use of your motion. Key in 1:59 instead of 2:00 is a better savings than pressing the same key multiple times is.Okay, I'm guilty of paying attention to every inefficiency, but as both an engineer and a fencer, I find these things being important to my work and my play. How could this way of thinking not pour over into the rest of my life?It does seem strange sometimes that my most introspective moments these days are when I am both running and listening to music. These are the moments with the least external stimulation in the life I currently live. I used to think between lying down and falling asleep at night, but for the past ten years, that time is pretty close to 20 seconds. Not much thinking time.The main things I took from this book: (1) everyone is getting better at razing off little bits of inefficiency so I am not alone, (2) the gain of that is more ephemeral than I sometimes believe, (3) my wide-view perspective of efficiency, which includes the time-cost of learning to use a potentially time-saving device, is a better way to think, and (4) time that is ""saved"" is still used in some way because you can't pour it into a bottle. The book didn't teach me, as much as shed some light on the dark places of time that I haven't had time to think about."
29,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237216-emily,5,"When I made my piece about the Heart, I read a lot of books about it and enjoyed little bits of all of them. Then, I read one that summed it all up and seemed to get at exactly many of the things I wanted to explore. (Louisa Young's Book of the Heart, just in case you're curious) Faster is THAT book but for Time. In pretty much every chapter I found myself thinking, ""Yes! That's - yes! I hadn't thought of things quite like that. Damn!"" All this time I was thinking I wanted to make a piece about Time, and now I'm wondering if it's really SPEED I want to explore. Gleick's thesis is that everything in our lives is accelerating, that the hallmark of modern life is its speed. That this complicates things is evidenced in one of my favorite chapters ""365 Ways to Save Time"" wherein he analyzes a book by that name and points out all the contradictory messages we get about saving time. Tip 209: Delegate 99% of your calls to your secretary. Tip 66: Take every phone call yourself and have your secretary interrupt you for the next call to save time answering messages. I love how Gleick pulls apart all these contradictions and points at the many ways these attempts to save time make us nuts. He points out the dangers of speed - such as ""real time"" opinion polls and sped up music. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be reading this again. Funny, I had to read this book very slowly in order to digest all it has to offer. I think I'll read it slowly again soon. "
30,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745969-chelsea,3,"I just finished reading Faster: The Acceleration of Just AboutEverything by James Gleick. (Ironically enough, not a quick read.) The basic thesis of the book is that our modern culture is obsessed with the notion of speed and the acceleration of everyday actions is a driving force in our technological and even political developments. Each chapter takes an aspect, object or idea and examines its development in context. Elevators, watches, cars, commercials, almost everything is touched on. He discusses our perception of passing time, what we do with our time, the development of a concept of time and the concept of ""free"" time, and what ""time"" really means. While exploring these things, he refrains from judgment on their development, offering only examples on which you can base your own decisions.While he has a sort of rambling, conversation style, his voice is much clearer and stronger than that of Stoll. He speaks with concise and clear language and adequately supports his descriptions. Though containing anecdotes and small diversions, they are clearly linked to the topic at hand.In summary, I found this to be a great read (and a great buy at $5 off the bargain rack.) It really opens your eyes to the little speed and time-related idiosyncrasies of everyday life and interactions. It's short and compartmentalized chapters lend themselves to good bed-time reading."
31,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,4,"On time, our experience and measure of it, and particularly our accelerating life perspective, propelled by equally exponential technological advance. Written in 1999, the book loses little strength of argument since the reader can easily mentally update the most recent exemplar technologies and statistics (e.g. # of websites on topic x). Indeed, the intervening decade actually bolsters Gleick's point on progress, as the trends described herein have proven relatively robust and astute, becoming ever more popularly discussed by contemporary journalists.The book is befittingly brief, written much like one of James Gleick's long editorials in The New Yorker or NYT. Having a strong interest in the general topic of this book I worried initially that the material would be outdated or too superficial, but I was pleased to find myself thoroughly engaged throughout. I particularly enjoyed Gleick's insightful history of the measurement of time. This review refers to the audiobook version read by the author, who probably could have used a glass of water at certain points during recording, but in general reads his own work with good pacing and emphasis."
32,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,3,"I was tricked! I thought this was a book about physics (with the alluring word ""acceleration"" in the title), but it turned out to be more social and behavioral science than anything else. I still really enjoyed it though, as James Gleick once again proved his versatility as a writer. All the little nuances, the winks and nods to the quirkiest of human predilections and paranoias, were what made this book such a joy to read. And that seems to be Gleick's style, which works in any genre.My inner journalist salivated throughout the book whenever he interviewed someone so ostensibly boring but obviously incredibly interesting as the keeper of time at the atomic clock in Greenwich, England. The dude doesn't wear a watch. That's awesome. So, physics or not, this is a great read loaded with brilliant quotes and depressing poetics. And irrespective of the apparent pointlessness of human existence in a grander scheme of universal mortality, the book is surprisingly uplifting. Read it."
33,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122357-summer,4,"Although some sections of the book were dated to the point of irrelevance, the majority of the book was thought-provoking and still applicable. There is even an author's note at the end stating that a book about our ever increasing dependence on technology and increasing the speed of our lives became outdated in the months between the time it was written and the time it was published. Still, I found the ideas the author discussed- about our culture's need for speed and how it has spawned our collective impatience and inattention- pertinent even ten years after the book was re-released. There are plenty of books and magazine articles available telling us that our lives are fast-paced and offering solutions to the stated fact. This book was not a New Age list of how to slow your life down or 10 ways to savor the moment, but an examination of how we got to where we are, the depth of our speed addiction, and how in some ways we can not escape the pace that has been set. James Gleick isn't telling you what to do, he just hopes you'll think about the issue."
34,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5353362-chris-overstreet,4,"Starts off very interesting, but then sort of drags and gets a bit repetitive (began with a 5 star rating; then fell to a 3 due to my waning interest; hence 4 stars). It did make me stop and think about time, though. Like, really philosophically think about it. How do I (or we as society) allocate it? How does our culture view time compared to others around the world? Is leisure time a passive or active thing? Should we really brag about working long hours?The main take-away I took from the author was that, paradoxically, modern Westerners are obsessed with saving time (jamming the elevator close button, eating breakfast bars on the go, always multi-tasking), while at the same time obsessed with working and always being productive (working overtime, not taking vacations). We should stop and reflect on how we spend our time to make sure we are spending it the way we want. If we just go through the motions of daily life, without contemplating how we're spending each moment, we'll realize in old age we've lived a life wasted. And of course then it's too late."
35,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2026132-theron,3,"Gleick catalogs numerous ways in which western culture is driven by go, go, Go! Some meme are quite funny, and insightful. Others, upon self reflection, are sad. ""So what,"" you might say after reading this book, just as I did. His conclusion, maybe lacking but I took away a few things. Every generation sees the symptoms of mania (rapid speech, racing thoughts, decreased need for sleep, hypersexuality, euphoria, impulsiveness, grandiosity, and increased interest in goal-directed activities) in themselves and the next generation. Living faster has not lived up to promise (more leisure time, whatever that means) but that's okay because we're about ""our work"". Time (as we track it, tick-tock) is a creation of man that can be traded, sold, stolen, purchased, etc. in the same way as other goods or services."

And, I admit, there was something strangely fun about imagining the world before the turn of the millenium and 9/11 and the rebirth of Apple and the smartphone and...you get the idea. It made extrapolating his points all the more exciting, because you could see how his thoughts relate to the future as it is now.Also, Gleick is an exceptional writer and has the sort of style often reserved for novelist. I enjoyed reading him and the way he framed his information through encounters,In the end, though I enjoyed the obsoleteness, the book did suffer for being 13 years out of date--my fault, not its--but it's still a provocative read about the role of time in our lives."
37,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1269880-dave-gaston,4,"I loved it. A straight forward, brief and insightful history of time. A refreshing view — to look at a measure that man invented and then obsessed upon. Prior to this read, it was too easy to think of time as a thing of nature. Gleick’s topic, is really his canvas. On it, he paints the history of progress aided by man’s inventions. For example, time from town to town was never in sync down to the minute until railroad schedules and the telegraph made it an obvious necessity. One of the optimistic theory’s of the book is, man’s obsessive desire to improve efficiency, will as a bi-product, make us a true global village.I read and wrote the above review in 2000. To Gleick's credit, 10 years later I can still recall some of his unique case studies."

An afterword in the book indicates that the book was dated before it hit shelves, so putting another 15 years on it doesn't help. In any event if you can skip references the wonders of blazing fast 500Kb internet and heavy increase in the use of fax machines and alt.net newsgroups - then there is something here for you. I enjoyed the philosophical discussion over the increase of information in our society and how that leads to an increase in a sense of time compression in our lives. Good stuff here to ponder, but ultimately this is the least of Gleick's books. If you haven't read ""The Information"" yet, go get that one.

The funny thing is he talks about the internet and mobile phones and things like that, and it was written in 1998! So it's weirdly dated. Some interesting factoids--many elevators have their 'door closed' button disabled. The button is just there to make people feel like they have something to do. People are terrible at estimating how much time they spent doing one thing or another. But the datedness was too distracting, and a lot of it was just general, well-trod rants about the good ol' days, when people would take time to smell the roses."
41,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1551258-barry,3,"Mr. Gleick throws out a topic of interest to his readers: people are trying to cram more things into their day, and he looks at some of the reasons for this as well as the consequences of it. Faster is a really neat idea, but it has a tendency to read like an essay (or investigative newspaper article) that has been filled out to book length. There is nothing inherently wrong with doing that, but the chapters tend to start fast and then plod along, straying from the theme of the chapter and book. There are several chapters that left me scratching my head over their inclusion, but it remains an interesting book and one worth reading."

His skill in presenting a thematic read is enjoyable through and through. Turns on phrases, quips and quotes, matched by insightful expertise augment a rich educational journey. As evident by the subtitle, 'The Acceleration of Just About Everything,' the world has raced on since the book was first released in 1999. Many of the references are now defunct, obsolete,...invalid. The world has not slowed down over the past fifteen years marking the validity of Gleick's observations with cruel passing. Had I read this book when it first hit the stores, I probably would have marked it as a favorite along side Toffler and Gladwell. "

No strategies to cope, only more ways to count how fast we are seemingly becoming.In the last chapter he did approach some interesting thoughts and themes, but then the book was over.Adding it to the 'read' shelf.

Unfortunately, I think that we are worse for this effect. We should take the time to enjoy music, theater, literature not try to rush through everything so that we can relax later later (which we never actually do).Unfortunately, I thought it dragged a bit near the end.

It wasn't especially riveting or alternative from other books of its class, but it offered some peculiar (And generally true) anecdotes regarding time and the human treatment of it. At its best, it allowed me to pause and reflect on my own attitude and use of things such as watches, digital clocks, elevators, telescopes even. At its worst, it was dry and a moderate bore to labor through."
53,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7558083-dave-brown,4,"Using the accessible style of a magazine article, Gleick reveals complex insights with everyday examples. Not as big a challenge as his wonderful exposition on complexity theory, Chaos: Making a New Science, this is nonetheless a useful book -- even 13 years after he wrote it. He shows clearly how little we understand time and how influential our misunderstandings are on important choices on how we live. Skim some if you must, but read the last several chapters carefully. "
54,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8184905-jordan,4,"Each chapter will deserve a second reading at some point, but after the first read I feel more informed about the stunning acceleration of our culture. In each facet of our existence, things are done for us faster and more out of sight. The book is constructed well and flows nicely from insight to insight - plane travel, communication technology, watches, ""real"" time - Gleick is a master of historical elucidation."
55,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9539808-joe-mcclure,4,"I appreciate how this book's form informs its content. Its short sentences, short chapters, breezy style, sound-bite-like phrases, and use of first-person plural and second person embody the theme of acceleration.Also, the book's outdatedness illustrates its topic. ""Faster"" was written in 1999, before Google, Facebook, Twitter, and smartphones. Things certainly have accelerated in the last 14 years."
56,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1739762-christian,5,"[Listened to audiobook] I can't imagine a book that better captures the frenetic pace of the world today. From elevators that move so quickly that they require a stop in a pressure equalizing lobby before making the rest of the trip to the 'real time' world of the Internet, Gleick once again explores the world around us in terms that are relatable and fascinating."
57,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5074389-jack-coleman,4,"Interesting look at humankinds adaptation to time and acceleration.I like these two quotes from the book. ""Joining times cattle drive"" Nicholson Baker and ""The idea that the poor should have any liesure time has always been a shock to the rich."" Bertrand RussellLibrary Loan"
58,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1564124-calen,2,"Probably had more kick in 2000, but at this point doesn't offer much insight and the extremities used as examples have since been rendered trivial at best compared to modern realities. The first sections covering the history of time keeping are the most interesting but that's likely a matter of perspective based on age."
59,067977548X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7254775-paula,2,"Lacks a thorough analysis of the core of development towards a faster-moving, time-conscious society and instead simply sums up all the aspects of current life that have become 'faster' than they were before. I know we're all time-conscious, but I want to know: why? Gleick fails to enlighten us. Boring."
