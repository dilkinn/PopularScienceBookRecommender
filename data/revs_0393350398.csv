0,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"Two excellent science writers collaborated on this book. The title describes the overall theme quite well; the origin of the universe, galaxies, stars, elements, solar systems, planets, and life. The last chapter discusses the search for extra-terrestrial life.Some of the chapters are imbued with a fun sense of humor--while others are lacking in humor, though still well-written. I wonder if the reason is that and each author tackled entire chapters, so each chapter represents the style of its author. I suspect--based on other books of his that I've read--that Tyson is the humorous writer.I enjoyed the end of Chapter 5, which describes what will happen to the universe in a hundred billion years from now: By then, the Milky Way will have coalesced with its nearest neighbors, creating one giant galaxy in the literal middle of nowhere. Our night sky will contain orbiting stars, (dead and alive) and nothing else, leaving future astrophysicists a cruel universe....Enjoy cosmology while you can. Another humorous digression starts out by mentioning that lithium has been useful as an antidepressant medication: Lithium rides down a one-way street because every star has more effective nuclear fusion reactions to destroy lithium than to create it. As a result, the cosmic supply of lithium has steadily decreased and continues to do so. If you want some, now would be a good time to acquire it. I also very much appreciated the mention of Alar and Juri Toomre, two brothers who simulated the effects of colliding galaxies. As a graduate student, I took a few excellent classes from Juri Toomre. And I remember a seminar that he gave on the subject of galaxies colliding! It's nice to encounter a professor who was influential in my life, mentioned in a popular book such as this one.I read this book in the hard-cover edition--I would recommend reading a printed edition rather than an e-book, as it contains a number of beautiful high-resolution photographs. Most of the photographs are not mentioned in the text of the book, but extensive captions help guide the reader to understand their context.I just loved the humor in the book's preface, which mentions a cartoon showing someone gazing up at the stars, and remarking,""When I look at all those stars, I'm struck by how insignificant they are""."

It's a great refresher, too, if that's your thing, and as for the tidbits like how we're figuring out and classifying the planets turning around other stars, there's even a great explanation for that, too. Hint: doppler shift. :)All in all, it's very well-written and enjoyable if not crammed with surprises. It's meant to put our feet firmly in the science of we know well and of the others, the ones we understand more or less well, we qualify that we're always on the search for new and better questions in a game of controlled ignorance. :)I totally recommend this for laymen and the curious."
2,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,2,"I wish that I could rate this book higher. I really like Neil deGrasse Tyson, and I really like this subject, but this book was... not great for me. Maybe it was the fact that I did the audio rather than reading it with my own eyeballs, but it just didn't work for me. I found the technicality off-putting. It was hard for me to focus on this book when there are just random facts and figures being thrown at my ears. I've read quite a few science books this year, and they were all interesting and entertaining and accessible, and I learned something from all of them. But this one just didn't work for me. I really WANTED to love it, but I don't think that this book is really aimed at a casual reader who has an interest in science and cosmology, because the level of technical info is pretty high. I think that there's a middle-ground possible, but this one didn't quite get there. There seems to be a lack of cohesion. Facts and data points are just thrown out there and the reader is supposed to know what to do with them. Or maybe it just really was the format... or just the wrong time for me to try to read it. It is a busy time of year and I'm way behind on my reading goals and maybe I just wasn't as focused as I should have been and missed some key things that would tie everything together. Regardless, I ended up returning the audiobook to Audible... Maybe I'll try to get this in a ebook or print form at some point down the road and see if that makes a difference in my enjoyment. "

“However, every advance in our knowledge of the cosmos has revealed that we live on a cosmic speck of dust, orbiting a mediocre star in the far suburbs of a common sort of galaxy, among a hundred billion galaxies in the universe. The news of our cosmic unimportance triggers impressive defense mechanisms in the human psyche.”
A short personal note: Forget hot actors and actresses, singers, models. If I had the chance to meet a famous person I'd totally go for Neil deGrasse Tyson. Or Michio Kaku, but preferably Tyson. Astrophysics has always been a passion of mine, even before my love for literature so this book felt like a trip to my 8-year-old self who walked around with books on astronomy and suffered from severe sleep deprivation because she prefered to watch the stars and the moon rather than sleep. I was a strange child, I realise that, antisocial except when given the chance to talk about the nightsky, that's when I came alive.This book covers an enormous period of time, fourteen billion years, and even provides some interesting thoughts concerning the future of our planet and galaxy. The theme of the book is clear, it deals with the origin of the universe, the various types of galaxies, the formation of the clusters, all the types of stars, the origin of the planets and life in general. It concerns itself with vague topics like dark matter and dark energy and black holes, all the mysteries of the universe, all that is still theory and will maybe remain a theory forever. It provides answers or at least suggests possible answer to hundreds of questions one might ask him/herself about how everything turned out the way it did. Despite the difficulty of the entire topic, it is an understandable, even fun read due to Tyson's unique sense of humour. The chapters that are less humorous are still highly enjoyable for the reason that both authors are talented when it comes to writing. Every single chapter is very well-written, elaborate and provides just enough explanations to intrigue but not confuse. I repeat, the book is not as intricate as the majority of the books that concern themselves with astrophysics, which is a great think because it is more likely that people who are generally curious pick such a book up rather than a highly scientific monster with formulas and one technical term after another. Let's be honest, people who aren't deeply ""into"" that topic will never understand a highly scientific beast, but they will easy get this one. And I think it is a good thing for it encourages people to think outside the box, to question and doubt and look for more. 
“... informed ignorance provides the natural state of mind for research scientists at the ever-shifting frontiers of knowledge. People who believe themselves ignorant of nothing have neither looked for, nor stumbled upon, the boundary between what is known and unknown in the cosmos.”
What I also appreciated was the fact that in every chapter scientists who are usually overlooked were mentioned, their theories who led other scientists to question and doubt and in the end find answers where they had never expected them to. I loved how the development of the various theories, experiments, simulations was dealt with and how one scientist's thought was based on another one's and so on and so forth back to Newton. Thus, this book provides not only an insight into the past of the universe but into the human discoveries and mentions all the important personas in this field of studies. Loved it. I hope I will find enough free-time to read Tyson's book  Death by Black Hole soon though it seems unlikely with all the required reading for university...

5,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,4,"We shall not cease from explorationAnd the end of all our exploringWill be to arrive where we startedAnd know the place for the first time . . . -- T. S. Eliot, 1942Hardly any scientific discoveries of the past century have flowed from the direct application of our senses. They came instead from the direct application of the sense-transcendent mathematics and hardware. This simple fact explains why, to the average person, relativity, particle physics, and eleven-dimensional string theory make no sense. Add to this list black holes, wormholes, and the big bang.-- Neil deGrasse Tyson, from OriginsThe universe is fascinating and complex. Despite the diligent efforts of the brightest minds of the past few centuries, no unifying ""theory of everything"" has emerged or seems likely to emerge. Instead, it seems, the more we learn about the universe, the more we find new unexplained (and seemingly unexplainable) complexities.This was really a great book for explaining our current level of understanding of the universe. I am sure that I will never be able to comprehend even a sizable percentage of what the great scientists understand about it. But likewise, I am also sure (especially after reading this book) that the great scientists are equally unable to comprehend even a sizable percentage of all that there is to know and understand. I really appreciate Neil deGrasse Tyson for his efforts to make this truly important and fascinating information more accessible and understandable to ordinary people like me."
6,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'Origins' is the best explanatory introduction to the formation and evolution of the Cosmos I have read! Co-author Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and co-author Donald Goldsmith is an astronomy writer, and in my opinion, they make a good team. The book is the most coherently arranged science book on this subject I have ever tried.It has five parts:Part I: The Origin of the UniversePart II: The Origin of Galaxies and Cosmic StructurePart III: The Origin of StarsPart IV: The Origin of PlanetsPart V: The Origin of Life (space aliens! - maybe)There are 17 chapters.I learned a great deal that I had never understood or had known about recent mainstream discoveries and theories gleaned from the Hubble Space Telescope, the Galileo spacecraft that explored Jupiter in 1995, the Cassini-Huygens  spacecraft that explored Saturn in 2004, and WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) that was launched in 2001 to study the cosmic background radiation.Oh my, but I wish that fricking James Webb Space Telescope is completed before I die...The two authors filled in many gaps in my knowledge, such as why most scientists think there was a Big Bang. A fascinating narrative in Chapter 1 'In the Beginning' mixes speculations as well as what has been gleaned from actual measurements and observations about the expansion of the Universe. I never knew about how particles and photons were so energized it took a while before the production of atoms was possible - about ten minutes into the cool down of the Big Bang.I have heard endlessly (another Universe pun, sorry) about the cosmic background radiation (CBR) which had been accidentally detected in 1965 (pigeon poop was involved) after years of predictions by respectable Big Brain scientists since the 1940's. I did not have a clue why everyone thought it was proof of the Big Bang, only that the CBR was it somehow. The CBR was a proof of concept for astrophysicists because these now currently almost evenly distributed microwave spectrum waves go back to almost the beginning of time, maybe just when the Universe was 380,000 years old. These microwaves were once ferocious gamma-ray and X-ray photons from the Big Bang. Eventually the CBR will be in the radio wave spectrum in another one hundred billion years, not microwaves photons anymore, as these photons lose more and more of their original energy from the Big Bang. Scientists can actually detect, measure and have mapped visually the CBR to the beginning of the Universe, basically, microwaves coming from everywhere, with maybe some matter/gravity gaps, because atoms began to form then and gravity began to effect what had been a particle soup.The temperature of the Universe, which scientists can measure, dropped as the size of the Universe expanded. How do they know the Universe is expanding, btw? The Doppler Effect of light! The explanation about how many ways scientists are using the Dopplar effect, such as to find exosolar planets, was astonishing!Briefly, but with the most coherent explanations I have ever read, the authors explain the creation of atoms, space dust, types of suns and galaxies, dark energy, dark matter, elements (as in the element table), and what has been learned about some of the planets and their moons.Included in the back of the book are a glossary of terms, a section for further reading, and an Index. Two sections of photos are included that add depth (sort of a pun, you know, it's all about Space) to the explanations.Heisenberg and Schrodinger are driving along the Autobahn when they are stopped by a police officer. The cop says to Heisenberg, who is driving, ""Do you know how fast you were going?!"" Heisenberg says, ""No, but I knew where I was."" ""OK, smart guy,"" says the cop, ""I'm going to search your car."" So he does, and then comes back to the window. ""Did you know you have a dead cat in a box in the truck?"" Schrodinger says, ""No, but I do now."""
7,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"DeGrasse Tyson and Goldsmith give us a wide ranging look at the beginning of everything: The universe, galaxies, stars, planets, even life itself. They discuss a myriad of topics such as: The Big Bang and cosmic inflation; how the elements are made; the structure and composition of the universe; the likelihood of alien life. With this extensive scope in a relatively short book nothing is covered in depth. For the science enthusiast who has read similar books there isn’t much new. Still I enjoyed this one. It was very well written and nicely tied together diverse concepts. I read a 2014 reissue but it was written in 2004 and had not been updated. So for descriptions of the planets and moons in our solar system or the discovery of exoplanets, the results of a decade of additional exploration are not included. Neither, of course are recent discoveries in particle physics such as the Higgs boson. Still, I think the book is a good choice for someone who just wants to read one book to survey astrophysics. Readers who have some knowledge of physics will, of course, get more out of it. While not highly technical the text is beyond introductory. The writing is pretty straight forward but there is some tongue in cheek. Science buffs may already be familiar with the story of the student science project about a risky chemical: dihydrogen monoxide. At the fair the student set out a sign that listed its dangers: A component of acid rain; can kill you if inhaled; dissolves most things it contacts; causes severe burns as a gas; found in cancerous tumors. 86% of the people who visited the booth signed a petition to ban this peril. You may know it better by its chemical notation H2O. The authors wonder if this is the real reason we can’t find water on Mars."

9,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8011527-ripu-jain,5,"When a book with the title Origins: 14 Billion Yeas of Cosmic Evolution, starts with an opening line “In the beginning, there was physics”, and is written by NDT the man himself, you cant go wrong with it. An extraordinary story needs an extraordinary story-teller, and NDT is no ordinary human - does an exceptional job translating the modern understanding of astrophysics to normal language. Its the ultimate origins story told - from origin of the universe at the moment of creation (10^-43 second after the big bang), to the exponential inflation of universe in 1st 3 minutes, to plasmaoidal era of the universe for next 300,000 years, to era of 1st particle formation and photon releases (which get stretched into CMBR waves), to formation of vast cosmic structure (thanks to gravity and dark matter and energy of empty space aka dark energy), to formation of first galaxies and supermassive black holes, to the formation of first starts and solar systems, to formation of planets and moons, and finally to origins of life itself.This is one of the few books I managed to finish within 2 weeks of starting. If a casual science enthusiast wants to read a cosmology book this year, make it this one. You will feel your brain get blown and smarter at the same time "
10,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1399578-becca,1,"I'm not actually finishing this book. I refuse. The way it's written is so off-putting. It's redundant and smarmy. The authors explained the ""photon fog"" condition of the early universe fully three times on one page and then again in the next chapter. They also managed to take shots at religion, sci-fi, and non-scientists all within the first 50 pages. And the info that they're writing about isn't even that ground-breaking; they appear to be covering theories that have been around for at least the last 20-25 years, and generally longer. Like, get over yourselves, gentlemen. Seriously. If you're looking for quality popular science writing that doesn't address you like you're a total idiot and does cover ideas that actually are new and weird and fun, check out The Elegant Universe and leave this thing on the shelf.

11,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35905360-ric,3,"It takes a lot for me to read nonfiction, I just don’t find it as enjoyable unless it’s a subject that I’m really interested in. I’ve always liked science, and Neil deGrasse Tyson’s Astrophysics For People in a Hurry was pretty good so I decided to pick this one up. It was also good, though still a very dry read. It was interesting to read about the the makeup of the universe, as well as it’s creation. And if you’re interested in this subject, you’ll probably really enjoy this book. But it’s usually tough for me to get through nonfiction, so personally I liked this book, but I wouldn’t say that I loved it. "
12,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17410563-alan-fuller,1,"In a book that is supposed to be about origins, Tyson gets on the bus at the first stop rather than at the beginning. He says that in the beginning there was physics. Okay. Where did the laws and constants found in physics come from? What a cop out!"
13,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793135-eric,2,"In the beginning, something something something happened. Here is something that sort of resembles math describing it. Here are some Greek letters, you remember those, right? Here is a confusing analogy for it. And finally, here is an attempt at a joke that makes you cringe.That's how I'm afraid I will remember ""Origins"", which I think is a shame. I like NDT, I enjoyed the PBS Nova special, and I've always been fascinated by astronomy, physics, and cosmology. The book, however, is a bit of a disappointment when held against the tremendous potential of the subject matter. NDT is best when talking with his hands, expressing with his face, and with a giant planetarium at his disposal to illustrate his point (this being one of his day jobs). Watching him and seeing his genuine enthusiasm and awe pulls you in and brings you closer to his analogies and explanations. It also helps you shrug off some of his ""scientist"" humor. In text much of this is lost, to the detriment of the poor reader. For example, his analogy that negative space is shaped ""like a saddle"" leaves you wondering, ""What? Curved up like a u? Down like an n? Both? Neither? Smelly, uncomfortable, and straddling a cosmic horse? Good God man answer me!"" Unfortunately without hands or an effective illustration to make the point clearer to a layman, you are left to shrug your shoulders and soldier onward.In my opinion the most trying chapters by far are the ones that deal with the Universe as a whole. These are also front-loaded in ""Origins"", so I found myself on page less-than-100 a looooong time. The current theories on origins, expansion, space, dark energy, dark matter, and all of the ENORMOUS issues that comprise what (some) believe to be the best explanations for it all can fill volumes- or a pamphlet. These are the kinds of topics you can summarize in a few sentences with little ""meaty"" explanation, or you can devote a lifetime of research to understand. Everything I've seen in between leaves you holding the book sideways in confusion. This is the fate of the layman, I suppose, but the book includes full-color illustrations of galaxies, nebulae, planets, and other things. Why couldn't they include conceptual diagrams to help illustrate some of these complicated topics? For cripes sake there is a picture of NDT standing with someone at Arecibo that doesn't illustrate anything at all! Cynicism tells me useful pictures would have cut into the ""Pretty picture ink/space"" that helped sell the book to those who just wanted to throw it on their coffee table without reading it, as with ""A Brief History of Time"". The discussions of the cosmological constant, fate of the Universe, dark energy/matter, gravity, other dimensions, and one thing after another give you just enough detail to want to know and understand more... and then it's off to an ending paragraph of navel-gazing, philosophizing, or a joke that rarely hits its mark.These things wouldn't be so frustrating if NDT weren't very good at what he does, inspiring wonder and curiosity in people about the Universe. For every time I got bogged down, the authors would then reveal a fascinating concept or finding. This is a half awesome, half never-gonna-finish-it book. Many of the revelations are things I had read before, with better explanations, but some people have never been exposed to certain theories. ""Origins"" does a good job of trying to organize and package a LOT of information in a single volume. This is a strength that makes it worth recommending to some, and a weakness that will leave others feeling its reach (even as a summary volume) far exceeds its grasp. For Baby Boomers who may have lost interest in science after mandatory school, the findings of the last few decades may blow their minds. This book is an excellent summary that can point the way to further reading.If you can get past the typos, that is. Simple, inexplicable mistakes like missing letters, misspellings, words, and other things even a computerized editor should have found appear everywhere. If you're going to explain to someone the origins and fate of the Universe, galaxies, stars, and planets, at least have a couple of people proofread it. Also, the thinly-veiled harping on issues like Creationism and defense of the scientific method were unnecessary. You're preaching to the choir fellas. Do you really think someone who picked up a book like ""Origins"" is going to need an explanation of why the scientific method is a valid approach? Use some of that room to flesh out more than a passing reference to topics it's pretty clear you don't feel like discussing, such as String theory, or include a blasted picture of something in the actual context where it's mentioned.If you're interested in astronomy or astrophysics I recommend buying a relatively recent used textbook over ""Origins"". It might not look as pretty or fit as conveniently on your living room bookshelf, but it will likely get you closer to the heart of a brave new world of understanding that is constantly expanding. Plus it's unlikely to have as many covert Op-Ed jabs. If that sounds a bit too daunting, pick up ""Origins"" and you'll at least get a Reader's Digest version of a very, very, VERY big picture."

And you might wonder why there had to be all these bigbang, formation of stars, planetary systems, galaxies, why the simplest of atoms had to come into being and fuse themselves into others, and why after all there is this Earth where the materials of life clumped together, evolved, and now there YOU are - living your goddam life which is next to nothing both in terms of eternity and existence! And everything is just going about their business in their taken-for-granted existence till the end comes.This has been a clean, organized piece, clear-cut and very well written indeed.

It goes into detail about how the moons of Jupiter have a liquid, salty ocean that have all the ingredients for life, we just need to get there! This is a GREAT book about the history of everything. I would put it on par and along the same lines of Short History of Nearly Everything, and A Brief History of Time. All of these are great books, but I'd say that this one is the *most* accessible to everyone. Neil has a way of explaining things so everyone can understand, without making it feel like he's belittling you or talking down to you. All of the books I listed are written by people who have a passion for the subject, but Neil is the one who makes it the most apparent how much he loves his profession and his passion for learning is contagious. Love this guy! "
16,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8740546-dan,5,"Origins was a surprisingly easy and enjoyable read. I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson and Donald Goldsmith chose an excellent theme in deciding to write this book through the lens of beginnings. This focus allowed them to cover the basics of everything from the origins of the universe to the beginning of life on earth and beyond in a concise and coherent narrative that expertly shifts the reader's focus between the everyday sensory world, the unimaginably large scale of the galaxies, and the infinitesimally small realm of quantum mechanics. Tyson's humor and wit along with his clear style of writing complement his fluency of the subjects covered and do well to elucidate a historically murky and frequently misunderstood area of science. "

18,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41567499-ashley,3,"There's so much information in this book that I'm still processing it. So in short, I'll continue to visit this book over and over again."
19,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96664-samantha,4,"Despite the complexity of the subject matter, this book was very understandable. That is one of the strengths of Neil DeGrasse Tyson's writing (and that of his writing partner in this project, Donald Goldsmith). That being said, much of the material covered in the book was still beyond my comprehension. However, since I am very interested in the ""stuff"" out there in the cosmos, I really enjoyed this book.As the title implies, the book covers topics from the very beginning of the universe to now and beyond. A lot of it is, by necessity, theoretical, though strongly based in logic and backed by mathematics. And most of it is simply amazing. For instance, regarding the very first moments of the universe:The inflationary era lasted from about 10 to the -37 second to 10 to the -33 second after the big bang. During that relatively brief stretch of time, the fabric of space and time expanded faster than light, growing in a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second from one hundred billion billion times smaller than the size of a proton to about 4 inches. Yes, the observable universe once fit within a grapefruit.Like I said, amazing. Those with more of a science and math background (or those who don't believe in the big bang) may not find this particularly impressive, but from this layperson's perspective, it was fascinating.Traveling methodically through the last 14 billion years, the authors endeavor to explain everything from the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy to how planets form to how life on Earth began to the probability of other life in the universe. The verdict? We're very probably not the only ones. Why? 'Cause the universe is just that big and it's unlikely we're the only ones out there.One of my favorite excerpts comes in the next to last chapter, ""Searching for Life in the Milky Way Galaxy."" It deals with why no advanced alien life forms have contacted us yet (UFO sightings do not count as scientific evidence):Why should they? Just what about our planet makes us special to the point that we merit attention from extraterrestrial societies, assuming that they exist? On this point more than any other, humans have consistently violated the Copernican principle [that we're not the center of the universe]. Ask anyone why Earth deserves scrutiny, and you are likely to receive a sharp, angry stare. Almost all conceptions of alien visitors to Earth, as well as a sizable part of religious dogma, rest on the unspoken, obvious conclusion that our planet and our species rank so high on the list of universal marvels that no argument is needed to support the astronomically strange contention that our speck of dust, nearly lost in its Milky Way suburb, somehow stands out like a galactic beacon, not only demanding but also receiving attention on a cosmic scale.If nothing else, this book really puts our significance in perspective. It's not saying we're not important. But our importance needs to be measured on a much smaller scale than the entire universe. There is so much out there to still be discovered, so much left to learn. To think we're the most interesting things out there is to limit imagination.And the photos included in the book are absolutely amazing, too."
20,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1603118-ryan-lawson,3,"This was a great book to contrast Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe. At face value, one would assume that both books are similar because they a) deal with physics and b) cover the universe; but it's not that simple. If there's one thing I've learned from these scientific exposés it's this (best said by Tyson himself!):""You must also find a way to reconcile two currently incompatible branches of physics: quantum mechanics (the science of the small) and general relativity (the science of the large).""So, if Greene's book was a wonderful insight into the world of quantum mechanics then Tyson's is a perfect example of general relativity in action. (Of course, Greene's manuscript is actually an attempt via string-theory to connect the two conflicting branches of physics; but it still offers a plethora of information in the ways and history of quantum mechanics, more so than general relativity.)I must say that I am more of a general relativity man myself. Quantum mechanics is too theoretical for me. That's not to say that general relativity doesn't have it's own abrasive theoretical moments, but it's all just easier for me to swallow. Neil deGrasse Tyson does a splendid job of presenting the information in a way that doesn't overwhelm the reader but also emboldens the reader's sense of intellect. This is a smart book for readers who want to survey the cosmos without becoming completely submersed in the scientific language of its theories. Perhaps, the best thing about this book (along with Greene's) is that it also gives a detailed history lesson. So, the reader not only gets to let their imaginations run wild with thoughts of deep space exploration, cosmic disasters, tumultuous beginnings, and universal existence but they also are empowered with the knowledge of who is responsible for such discoveries. This book is also filled with interesting little factoids such as:""Earth's Moon has about 1/400 of the Sun's diameter, but is also just about 1/400 as far from us as the Sun, giving the Sun and the Moon the same size on the sky--a coincidence not shared by any other plant-moon combination in the solar system, and one that grants earthlings uniquely photogenic total solar eclipses.""Something like that really makes one ponder a divine existence! It's so amazing to realize that through these scientific books I actually gain an even more confident and spiritual outlook on the universe. Origins just really gives an ultimate sense of connectivity with the cosmos. Neil covers the origins of the universe and everything within it in an exceptional, learned manner. A special addition to this text, I think, are the two sections of photographs of galaxies, planets, and stars. "
21,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680713-george,5,"This is a wonderful tour through basic astronomy into the newer, more unknown aspects of the final frontier. Those who know Mr. Tyson and his efforts to promote ""science literacy"" might not particularly fancy this. Alternatively, some may already know this information due to textbooks or being in school for the subjects.I'm one of those people who's in school for something completely unrelated to science and astronomy. While that may be the case, it did its job in informing me of things that may be harder to find in other places. I try to keep up-to-date with news from NASA and space, so now I feel like I'm more prepared for those articles on ScienceDaily and other outlets.If you're unfamiliar with astronomy this is easily one of (if not the) best sources you can come by. It's reminiscent of Carl Sagan and his works, but this has a more polished feel to it.The chapters about dark matter, black holes and the origins of the universe are fantastic. Recommended completely over everything else."
22,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85887334-reinis-simanovskis,3,Great book to give an insight on how we go from the big bang to the origination of life - which though is still quite unclear.I like Neil deGrasse Tyson quite a lot as his tv appearances are always with great style & enthusiasm - thus was a bit disappointing as had higher expectations from how his book was written. Was a bit tough to follow in the parts about galaxies & suns forming (though maybe because that's what I knew the least before) but the parts about speculations of how life can form on earth or anywhere else I enjoyed immensely.
23,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15233783-esteban,5,Deep research and terrific narrative about the origin of everything you can find in the universe from subatomic particles all the way thru intelligent life.It uses a very friendly language to go over some very complex stuff while being plagued with interesting good to know things and even some humor.I did love it.
24,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4841374-earl-grey-tea,3,"I am a fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson and got chose this book from a list on Audible during one of their buy one get one free sales.One of the things that I like about Tyson is his ability to make astronomy and cosmology approachable to the average person. Unfortunately, the first part of this book wasn't very easy for someone to wrap their head around. I took an astronomy class in college (quite a few year ago), and I was desperately trying to follow along to his explanation of the first moments of the universe as explained by the Big Bang Theory. Once the book came down to the galactic level and below, it was much more easy to follow and enjoyable. How the universe formed and what is the true shape of the universe was something that I had a hard time following right out of the gate.There is a lot of great and valuable information in this book that people can learn. However, I think the biggest issue with this book is the order in which the story of the universe is told. Instead of starting with the entire universe and moving down to the planets and their potential life forms, I think a reverse order would have been better. Start with things (planets and life) that people are familiar with. As these ideas are explained and people become more familiar with astronomical and cosmological terms and ideas, then tackling the origins of the universe would be less overwhelming to an average reader."
25,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31429894-brandon-milton,5,"It has often been said that Neil DeGrasse Tyson serves the role as the modern era Carl Sagan - A brilliant scientist with a knack for communicating passion and knowledge to others. In this collaboration with Donald Goldsmith, Tyson solidifies this idea. This book serves as an excellent introduction to knowledge about the universe, our solar system, and our current space endeavors. Although some parts may be a little technical, the information is conveyed with a casual demeanor using easy-to-understand structure. The only fault of this book is its medium. As our knowledge of the universe continues to grow, as theories advance, and as our space missions progress, the content of the book remains the same. Thus, there is some outdated information regarding the progress of certain missions, especially New Horizons.Nonetheless, the book serves as a great starting point for anyone interested in astronomy, astrophysics, or science in general. It also serves as a great afternoon read for those who wish to be continuously humbled by the fact that we are indeed just cosmic dust."
26,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7515832-jamie-therebelliousreader,4,"4 stars. Definitely enjoyed Astrophysics for People in a Hurry more than this one but it was still a really good listen. The narrator does a great job and it was very informative and interesting. I just really enjoy listening to this topic on audiobook. Don't ask me why, but it is really comforting and relaxing to me and I honestly cannot for the life of me explain why. I recommend this book if you're into the subject, but again, like with Tyson's other book, this is not a starting place or introduction into the subject of Astrophysics. You're gonna need a little bit of knowledge but even if you don't know too much about it and still want to just jump in, go for the audiobook at least. I'm looking forward to getting my hands on another audiobook by Tyson because the guy is awesome and makes what could be a very confusing subject a whole lot of fun."
27,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay,3,"For a science book that according to reviews is “accessible”, I found it a bit more challenging than I expected. I’ve read/listened to a number of pop science books over the years, and I do expect some challenges to think the concepts through if they are new. Here, I found the explanations were a mix of simple, with beautiful and funny metaphors, to complex, where the authors took multiple tacks at explanations. Certainly, part of the problem was likely that I listened to the audio version of this book. Audio does not lend itself to stopping and reflecting while reading, and from my experience here, this is one of those books that demands some reflection. Unless, of course, if it is all review for you. Then you are just reading it for the jokes and the analogies. Overall, a reasonable state-of-the-art review of cosmology."

43,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3082950-tomislav,4,"I read this very introductory science overview, because it was selected as book of the month by Goodreads' Science and Inquiry group. It was published about ten years ago, as a companion to a four part Nova series, that I own a DVD copy of. It is organized into five parts, successively exploring the origin of the universe, galaxies, stars, planets, and life. I found it to be an inspiring, if somewhat aged, overview. Below are my comments on each part:Part I: The Origin of the Universe. I found this to be somewhat repetitive with the many other cosmology overviews available. In particular, Brian Greene's The Fabric of the Cosmos is more sophisticated, while still remaining on a conceptual level. But I must admit that I felt Tyson and Goldsmith's coverage of the justification for dark matter to be exceptionally clear and concise.Part II: The Origin of Galaxies and Cosmic Structures. The authors mention that at the time of writing, the James Webb Space Telescope was scheduled to go into operation in 2011. It looks like the launch is now set for 2018. Here's the official website http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/Part III: The Origin of Stars. Nice photography!Part IV: The Origin of Planets. This book was published in 2004. At that time, slightly over 100 exoplanets had been identified by measuring the Doppler effect on the spectra of the parent stars. However, at this date, there are several thousand known exoplanets, some identified through direct observation with the Keplar Space Telescope (launched 2009). The smallest known are less than 1 Earth in size, and so understanding of the origin of planets now has a much larger and varied statistical base to work with. Those tenuous theories of planetary origin have surely evolved. This section really needs a re-write. Part V: The Origin of Life. My update here is that the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft has been exploring Saturn for the past ten years now. The Huygens Lander has photographed the surface of Titan in 2005 and confirmed theories about a landscape of solid ice eroded by liquid methane. Hydrocarbon lakes on the surface have been surveyed and even named. Secondly, a fly-by of Enceladus, a smaller moon of Saturn, has identified that it has an under-surface body of water, complete with geysers spewing salty water-ice into space. A list of potential sites of life in the solar system must now include Enceladus.Great quote at the end: We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time.-T.S. Eliot, 1942"
44,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73736815-craig-wanderer,4,"Like any book written by a World Renowned Scientist it is worth your time, however I found much of it to be somewhat redundant as it sounded very similar to ""Astrophysics for People in a Hurry"" To be fair I listened to the Audio of both and Neil read Astrophysics and someone else Origins. "
45,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,3,"At first I couldn't figure out why a book published in 2014 was so out of date; e.g., only about 100 exo-planets discovered thus far and none of them Earth-like, and only three solar system bodies worth exploring for possibility of life: Mars, Europa and Titan. What about Enceladus?Then, after I had finished the book, I discovered that it was based on the TV program that was done in 2004. My fault I guess, but I didn't see anything in the book (Kindle version) to indicate that. Of course, had I read the GR page for it I might have figured it out.This story of the evolution of the universe and our place in it is generally interesting but somewhat uneven at times, probably due to its being the product of two authors who apparently did not read each other's drafts before they produced the final version. Consequently there is a bit of redundancy. It is sprinkled with humor, which helps.For someone with an interest in this topic I would suggest looking for something both older and more recent. In the case of the older, I have a specific recommendation:The Collapsing Universe by Isaac Asimov. Carl Sagan called Asimov ""the Great Explainer"" (high praise indeed). Asimov tells much the same story as the first half of this book but in the reverse order, and without the benefit of discoveries after its 1977 publication, such as inflation theory and the confirmation of dark matter and dark energy. It's a wonderful books that brings out details missing in this one."
46,0393350398,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20111112-berry-muhl,5,"I put aside my reservations about Tyson, the political mouthpiece, long enough to read this book, which is sort of a Cosmos for the current generation (born in a similar way, as a compilation of essays culled for inclusion in a television miniseries).It's a pretty thorough narrative of the history of the universe, from just post-Bang up until relatively recent (the origin of life, circa 3.8 billion BC) times. Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan have covered much of this territory already in their own popular writings, but this one has a clear narrative thread tying it all together. It's got all the science you might need, though none of the math (and relatively little time is spent covering highly theoretical topics such as string theory).I don't know how the writing duties were divided up, but I'm assuming that Tyson does most of the actual scripting. He's pretty good at prose, although sometimes his word choice appears a bit amateurish. This foray dates from 2004, so presumably he's improving over time. (I've just started a follow-up volume, Death by Black Hole, which begins with the same essay with which Origins ends. Stay tuned.)"

Yes, I mugged up the periodic table in school but found it super interesting after reading this book. Science is the only solution/answer/path to the growth and progress of mankind and I wish it was taught in schools like the way it is explained in these kind of books. Same thing goes for Math, rather than teaching us 100 real/modern analysis theorems teach us just 10 and explain it's application in the real world. Anyway it goes without saying, I loved the book."

The universe, the solar system, our own planet, life, and a good deal else. This book was written in 2004, so some things have already changed. For instance, Pluto and Ceres are now officially dwarf planets, and we know more about the moons of Jupiter and Saturn than we did eleven years ago. This is still a good, solid, interesting book, that will expand your knowledge of the universe we live in. It's a great read, or a great listen. I don't think I'm off base in saying that while Kevin Kenerly's voice doesn't really sound like Tyson's, he does have Tyson's speech patterns down, and for me that enhanced the listening experience.Recommended."

Written with humor and in a conversational tone, the authors made that which is inaccessible just a bit more accessible for those of us who are not aspiring astrophysicists. What I admire about this book is the author's simultaneous acceptance of what we do not yet know (mystery) with the scientist's ever-hungry pursuit to know and discover more. DeGrasse Tyson accepts and admits frankly that there is so much we don't know. It is never stated defensively or with an attitude, just plain honestly. I admired this lack of attitude or ego in the writing. Well worth the listen (audiobook) or read, taken slowly. A truly humbling look at the universe and our place in it."

There was so much interesting information, neat little tidbits, and fun ways of thinking about the universe. A book like this doesn't HAVE to be fun, I suppose. But it was fun.

This is not a drawback of the book, but a feature. If the reader is satisfied with the summarized explanation of the authors, he can keep reading the book. On the other hand, more demanding readers can search for details in other sources. This keep the book simple and enjoyable for the majority of readers.

This book explains so many grand ideas on how scientists have come to the conclusions of how old our universe is and reveals the many things that they do not understand with our current knowledge and technology. This is a heavy book; many of the concepts and ideas require deep thought and/or a (semi) advanced understanding of scientific ideas, so it's not going to be for everybody.
