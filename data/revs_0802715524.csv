0,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350233-casey,3,"This book should really be called ""A History of the Western World in 6 Glasses,"" as it doesn't consider the drinks of South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, and much of Asia. Indeed, tea is considered only through the lens of the British empire, even though the formal Japanese tea service is arguably more interesting than a British tea party. Even as a Western history, it kind of fails, as there's a large gap between wine production in the Roman empire and the distillation of rum in Barbados. This can only be viewed as a surface history of the world, but as far as surface stories go, it's pretty interesting.Throughout the book, Standage tells the history of six beverages (beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola) as they appeared in the historical record. This is actually not so great, as the book ends up talking about beer without ever mentioning Germany, and wine without ever mentioning France or California. Instead of bringing it all back together in the epilogue, he just rambles on about bottled water and (randomly) colonizing Mars.The book also contains a shockingly uncritical depiction of the Coca-Cola company, which creatives a ""beverage"" that can best be described as a noxious substance that no one should be consuming, especially not on a regular basis. Unfortunately, the health effects of soda are not discussed.I'd recommend A History of the World in 6 Glasses only to those interested in culinary history and esoterica. History buffs and general readers should skip this one."

But, how did people throughout history quench their literal thirst and how do the beverage choices made throughout history help define the advancements the world has seen since its inception? Tom Standage seeks to answer these and many other questions as he examines how six beverages (beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola) help to explain global advancements since humans first inhabited the earth. Standage takes readers as far back as possible to explore how beer could have influenced history so completely. A combination of water and cereal grains, beer was an accidental discovery that exemplifies the sedentary nature of humans. Crops took time to grow and required people to stay in one place for a period of time. The fermentation process also took a period to develop, which required people not to roam freely across the land. Beer could be made and consumed by anyone, which differed greatly from wine. More of a high-class beverage, wine was much more complex to make and costly to consume. As Standage explains, it was developed by the Romans and Athenians, who modified it and created lavish drinking parties around its consumption. Standage also argues that wine helped propel Christianity around the world, as the beverage is at the heart of the religion’s central symbolic theme of the Blood of Christ. Moving from simple fermentation to a more complex system called distillation, spirits came onto the scene and served to propel the world ahead even more. With use of scientific brewing and the addition of sugar to help the naturally impeded yeasts found in fruits or grains, spirits were a more complex and fiery beverage. The need for sugars helped to foster its cultivation, which was back-breaking work. What better way to have sugar harvested than through the use of slaves, which Standage explains helped bring spirits to the New World. Caribbean sugar cane was cultivated by African slaves, creating a tumultuous time in history to facilitate the creation of many new and interesting beverages. An equally popular drink in the form of coffee emerged, which created an enlightenment of sorts. Coffee became the drink of academics and the intellectual, as they would gather to discuss their ideas at coffee houses well in the night. The fostering of discussions, much as wine had done for the Romans and Athenians, came from coffee and, to this day, the correlation between the beverage and higher understanding is accepted. Tea, on the other hand, proved not only to be a drink that brought about medicinal properties, but helped Britain cement its power in the world. While the British Empire gained in importance, the British East India Company developed a worldwide supply of tea and marketed it as best as possible. This power remained strong for centuries, as the British remained at its centre. However, all good things must be replaced with something else, leaving Coca-Cola to move from a pharmaceutical remedy to the drink of America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its production skyrocketed and was soon symbolic of America, which developed into freedom before long. American troops all over the world sought the beverage and wherever the US military found itself, freedom was said to be as well. Standage talks at length about the Soviet push-back against Coca-Cola, though the Iron Curtain was no match for the power of the mighty soda pop. In a book that leaves the reader’s head spinning as they reach for their beverage of choice, one can only wonder what the next big drink will be, and how its impact will shape the future. Standage posits his guess in the epilogue, but you’ll have to read to find out. Recommended to those who love history told through a unique lens, as well as the reader who loves to learn as they are entertained.I quite enjoy looking at history and world events through unorthodox means, particularly when I had not thought to do so myself. Tom Standage does a masterful job at creating this perspective and fills this book with a great deal of information that can be interpreted in many ways. While I only skimmed the surface of his discussions in the paragraph above, the fact that six mere beverages can truly tell so much about how humans have evolved over time is amazing. Standage uses concrete examples to substantiate his arguments and keeps the discussion interesting at all turns. He has little concern about offending, as he speaks openly and frankly at every turn. His attention to detail is like few other books I have read in the past and the fact that topics flow so easily makes the book even more interesting. With twelve strong chapters (two on each beverage), Standage explores the history of the beverage and then discusses its social, political, and economic impact on the world. This permits the reader to better understand his arguments and almost demands taking a step back to see how the pieces all come together. I am pleasantly surprised about how ensconced I was with the arguments presented and can only hope that his other works on the subject of world history are just as captivating. Now then, I need a Guinness to synthesise some of what I read... or maybe a dark roast coffee.... no, a strong tea! Well, while I decide, go find this book and see what you think for yourself.Kudos, Mr. Standage, for an amazing read. I can only hope other adventurous readers take the time and enjoy this as much as I have.Love/hate the review?

2,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,4,An interesting and engaging way to learn about history. I found it fascinating. Will look on these beverages through new lenses now.
3,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1700721-domenico,4,"I seem to be in a phase where I like books that show me the hidden life of the everyday things all around us, especially food and drink. A few years ago I read ""Heat: An Amateur's Adventures as Kitchen Slave, Line Cook, Pasta-Maker, and Apprentice to a Dante-Quoting Butcher in Tuscany"", by Bill Buford, which started me on this quest, which was followed by several more books, including ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"", by Michael Pollan. Most recently I read ""The Search for God and Guinness"", by Stephen Mansfield.Now, I've finished ""A History of the World in 6 Glasses"", by Tom Standage, which connects the span of human history to 6 different beverages that affected history culturally, politically, anthropologically, nutritionally, and economically. The six, in rough order of their era of greatest influence, are beer, wine, whiskey, coffee, tea, and cola. More broadly, you could have called the book ""A History of the World in Two Brain-Altering Chemicals: Alcohol and Caffeine.""It is a fascinating look at how these drinks sometimes have been responsible for pivotal moments in history, causing one civilization to rise and another to fall. While human affairs are much more complicated than one factor can explain, we can't deny that one of the reasons ancient tribes turned from peripatetic hunting-gathering to more stationary agriculture was the need to cultivate grains for beer, for instance. (Standage points out that of course the grains were also used for bread too, but bread and beer were nearly interchangeable in most places, two phases of cooking of the same product. Beer was ""liquid bread"" and bread was ""solid beer."")Most the drinks had origins--or at least early primary uses--in religious rituals, especially beer, wine, coffee, and tea. Whiskey and cola, which were much more modern inventions were just consumer products. Eventually, all of them made the leap to common use. What made them significant was their eventual ubiquity, even if at first they were reserved to the elites.There were also some very interesting anecdotes, such as the story of how coffee came to Europe from the Middle East. Some theologians rejected it as a Muslim invention, thus of the devil, while others embraced. So a decision had to be made.Shortly before his death in 1605, Pope Clement VIII was asked to state the Catholic church's position on coffee. At the time, the drink was a novelty little known in Europe except among botanists and medical men, including those at the University of Padua, a leading center for medical research. Coffee's religious opponents argued that coffee was evil: They contended that since Muslims were unable to drink wine, the holy drink of Christians, the devil had punished them with coffee instead. But the pope had the final say. A Venetian merchant provided a small sample for inspection, and Clement decided to taste the new drink before making his decision. The story goes that he was so enchanted by its taste and aroma that he approved its consumption by Christians.Other sources claim he said: ""This devil's drink is so delicious...we should cheat the devil by baptizing it."" True or not, I will be sure to thank Pope Clement VIII and pray for him every day over my morning cup of joe.Another interesting tidbit concerned the importance of tea to the Industrial Revolution in Britain in the 18th and 19th century. As labor became less about individual craftsmen and more about unskilled workers who could maintain machines in monotonous repitition over long hours, tea and tea breaks helped them to remain alert and concentrate. Likewise, even as the factory workers were gathering together in closer working and living conditions, waterborne illnesses became almost extinct, not just due to the boiling of water for tea, but for the phenolic acids--the tannins--in the tea itself.Infants benefited too, since the antibacterial phenolics in tea pass easily into the breast milk of nursing mothers. This lowered infant mortality and provided a large labor pool just as the Industrial Revolution took hold.In fact, every one of the six drinks was considered for both their positive and negative effects on society. Coffee led to 16th-century coffeehouses that were the locus of the Scientific Revolution that led to the Enlightenment, democracy, free-market economics, and more. The Chinese stranglehold on tea production and insistence on Westerners buying it with silver, not trading it for Western goods, led to the creation of the opium trade from India that eventually destabilized China in the 19th century, which last through the 20th century until the rise of Communism.While these six beverages can't be said to have caused the most important and decisive moments of history, they often played significant roles in moments that caused the course of history to go in one direction and not the other. If not for the wine it exported, would Greece have risen to a great culture that brought us philosophy and so much else?Without tea or rum/whiskey, would Great Britain have become the empire on whose flag the sun never sets? Maybe, maybe in a different form or in a different time, but undoubtedly different.""A History of the World in Six Glasses"" was a fun and quick read that makes me want to delve more into the various individual elements it presents. Which is the best kind of book, isn't it?"
4,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,5,"I noticed this book on a few friend's 'to-read' lists and thought I should write a review on it since I have read it a few years back and it is still very much part of our family's proud ...intellectual history...8-)We do not realize how necessary fluids are for our survival. As Tom Standage states, we can live without food for quite a while, but will die very soon of fluid deprivation. In fact, aren't we looking for water on Mars before we migrate there? :-)) Initially I did not plan to buy this book. I was trying to find ""The Devil's Cup: A History of the World According to Coffee"" by Stewart Lee Allen. Tom Standage divided the history of the world into six periods, each forming a different chapter in the book: Beer in Mesopotamia and Egypt; Wine in Greece and Rome; Spirits in the Colonial Period; Coffee in the Age of Reason; Tea and the British empire; Coca-Cola and the Rise of America. Three are alcohol beverages and three caffeine. The idea for the book came to Tom Standage 'while reading an article in my Sunday newspaper about a wine said to have been one of Napoleon's favourites during exile: Vin de Constance. It is a sweet wine, made in the Constantia region of South Africa, which was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. In Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, the heroine is advised to drink it because of it's 'healing powers on a disappointed heart'. Charles Dickens also mentions the wine, referring in The Mystery of Edwin Drood to 'the support embodied in a glass of Constantia and a home-made biscuit'.""There is perhaps a more subtle, unintentional, humor buried in the amazing facts, and the reader needs to concentrate. It can cramp the reader's style a bit on the think-tank. So much so that I personally often fell asleep and had to reread everything in a new session, which made it tedious in some instances. But the facts are worth learning! It certainly sheds a bright new light on world history. The book is so laden with information that I found it too much to absorb in one sitting. For instance: the ancient old tea culture of the Chinese which was only discovered hundreds of years later by the Brits, changed the latter's foreign policy forever; brandy and rum, developed from the Arabian knowledge of chemistry , inspired the age of Exploration; Greeks spread their influence through their exports of wine all over the world.The book encourage thought. Slavery, wars and sanctions were often fueled by some of these beverages. Reading it all in one book, from Tom Standage's perspective, turns these facts into eye-openers. For instance: P 80: ""...herbs, honey and other additives were commonly added to lesser wines to conceal imperfections. Some Romans even carried herbs and other flavorings with them while traveling, to improve the taste of bad wine.While modern wine drinkers may turn op their noses at the Greek and Roman use of additives, it is not that different from the modern use of oak as flavoring agent, often to make otherwise unremarkable wines more palatable.Below these adulterated wines was posca, a drink made by mixing water with wine that had turned sour and vinegarlike. Posca was commonly 	issued to Roman soldiers when better wines were unavailable, for example,during long campaigns. It was, in effect, a form of portable 	water-purification technology for the Roman army. When a Roman soldier offered Jesus Christ a sponge dipped in wine during his crucifixion, the wine in question would have been posca.""The location where you read the book does not matter. What is more important is that the information shared in the book ensures long relaxing discussion on a Sunday afternoon with friends and family. It gives some mundane moments the more meaningful memories it needs. I initially gave it three stars only because it was not an easy read. I really needed to keep all my ducks in a row for this one. But in retrospect I changed my mind. His research was excellent! It is a good read for someone who wants to know how the development of chemistry from ancient times until now changed our world - in an easy, non-scientific, but factual read. It is the only book I offer to guest to take to bed with them! "
5,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4907861-stefan-burrell,4,"This book, I've read twice. It takes you from the formation of beer and society in Mesopotamia, to the use of wine as currency and how wine types represented a social classification system in Greece and Rome. It went through spirits and colonial time: We only have whiskey because it took too long to ship scotch and brandy by wagon out west, so we made corn whiskey. To how coffee was at first banned in Muslim society and called black wine - till they figured that it caused a different state of mind than actual alcohol. To the use of tea as a way to stay hydrated in England, the city was packed full and the water was not the cleanest. Once coffee arrived in England, there were coffee houses for men only because they were a place to smoke and talk politics while drinking coffee. Women in England had tea gardens, nice gardens where they could walk, talk or sit and drink tea. The book wrapped up in the time of just after WWII, granting Coca-Cola responsible as the first company to be globalized. The factories were built in American forts during the war so that the soldier could have coca-cola to drink, when WWII was over the factories remained. Then it dipped a bit to the Cold War as Coke played around with Invisible Coke and than landed at being Coca-Cola Classic, the original recipe minus the cocaine. "
6,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912138-alex-givant,5,"Excellent book about 6 drinks (beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Cola) that impacted live of mankind through different ages."
7,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,0,"An interesting way of breaking history up by beer, wine, whiskey, coffee, tea, & cola. Each came into its own in our history & may well have driven it in some ways. The basic idea along with a thumbnail of each is laid out in the introduction pretty well. Well enough that I didn't want to continue listening after about half the first section on beer. I didn't care much for the narrator & that wasn't helped by repetitious writing. This would probably be a great book to read, though.It's doubtful, but I might get back to it at some point. "
8,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23377915-xxertz,3,"It is funny how we prefer certain aspects of books. Another review here enjoyed the non-alcoholic drinks better than the alcoholic drinks due to the amount of history and economics it covered, but I found the alcohol drinks to be far more interesting, in depth, and entertaining. Overall, I liked this book and learned a lot about how these drinks affected trade and became popular worldwide."
9,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2173066-patrick-peterson,3,"23 Feb 2015 - I read this book since my son recommended it to me, while he was reading it for his World History AP class this year. I see why he liked it and I generally did too. It is fun and breezy and covers some fascinating ground that is indeed important, and grossly undercovered in most books or courses in history.However, the book is a bit presumptuous in stating it is a “History of the World…” or that the six drinks have “defined humankind’s past.” Neither statement is totally true, except in a very loose way, but that should not stop one from reading it.While refreshingly more open to an objective view of history regarding capitalism, free markets and property rights, than many (most?) history books, the author still promoted some completely foolish ideas by giving them equal or more time vs. sound ideas and facts.The author needs to explore the idea that all these beverages are/were, in effect, private, not ""public"" or government created or owned. His epilogue could have been far more informed and informative on the subject of the modern situation of water issues. If he had explored the crucial nature of privatization in man's need for a quality beverage that does not poison him/her, is of reasonable expense and is available to but not wasted by virtually everyone.The definition of imperialism is likewise not one of the strong suits of the author. His never defining it clearly but none-the-less using its corrupted meaning by communist ideology was very unhelpful. He only tacitly used a definition that has twisted the word with pretzel logic to include non-coercive private firms' actions (but NOT include Soviet or other communist foreign aggression). That is worse than just sad. He is not as bad as many on this score, since he also made fun of the various communist groups' ridiculous attacks on Coca-Cola, much to the detriment of their comrade citizens in the various countries he names. But still, being muddled on this important concept has significant repercussions.There are other words, incidents, trends, etc. that the author could help the reader by not using, or at least defining carefully (‘consumerism,’ for one), but I just state again, the book has lots to recommend it and I enjoyed and learned a bunch from it overall. It is well written, fun and funny and I recommend it overall."
10,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91339-jonathan,3,"6 Glasses zeroes in on six liquids--from beer in ancient Mesopotamia to wine and spirits to coffee and tea and finally to cola and the globalization of brands such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola--and targets each as being responsible (or at least culpable) for the shaping of cultures (quite likely), writing itself (quite possible), and industrialization (believable, especially in light of Coke).Each of the libations receives its proper dues. The organization of the book itself is very well done, and the anecdotes and histories of each are engaging.The sad irony about 6 Glasses--and it's a rather important one--is that, for all its talk, the book is remarkably dry. Sure, Standage gets wittier than in the opening section on beer, and notably in the chapters on wine and cola, which seem his obvious liquids of choice, but this reader's reserves were nearly sapped after finishing the pages about beer.He does a bang-up job with his research and presentation in some parts of this book, frames his passages well, and, honestly, the pictures really do help.""Quickly, bring me a beaker of wine, so that I may wet my mind and say something clever,"" Aristophanes reports to us as the section on wine commences. One wishes that Standage had called for just that. Perhaps it would have made for a more intriguing read."
11,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/160042-starry,5,"I saw this in my sister's to-read list and, boy, am I glad! This was a really fun book to read. For me. It was not so fun for my husband, who was stuck sitting next to me and hearing, ""Hey, listen to this --"" and ""Here's something interesting --"". But now I'm done, so he can read all the little leftover bits where I managed to hold my tongue and let him enjoy his own book (which probably wasn't half so interesting).The book attempts to tell the history of the world using six beverages that illustrate the social and political doings of the day: beer (the cultivation of grains), wine (rise of Greek and Roman culture), distilled liquor (sea travel and colonialism), coffee (Age of Reason), tea (British Empire), and Coca-Cola (rise of capitalism, American power and influence). It's a clever way to tell a story. Although history is told from the typical Euro-centric viewpoint in this book, the beverages and their backstories have impressively global origins: coffee originally from Arabia, tea from Asia, the cocoa and kola from South America and Africa. And some of ingredients' stories, told partly and in passing, would also be very interesting on their own: sugarcane and chocolate, for instance."
12,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,3,"Pop non-fiction with clever gimmick of six beverages to summarize world history. Plenty of interesting factoids. One problem is that the flip side of the cleverness of the gimmick is that all sorts of beverages are left out. The human consumption of animal milk, for example, is an interesting story with important implications but we don't learn about that. Another problem is that the research does not appear to be very deep and so some of the factoids don't seem to be true. For example, tea is credited with protecting the English from bacterial disease around the time of the industrial revolution. But that is when mortality was the highest overall, and if one looks at specific outbreaks like the great cholera epidemic of John Snow fame, it was specifically the beer drinkers who were spared. It makes some theoretical sense that tea should be helpful but that's different from there being any actual evidence of that. The book edges beyond cocktail-party chatter to serious stuff at the end in a polemic about water."
13,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42245818-zo,5,"As someone who's never really enjoyed ""proper"" history, I'm always surprised when I find myself enjoying a history book. This managed to both entertain and educate me, because with just the 6 drinks highlighted the author managed to create a brief history of civilisation as we know it. It really is amazing how much the fashions for certain drinks (and/or the lack of taxation on certain drinks) has shaped the world! I think the last chapter, on CocaCola, let the book down slightly though. For the first five drinks, Standage made a fairly convincing argument that they did indeed change the course of human history, however CocaCola is used more as an example of the modern world, not a factor in creating it. It is a good example though, as you will see if you read the book!I zoomed through this in a couple of days, and I'm even considering re-reading it, but this time taking notes ;)"
14,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269609-spookysoto,4,"This was a great book. If you're interested in history and beverages I highly recommend it to you.It explores world history from the point of view of the discovery and consumption of several key beverages: beer, wine, rum, coffee, tea and cola. I learned a lot. My favorite chapters were the ones about coffee.I recommend it, specially in audiobook format."
15,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4265436-nicole,4,"I enjoyed this overview of six influential and historically important beverages throughout human history. This is a very broad, surface-level overview, but that's not a bad thing! I liked how the author focused on each beverage in regards to a specific time/place. It's inspired me to try and read further about these topics."
16,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21198579-mary-catelli,5,"This got recommended at Lunacon at more than one panel I was at. The title is a bit hyperbolic. The six drinks discussed are indeed significant in the history of beverages, and their adoption occured at otherwise historically significant times, but sometimes they were just harbringers, or even merely coinciding -- though sometimes they were indeed movers and shakers in history. Then, the drinks by themselves can be fascinating.Beer is the first, and obviously, the least well-documented, since it predates writing. We don't even know if mead or wine might have been actually first. But we have archeological evidence of humanity's beginning to harvest grains and store them, and soon after, they must have made two discoveries. One is that grain that is wetted and allowed to start sprouting becomes sweet -- a rare treat in that time. The other was that a mix of water and grain would, after a few days, become alcoholic. Great stuff, because it was safer than water to drink, and when drunk before the fermentation ended, would contain suspended yeast, full of good nutrition. ""Beer and bread"" were standard for laborers, and Enkidu's savage state was marked by a lack of knowledge of those two dishes. Beer making advanced with such discoveries as keeping on using the same tub made better beer -- it would contain yeast from the last time. And we have very early pictures of two men drinking from a pot with straws, necessarily because of all the flotsam in the drink. Mesopatmia treated drunkness more humorously, and Egypt more gravely, with many injunctions against it, but both civilizations drank. (I think some of this is more speculative than it is treated.)Later, they also started to drink ""the beer of the mountains"" or wine. There was a time when it was fantasically expensive, and people would float it down river from the mountains and then break up the rafts and sell them for a tenth of what they had originally cost, because the price of the wine would justify it, and for a few centuries it was tribute, but it grew less expensive, partly because the Greeks were shipping it everywhere. (Whereupon he goes into the technicalities of feasting and wine with Romans and Greeks -- the Romans would graduate the vintages at a feast by status, and once a man was caught because his host sent out a slave to buy a better vintage because he could not give his high status guest his own wine.) And the continuation of wine throughout the Middle Ages.Which also saw the development of alchemy, and the refinement of distilling arts until we get spirits. And its connection with the slave trade. And its discovery of rum -- handily made from the byproducts of making sugar. Great Britain tried to ban the importation of molasses from the French islands to the American colonies, which would have raised prices and limited supplies, because the molasses from the British islands was not only inferior but insufficient for the amount of rum drunk. Not that America didn't have its own problems, especially when people inland began turning to whisky, which needed local, not imported, ingredients.Coffee was discovered in Arabia, where some people tried to ban it as an intoxicant for its mental effects. And spread to Europe despite horrors from occasional physicians. Boiling the water made it, like all the alcoholic drinks, safer than water, and it was very popular with the information classes of the day, the expanding class of clerks, for instance. Coffee houses became important centers of trade and discussion, and even scientific lectures. The Stock Exchange began in a coffee house, though they had to leave when a broker complained of exclusion from a public location.Tea was introduced to England by Charles II's bride, and it took a while to really take off, because it was more expensive, but it did manage. It was even better than coffee, because of its anti-bacterial properties which meant that even boiling the water had some help. The age of its discovery in China was somewhat exaggerated in the records, and for a time under the Monguls, it was not as important because the emperors prefered their own drinks, but it spread again after that dynasty. It also spread in England, where a merchant named Twinings actually opened a tea store next to his coffee shop so women, who couldn't go into the coffee shop, could buy the tea. His company's logo is still in use -- the oldest continually used logo. Tea lead to other effects, too, such as that which the tea tax had the American colonies (though it didn't cause tea to be supplanted by coffee, because the supply was restored after the war ended, and not until the mid-nineteenth century did coffee take over), and the opium trade to China, because the East India Company was finding the rising price of silver cutting into its profits, and China was not interested in other goods. And then the company began to raise tea in India, devastating the China tea trade, and contributing to China's instability.And finally there is Coca-Cola, originally a patent medicine made by a man who promulgated a lot of them, and urgently needed a temperance one -- without alcohol. It depended on the invention of sparkling waters, which were first treated as medicinal, and then sold with flavors but still with the virtuous aura. It's no accident that soda fountains were a feature of drug stories. Coca-Cola spread quickly part because they just sold the syrup and the druggists loved it. Then, as a headache remedy, it had an intristically limited audience. It went for Refreshing, instead. The Pure Food and Drug Act at first looked good for it, removing some rivals, but then there was a big law suit accusing it of being contaminated by containing caffeine -- and sold to children, even, unlike tea or coffee. They won. The judge ruled that it was not a contaminant because it was part of the recipe. Still, Coca-Cola agreed not to use children in its ads, which help explain its use of Santa Claus in ads. Whereupon it managed to weather the repeal of Prohibition, and the Depression, and a new rival, During World War II, they were setting up plants on the military bases so that service men could get it as the standard price.It concludes with an epilogue about bottled water -- back to the beginning, when we had no other beverages.There have been a lot of interesting wrinkles in the history of drinks."
17,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16181797-wayland-smith,4,"I read about this book and was interested in the concept. How have various drinks helped shape human history? I wasn't sure what to expect, but what I got was a light read that was entertaining and informative. Discussed are beer, wine, rum, coffee, tea, and Coke. I know it sounds like a weird and random assortment, but the author makes it work. Beer was one of the first drinks mankind made, and some theories about how it happened, ancient stories about it, and its importance to ancient cultures are all covered. Next up is wine, which the author mostly associates with the Greek and Roman peoples. Rum played a big part in the slave trade and, as an aside, he throws in the Whiskey Rebellion, a little-known sequel to the American Revolution. Coffee started in Arab lands, was brought East by traders, and then coffeehouses became all the rage, and had something to do with such diverse things as Newton's Theory of Gravity and the French Revolution. Tea is big in the histories of China, England, and India, and he talks about how it became THE English drink, and the link to the Opium Wars. To wrap it up, what modern drink could sum up the 20th century better than Coca Cola? It's an interesting read, and not really taxing to follow. I enjoyed it, and if you like learning history in a slightly different way, you may as well. "
18,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4782633-jon-biggerstaff,4,"I enjoy history. I enjoy libations. Standage combines them both to wield a fascinating book on how 6 distinct beverages helped to shape and, at times, even define a time-period. From the Neolithic period and how the Mesopotamians stumbled into making beer, to the Industrial Revolution and the rise of Coca-Cola, it impresses the idea that beverages were not simply for enjoyment but were often catalysts of change in our society and in global influence."
19,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204691-ryan,5,"This was a lot of fun. Tom Standage is a writer for The Economist, and this book, A History of the World in 6 glasses, reads well. It takes you through 6 chapters dedicated to: beer, wine, distilled spirits, coffee, tea, and Coke. Beer was a big part of the development of domestication and agriculture, and he goes through how it probably developed and what customs still survive. Beer used to be drunk from one huge jar, and everyone would use a straw, so it was a very communal thing - one of the antecedents of the modern ""cheers."" Wine he takes through its discovery and the Greek and Roman preference for it. Did you know that ""strong wine"" for them was a mixture of 2 parts water to 1 part wine? Only insane cultures and Gods drank unadulterated wine without mixing a lot of water with it. The distilled spirits chapter followed the exploration of the world, sea voyages, and increasing international trade. Rum became a standard daily ration on British Navy vessels, and because they drank it with sugar and lime juice (called grog), sailors stopped getting scurvy. The French sailors, who still drank brandy every day, were more scurvy prone, and Standage attributes some of the Royal Navy's successes to the disappearance of scurvy. Coffee is important in terms of the Enlightenment and waking up a population that drank beer, wine, and liquor all the time (water was too unsanitary). Once coffee's popularity took hold, and people could drink something that didn't make them inebriated and actually gave them energy and focus, coffeehouses turned into meccas of discovery, discussion, business and science. Newton was inspired to invent calculus after a friend had made a bet at a coffee house about the elliptical orbits of planets. And the dubious story of Gabriel de Clieu is just funny, true or not: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_...Tea was another import from Asia (coffee came from the Middle East) that caught on in Britain and followed the development of the colonial system. The British imported their tea from China, not knowing how it was harvested. Once they got their hands on some of the actual plants and began cultivation in India, the British East India Company became a very powerful entity in the region with armies, government-like powers, and a huge influence on Parliament. And Coke brings you to the present, where corporations, branding, globalization, and the relationship between business and government can be explored in an interesting way through the development of Coca-Cola. I don't drink it myself, but if I did, I'd really be interested in how it came about and how the company has operated for the last century.It's all fascinating, I'd encourage anyone to read it. The contextual treatment of world history was very easily absorbed. For instance, his explanation of the actual reasons Bostonians held the Boston Tea Party would make certain parts of the conservative movement think twice about their ideological mascot - the Tea Act was actually a move to lower taxes but also gave the British East India Company a monopoly to export tea to the colonies. The Tea Party is more of a lesson in the dangers of ties between government and business than a pat anti-tax catchphrase. You'll never look at your glass, mug, bottle, or tumbler the same way ever again."
20,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia,4,"Where has this book for the last decade having not been read by me? I'm so grateful for a social studies teacher's recommendation as I haven't heard of it but was completely fascinated by the concept of the book and the story itself. Essentially vignettes that focus on six drinks and how the world: religion, politics, science, economics, and socialization changed as a result of their discovery or innovation. I liked that this book was straightforward in its storytelling, using a basic explanation of the politics so that even someone like me can understand it and the drink's impact on that political conversation. Obviously I have my particular favorites (beer and tea) but there was so much enriching information about locations and countries in all of them and how things like coffeehouses evolved and essentially became post offices and intellectual exchanges. Symposiums and wine? Peace treaties and Pepsi.Just a fascinating peak behind the curtain using something as (sometimes thought to be) innocuous but the elixir of life! Plus I liked how he had it come full circle because it is so true (even more true than it was written 12ish years ago) that water is now the topic of most conversations. "

22,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,3,"I would probably not have picked this book to read if it were up to me, because I tend to prefer books that go a bit more in-depth on a topic. After all, I read an entire book about one kind of fish (Cod: A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World). This was the holiday read for my in-person international book club, so I was able to breeze through it over the holidays. The author gives a brief overview of the history of six beverages - beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and... Coca-Cola. Yeah, the last one was a surprise to me too. I would have expected chocolate or water. He includes a bit about water in the wrap-up, but not really what you would expect.I did learn some surprising things. Beer and the discovery of fermented grains may have been a driving force behind moving away from hunter-gatherer society and toward cultivation. They know exactly what kind of wine Julius Caesar drank, and what type would have been on the sponge raised up to Jesus during the crucifixion (those Romans and their records!). The author does a decent job of research although every once in a while he surprises the reader with an overly strong opinion about something. He does NOT APPRECIATE drug addiction or using drugs to control people, and said so in situations about the opium trade (related to tea). I remember that moment because it didn't match the tone of the rest of the book, which I would call popular scholarship."
23,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4413597-praxedes,3,"It is possible to view history through almost any lens...in this case the author chose drinks to tell a story of the world's development. Filled with interesting facts and carefully researched, the author deftly recounts human/political/religious events from the perspective of six different drinks. Interestingly, half of them contain no alcohol!I would have rated it higher were it not for the sometimes confusing prose. Transitional phrases from one subtopic to the next did not have the flow needed to cover such an enormous time span seamlessly. But I would definitely recommend it."
24,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4674014-marquise,3,"3.5 stars. This book purports to tell the history of six iconic drinks in world history and how they were spread all over the world hand-in-hand with trade and conquest/colonialism, and as an introductory & popular history book, it fulfills its role just fine. I think those reviewers complaining about the lack of depth and stuff like ""where's Germany for the beer section?"" and ""Where's France and California for wine history?"" and ""large gaps between wine in Rome and rum in Barbados,"" and even sillier things like ""it should be a history of the Western World instead"" are completely missing the point on top of coming to this book with unrealistic expectations. This is no work of academic rigor, the author is no historian, as simple as that. The author's premise seems to be the economics of drinks and how certain drinks became global beverages riding the coattails of superpowers going on trade or conquest all over the world. Beer, wine, coffee, spirits, tea and Coca-Cola all owe their global popularity to the superpowers and empires of each period that either created them or made them a staple of their economy and culture, which is why the focus is on Mesopotamia, Greece/Rome, Britain, the US, etc. To me, it makes sense that he restricted himself to his narrow scope, so there's no point on including France for the wine section merely because it wasn't France that made it a global drink, nor was it Germany who made beer an universal drink, much less was it Japan who spread tea culture across the globe. There's no history of indigenous South American beverages here because people across the globe aren't drinking chicha, and the premise is ""six cups,"" not ""every alcoholic drink in existence."" Standage hasn't pretended to tell the history of every single drink in every culture in all periods of human history; it's just silly to think it's a flaw of the book that he hasn't. There are books about the missing drinks, and it sounds plain pedantic to object ""whataboutism"" as a flaw of the book, when it has others worth mentioning.To me, the flaws come from the writing, which although light, good-humoured and easy to read, is rather simplistic and repetitive. Journalistic more than writerly. Second flaw of note is that the sections are uneven as far as engaging the reader's interest is involved. The section on beer is interesting and it covers the most accepted anthropological theories about the origins of alcoholic drinks (which I guess you'd have to be familiar with to spot, because Standage doesn't state them as plainly but in passing), but the section on wine is rather boring. If you're a Roman history enthusiast, like I am, then it's too simple, almost like written for children, and there's some inaccuracies that remind you Standage is no historian (the part on ""posca,"" for example, is incomplete and not very accurate). The section on spirits gets more interesting and lively, but it feels too summed up because it covers several centuries in just a few paragraphs. The coffee section is mildly interesting, but feels incomplete because it doesn't cover some cultural aspect of the adoption of coffee in Europe, such as the religious ramifications; it's purely economic and mostly a collection of anecdotes. Then the tea section is again an utter bore, and finally the Coca-Cola section is definitely the most interesting of all. You get the point? It's quite unevenly researched.It's worth your time if you want an easy-peasy introduction to beverages and their key role in the economics of conquest, but don't expect to get a very profound analysis nor a deep historical treatise. This is just fun and will add to your collection of historical trivia."
25,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7196272-julia,5,"My favorite chapters were wine, coffee, and Coca-Cola"
26,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2330809-steve,3,"An extremely interesting history of beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, Coca-Cola - and, yes, to some extent, water - so, it's really 7 - through the lens of world events, the evolution of civilization, colonization, trade, politics, culture, religion, health, war, and, of course, economics....This is a fast, fun read, if for no other reason than it offers relatively compact, easy to digest (!), histories of the six drinks/beverages in the context of, well, the history of the world. Particularly if you've traveled widely, you'll be intrigued by Standage's explanations for how some nations/regions discovered, resisted, and/or became partial (or addicted) to, for example, wine versus beer or coffee versus tea. And my sense is that anthropologists will be at least mildly amused by his descriptions of (and explanations behind) the various serving/drinking rituals and how those ceremonies and habits have persevered, ""traveled,"" or evolved over time and space.I'm confident that, if you consider yourself an aficionado in any of the six beverages - beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, or Coca-Cola - you'll find Standage's coverage sweeping, but inadequate. The short volume permits only a relatively superficial dive into each of the six, with a heavy emphasis on its role and evolution rather than, say, the nuances of the underlying technology or marketing and current standing. (In other words, Standage no more strives to categorize the scores of craft beers at your local specialty beer restaurant than he endeavors to detail the world's assortment of grapes (and blends) or explain how Keurig currently offers literally hundreds of varieties of coffee in K cups....)It's no spoiler, but I found Standage at his best in his introduction and his conclusion, when he generalized, hypothesized, and forecast. I admit I found that the six drinks/topics tended to drag at times, and my gut says that a more skilled editor could have avoided some of the doldrums and repetitions. Nonetheless, an easy read chock full of trivia for the next time you share a drink (pick your poison - beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, or soda) with a friend or colleague..."

It is very informative, and the topic -- 6 glasses -- is a creative way to view history. I found it to be very repetitive, however, and the author could have cut the material in half without losing content, especially in the first half of the book (about beer, wine, and spirits). The book became more interesting to me, and less repetitive in the second half (about coffee, tea, and cola) but still would have benefitted from some editing. "

And it was right up my alley. His summary of world history in these six main drinks is actually quite accurate, and he has insights on each drink and their histories. Some chapters were slightly better than others, but each chapter really was intriguing.In short, I had no idea that these main six world drinks (seven if you include water, which is talked about briefly but well in the epilogue) really affected history so much. I now know more about beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola (and even water!), and I especially appreciate them and their histories more. It all truly is fascinating. So I definitely would recommend the book. It isn't life changing or anything, but it is an enjoyable and insightful read. For each drink, he has two well organized chapters. And then the epilogue cleverly talks about how the drink of the future looks to actually be water—it all comes full circle. So overall, I loved it. Will read it again in the future (after I forget much of the information).I'd put this right up there with The Dorito Effect in the category of non-Christian non-fiction books that I thoroughly enjoyed."

And that's what Mr. Standage has done here. Instead of looking at world history through political events or from a certain country's view we see how the creation and evolution of six drinks had an impact on world history. We start with beer in the age of ancient Egyptians, move to wine in the age of Classic Greece, then on to the development of distilled spirits in western Europe during the age of exploration and colonization. After that we move to non-alcoholic drinks, starting with coffee's development in the Arabian countries and the impact it had once it reached England and France, on to Tea and how the English appropriated it from the Chinese and used the trade to control China and India, and finally on to Coke, and how it became the ubiquitous ""All-American"" brand that it is today.In book club we all found the book a little uneven, but what is interesting is that we were all speaking of different chapters. For me, I was most intrigued by the audacity of the British Empire's actions in China during the tea chapter. It is a pretty approachable history, over all. Though I wouldn't suggest the audio book; the reader was truly terrible. 3.5 Stars"
34,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,3," I really wanted to like this book, but instead found it to be a struggle to finish at times. It’s not that it’s a bad book or that it’s not interesting, I just found that it could have been much briefer and at times, especially the sections on tea and coffee. The concept here of following how beverages changed and influenced society is a valid one, it was especially interesting to hear about how coffee houses took over parts of Europe as central locations for the discussion of scientific and political ideas. I also found the early history of Coca-Cola and Pepsi to be fascinating as there was information within this work that I was not aware of. Overall, this is a well written history told in an interesting way, the author just rambles on a bit in a few spots and in others is far too brief. "

However this book has been to many places when I was reading it(for years) and had many drinks with me as well. It's not something you add to a book review but I wanted to keep the memory of the places with this book so here they are- AB coffee in Comilla, Saffron in sylhet, probably Takeout in Dhaka, Cocacola plant of Abdul monem, Fulkoli of Pathantulla....

It has the point of view (if you wish, you may call them “biases”) of that magazine (the author's employer), meaning, it is generally cheerful, it admires and celebrates commerce as heroic, and it doesn't spend time getting excessively hot and bothered about the exploitation and misery that inevitably accompanies human commercial activity.I hope that the author doesn't read the reviews here. If he did, he'd go insane, because he'd find out that the book was both too dry and very readable, there was both too much detail and not enough, and that each of the six parts was duller than the other five. Enjoyable quotes:“There is no history of mankind, there are only many histories of all kinds of aspects of human life.”-- Karl Popper (should be at the beginning of every published microhistory.)About tea: “The progress of this famous plant has been something very like the progress of truth; suspected at first, though very palatable to those who had the courage to taste it; resisted as it encroached; abuse as its popularity spread; and establishing its triumph at least, in cheering the whole land from the palace to the cottage, only by slow and resistless efforts of time and its own virtues.”-- Isaac D'israeli (father of British politican Benjamin Disraeli)"

This should be History of Western civilization in 6 glasses. I Skimmed through Tea, and looked at Coke. It was at Tea that I completely lost interest. Coffee got a very brief chapter that started in Yemen but quickly went west. Then at the beginning of the Tea chapter, the author says China was an older, more advanced civilization than any other they came in contact with, talks briefly about the Japanese Tea Ceremony and then proceeds to talk about how the west set up the tea trade with china. "
43,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37899-tom,3,"This books was a very interesting concept. Look at how six beverages are linked to various times and places in history. While the beer chapter lacked a bit for me, this may have been due to the fact that it was from the Neolithic Period, and lacked a lot of the excellent primary source material that Enlightenment coffee houses or rum drinking ship captains are accompanied by. Still it was a fascinating look at how civilization and drinks are linked. I wish it had better references and notes, but it was a nice easy read, and those two things can often be at odds.The most interesting factoid: British ships originally provided the crew with ale rations, but eventually it switched to rum, which was often drank with sugar/molasses and lime/lemon. Thus the term, Limeys, and no scurvy. The French originally received wine rations (which provided Vitamin C) but switched to brandy, which distills out the vitamins. So during the Age of Imperialism, the health of British crews increased, and the French became more susceptible to disease. The role this nutrition versus malnutrition played in naval battles and the struggle between Britain and France was probably significant."

The author uses six drinks....beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola....to illustrate how trade, colonialism, and financial stability were brought to various parts of the world through the development and influence of these drinks. It is a fun journey and has some very informative facts about how and why each of these drinks developed. But some of those early iterations, especially beer, would not be recognized in today's world and probably not palatable to modern taste. But water was so polluted even up into the 19th century, that some alternative had to be found . Fermentation or boiling were the answers and certain sicknesses declined rapidly, thus giving some of our six drinks a reputation of ""curing all illnesses"". I don't imagine the person suffering from a major hangover would agree!!"

Not a good thing to mimic.I also found multiple sections repeating themselves. It's bad enough that I've had to read 4 pages in order to understand they drank beer out of a huge bowl, but I don't need to be reminded of it in the next section and the next section to complete the total 20 pages talking about one bowl!!!Also, the typos were distracting! I almost cracked out a red pen and started marking it up!I've read fact heavy books that also put in some funny stories or jokes and I thought this book had ample opportunities to break it up a little and add some flare to the stories.

Though a lot of the information wasn't necessarily new to me, between the beer and wine in western culture and the globalisation classes I took, it was an excellent treatment of the subjects. The writing was accessible- it read sort of like a master's thesis written by someone who actually wanted someone besides his thesis committee to take interest in the subject. It felt a little repetitive at times, but all in all wasn't so bad stylistically. I'd recommend this book just sort of in general to people. It's a very readable glance into both the history of civilisation and the current model of globalisation. Though by no means not a complete treatment of these subjects, it would act as a good launching platform into new interests for any reader. Plus, despite its academic nature, it's a pretty short and easy but still information-laiden read."

A History Of The World In 6 Glasses is a generalized overview of how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and coca cola have steered the course of western civilization. Influences were farther reaching than I would have imagined. These beverages determined social class, sparked a revolution, affected international trade and politics, perpetuated imperialism and had a hand in globalization among other things. In his epilogue Standage stresses the importance of clean water and poses the idea that sustainable water resources may be THE impetus for future conflicts. This is not intended as a deep analysis of history, nor are you going to get a comparison study of Guinness versus PBR, or the merits of French and Italian varietals, but it is entertaining nevertheless. (And to you 'whiners' - pun intended - who define your hipness in the fault you can find in everything you read - get over yourselves.) "

Standage doesn't offer much humor, which is something that lights up nonfiction for me, but that's literally the only drawback. Otherwise, it's a terrific, competent, erudite, informative and accessible volume that just might make one pause to think with appreciation of history before having a drink next time. Standage is also notably unbiased in his writing, all viewpoints and perspectives were represented with impressive evenness, thus easily maximizing its appeal to a variety of readers. I've read Cheever's history of drinking in America, but this encompassed the entire world, centuries of civilization, not to mention it had pictures.

Each drink has its own historical era and each drink in one way or another was such a popular drink that it was a force behind change. The drinks: Beer, Wine, Distilled Spirits, Coffee, Tea and Coca Cola. Many interesting stories from each glass - with each drink being given its own section in the book so there is no overlap.

57,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Apologies to all here: much of what follows are notes that I took on some interesting points, so please forgive the rambling, disorganized narrative.The ""Six Glasses"" are: beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola. This book is a history of the world through the lens of the six glasses, so it's selective in a geographical sense, but fairly comprehensive in a temporal sense. Standage's book is just the right length: long enough to include important details, but short enough to keep the reader's interest. It's perfect as ""pop history."" Standage's initial chapter on beer, however, is a disappointment! He only gets us to 1335 B.C.E. I'm interested in beer. It's my favorite drink (sharing first place with coffee). So I'm feeling slighted. There's a lot to know about the development of beer, but Standage doesn't even get us to the point where we started adding hops. (He only makes the statement that this did not happen until the Middle Ages). We get no sense of the role of beer in cultures other than those of ancient Sumeria and Egypt. The only tidbit worth remembering about beer is that Egyptian pharaohs liked to be buried with beer-brewing equipment. I'll have to write a will now, which specifies the same for me! (On second thought, I'll say that the image of Sumerians drinking beer from long, bent straws that dip into gigantic pots that tower over their heads was amusing.)The book starts to pick up some steam when it describes how the Ancient Greeks drank wine. Elaborate rituals, called ""symposion"" (think Plato's Symposium) were commonplace. Wine was served in a giant krater (a pot) and special implements and bowls were used to extract and drink it. Furthermore, wine was always diluted with water. It was considered barbaric to drink full-strength wine. Drunkenness was discouraged; moderation encouraged. Wine was meant to enhance subtle and insightful conversation, not meant to incite rowdy drunkenness. Vast quantities of wine were traded by ship.Romans continued the wine tradition, exporting it to the northern countries, and even using wine that had ""turned"" as a water-purifying agent for soldiers who were out on long campaigns. Apparently, this was what was actually on the vinegar sponge that was offered to Jesus while he hung on the cross. There's an interesting passage about Galen and Marcus Aurelius. Galen prescribed wine as health tonic. Apparently, the older and more expensive the vintage, the better! Even so, it was used to wash down some rather vile medicinal concoctions (think ear of bat, eye of toad, etc.)Eventually, the Moors of Spain discovered that wine could be distilled in order to increase the alcohol content. The word ""alcohol"" comes from the Arabic word for distilled antinomy, which was used as eye shadow. Odd to think that Muslims, who now renounce it, were the inventors of strong spirits!Standage also makes an interesting point about how much Arab learning (algebra, trigonometry, astronomy) was used by Western Europeans in their push to find an alternate route to the East. This was felt to be necessary because Arabs dominated the spice trade routes to the east, so Western Europeans thought perhaps they could find their own route to China through the west.What they found, instead of a new road to China, was a new place to grow sugar cane! That place was the Caribbean. (Except here's another weird twist: the Arabs had somehow obtained sugar cane from Polynesians? Gotta research this one!) In Barbados, the English eventually discovered the recipe for rum, which is made from molasses -- a waste product of sugar production. Rum -- mixed with lime juice, sugar, and water -- became ""grog,"" which helped the British navy avoid scurvy and defeat the Spanish at Trafalgar. Interesting point by Standage here, about how alcohol content was tested by heating rum with a few grains of gunpowder. If the gunpowder could just barely be brought to the ignition point, that meant the rum was about 50% alcohol, and thus suitable for sailors.Rum also became instrumental in the slave trade. Africans could sell slaves for rum. The slaves would be shipped to the Caribbean to grow sugar cane, and the cycle could be perpetuated. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!Interestingly, a tax favoring British molasses (which was used in the American Colonies to make cheap rum) was credited by John Adams as one of the main spurs of the American Revolution. Standage claims that rum was the most widely consumed drink in colonial America. Early American settlers complained that the unavailability of alcohol was one of the most unbearable hardships of the new world. So when John Winthrop came over, his ship was laden with 10,0000 gallons of beer! Rum, however, had the advantage of being less perishable than beer, and it could be cheaply made in the colonies wherever molasses was imported. So it could be readily shipped, and readily made in port cities.Although rum could be cheaply made in ports, it got more expensive to produce as one ventured inland, where molasses became scarce. Furthermore, Irish and Scottish immigrants sought to make whiskey without easy access to barley. So they used rye and corn. Apparently, excellent corn mash whiskey was made in Bourbon County, KY (hence the name ""Bourbon Whiskey""). The first rebellion against the U.S. Government was inspired by an excise tax on whiskey (the tax was imposed on production, and was not dependent upon sale). The government flexed its muscles by sending troops to western Pennsylvania, in order to quell the violence against tax collectors. Standage seems to suggest that this was the first real test of federal power in the U.S. The distillers backed down, and later the government abolished the tax.As Standage moves on to coffee, I was struck by several revelations. First, that London was the first big center of coffee houses! Although we associate the British with tea, coffee was all the rage well before the tea boom got going. Standage makes a comparison of coffee houses to today's Internet. At first, I was skeptical of this claim. Yet it turns out that each coffee house was devoted to a particular trade or art! And furthermore, people picked up their mail and got their news at coffee-houses. Sometimes runners would circulate news from one coffee house to the next. So the comparison to the Internet(today's central mechanism for information exchange) is apt. Standage asserts that English coffee houses were places where scientific, political, and philosophical ideas could be openly discussed. Apparently, some coffee-house arguments about gravity and its relation to elliptical orbits caused some head-butting between Christopher Wren, Thomas Hooke, and Edmund Halley. Newton finally settled the argument by publishing the Principia -- which Standage claims was, at least in part, inspired by the coffee house argument!French coffee houses were another matter. Apparently, they were rife with government spies. Woe betide he who openly challenged the establishment! He'd end up in the Bastille, or flee to England like Voltaire did. There's an interesting story about how a French sailor brought coffee to the Caribbean. The only coffee plant in Paris was in an inaccessible royal garden. So the sailor, de Clieu, persuaded a doctor to claim (falsely) that a cutting from the tree was necessary to prepare medicine for a patient. Thanks to de Clieu's smuggling act, coffee plantations were eventually established in Brazil, which became the world's largest exporter of coffee. It seems that the French won the trade contest with the Dutch, who had already established coffee plantations in the East Indies, including Java. And the poor Arabs, who invented coffee, never really got much economic benefit from it.Perhaps the most surprising revelation about coffee is the controversy it caused wherever it was introduced. Even in Arabia, it was compared to alcohol because of its mood-altering properties. In the west, it was considered by the old guard to be culturally subversive -- which I suppose it was, but in a good way. The coffee house cultures were places where people could test new ideas in an informal setting. Much intellectual progress was accomplished there. In the chapter on tea I discovered a new drink: koumiss (fermented mare's milk!) At the end of Sung Dynasty, the Mongols took control of China. Koumiss was favored over tea by the Mongols, who lived on their horses. At the height of their power, Kublai Khan's brother erected a fountain that dispensed rice beer from China, grape wine from Persia, mead from Eurasia, and koumiss! What a marvelous image! The Mongolian empire was short-lived, so perhaps that's why I never heard of koumiss. Anyway, China got the ball rolling when it comes to tea, and it probably started gaining in popularity in the First Century, C.E. Chinese control of the tea trade actually made it more expensive than coffee for quite some time, which helps to explain why coffee was initially more popular than tea in Europe. Europeans had their own coffee plantations in the West and East Indies long before they had their own tea plantations (eventually in British-controlled India).European-controlled tea plantations didn't come until the British East India Company discovered that tea could be grown in India, some time in the 1860's. If I remember correctly, the BEIC at some point had more money than Great Britain itself, and paid ten percent of Britain's tax revenue. And it operated almost like a government unto itself in India. As the BEIC was able to bring the cost of tea down not only by growing it, but by manufacturing and shipping it as well, tea became the universal drink of Britain (ca. 1860 forward). It had formerly been the exclusive drink of the elite and the wealthy. There's an interesting interlude, beginning in 1839 or so, called ""The Opium Wars."" The British, at this time still dependent on trading for tea in China, had nothing to offer the Chinese except opium from India. This was problematic, however, because the Chinese had outlawed opium! So the BEIC used intermediaries to sell the opium for silver, which was the only thing the Chinese would accept in exchange for tea. When the Chinese became wise to this plot, they destroyed massive quantities of illegal opium. The British then declared a war (which they won with superior military and naval technology) and demanded reparations for the lost contraband! Furthermore, this is when the British invaded Hong Kong and made it part of their own political sphere. One extremely interesting point here is that tea was originally only green tea. Green tea is made from the same leaves as black tea, except that less processing is involved. Black tea is made by scoring and oxidizing the leaves before drying them. Standage points out that black tea was considered inferior by the Chinese. But for the British, it was better because it was less perishable and easier to ship long distance. Furthermore, much tea was adulterated with ""filler,"" like sawdust, grass, bugs, etc. Filler used in green tea tended to be toxic, whereas the fillers used to bulk up black tea were generally safer. So black tea thus became the British standard. I was quite amused by Standage's chapter on the final drink: Coca-Cola. I never cared for Coca-Cola. Even as a child, I hated how it left a tacky film on my teeth! Nevertheless, its origins are quite interesting. It turns out that Coca-Cola was originally formulated by John Pemberton, in Atlanta. He was a manufacturer of ""patent medicine,"" which is a term for unregulated folk-style remedies, also known as ""nostrums."" See Patent Medicine HistoryMost patent medicines were herbal or vegetable oil extracts in a suspension of alcohol. In the early 20th century, the U.S. Government finally created the FDA, in order to protect consumers from adulterated foods, poor sanitation practices in abattoirs, and from false claims about the medicinal properties of patent medicines. Because Coca-Cola contained caffeine and even (originally) a very mild dose of alkaloid stimulants (from coca leaves), the U.S. Government eventually brought suit against Coca-Cola. Apparently, the government's concern was that Coca-Cola was the first stimulant marketed to children. But the suit was brought on the ground that the name of the drink was misleading. According to Standage, Coca-Cola prevailed in the trial court (which held that the drink was flavored with kola nut, and was hence ""pure""). On appeal, however, Coca-Cola had a minor loss which resulted in the company's agreement to reduce the caffeine content. Amazingly, Coca-Cola went on to become a global drink, spread in part by military endorsement. Coca-Cola actually partnered with the U.S. military during WWII, to the extent that Coca-Cola plants were constructed on military bases. Eventually, the world began to associate Coca-Cola with the United States. Standage claims that ""Coca-Cola"" is one of the world's most readily understood words, after ""O.K."" There's much interesting material in Standage's penultimate chapter about the hostility toward Coca-Cola by the Soviet Bloc and the Arab countries. I appreciated how Standage concluded his book with water, and the bottled water craze. He points out that, in the U.S., a bottle of water costs more by volume than gasoline, but people still buy it, even though they can get a superior product straight from their home taps, at a small fraction of the cost. I also appreciated Standage's acknowledgment of the importance of potable water to world political stability and human health in general. After all, the six drinks were all initially employed (at least in part) as water-purifiers of one sort or another.Overall, this was a very entertaining and well-written book! "

And according to Tom Standage, they are drinks that have changed the world.And he's going to tell you why he believes that. And he gives some pretty convincing arguments. From grain used to make beer which due to water being boiled and/or fermented as well as the increased amount of vitamin B, made it a more healthy drink. Also collecting wild grains eventually moved to farming with it's guaranteed grain access which needed irrigation resulting in excess grain to store for shortages as well as religious rites (good harvest was the gift from the gods). In order to verify community contributions, led to accounting, writing, bureaucracy. Excess grain could also be used as payment for workers involved in community construction of buildings and monuments.And that's just beer.As he examines each of his drinks, time and civilization moves toward the present day. Wine - again a healthier alternative to possibly contaminated water but also causes for excess among the Roman elite. Distilled alcohol like brandy, whiskey, rum and rye which - unfortunately were also used as trading goods in the early slave trade. Coffee and coffeehouses which became places for intellectual conversations as well as revolutionary ideas. Exploration of Europe into the Far East for spices and tea (introduced by Arabian traders as well as a bridal gift to Charles II of England) leading to the massive trading conglomerates of the British East India, Dutch East and Dutch West Trading Companies, which used opium to pay for tea instead of the silver previously required. And when the southern states of the U.S. couldn't grow tea, they switched to tobacco. Soda or dry water and the history of Coca-Cola and the cola wars. And back to the original - water.So it's really about seven drinks, not six. It's surprising how extensively interwoven into human history across the globe these six drinks are. And how much they impacted humanity - positively as well as negatively. So, next time when you share a drink, recall that it's a universal sign of hospitality and friendship. That at one time, your drink and that of your companions once shared the same vessel and the clink of glasses signifies a reuniting of that shared bottle or container. Slainte!2020-109"

Standage explains their effect on society: distilled spirits were durable (because of their high alcohol content) and compact and were, therefore, easier to transport than previous forms of alcohol (wine and beer). Rum – brought to Boston as raw molasses and subsequently distilled – formed a large part of early New England’s economy.Each beverage has a theme, whether it be wine symbolizing civilization and intellectual life, beer representing daily food and our social nature, or coffee exemplifying networking and innovation: “London’s coffeehouses were the crucibles of the scientific and financial revolutions that shaped the modern world.” Coca-Cola, the sixth beverage discussed, represents the rise of America to become the world’s superpower, and the mass marketing and globalization that has ensued.Full of fascinating tidbits (I had no idea that Scotch whisky is distilled beer!), this thought-provoking book was an intriguing way to learn about the history of the world through commodities. So much so that I’ve put his An Edible History of Humanity on my to-read list.If you like accessible books about the history of the world, you might also enjoy: Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond"

And it was right up my alley. His summary of world history in these six main drinks is actually quite accurate, and he has insights on each drink and their histories. Some chapters were slightly better than others, but each chapter really was intriguing.In short, I had no idea that these main six world drinks (seven if you include water, which is talked about briefly but well in the epilogue) really affected history so much. I now know more about beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola (and even water!), and I especially appreciate them and their histories more. It all truly is fascinating. So I definitely would recommend the book. It isn't life changing or anything, but it is an enjoyable and insightful read. For each drink, he has two well organized chapters. And then the epilogue cleverly talks about how the drink of the future looks to actually be water—it all comes full circle. So overall, I loved it. Will read it again in the future (after I forget much of the information).I'd put this right up there with The Dorito Effect in the category of non-Christian non-fiction books that I thoroughly enjoyed."

And that's what Mr. Standage has done here. Instead of looking at world history through political events or from a certain country's view we see how the creation and evolution of six drinks had an impact on world history. We start with beer in the age of ancient Egyptians, move to wine in the age of Classic Greece, then on to the development of distilled spirits in western Europe during the age of exploration and colonization. After that we move to non-alcoholic drinks, starting with coffee's development in the Arabian countries and the impact it had once it reached England and France, on to Tea and how the English appropriated it from the Chinese and used the trade to control China and India, and finally on to Coke, and how it became the ubiquitous ""All-American"" brand that it is today.In book club we all found the book a little uneven, but what is interesting is that we were all speaking of different chapters. For me, I was most intrigued by the audacity of the British Empire's actions in China during the tea chapter. It is a pretty approachable history, over all.

It’s not that it’s a bad book or that it’s not interesting, I just found that it could have been much briefer and at times, especially the sections on tea and coffee. The concept here of following how beverages changed and influenced society is a valid one, it was especially interesting to hear about how coffee houses took over parts of Europe as central locations for the discussion of scientific and political ideas. I also found the early history of Coca-Cola and Pepsi to be fascinating as there was information within this work that I was not aware of. Overall, this is a well written history told in an interesting way, the author just rambles on a bit in a few spots and in others is far too brief. "

If he did, he'd go insane, because he'd find out that the book was both too dry and very readable, there was both too much detail and not enough, and that each of the six parts was duller than the other five.

Coffee got a very brief chapter that started in Yemen but quickly went west.

73,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37899-tom,3,"This books was a very interesting concept. Look at how six beverages are linked to various times and places in history. While the beer chapter lacked a bit for me, this may have been due to the fact that it was from the Neolithic Period, and lacked a lot of the excellent primary source material that Enlightenment coffee houses or rum drinking ship captains are accompanied by. Still it was a fascinating look at how civilization and drinks are linked. I wish it had better references and notes, but it was a nice easy read, and those two things can often be at odds.The most interesting factoid: British ships originally provided the crew with ale rations, but eventually it switched to rum, which was often drank with sugar/molasses and lime/lemon. Thus the term, Limeys, and no scurvy. The French originally received wine rations (which provided Vitamin C) but switched to brandy, which distills out the vitamins. So during the Age of Imperialism, the health of British crews increased, and the French became more susceptible to disease. The role this nutrition versus malnutrition played in naval battles and the struggle between Britain and France was probably significant."

It is a fun journey and has some very informative facts about how and why each of these drinks developed. But some of those early iterations, especially beer, would not be recognized in today's world and probably not palatable to modern taste. But water was so polluted even up into the 19th century, that some alternative had to be found . Fermentation or boiling were the answers and certain sicknesses declined rapidly, thus giving some of our six drinks a reputation of ""curing all illnesses"".

The writing was accessible- it read sort of like a master's thesis written by someone who actually wanted someone besides his thesis committee to take interest in the subject. It felt a little repetitive at times, but all in all wasn't so bad stylistically. I'd recommend this book just sort of in general to people. It's a very readable glance into both the history of civilisation and the current model of globalisation. Though by no means not a complete treatment of these subjects, it would act as a good launching platform into new interests for any reader.

Standage doesn't offer much humor, which is something that lights up nonfiction for me, but that's literally the only drawback. Otherwise, it's a terrific, competent, erudite, informative and accessible volume that just might make one pause to think with appreciation of history before having a drink next time. Standage is also notably unbiased in his writing, all viewpoints and perspectives were represented with impressive evenness, thus easily maximizing its appeal to a variety of readers. I've read Cheever's history of drinking in America, but this encompassed the entire world, centuries of civilization, not to mention it had pictures. Really enlightening, entertaining and enjoyable read for anyone with an appreciation of history. Highly recommended."
79,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2994598-blaine-desantis,4,"Really good read! One of these books you would classify as social history non-fiction. The author takes a premise that there are 6 leading drinks (glasses) that influenced the world. Each drink has its own historical era and each drink in one way or another was such a popular drink that it was a force behind change. The drinks: Beer, Wine, Distilled Spirits, Coffee, Tea and Coca Cola. Many interesting stories from each glass - with each drink being given its own section in the book so there is no overlap. If you enjoy this type of non-fiction book than this is one that you should put on your list to read. Short book, short and snappy sections. Read it in 6 days: One day per glass! "

A quick and approachable read, I would recommend it to anyone who would like to get a broad overview of world history told from a fun perspective. I would recommend to AP World History students, except for the fact that the first three drinks are alcoholic and I'm not sure it's a great idea to be promoting at school. Having said that, I hope to share some excerpts about coffee and Coca Cola (and possibly tea) with them next year!"

87,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Apologies to all here: much of what follows are notes that I took on some interesting points, so please forgive the rambling, disorganized narrative.The ""Six Glasses"" are: beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola. This book is a history of the world through the lens of the six glasses, so it's selective in a geographical sense, but fairly comprehensive in a temporal sense. Standage's book is just the right length: long enough to include important details, but short enough to keep the reader's interest. It's perfect as ""pop history."" Standage's initial chapter on beer, however, is a disappointment! He only gets us to 1335 B.C.E. I'm interested in beer. It's my favorite drink (sharing first place with coffee). So I'm feeling slighted. There's a lot to know about the development of beer, but Standage doesn't even get us to the point where we started adding hops. (He only makes the statement that this did not happen until the Middle Ages). We get no sense of the role of beer in cultures other than those of ancient Sumeria and Egypt. The only tidbit worth remembering about beer is that Egyptian pharaohs liked to be buried with beer-brewing equipment. I'll have to write a will now, which specifies the same for me! (On second thought, I'll say that the image of Sumerians drinking beer from long, bent straws that dip into gigantic pots that tower over their heads was amusing.)The book starts to pick up some steam when it describes how the Ancient Greeks drank wine. Elaborate rituals, called ""symposion"" (think Plato's Symposium) were commonplace. Wine was served in a giant krater (a pot) and special implements and bowls were used to extract and drink it. Furthermore, wine was always diluted with water. It was considered barbaric to drink full-strength wine. Drunkenness was discouraged; moderation encouraged. Wine was meant to enhance subtle and insightful conversation, not meant to incite rowdy drunkenness. Vast quantities of wine were traded by ship.Romans continued the wine tradition, exporting it to the northern countries, and even using wine that had ""turned"" as a water-purifying agent for soldiers who were out on long campaigns. Apparently, this was what was actually on the vinegar sponge that was offered to Jesus while he hung on the cross. There's an interesting passage about Galen and Marcus Aurelius. Galen prescribed wine as health tonic. Apparently, the older and more expensive the vintage, the better! Even so, it was used to wash down some rather vile medicinal concoctions (think ear of bat, eye of toad, etc.)Eventually, the Moors of Spain discovered that wine could be distilled in order to increase the alcohol content. The word ""alcohol"" comes from the Arabic word for distilled antinomy, which was used as eye shadow. Odd to think that Muslims, who now renounce it, were the inventors of strong spirits!Standage also makes an interesting point about how much Arab learning (algebra, trigonometry, astronomy) was used by Western Europeans in their push to find an alternate route to the East. This was felt to be necessary because Arabs dominated the spice trade routes to the east, so Western Europeans thought perhaps they could find their own route to China through the west.What they found, instead of a new road to China, was a new place to grow sugar cane! That place was the Caribbean. (Except here's another weird twist: the Arabs had somehow obtained sugar cane from Polynesians? Gotta research this one!) In Barbados, the English eventually discovered the recipe for rum, which is made from molasses -- a waste product of sugar production. Rum -- mixed with lime juice, sugar, and water -- became ""grog,"" which helped the British navy avoid scurvy and defeat the Spanish at Trafalgar. Interesting point by Standage here, about how alcohol content was tested by heating rum with a few grains of gunpowder. If the gunpowder could just barely be brought to the ignition point, that meant the rum was about 50% alcohol, and thus suitable for sailors.Rum also became instrumental in the slave trade. Africans could sell slaves for rum. The slaves would be shipped to the Caribbean to grow sugar cane, and the cycle could be perpetuated. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!Interestingly, a tax favoring British molasses (which was used in the American Colonies to make cheap rum) was credited by John Adams as one of the main spurs of the American Revolution. Standage claims that rum was the most widely consumed drink in colonial America. Early American settlers complained that the unavailability of alcohol was one of the most unbearable hardships of the new world. So when John Winthrop came over, his ship was laden with 10,0000 gallons of beer! Rum, however, had the advantage of being less perishable than beer, and it could be cheaply made in the colonies wherever molasses was imported. So it could be readily shipped, and readily made in port cities.Although rum could be cheaply made in ports, it got more expensive to produce as one ventured inland, where molasses became scarce. Furthermore, Irish and Scottish immigrants sought to make whiskey without easy access to barley. So they used rye and corn. Apparently, excellent corn mash whiskey was made in Bourbon County, KY (hence the name ""Bourbon Whiskey""). The first rebellion against the U.S. Government was inspired by an excise tax on whiskey (the tax was imposed on production, and was not dependent upon sale). The government flexed its muscles by sending troops to western Pennsylvania, in order to quell the violence against tax collectors. Standage seems to suggest that this was the first real test of federal power in the U.S. The distillers backed down, and later the government abolished the tax.As Standage moves on to coffee, I was struck by several revelations. First, that London was the first big center of coffee houses! Although we associate the British with tea, coffee was all the rage well before the tea boom got going. Standage makes a comparison of coffee houses to today's Internet. At first, I was skeptical of this claim. Yet it turns out that each coffee house was devoted to a particular trade or art! And furthermore, people picked up their mail and got their news at coffee-houses. Sometimes runners would circulate news from one coffee house to the next. So the comparison to the Internet(today's central mechanism for information exchange) is apt. Standage asserts that English coffee houses were places where scientific, political, and philosophical ideas could be openly discussed. Apparently, some coffee-house arguments about gravity and its relation to elliptical orbits caused some head-butting between Christopher Wren, Thomas Hooke, and Edmund Halley. Newton finally settled the argument by publishing the Principia -- which Standage claims was, at least in part, inspired by the coffee house argument!French coffee houses were another matter. Apparently, they were rife with government spies. Woe betide he who openly challenged the establishment! He'd end up in the Bastille, or flee to England like Voltaire did. There's an interesting story about how a French sailor brought coffee to the Caribbean. The only coffee plant in Paris was in an inaccessible royal garden. So the sailor, de Clieu, persuaded a doctor to claim (falsely) that a cutting from the tree was necessary to prepare medicine for a patient. Thanks to de Clieu's smuggling act, coffee plantations were eventually established in Brazil, which became the world's largest exporter of coffee. It seems that the French won the trade contest with the Dutch, who had already established coffee plantations in the East Indies, including Java. And the poor Arabs, who invented coffee, never really got much economic benefit from it.Perhaps the most surprising revelation about coffee is the controversy it caused wherever it was introduced. Even in Arabia, it was compared to alcohol because of its mood-altering properties. In the west, it was considered by the old guard to be culturally subversive -- which I suppose it was, but in a good way. The coffee house cultures were places where people could test new ideas in an informal setting. Much intellectual progress was accomplished there. In the chapter on tea I discovered a new drink: koumiss (fermented mare's milk!) At the end of Sung Dynasty, the Mongols took control of China. Koumiss was favored over tea by the Mongols, who lived on their horses. At the height of their power, Kublai Khan's brother erected a fountain that dispensed rice beer from China, grape wine from Persia, mead from Eurasia, and koumiss! What a marvelous image! The Mongolian empire was short-lived, so perhaps that's why I never heard of koumiss. Anyway, China got the ball rolling when it comes to tea, and it probably started gaining in popularity in the First Century, C.E. Chinese control of the tea trade actually made it more expensive than coffee for quite some time, which helps to explain why coffee was initially more popular than tea in Europe. Europeans had their own coffee plantations in the West and East Indies long before they had their own tea plantations (eventually in British-controlled India).European-controlled tea plantations didn't come until the British East India Company discovered that tea could be grown in India, some time in the 1860's. If I remember correctly, the BEIC at some point had more money than Great Britain itself, and paid ten percent of Britain's tax revenue. And it operated almost like a government unto itself in India. As the BEIC was able to bring the cost of tea down not only by growing it, but by manufacturing and shipping it as well, tea became the universal drink of Britain (ca. 1860 forward). It had formerly been the exclusive drink of the elite and the wealthy. There's an interesting interlude, beginning in 1839 or so, called ""The Opium Wars."" The British, at this time still dependent on trading for tea in China, had nothing to offer the Chinese except opium from India. This was problematic, however, because the Chinese had outlawed opium! So the BEIC used intermediaries to sell the opium for silver, which was the only thing the Chinese would accept in exchange for tea. When the Chinese became wise to this plot, they destroyed massive quantities of illegal opium. The British then declared a war (which they won with superior military and naval technology) and demanded reparations for the lost contraband! Furthermore, this is when the British invaded Hong Kong and made it part of their own political sphere. One extremely interesting point here is that tea was originally only green tea. Green tea is made from the same leaves as black tea, except that less processing is involved. Black tea is made by scoring and oxidizing the leaves before drying them. Standage points out that black tea was considered inferior by the Chinese. But for the British, it was better because it was less perishable and easier to ship long distance. Furthermore, much tea was adulterated with ""filler,"" like sawdust, grass, bugs, etc. Filler used in green tea tended to be toxic, whereas the fillers used to bulk up black tea were generally safer. So black tea thus became the British standard. I was quite amused by Standage's chapter on the final drink: Coca-Cola. I never cared for Coca-Cola. Even as a child, I hated how it left a tacky film on my teeth! Nevertheless, its origins are quite interesting. It turns out that Coca-Cola was originally formulated by John Pemberton, in Atlanta. He was a manufacturer of ""patent medicine,"" which is a term for unregulated folk-style remedies, also known as ""nostrums."" See Patent Medicine HistoryMost patent medicines were herbal or vegetable oil extracts in a suspension of alcohol. In the early 20th century, the U.S. Government finally created the FDA, in order to protect consumers from adulterated foods, poor sanitation practices in abattoirs, and from false claims about the medicinal properties of patent medicines. Because Coca-Cola contained caffeine and even (originally) a very mild dose of alkaloid stimulants (from coca leaves), the U.S. Government eventually brought suit against Coca-Cola. Apparently, the government's concern was that Coca-Cola was the first stimulant marketed to children. But the suit was brought on the ground that the name of the drink was misleading. According to Standage, Coca-Cola prevailed in the trial court (which held that the drink was flavored with kola nut, and was hence ""pure""). On appeal, however, Coca-Cola had a minor loss which resulted in the company's agreement to reduce the caffeine content. Amazingly, Coca-Cola went on to become a global drink, spread in part by military endorsement. Coca-Cola actually partnered with the U.S. military during WWII, to the extent that Coca-Cola plants were constructed on military bases. Eventually, the world began to associate Coca-Cola with the United States. Standage claims that ""Coca-Cola"" is one of the world's most readily understood words, after ""O.K."" There's much interesting material in Standage's penultimate chapter about the hostility toward Coca-Cola by the Soviet Bloc and the Arab countries. I appreciated how Standage concluded his book with water, and the bottled water craze. He points out that, in the U.S., a bottle of water costs more by volume than gasoline, but people still buy it, even though they can get a superior product straight from their home taps, at a small fraction of the cost. I also appreciated Standage's acknowledgment of the importance of potable water to world political stability and human health in general. After all, the six drinks were all initially employed (at least in part) as water-purifiers of one sort or another.Overall, this was a very entertaining and well-written book! "

And according to Tom Standage, they are drinks that have changed the world.And he's going to tell you why he believes that. And he gives some pretty convincing arguments. From grain used to make beer which due to water being boiled and/or fermented as well as the increased amount of vitamin B, made it a more healthy drink. Also collecting wild grains eventually moved to farming with it's guaranteed grain access which needed irrigation resulting in excess grain to store for shortages as well as religious rites (good harvest was the gift from the gods). In order to verify community contributions, led to accounting, writing, bureaucracy. Excess grain could also be used as payment for workers involved in community construction of buildings and monuments.And that's just beer.As he examines each of his drinks, time and civilization moves toward the present day. Wine - again a healthier alternative to possibly contaminated water but also causes for excess among the Roman elite. Distilled alcohol like brandy, whiskey, rum and rye which - unfortunately were also used as trading goods in the early slave trade. Coffee and coffeehouses which became places for intellectual conversations as well as revolutionary ideas. Exploration of Europe into the Far East for spices and tea (introduced by Arabian traders as well as a bridal gift to Charles II of England) leading to the massive trading conglomerates of the British East India, Dutch East and Dutch West Trading Companies, which used opium to pay for tea instead of the silver previously required. And when the southern states of the U.S. couldn't grow tea, they switched to tobacco. Soda or dry water and the history of Coca-Cola and the cola wars. And back to the original - water.So it's really about seven drinks, not six. It's surprising how extensively interwoven into human history across the globe these six drinks are. And how much they impacted humanity - positively as well as negatively. So, next time when you share a drink, recall that it's a universal sign of hospitality and friendship. That at one time, your drink and that of your companions once shared the same vessel and the clink of glasses signifies a reuniting of that shared bottle or container. Slainte!2020-109"

Standage explains their effect on society: distilled spirits were durable (because of their high alcohol content) and compact and were, therefore, easier to transport than previous forms of alcohol (wine and beer). Rum – brought to Boston as raw molasses and subsequently distilled – formed a large part of early New England’s economy.Each beverage has a theme, whether it be wine symbolizing civilization and intellectual life, beer representing daily food and our social nature, or coffee exemplifying networking and innovation: “London’s coffeehouses were the crucibles of the scientific and financial revolutions that shaped the modern world.” Coca-Cola, the sixth beverage discussed, represents the rise of America to become the world’s superpower, and the mass marketing and globalization that has ensued.Full of fascinating tidbits (I had no idea that Scotch whisky is distilled beer!), this thought-provoking book was an intriguing way to learn about the history of the world through commodities. So much so that I’ve put his An Edible History of Humanity on my to-read list.If you like accessible books about the history of the world, you might also enjoy: Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond"

And it was right up my alley. His summary of world history in these six main drinks is actually quite accurate, and he has insights on each drink and their histories. Some chapters were slightly better than others, but each chapter really was intriguing.In short, I had no idea that these main six world drinks (seven if you include water, which is talked about briefly but well in the epilogue) really affected history so much. I now know more about beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola (and even water!), and I especially appreciate them and their histories more. It all truly is fascinating. So I definitely would recommend the book. It isn't life changing or anything, but it is an enjoyable and insightful read. For each drink, he has two well organized chapters. And then the epilogue cleverly talks about how the drink of the future looks to actually be water—it all comes full circle. So overall, I loved it. Will read it again in the future (after I forget much of the information).I'd put this right up there with The Dorito Effect in the category of non-Christian non-fiction books that I thoroughly enjoyed."

And that's what Mr. Standage has done here. Instead of looking at world history through political events or from a certain country's view we see how the creation and evolution of six drinks had an impact on world history. We start with beer in the age of ancient Egyptians, move to wine in the age of Classic Greece, then on to the development of distilled spirits in western Europe during the age of exploration and colonization. After that we move to non-alcoholic drinks, starting with coffee's development in the Arabian countries and the impact it had once it reached England and France, on to Tea and how the English appropriated it from the Chinese and used the trade to control China and India, and finally on to Coke, and how it became the ubiquitous ""All-American"" brand that it is today.In book club we all found the book a little uneven, but what is interesting is that we were all speaking of different chapters. For me, I was most intrigued by the audacity of the British Empire's actions in China during the tea chapter. It is a pretty approachable history, over all.

It’s not that it’s a bad book or that it’s not interesting, I just found that it could have been much briefer and at times, especially the sections on tea and coffee. The concept here of following how beverages changed and influenced society is a valid one, it was especially interesting to hear about how coffee houses took over parts of Europe as central locations for the discussion of scientific and political ideas. I also found the early history of Coca-Cola and Pepsi to be fascinating as there was information within this work that I was not aware of. Overall, this is a well written history told in an interesting way, the author just rambles on a bit in a few spots and in others is far too brief. "

If he did, he'd go insane, because he'd find out that the book was both too dry and very readable, there was both too much detail and not enough, and that each of the six parts was duller than the other five.

This should be History of Western civilization in 6 glasses. I Skimmed through Tea, and looked at Coke. It was at Tea that I completely lost interest. Coffee got a very brief chapter that started in Yemen but quickly went west.

103,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37899-tom,3,"This books was a very interesting concept. Look at how six beverages are linked to various times and places in history. While the beer chapter lacked a bit for me, this may have been due to the fact that it was from the Neolithic Period, and lacked a lot of the excellent primary source material that Enlightenment coffee houses or rum drinking ship captains are accompanied by. Still it was a fascinating look at how civilization and drinks are linked. I wish it had better references and notes, but it was a nice easy read, and those two things can often be at odds.The most interesting factoid: British ships originally provided the crew with ale rations, but eventually it switched to rum, which was often drank with sugar/molasses and lime/lemon. Thus the term, Limeys, and no scurvy. The French originally received wine rations (which provided Vitamin C) but switched to brandy, which distills out the vitamins. So during the Age of Imperialism, the health of British crews increased, and the French became more susceptible to disease. The role this nutrition versus malnutrition played in naval battles and the struggle between Britain and France was probably significant."

It is a fun journey and has some very informative facts about how and why each of these drinks developed. But some of those early iterations, especially beer, would not be recognized in today's world and probably not palatable to modern taste. But water was so polluted even up into the 19th century, that some alternative had to be found . Fermentation or boiling were the answers and certain sicknesses declined rapidly, thus giving some of our six drinks a reputation of ""curing all illnesses"".

It's bad enough that I've had to read 4 pages in order to understand they drank beer out of a huge bowl, but I don't need to be reminded of it in the next section and the next section to complete the total 20 pages talking about one bowl!!!Also, the typos were distracting! I almost cracked out a red pen and started marking it up!I've read fact heavy books that also put in some funny stories or jokes and I thought this book had ample opportunities to break it up a little and add some flare to the stories. It would have made it at least read-able if not quite enjoyable."
106,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1255266-stefanie,4,"My dear reading guru Tricia lent me this book, which I believe she read for a class at some point. Though a lot of the information wasn't necessarily new to me, between the beer and wine in western culture and the globalisation classes I took, it was an excellent treatment of the subjects. The writing was accessible- it read sort of like a master's thesis written by someone who actually wanted someone besides his thesis committee to take interest in the subject. It felt a little repetitive at times, but all in all wasn't so bad stylistically. I'd recommend this book just sort of in general to people. It's a very readable glance into both the history of civilisation and the current model of globalisation. Though by no means not a complete treatment of these subjects, it would act as a good launching platform into new interests for any reader. Plus, despite its academic nature, it's a pretty short and easy but still information-laiden read."
107,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882126-nancy,4,"A small but very interesting read. A History Of The World In 6 Glasses is a generalized overview of how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and coca cola have steered the course of western civilization. Influences were farther reaching than I would have imagined. These beverages determined social class, sparked a revolution, affected international trade and politics, perpetuated imperialism and had a hand in globalization among other things. In his epilogue Standage stresses the importance of clean water and poses the idea that sustainable water resources may be THE impetus for future conflicts. This is not intended as a deep analysis of history, nor are you going to get a comparison study of Guinness versus PBR, or the merits of French and Italian varietals, but it is entertaining nevertheless. (And to you 'whiners' - pun intended - who define your hipness in the fault you can find in everything you read - get over yourselves.) "
108,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit,5,"I certainly do love a good thematic history. This was a very good one at that. Standage doesn't offer much humor, which is something that lights up nonfiction for me, but that's literally the only drawback. Otherwise, it's a terrific, competent, erudite, informative and accessible volume that just might make one pause to think with appreciation of history before having a drink next time. Standage is also notably unbiased in his writing, all viewpoints and perspectives were represented with impressive evenness, thus easily maximizing its appeal to a variety of readers. I've read Cheever's history of drinking in America, but this encompassed the entire world, centuries of civilization, not to mention it had pictures. Really enlightening, entertaining and enjoyable read for anyone with an appreciation of history. Highly recommended."
109,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2994598-blaine-desantis,4,"Really good read! One of these books you would classify as social history non-fiction. The author takes a premise that there are 6 leading drinks (glasses) that influenced the world. Each drink has its own historical era and each drink in one way or another was such a popular drink that it was a force behind change. The drinks: Beer, Wine, Distilled Spirits, Coffee, Tea and Coca Cola. Many interesting stories from each glass - with each drink being given its own section in the book so there is no overlap. If you enjoy this type of non-fiction book than this is one that you should put on your list to read. Short book, short and snappy sections. Read it in 6 days: One day per glass! "

I would recommend to AP World History students, except for the fact that the first three drinks are alcoholic and I'm not sure it's a great idea to be promoting at school. Having said that, I hope to share some excerpts about coffee and Coca Cola (and possibly tea) with them next year!"

117,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Apologies to all here: much of what follows are notes that I took on some interesting points, so please forgive the rambling, disorganized narrative.The ""Six Glasses"" are: beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola. This book is a history of the world through the lens of the six glasses, so it's selective in a geographical sense, but fairly comprehensive in a temporal sense. Standage's book is just the right length: long enough to include important details, but short enough to keep the reader's interest. It's perfect as ""pop history."" Standage's initial chapter on beer, however, is a disappointment! He only gets us to 1335 B.C.E. I'm interested in beer. It's my favorite drink (sharing first place with coffee). So I'm feeling slighted. There's a lot to know about the development of beer, but Standage doesn't even get us to the point where we started adding hops. (He only makes the statement that this did not happen until the Middle Ages). We get no sense of the role of beer in cultures other than those of ancient Sumeria and Egypt. The only tidbit worth remembering about beer is that Egyptian pharaohs liked to be buried with beer-brewing equipment. I'll have to write a will now, which specifies the same for me! (On second thought, I'll say that the image of Sumerians drinking beer from long, bent straws that dip into gigantic pots that tower over their heads was amusing.)The book starts to pick up some steam when it describes how the Ancient Greeks drank wine. Elaborate rituals, called ""symposion"" (think Plato's Symposium) were commonplace. Wine was served in a giant krater (a pot) and special implements and bowls were used to extract and drink it. Furthermore, wine was always diluted with water. It was considered barbaric to drink full-strength wine. Drunkenness was discouraged; moderation encouraged. Wine was meant to enhance subtle and insightful conversation, not meant to incite rowdy drunkenness. Vast quantities of wine were traded by ship.Romans continued the wine tradition, exporting it to the northern countries, and even using wine that had ""turned"" as a water-purifying agent for soldiers who were out on long campaigns. Apparently, this was what was actually on the vinegar sponge that was offered to Jesus while he hung on the cross. There's an interesting passage about Galen and Marcus Aurelius. Galen prescribed wine as health tonic. Apparently, the older and more expensive the vintage, the better! Even so, it was used to wash down some rather vile medicinal concoctions (think ear of bat, eye of toad, etc.)Eventually, the Moors of Spain discovered that wine could be distilled in order to increase the alcohol content. The word ""alcohol"" comes from the Arabic word for distilled antinomy, which was used as eye shadow. Odd to think that Muslims, who now renounce it, were the inventors of strong spirits!Standage also makes an interesting point about how much Arab learning (algebra, trigonometry, astronomy) was used by Western Europeans in their push to find an alternate route to the East. This was felt to be necessary because Arabs dominated the spice trade routes to the east, so Western Europeans thought perhaps they could find their own route to China through the west.What they found, instead of a new road to China, was a new place to grow sugar cane! That place was the Caribbean. (Except here's another weird twist: the Arabs had somehow obtained sugar cane from Polynesians? Gotta research this one!) In Barbados, the English eventually discovered the recipe for rum, which is made from molasses -- a waste product of sugar production. Rum -- mixed with lime juice, sugar, and water -- became ""grog,"" which helped the British navy avoid scurvy and defeat the Spanish at Trafalgar. Interesting point by Standage here, about how alcohol content was tested by heating rum with a few grains of gunpowder. If the gunpowder could just barely be brought to the ignition point, that meant the rum was about 50% alcohol, and thus suitable for sailors.Rum also became instrumental in the slave trade. Africans could sell slaves for rum. The slaves would be shipped to the Caribbean to grow sugar cane, and the cycle could be perpetuated. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!Interestingly, a tax favoring British molasses (which was used in the American Colonies to make cheap rum) was credited by John Adams as one of the main spurs of the American Revolution. Standage claims that rum was the most widely consumed drink in colonial America. Early American settlers complained that the unavailability of alcohol was one of the most unbearable hardships of the new world. So when John Winthrop came over, his ship was laden with 10,0000 gallons of beer! Rum, however, had the advantage of being less perishable than beer, and it could be cheaply made in the colonies wherever molasses was imported. So it could be readily shipped, and readily made in port cities.Although rum could be cheaply made in ports, it got more expensive to produce as one ventured inland, where molasses became scarce. Furthermore, Irish and Scottish immigrants sought to make whiskey without easy access to barley. So they used rye and corn. Apparently, excellent corn mash whiskey was made in Bourbon County, KY (hence the name ""Bourbon Whiskey""). The first rebellion against the U.S. Government was inspired by an excise tax on whiskey (the tax was imposed on production, and was not dependent upon sale). The government flexed its muscles by sending troops to western Pennsylvania, in order to quell the violence against tax collectors. Standage seems to suggest that this was the first real test of federal power in the U.S. The distillers backed down, and later the government abolished the tax.As Standage moves on to coffee, I was struck by several revelations. First, that London was the first big center of coffee houses! Although we associate the British with tea, coffee was all the rage well before the tea boom got going. Standage makes a comparison of coffee houses to today's Internet. At first, I was skeptical of this claim. Yet it turns out that each coffee house was devoted to a particular trade or art! And furthermore, people picked up their mail and got their news at coffee-houses. Sometimes runners would circulate news from one coffee house to the next. So the comparison to the Internet(today's central mechanism for information exchange) is apt. Standage asserts that English coffee houses were places where scientific, political, and philosophical ideas could be openly discussed. Apparently, some coffee-house arguments about gravity and its relation to elliptical orbits caused some head-butting between Christopher Wren, Thomas Hooke, and Edmund Halley. Newton finally settled the argument by publishing the Principia -- which Standage claims was, at least in part, inspired by the coffee house argument!French coffee houses were another matter. Apparently, they were rife with government spies. Woe betide he who openly challenged the establishment! He'd end up in the Bastille, or flee to England like Voltaire did. There's an interesting story about how a French sailor brought coffee to the Caribbean. The only coffee plant in Paris was in an inaccessible royal garden. So the sailor, de Clieu, persuaded a doctor to claim (falsely) that a cutting from the tree was necessary to prepare medicine for a patient. Thanks to de Clieu's smuggling act, coffee plantations were eventually established in Brazil, which became the world's largest exporter of coffee. It seems that the French won the trade contest with the Dutch, who had already established coffee plantations in the East Indies, including Java. And the poor Arabs, who invented coffee, never really got much economic benefit from it.Perhaps the most surprising revelation about coffee is the controversy it caused wherever it was introduced. Even in Arabia, it was compared to alcohol because of its mood-altering properties. In the west, it was considered by the old guard to be culturally subversive -- which I suppose it was, but in a good way. The coffee house cultures were places where people could test new ideas in an informal setting. Much intellectual progress was accomplished there. In the chapter on tea I discovered a new drink: koumiss (fermented mare's milk!) At the end of Sung Dynasty, the Mongols took control of China. Koumiss was favored over tea by the Mongols, who lived on their horses. At the height of their power, Kublai Khan's brother erected a fountain that dispensed rice beer from China, grape wine from Persia, mead from Eurasia, and koumiss! What a marvelous image! The Mongolian empire was short-lived, so perhaps that's why I never heard of koumiss. Anyway, China got the ball rolling when it comes to tea, and it probably started gaining in popularity in the First Century, C.E. Chinese control of the tea trade actually made it more expensive than coffee for quite some time, which helps to explain why coffee was initially more popular than tea in Europe. Europeans had their own coffee plantations in the West and East Indies long before they had their own tea plantations (eventually in British-controlled India).European-controlled tea plantations didn't come until the British East India Company discovered that tea could be grown in India, some time in the 1860's. If I remember correctly, the BEIC at some point had more money than Great Britain itself, and paid ten percent of Britain's tax revenue. And it operated almost like a government unto itself in India. As the BEIC was able to bring the cost of tea down not only by growing it, but by manufacturing and shipping it as well, tea became the universal drink of Britain (ca. 1860 forward). It had formerly been the exclusive drink of the elite and the wealthy. There's an interesting interlude, beginning in 1839 or so, called ""The Opium Wars."" The British, at this time still dependent on trading for tea in China, had nothing to offer the Chinese except opium from India. This was problematic, however, because the Chinese had outlawed opium! So the BEIC used intermediaries to sell the opium for silver, which was the only thing the Chinese would accept in exchange for tea. When the Chinese became wise to this plot, they destroyed massive quantities of illegal opium. The British then declared a war (which they won with superior military and naval technology) and demanded reparations for the lost contraband! Furthermore, this is when the British invaded Hong Kong and made it part of their own political sphere. One extremely interesting point here is that tea was originally only green tea. Green tea is made from the same leaves as black tea, except that less processing is involved. Black tea is made by scoring and oxidizing the leaves before drying them. Standage points out that black tea was considered inferior by the Chinese. But for the British, it was better because it was less perishable and easier to ship long distance. Furthermore, much tea was adulterated with ""filler,"" like sawdust, grass, bugs, etc. Filler used in green tea tended to be toxic, whereas the fillers used to bulk up black tea were generally safer. So black tea thus became the British standard. I was quite amused by Standage's chapter on the final drink: Coca-Cola. I never cared for Coca-Cola. Even as a child, I hated how it left a tacky film on my teeth! Nevertheless, its origins are quite interesting. It turns out that Coca-Cola was originally formulated by John Pemberton, in Atlanta. He was a manufacturer of ""patent medicine,"" which is a term for unregulated folk-style remedies, also known as ""nostrums."" See Patent Medicine HistoryMost patent medicines were herbal or vegetable oil extracts in a suspension of alcohol. In the early 20th century, the U.S. Government finally created the FDA, in order to protect consumers from adulterated foods, poor sanitation practices in abattoirs, and from false claims about the medicinal properties of patent medicines. Because Coca-Cola contained caffeine and even (originally) a very mild dose of alkaloid stimulants (from coca leaves), the U.S. Government eventually brought suit against Coca-Cola. Apparently, the government's concern was that Coca-Cola was the first stimulant marketed to children. But the suit was brought on the ground that the name of the drink was misleading. According to Standage, Coca-Cola prevailed in the trial court (which held that the drink was flavored with kola nut, and was hence ""pure""). On appeal, however, Coca-Cola had a minor loss which resulted in the company's agreement to reduce the caffeine content. Amazingly, Coca-Cola went on to become a global drink, spread in part by military endorsement. Coca-Cola actually partnered with the U.S. military during WWII, to the extent that Coca-Cola plants were constructed on military bases. Eventually, the world began to associate Coca-Cola with the United States. Standage claims that ""Coca-Cola"" is one of the world's most readily understood words, after ""O.K."" There's much interesting material in Standage's penultimate chapter about the hostility toward Coca-Cola by the Soviet Bloc and the Arab countries. I appreciated how Standage concluded his book with water, and the bottled water craze. He points out that, in the U.S., a bottle of water costs more by volume than gasoline, but people still buy it, even though they can get a superior product straight from their home taps, at a small fraction of the cost. I also appreciated Standage's acknowledgment of the importance of potable water to world political stability and human health in general. After all, the six drinks were all initially employed (at least in part) as water-purifiers of one sort or another.Overall, this was a very entertaining and well-written book! "

And according to Tom Standage, they are drinks that have changed the world.And he's going to tell you why he believes that. And he gives some pretty convincing arguments. From grain used to make beer which due to water being boiled and/or fermented as well as the increased amount of vitamin B, made it a more healthy drink. Also collecting wild grains eventually moved to farming with it's guaranteed grain access which needed irrigation resulting in excess grain to store for shortages as well as religious rites (good harvest was the gift from the gods). In order to verify community contributions, led to accounting, writing, bureaucracy. Excess grain could also be used as payment for workers involved in community construction of buildings and monuments.And that's just beer.As he examines each of his drinks, time and civilization moves toward the present day. Wine - again a healthier alternative to possibly contaminated water but also causes for excess among the Roman elite. Distilled alcohol like brandy, whiskey, rum and rye which - unfortunately were also used as trading goods in the early slave trade. Coffee and coffeehouses which became places for intellectual conversations as well as revolutionary ideas. Exploration of Europe into the Far East for spices and tea (introduced by Arabian traders as well as a bridal gift to Charles II of England) leading to the massive trading conglomerates of the British East India, Dutch East and Dutch West Trading Companies, which used opium to pay for tea instead of the silver previously required. And when the southern states of the U.S. couldn't grow tea, they switched to tobacco. Soda or dry water and the history of Coca-Cola and the cola wars. And back to the original - water.So it's really about seven drinks, not six. It's surprising how extensively interwoven into human history across the globe these six drinks are. And how much they impacted humanity - positively as well as negatively. So, next time when you share a drink, recall that it's a universal sign of hospitality and friendship. That at one time, your drink and that of your companions once shared the same vessel and the clink of glasses signifies a reuniting of that shared bottle or container. Slainte!2020-109"

Standage explains their effect on society: distilled spirits were durable (because of their high alcohol content) and compact and were, therefore, easier to transport than previous forms of alcohol (wine and beer). Rum – brought to Boston as raw molasses and subsequently distilled – formed a large part of early New England’s economy.Each beverage has a theme, whether it be wine symbolizing civilization and intellectual life, beer representing daily food and our social nature, or coffee exemplifying networking and innovation: “London’s coffeehouses were the crucibles of the scientific and financial revolutions that shaped the modern world.” Coca-Cola, the sixth beverage discussed, represents the rise of America to become the world’s superpower, and the mass marketing and globalization that has ensued.Full of fascinating tidbits (I had no idea that Scotch whisky is distilled beer!), this thought-provoking book was an intriguing way to learn about the history of the world through commodities. So much so that I’ve put his An Edible History of Humanity on my to-read list.If you like accessible books about the history of the world, you might also enjoy: Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond"

And it was right up my alley. His summary of world history in these six main drinks is actually quite accurate, and he has insights on each drink and their histories. Some chapters were slightly better than others, but each chapter really was intriguing.In short, I had no idea that these main six world drinks (seven if you include water, which is talked about briefly but well in the epilogue) really affected history so much. I now know more about beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola (and even water!), and I especially appreciate them and their histories more. It all truly is fascinating. So I definitely would recommend the book. It isn't life changing or anything, but it is an enjoyable and insightful read. For each drink, he has two well organized chapters. And then the epilogue cleverly talks about how the drink of the future looks to actually be water—it all comes full circle. So overall, I loved it. Will read it again in the future (after I forget much of the information).I'd put this right up there with The Dorito Effect in the category of non-Christian non-fiction books that I thoroughly enjoyed."

And that's what Mr. Standage has done here. Instead of looking at world history through political events or from a certain country's view we see how the creation and evolution of six drinks had an impact on world history. We start with beer in the age of ancient Egyptians, move to wine in the age of Classic Greece, then on to the development of distilled spirits in western Europe during the age of exploration and colonization. After that we move to non-alcoholic drinks, starting with coffee's development in the Arabian countries and the impact it had once it reached England and France, on to Tea and how the English appropriated it from the Chinese and used the trade to control China and India, and finally on to Coke, and how it became the ubiquitous ""All-American"" brand that it is today.In book club we all found the book a little uneven, but what is interesting is that we were all speaking of different chapters. For me, I was most intrigued by the audacity of the British Empire's actions in China during the tea chapter. It is a pretty approachable history, over all. Though I wouldn't suggest the audio book; the reader was truly terrible. 3.5 Stars"

It’s not that it’s a bad book or that it’s not interesting, I just found that it could have been much briefer and at times, especially the sections on tea and coffee. The concept here of following how beverages changed and influenced society is a valid one, it was especially interesting to hear about how coffee houses took over parts of Europe as central locations for the discussion of scientific and political ideas. I also found the early history of Coca-Cola and Pepsi to be fascinating as there was information within this work that I was not aware of. Overall, this is a well written history told in an interesting way, the author just rambles on a bit in a few spots and in others is far too brief. "

Then at the beginning of the Tea chapter, the author says China was an older, more advanced civilization than any other they came in contact with, talks briefly about the Japanese Tea Ceremony and then proceeds to talk about how the west set up the tea trade with china.

While the beer chapter lacked a bit for me, this may have been due to the fact that it was from the Neolithic Period, and lacked a lot of the excellent primary source material that Enlightenment coffee houses or rum drinking ship captains are accompanied by. Still it was a fascinating look at how civilization and drinks are linked. I wish it had better references and notes, but it was a nice easy read, and those two things can often be at odds.The most interesting factoid: British ships originally provided the crew with ale rations, but eventually it switched to rum, which was often drank with sugar/molasses and lime/lemon. Thus the term, Limeys, and no scurvy. The French originally received wine rations (which provided Vitamin C) but switched to brandy, which distills out the vitamins. So during the Age of Imperialism, the health of British crews increased, and the French became more susceptible to disease. The role this nutrition versus malnutrition played in naval battles and the struggle between Britain and France was probably significant."

The author uses six drinks....beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola....to illustrate how trade, colonialism, and financial stability were brought to various parts of the world through the development and influence of these drinks. It is a fun journey and has some very informative facts about how and why each of these drinks developed. But some of those early iterations, especially beer, would not be recognized in today's world and probably not palatable to modern taste. But water was so polluted even up into the 19th century, that some alternative had to be found . Fermentation or boiling were the answers and certain sicknesses declined rapidly, thus giving some of our six drinks a reputation of ""curing all illnesses"". I don't imagine the person suffering from a major hangover would agree!!"

Not a good thing to mimic.I also found multiple sections repeating themselves. It's bad enough that I've had to read 4 pages in order to understand they drank beer out of a huge bowl, but I don't need to be reminded of it in the next section and the next section to complete the total 20 pages talking about one bowl!!!Also, the typos were distracting! I almost cracked out a red pen and started marking it up!I've read fact heavy books that also put in some funny stories or jokes and I thought this book had ample opportunities to break it up a little and add some flare to the stories. It would have made it at least read-able if not quite enjoyable."

Though a lot of the information wasn't necessarily new to me, between the beer and wine in western culture and the globalisation classes I took, it was an excellent treatment of the subjects. The writing was accessible- it read sort of like a master's thesis written by someone who actually wanted someone besides his thesis committee to take interest in the subject. It felt a little repetitive at times, but all in all wasn't so bad stylistically. I'd recommend this book just sort of in general to people. It's a very readable glance into both the history of civilisation and the current model of globalisation. Though by no means not a complete treatment of these subjects, it would act as a good launching platform into new interests for any reader. Plus, despite its academic nature, it's a pretty short and easy but still information-laiden read."
137,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882126-nancy,4,"A small but very interesting read. A History Of The World In 6 Glasses is a generalized overview of how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and coca cola have steered the course of western civilization. Influences were farther reaching than I would have imagined. These beverages determined social class, sparked a revolution, affected international trade and politics, perpetuated imperialism and had a hand in globalization among other things. In his epilogue Standage stresses the importance of clean water and poses the idea that sustainable water resources may be THE impetus for future conflicts. This is not intended as a deep analysis of history, nor are you going to get a comparison study of Guinness versus PBR, or the merits of French and Italian varietals, but it is entertaining nevertheless. (And to you 'whiners' - pun intended - who define your hipness in the fault you can find in everything you read - get over yourselves.) "

Standage doesn't offer much humor, which is something that lights up nonfiction for me, but that's literally the only drawback. Otherwise, it's a terrific, competent, erudite, informative and accessible volume that just might make one pause to think with appreciation of history before having a drink next time. Standage is also notably unbiased in his writing, all viewpoints and perspectives were represented with impressive evenness, thus easily maximizing its appeal to a variety of readers. I've read Cheever's history of drinking in America, but this encompassed the entire world, centuries of civilization, not to mention it had pictures. Really enlightening, entertaining and enjoyable read for anyone with an appreciation of history. Highly recommended."

The author takes a premise that there are 6 leading drinks (glasses) that influenced the world. Each drink has its own historical era and each drink in one way or another was such a popular drink that it was a force behind change. The drinks: Beer, Wine, Distilled Spirits, Coffee, Tea and Coca Cola. Many interesting stories from each glass - with each drink being given its own section in the book so there is no overlap. If you enjoy this type of non-fiction book than this is one that you should put on your list to read. Short book, short and snappy sections. Read it in 6 days: One day per glass! "

147,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Apologies to all here: much of what follows are notes that I took on some interesting points, so please forgive the rambling, disorganized narrative.The ""Six Glasses"" are: beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola. This book is a history of the world through the lens of the six glasses, so it's selective in a geographical sense, but fairly comprehensive in a temporal sense. Standage's book is just the right length: long enough to include important details, but short enough to keep the reader's interest. It's perfect as ""pop history."" Standage's initial chapter on beer, however, is a disappointment! He only gets us to 1335 B.C.E. I'm interested in beer. It's my favorite drink (sharing first place with coffee). So I'm feeling slighted. There's a lot to know about the development of beer, but Standage doesn't even get us to the point where we started adding hops. (He only makes the statement that this did not happen until the Middle Ages). We get no sense of the role of beer in cultures other than those of ancient Sumeria and Egypt. The only tidbit worth remembering about beer is that Egyptian pharaohs liked to be buried with beer-brewing equipment. I'll have to write a will now, which specifies the same for me! (On second thought, I'll say that the image of Sumerians drinking beer from long, bent straws that dip into gigantic pots that tower over their heads was amusing.)The book starts to pick up some steam when it describes how the Ancient Greeks drank wine. Elaborate rituals, called ""symposion"" (think Plato's Symposium) were commonplace. Wine was served in a giant krater (a pot) and special implements and bowls were used to extract and drink it. Furthermore, wine was always diluted with water. It was considered barbaric to drink full-strength wine. Drunkenness was discouraged; moderation encouraged. Wine was meant to enhance subtle and insightful conversation, not meant to incite rowdy drunkenness. Vast quantities of wine were traded by ship.Romans continued the wine tradition, exporting it to the northern countries, and even using wine that had ""turned"" as a water-purifying agent for soldiers who were out on long campaigns. Apparently, this was what was actually on the vinegar sponge that was offered to Jesus while he hung on the cross. There's an interesting passage about Galen and Marcus Aurelius. Galen prescribed wine as health tonic. Apparently, the older and more expensive the vintage, the better! Even so, it was used to wash down some rather vile medicinal concoctions (think ear of bat, eye of toad, etc.)Eventually, the Moors of Spain discovered that wine could be distilled in order to increase the alcohol content. The word ""alcohol"" comes from the Arabic word for distilled antinomy, which was used as eye shadow. Odd to think that Muslims, who now renounce it, were the inventors of strong spirits!Standage also makes an interesting point about how much Arab learning (algebra, trigonometry, astronomy) was used by Western Europeans in their push to find an alternate route to the East. This was felt to be necessary because Arabs dominated the spice trade routes to the east, so Western Europeans thought perhaps they could find their own route to China through the west.What they found, instead of a new road to China, was a new place to grow sugar cane! That place was the Caribbean. (Except here's another weird twist: the Arabs had somehow obtained sugar cane from Polynesians? Gotta research this one!) In Barbados, the English eventually discovered the recipe for rum, which is made from molasses -- a waste product of sugar production. Rum -- mixed with lime juice, sugar, and water -- became ""grog,"" which helped the British navy avoid scurvy and defeat the Spanish at Trafalgar. Interesting point by Standage here, about how alcohol content was tested by heating rum with a few grains of gunpowder. If the gunpowder could just barely be brought to the ignition point, that meant the rum was about 50% alcohol, and thus suitable for sailors.Rum also became instrumental in the slave trade. Africans could sell slaves for rum. The slaves would be shipped to the Caribbean to grow sugar cane, and the cycle could be perpetuated. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!Interestingly, a tax favoring British molasses (which was used in the American Colonies to make cheap rum) was credited by John Adams as one of the main spurs of the American Revolution. Standage claims that rum was the most widely consumed drink in colonial America. Early American settlers complained that the unavailability of alcohol was one of the most unbearable hardships of the new world. So when John Winthrop came over, his ship was laden with 10,0000 gallons of beer! Rum, however, had the advantage of being less perishable than beer, and it could be cheaply made in the colonies wherever molasses was imported. So it could be readily shipped, and readily made in port cities.Although rum could be cheaply made in ports, it got more expensive to produce as one ventured inland, where molasses became scarce. Furthermore, Irish and Scottish immigrants sought to make whiskey without easy access to barley. So they used rye and corn. Apparently, excellent corn mash whiskey was made in Bourbon County, KY (hence the name ""Bourbon Whiskey""). The first rebellion against the U.S. Government was inspired by an excise tax on whiskey (the tax was imposed on production, and was not dependent upon sale). The government flexed its muscles by sending troops to western Pennsylvania, in order to quell the violence against tax collectors. Standage seems to suggest that this was the first real test of federal power in the U.S. The distillers backed down, and later the government abolished the tax.As Standage moves on to coffee, I was struck by several revelations. First, that London was the first big center of coffee houses! Although we associate the British with tea, coffee was all the rage well before the tea boom got going. Standage makes a comparison of coffee houses to today's Internet. At first, I was skeptical of this claim. Yet it turns out that each coffee house was devoted to a particular trade or art! And furthermore, people picked up their mail and got their news at coffee-houses. Sometimes runners would circulate news from one coffee house to the next. So the comparison to the Internet(today's central mechanism for information exchange) is apt. Standage asserts that English coffee houses were places where scientific, political, and philosophical ideas could be openly discussed. Apparently, some coffee-house arguments about gravity and its relation to elliptical orbits caused some head-butting between Christopher Wren, Thomas Hooke, and Edmund Halley. Newton finally settled the argument by publishing the Principia -- which Standage claims was, at least in part, inspired by the coffee house argument!French coffee houses were another matter. Apparently, they were rife with government spies. Woe betide he who openly challenged the establishment! He'd end up in the Bastille, or flee to England like Voltaire did. There's an interesting story about how a French sailor brought coffee to the Caribbean. The only coffee plant in Paris was in an inaccessible royal garden. So the sailor, de Clieu, persuaded a doctor to claim (falsely) that a cutting from the tree was necessary to prepare medicine for a patient. Thanks to de Clieu's smuggling act, coffee plantations were eventually established in Brazil, which became the world's largest exporter of coffee. It seems that the French won the trade contest with the Dutch, who had already established coffee plantations in the East Indies, including Java. And the poor Arabs, who invented coffee, never really got much economic benefit from it.Perhaps the most surprising revelation about coffee is the controversy it caused wherever it was introduced. Even in Arabia, it was compared to alcohol because of its mood-altering properties. In the west, it was considered by the old guard to be culturally subversive -- which I suppose it was, but in a good way. The coffee house cultures were places where people could test new ideas in an informal setting. Much intellectual progress was accomplished there. In the chapter on tea I discovered a new drink: koumiss (fermented mare's milk!) At the end of Sung Dynasty, the Mongols took control of China. Koumiss was favored over tea by the Mongols, who lived on their horses. At the height of their power, Kublai Khan's brother erected a fountain that dispensed rice beer from China, grape wine from Persia, mead from Eurasia, and koumiss! What a marvelous image! The Mongolian empire was short-lived, so perhaps that's why I never heard of koumiss. Anyway, China got the ball rolling when it comes to tea, and it probably started gaining in popularity in the First Century, C.E. Chinese control of the tea trade actually made it more expensive than coffee for quite some time, which helps to explain why coffee was initially more popular than tea in Europe. Europeans had their own coffee plantations in the West and East Indies long before they had their own tea plantations (eventually in British-controlled India).European-controlled tea plantations didn't come until the British East India Company discovered that tea could be grown in India, some time in the 1860's. If I remember correctly, the BEIC at some point had more money than Great Britain itself, and paid ten percent of Britain's tax revenue. And it operated almost like a government unto itself in India. As the BEIC was able to bring the cost of tea down not only by growing it, but by manufacturing and shipping it as well, tea became the universal drink of Britain (ca. 1860 forward). It had formerly been the exclusive drink of the elite and the wealthy. There's an interesting interlude, beginning in 1839 or so, called ""The Opium Wars."" The British, at this time still dependent on trading for tea in China, had nothing to offer the Chinese except opium from India. This was problematic, however, because the Chinese had outlawed opium! So the BEIC used intermediaries to sell the opium for silver, which was the only thing the Chinese would accept in exchange for tea. When the Chinese became wise to this plot, they destroyed massive quantities of illegal opium. The British then declared a war (which they won with superior military and naval technology) and demanded reparations for the lost contraband! Furthermore, this is when the British invaded Hong Kong and made it part of their own political sphere. One extremely interesting point here is that tea was originally only green tea. Green tea is made from the same leaves as black tea, except that less processing is involved. Black tea is made by scoring and oxidizing the leaves before drying them. Standage points out that black tea was considered inferior by the Chinese. But for the British, it was better because it was less perishable and easier to ship long distance. Furthermore, much tea was adulterated with ""filler,"" like sawdust, grass, bugs, etc. Filler used in green tea tended to be toxic, whereas the fillers used to bulk up black tea were generally safer. So black tea thus became the British standard. I was quite amused by Standage's chapter on the final drink: Coca-Cola. I never cared for Coca-Cola. Even as a child, I hated how it left a tacky film on my teeth! Nevertheless, its origins are quite interesting. It turns out that Coca-Cola was originally formulated by John Pemberton, in Atlanta. He was a manufacturer of ""patent medicine,"" which is a term for unregulated folk-style remedies, also known as ""nostrums."" See Patent Medicine HistoryMost patent medicines were herbal or vegetable oil extracts in a suspension of alcohol. In the early 20th century, the U.S. Government finally created the FDA, in order to protect consumers from adulterated foods, poor sanitation practices in abattoirs, and from false claims about the medicinal properties of patent medicines. Because Coca-Cola contained caffeine and even (originally) a very mild dose of alkaloid stimulants (from coca leaves), the U.S. Government eventually brought suit against Coca-Cola. Apparently, the government's concern was that Coca-Cola was the first stimulant marketed to children. But the suit was brought on the ground that the name of the drink was misleading. According to Standage, Coca-Cola prevailed in the trial court (which held that the drink was flavored with kola nut, and was hence ""pure""). On appeal, however, Coca-Cola had a minor loss which resulted in the company's agreement to reduce the caffeine content. Amazingly, Coca-Cola went on to become a global drink, spread in part by military endorsement. Coca-Cola actually partnered with the U.S. military during WWII, to the extent that Coca-Cola plants were constructed on military bases. Eventually, the world began to associate Coca-Cola with the United States. Standage claims that ""Coca-Cola"" is one of the world's most readily understood words, after ""O.K."" There's much interesting material in Standage's penultimate chapter about the hostility toward Coca-Cola by the Soviet Bloc and the Arab countries. I appreciated how Standage concluded his book with water, and the bottled water craze. He points out that, in the U.S., a bottle of water costs more by volume than gasoline, but people still buy it, even though they can get a superior product straight from their home taps, at a small fraction of the cost. I also appreciated Standage's acknowledgment of the importance of potable water to world political stability and human health in general. After all, the six drinks were all initially employed (at least in part) as water-purifiers of one sort or another.Overall, this was a very entertaining and well-written book! "

And according to Tom Standage, they are drinks that have changed the world.And he's going to tell you why he believes that. And he gives some pretty convincing arguments. From grain used to make beer which due to water being boiled and/or fermented as well as the increased amount of vitamin B, made it a more healthy drink. Also collecting wild grains eventually moved to farming with it's guaranteed grain access which needed irrigation resulting in excess grain to store for shortages as well as religious rites (good harvest was the gift from the gods). In order to verify community contributions, led to accounting, writing, bureaucracy. Excess grain could also be used as payment for workers involved in community construction of buildings and monuments.And that's just beer.As he examines each of his drinks, time and civilization moves toward the present day. Wine - again a healthier alternative to possibly contaminated water but also causes for excess among the Roman elite. Distilled alcohol like brandy, whiskey, rum and rye which - unfortunately were also used as trading goods in the early slave trade. Coffee and coffeehouses which became places for intellectual conversations as well as revolutionary ideas. Exploration of Europe into the Far East for spices and tea (introduced by Arabian traders as well as a bridal gift to Charles II of England) leading to the massive trading conglomerates of the British East India, Dutch East and Dutch West Trading Companies, which used opium to pay for tea instead of the silver previously required. And when the southern states of the U.S. couldn't grow tea, they switched to tobacco. Soda or dry water and the history of Coca-Cola and the cola wars. And back to the original - water.So it's really about seven drinks, not six. It's surprising how extensively interwoven into human history across the globe these six drinks are. And how much they impacted humanity - positively as well as negatively. So, next time when you share a drink, recall that it's a universal sign of hospitality and friendship. That at one time, your drink and that of your companions once shared the same vessel and the clink of glasses signifies a reuniting of that shared bottle or container. Slainte!2020-109"

Standage explains their effect on society: distilled spirits were durable (because of their high alcohol content) and compact and were, therefore, easier to transport than previous forms of alcohol (wine and beer). Rum – brought to Boston as raw molasses and subsequently distilled – formed a large part of early New England’s economy.Each beverage has a theme, whether it be wine symbolizing civilization and intellectual life, beer representing daily food and our social nature, or coffee exemplifying networking and innovation: “London’s coffeehouses were the crucibles of the scientific and financial revolutions that shaped the modern world.” Coca-Cola, the sixth beverage discussed, represents the rise of America to become the world’s superpower, and the mass marketing and globalization that has ensued.Full of fascinating tidbits (I had no idea that Scotch whisky is distilled beer!), this thought-provoking book was an intriguing way to learn about the history of the world through commodities.

And it was right up my alley. His summary of world history in these six main drinks is actually quite accurate, and he has insights on each drink and their histories. Some chapters were slightly better than others, but each chapter really was intriguing.In short, I had no idea that these main six world drinks (seven if you include water, which is talked about briefly but well in the epilogue) really affected history so much. I now know more about beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola (and even water!), and I especially appreciate them and their histories more. It all truly is fascinating. So I definitely would recommend the book. It isn't life changing or anything, but it is an enjoyable and insightful read. For each drink, he has two well organized chapters. And then the epilogue cleverly talks about how the drink of the future looks to actually be water—it all comes full circle. So overall, I loved it. Will read it again in the future (after I forget much of the information).I'd put this right up there with The Dorito Effect in the category of non-Christian non-fiction books that I thoroughly enjoyed."

And that's what Mr. Standage has done here. Instead of looking at world history through political events or from a certain country's view we see how the creation and evolution of six drinks had an impact on world history. We start with beer in the age of ancient Egyptians, move to wine in the age of Classic Greece, then on to the development of distilled spirits in western Europe during the age of exploration and colonization. After that we move to non-alcoholic drinks, starting with coffee's development in the Arabian countries and the impact it had once it reached England and France, on to Tea and how the English appropriated it from the Chinese and used the trade to control China and India, and finally on to Coke, and how it became the ubiquitous ""All-American"" brand that it is today.In book club we all found the book a little uneven, but what is interesting is that we were all speaking of different chapters. For me, I was most intrigued by the audacity of the British Empire's actions in China during the tea chapter. It is a pretty approachable history, over all. Though I wouldn't suggest the audio book; the reader was truly terrible. 3.5 Stars"

It’s not that it’s a bad book or that it’s not interesting, I just found that it could have been much briefer and at times, especially the sections on tea and coffee. The concept here of following how beverages changed and influenced society is a valid one, it was especially interesting to hear about how coffee houses took over parts of Europe as central locations for the discussion of scientific and political ideas. I also found the early history of Coca-Cola and Pepsi to be fascinating as there was information within this work that I was not aware of. Overall, this is a well written history told in an interesting way, the author just rambles on a bit in a few spots and in others is far too brief. "

160,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7658657-shae-mcdaniel,5,Freaking fascinating and engaging. I learned so much!
161,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,4,"An enjoyable and readable book, like an edition of The Economist about things that happened a long time ago. It has the point of view (if you wish, you may call them “biases”) of that magazine (the author's employer), meaning, it is generally cheerful, it admires and celebrates commerce as heroic, and it doesn't spend time getting excessively hot and bothered about the exploitation and misery that inevitably accompanies human commercial activity.I hope that the author doesn't read the reviews here. If he did, he'd go insane, because he'd find out that the book was both too dry and very readable, there was both too much detail and not enough, and that each of the six parts was duller than the other five. Enjoyable quotes:“There is no history of mankind, there are only many histories of all kinds of aspects of human life.”-- Karl Popper (should be at the beginning of every published microhistory.)About tea: “The progress of this famous plant has been something very like the progress of truth; suspected at first, though very palatable to those who had the courage to taste it; resisted as it encroached; abuse as its popularity spread; and establishing its triumph at least, in cheering the whole land from the palace to the cottage, only by slow and resistless efforts of time and its own virtues.”-- Isaac D'israeli (father of British politican Benjamin Disraeli)"
162,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930297-elizabeth,2,"I didn't finish this book. We went to the library Sunday and I decided just to go ahead and return it.In short:Beer - Mesopotamia, liquid bread, drink of the peopleWine - Greeks, symposia, democracySpirits - Colonialism, Slave Trade, RevolutionCoffee - Age of reason, academic discourse, people aren't drunk all the timeTea - British EmpireCoke - AmericaThe key point i took away is that what every drink has in common is an alternative to water which could be contaminated. all these drinks involve boiling water before people realized that the boiling was the part that was important. This should be History of Western civilization in 6 glasses. I Skimmed through Tea, and looked at Coke. It was at Tea that I completely lost interest. Coffee got a very brief chapter that started in Yemen but quickly went west. Then at the beginning of the Tea chapter, the author says China was an older, more advanced civilization than any other they came in contact with, talks briefly about the Japanese Tea Ceremony and then proceeds to talk about how the west set up the tea trade with china. "
163,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37899-tom,3,"This books was a very interesting concept. Look at how six beverages are linked to various times and places in history. While the beer chapter lacked a bit for me, this may have been due to the fact that it was from the Neolithic Period, and lacked a lot of the excellent primary source material that Enlightenment coffee houses or rum drinking ship captains are accompanied by. Still it was a fascinating look at how civilization and drinks are linked. I wish it had better references and notes, but it was a nice easy read, and those two things can often be at odds.The most interesting factoid: British ships originally provided the crew with ale rations, but eventually it switched to rum, which was often drank with sugar/molasses and lime/lemon. Thus the term, Limeys, and no scurvy. The French originally received wine rations (which provided Vitamin C) but switched to brandy, which distills out the vitamins. So during the Age of Imperialism, the health of British crews increased, and the French became more susceptible to disease. The role this nutrition versus malnutrition played in naval battles and the struggle between Britain and France was probably significant."
164,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson,3,"If you are looking for a history of the world, this is not the book BUT if you are looking for a wry and different take on how some portions of history evolved, you might want to give this book a try. The author uses six drinks....beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola....to illustrate how trade, colonialism, and financial stability were brought to various parts of the world through the development and influence of these drinks. It is a fun journey and has some very informative facts about how and why each of these drinks developed. But some of those early iterations, especially beer, would not be recognized in today's world and probably not palatable to modern taste. But water was so polluted even up into the 19th century, that some alternative had to be found . Fermentation or boiling were the answers and certain sicknesses declined rapidly, thus giving some of our six drinks a reputation of ""curing all illnesses"". I don't imagine the person suffering from a major hangover would agree!!"
165,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1238273-trisha,1,"Troutdale, January 19thA very dead-pan fact heavy book, which isn't a bad thing (I mean, don't pick it up thinking it will be a novel type story), but I thought some of the stories could have had more personality or ""voice"" instead of just a list of what happened. it was very high school text book. Not a good thing to mimic.I also found multiple sections repeating themselves. It's bad enough that I've had to read 4 pages in order to understand they drank beer out of a huge bowl, but I don't need to be reminded of it in the next section and the next section to complete the total 20 pages talking about one bowl!!!Also, the typos were distracting! I almost cracked out a red pen and started marking it up!I've read fact heavy books that also put in some funny stories or jokes and I thought this book had ample opportunities to break it up a little and add some flare to the stories. It would have made it at least read-able if not quite enjoyable."
166,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1255266-stefanie,4,"My dear reading guru Tricia lent me this book, which I believe she read for a class at some point. Though a lot of the information wasn't necessarily new to me, between the beer and wine in western culture and the globalisation classes I took, it was an excellent treatment of the subjects. The writing was accessible- it read sort of like a master's thesis written by someone who actually wanted someone besides his thesis committee to take interest in the subject. It felt a little repetitive at times, but all in all wasn't so bad stylistically. I'd recommend this book just sort of in general to people. It's a very readable glance into both the history of civilisation and the current model of globalisation. Though by no means not a complete treatment of these subjects, it would act as a good launching platform into new interests for any reader. Plus, despite its academic nature, it's a pretty short and easy but still information-laiden read."
167,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882126-nancy,4,"A small but very interesting read. A History Of The World In 6 Glasses is a generalized overview of how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and coca cola have steered the course of western civilization. Influences were farther reaching than I would have imagined. These beverages determined social class, sparked a revolution, affected international trade and politics, perpetuated imperialism and had a hand in globalization among other things. In his epilogue Standage stresses the importance of clean water and poses the idea that sustainable water resources may be THE impetus for future conflicts. This is not intended as a deep analysis of history, nor are you going to get a comparison study of Guinness versus PBR, or the merits of French and Italian varietals, but it is entertaining nevertheless. (And to you 'whiners' - pun intended - who define your hipness in the fault you can find in everything you read - get over yourselves.) "
168,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit,5,"I certainly do love a good thematic history. This was a very good one at that. Standage doesn't offer much humor, which is something that lights up nonfiction for me, but that's literally the only drawback. Otherwise, it's a terrific, competent, erudite, informative and accessible volume that just might make one pause to think with appreciation of history before having a drink next time. Standage is also notably unbiased in his writing, all viewpoints and perspectives were represented with impressive evenness, thus easily maximizing its appeal to a variety of readers. I've read Cheever's history of drinking in America, but this encompassed the entire world, centuries of civilization, not to mention it had pictures. Really enlightening, entertaining and enjoyable read for anyone with an appreciation of history. Highly recommended."
169,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2994598-blaine-desantis,4,"Really good read! One of these books you would classify as social history non-fiction. The author takes a premise that there are 6 leading drinks (glasses) that influenced the world. Each drink has its own historical era and each drink in one way or another was such a popular drink that it was a force behind change. The drinks: Beer, Wine, Distilled Spirits, Coffee, Tea and Coca Cola. Many interesting stories from each glass - with each drink being given its own section in the book so there is no overlap. If you enjoy this type of non-fiction book than this is one that you should put on your list to read. Short book, short and snappy sections. Read it in 6 days: One day per glass! "
170,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5472357-carrie-emmerson,4,"Fantastic overview of world history as told through the lens of different drinks. A quick and approachable read, I would recommend it to anyone who would like to get a broad overview of world history told from a fun perspective. I would recommend to AP World History students, except for the fact that the first three drinks are alcoholic and I'm not sure it's a great idea to be promoting at school. Having said that, I hope to share some excerpts about coffee and Coca Cola (and possibly tea) with them next year!"
171,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26554841-quinn,2,"This book had a really interesting concept: to tell history broken down into the drinks that were popular during that time, but unfortunately, this book is basically a textbook and is written with the the manor and vocabulary of one. I found it a bit hard to read, but there were some interesting points like learning about Coca-Cola and how the other speculated on going to Mars and the effect it would have on the human race."
172,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4047618-robert-greenberger,4,"Beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and cola apparently make the world go round. Tom Stabndage's brief survey of history through the development and spread of these beverages is rather entertaining and occasionally enlightening. You're left wanting to know more about the development, especially with a more global perspective, but overall this is a satisfying and refreshing look at world history from a unique perspective."
173,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312898-ben,4,"This style is one of my favorite kinds of non-fiction, interweaving history, economics, and culture from an unconventional perspective. It was packed with interesting little insights. Coincidentally, minutes after finishing the book, the train I'm riding just passed a huge Coca-Cola distribution warehouse I've never noticed before."
174,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6672056-plateresca,3,"I really liked the idea of looking at history through drinks, and though some parts of the book did seem a bit monotonous and repetitive, it has some very interesting facts, so, on the whole, definitely readable."
175,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8841763-nikki,4,This book can be a little dry but was overall very knowledgeable. Since I do or have had all of these beverages it was great to learn where they came from and how they influenced history. 
176,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745075-katherine-reay,0,Fascinating book -- loved looking at history through a new lens -- or a new glass. 
177,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Apologies to all here: much of what follows are notes that I took on some interesting points, so please forgive the rambling, disorganized narrative.The ""Six Glasses"" are: beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola. This book is a history of the world through the lens of the six glasses, so it's selective in a geographical sense, but fairly comprehensive in a temporal sense. Standage's book is just the right length: long enough to include important details, but short enough to keep the reader's interest. It's perfect as ""pop history."" Standage's initial chapter on beer, however, is a disappointment! He only gets us to 1335 B.C.E. I'm interested in beer. It's my favorite drink (sharing first place with coffee). So I'm feeling slighted. There's a lot to know about the development of beer, but Standage doesn't even get us to the point where we started adding hops. (He only makes the statement that this did not happen until the Middle Ages). We get no sense of the role of beer in cultures other than those of ancient Sumeria and Egypt. The only tidbit worth remembering about beer is that Egyptian pharaohs liked to be buried with beer-brewing equipment. I'll have to write a will now, which specifies the same for me! (On second thought, I'll say that the image of Sumerians drinking beer from long, bent straws that dip into gigantic pots that tower over their heads was amusing.)The book starts to pick up some steam when it describes how the Ancient Greeks drank wine. Elaborate rituals, called ""symposion"" (think Plato's Symposium) were commonplace. Wine was served in a giant krater (a pot) and special implements and bowls were used to extract and drink it. Furthermore, wine was always diluted with water. It was considered barbaric to drink full-strength wine. Drunkenness was discouraged; moderation encouraged. Wine was meant to enhance subtle and insightful conversation, not meant to incite rowdy drunkenness. Vast quantities of wine were traded by ship.Romans continued the wine tradition, exporting it to the northern countries, and even using wine that had ""turned"" as a water-purifying agent for soldiers who were out on long campaigns. Apparently, this was what was actually on the vinegar sponge that was offered to Jesus while he hung on the cross. There's an interesting passage about Galen and Marcus Aurelius. Galen prescribed wine as health tonic. Apparently, the older and more expensive the vintage, the better! Even so, it was used to wash down some rather vile medicinal concoctions (think ear of bat, eye of toad, etc.)Eventually, the Moors of Spain discovered that wine could be distilled in order to increase the alcohol content. The word ""alcohol"" comes from the Arabic word for distilled antinomy, which was used as eye shadow. Odd to think that Muslims, who now renounce it, were the inventors of strong spirits!Standage also makes an interesting point about how much Arab learning (algebra, trigonometry, astronomy) was used by Western Europeans in their push to find an alternate route to the East. This was felt to be necessary because Arabs dominated the spice trade routes to the east, so Western Europeans thought perhaps they could find their own route to China through the west.What they found, instead of a new road to China, was a new place to grow sugar cane! That place was the Caribbean. (Except here's another weird twist: the Arabs had somehow obtained sugar cane from Polynesians? Gotta research this one!) In Barbados, the English eventually discovered the recipe for rum, which is made from molasses -- a waste product of sugar production. Rum -- mixed with lime juice, sugar, and water -- became ""grog,"" which helped the British navy avoid scurvy and defeat the Spanish at Trafalgar. Interesting point by Standage here, about how alcohol content was tested by heating rum with a few grains of gunpowder. If the gunpowder could just barely be brought to the ignition point, that meant the rum was about 50% alcohol, and thus suitable for sailors.Rum also became instrumental in the slave trade. Africans could sell slaves for rum. The slaves would be shipped to the Caribbean to grow sugar cane, and the cycle could be perpetuated. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!Interestingly, a tax favoring British molasses (which was used in the American Colonies to make cheap rum) was credited by John Adams as one of the main spurs of the American Revolution. Standage claims that rum was the most widely consumed drink in colonial America. Early American settlers complained that the unavailability of alcohol was one of the most unbearable hardships of the new world. So when John Winthrop came over, his ship was laden with 10,0000 gallons of beer! Rum, however, had the advantage of being less perishable than beer, and it could be cheaply made in the colonies wherever molasses was imported. So it could be readily shipped, and readily made in port cities.Although rum could be cheaply made in ports, it got more expensive to produce as one ventured inland, where molasses became scarce. Furthermore, Irish and Scottish immigrants sought to make whiskey without easy access to barley. So they used rye and corn. Apparently, excellent corn mash whiskey was made in Bourbon County, KY (hence the name ""Bourbon Whiskey""). The first rebellion against the U.S. Government was inspired by an excise tax on whiskey (the tax was imposed on production, and was not dependent upon sale). The government flexed its muscles by sending troops to western Pennsylvania, in order to quell the violence against tax collectors. Standage seems to suggest that this was the first real test of federal power in the U.S. The distillers backed down, and later the government abolished the tax.As Standage moves on to coffee, I was struck by several revelations. First, that London was the first big center of coffee houses! Although we associate the British with tea, coffee was all the rage well before the tea boom got going. Standage makes a comparison of coffee houses to today's Internet. At first, I was skeptical of this claim. Yet it turns out that each coffee house was devoted to a particular trade or art! And furthermore, people picked up their mail and got their news at coffee-houses. Sometimes runners would circulate news from one coffee house to the next. So the comparison to the Internet(today's central mechanism for information exchange) is apt. Standage asserts that English coffee houses were places where scientific, political, and philosophical ideas could be openly discussed. Apparently, some coffee-house arguments about gravity and its relation to elliptical orbits caused some head-butting between Christopher Wren, Thomas Hooke, and Edmund Halley. Newton finally settled the argument by publishing the Principia -- which Standage claims was, at least in part, inspired by the coffee house argument!French coffee houses were another matter. Apparently, they were rife with government spies. Woe betide he who openly challenged the establishment! He'd end up in the Bastille, or flee to England like Voltaire did. There's an interesting story about how a French sailor brought coffee to the Caribbean. The only coffee plant in Paris was in an inaccessible royal garden. So the sailor, de Clieu, persuaded a doctor to claim (falsely) that a cutting from the tree was necessary to prepare medicine for a patient. Thanks to de Clieu's smuggling act, coffee plantations were eventually established in Brazil, which became the world's largest exporter of coffee. It seems that the French won the trade contest with the Dutch, who had already established coffee plantations in the East Indies, including Java. And the poor Arabs, who invented coffee, never really got much economic benefit from it.Perhaps the most surprising revelation about coffee is the controversy it caused wherever it was introduced. Even in Arabia, it was compared to alcohol because of its mood-altering properties. In the west, it was considered by the old guard to be culturally subversive -- which I suppose it was, but in a good way. The coffee house cultures were places where people could test new ideas in an informal setting. Much intellectual progress was accomplished there. In the chapter on tea I discovered a new drink: koumiss (fermented mare's milk!) At the end of Sung Dynasty, the Mongols took control of China. Koumiss was favored over tea by the Mongols, who lived on their horses. At the height of their power, Kublai Khan's brother erected a fountain that dispensed rice beer from China, grape wine from Persia, mead from Eurasia, and koumiss! What a marvelous image! The Mongolian empire was short-lived, so perhaps that's why I never heard of koumiss. Anyway, China got the ball rolling when it comes to tea, and it probably started gaining in popularity in the First Century, C.E. Chinese control of the tea trade actually made it more expensive than coffee for quite some time, which helps to explain why coffee was initially more popular than tea in Europe. Europeans had their own coffee plantations in the West and East Indies long before they had their own tea plantations (eventually in British-controlled India).European-controlled tea plantations didn't come until the British East India Company discovered that tea could be grown in India, some time in the 1860's. If I remember correctly, the BEIC at some point had more money than Great Britain itself, and paid ten percent of Britain's tax revenue. And it operated almost like a government unto itself in India. As the BEIC was able to bring the cost of tea down not only by growing it, but by manufacturing and shipping it as well, tea became the universal drink of Britain (ca. 1860 forward). It had formerly been the exclusive drink of the elite and the wealthy. There's an interesting interlude, beginning in 1839 or so, called ""The Opium Wars."" The British, at this time still dependent on trading for tea in China, had nothing to offer the Chinese except opium from India. This was problematic, however, because the Chinese had outlawed opium! So the BEIC used intermediaries to sell the opium for silver, which was the only thing the Chinese would accept in exchange for tea. When the Chinese became wise to this plot, they destroyed massive quantities of illegal opium. The British then declared a war (which they won with superior military and naval technology) and demanded reparations for the lost contraband! Furthermore, this is when the British invaded Hong Kong and made it part of their own political sphere. One extremely interesting point here is that tea was originally only green tea. Green tea is made from the same leaves as black tea, except that less processing is involved. Black tea is made by scoring and oxidizing the leaves before drying them. Standage points out that black tea was considered inferior by the Chinese. But for the British, it was better because it was less perishable and easier to ship long distance. Furthermore, much tea was adulterated with ""filler,"" like sawdust, grass, bugs, etc. Filler used in green tea tended to be toxic, whereas the fillers used to bulk up black tea were generally safer. So black tea thus became the British standard. I was quite amused by Standage's chapter on the final drink: Coca-Cola. I never cared for Coca-Cola. Even as a child, I hated how it left a tacky film on my teeth! Nevertheless, its origins are quite interesting. It turns out that Coca-Cola was originally formulated by John Pemberton, in Atlanta. He was a manufacturer of ""patent medicine,"" which is a term for unregulated folk-style remedies, also known as ""nostrums."" See Patent Medicine HistoryMost patent medicines were herbal or vegetable oil extracts in a suspension of alcohol. In the early 20th century, the U.S. Government finally created the FDA, in order to protect consumers from adulterated foods, poor sanitation practices in abattoirs, and from false claims about the medicinal properties of patent medicines. Because Coca-Cola contained caffeine and even (originally) a very mild dose of alkaloid stimulants (from coca leaves), the U.S. Government eventually brought suit against Coca-Cola. Apparently, the government's concern was that Coca-Cola was the first stimulant marketed to children. But the suit was brought on the ground that the name of the drink was misleading. According to Standage, Coca-Cola prevailed in the trial court (which held that the drink was flavored with kola nut, and was hence ""pure""). On appeal, however, Coca-Cola had a minor loss which resulted in the company's agreement to reduce the caffeine content. Amazingly, Coca-Cola went on to become a global drink, spread in part by military endorsement. Coca-Cola actually partnered with the U.S. military during WWII, to the extent that Coca-Cola plants were constructed on military bases. Eventually, the world began to associate Coca-Cola with the United States. Standage claims that ""Coca-Cola"" is one of the world's most readily understood words, after ""O.K."" There's much interesting material in Standage's penultimate chapter about the hostility toward Coca-Cola by the Soviet Bloc and the Arab countries. I appreciated how Standage concluded his book with water, and the bottled water craze. He points out that, in the U.S., a bottle of water costs more by volume than gasoline, but people still buy it, even though they can get a superior product straight from their home taps, at a small fraction of the cost. I also appreciated Standage's acknowledgment of the importance of potable water to world political stability and human health in general. After all, the six drinks were all initially employed (at least in part) as water-purifiers of one sort or another.Overall, this was a very entertaining and well-written book! "
178,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,4,"Beer - Wine - Alcohol/distilled - Coffee - Tea - Coca-Cola/Soda. And according to Tom Standage, they are drinks that have changed the world.And he's going to tell you why he believes that. And he gives some pretty convincing arguments. From grain used to make beer which due to water being boiled and/or fermented as well as the increased amount of vitamin B, made it a more healthy drink. Also collecting wild grains eventually moved to farming with it's guaranteed grain access which needed irrigation resulting in excess grain to store for shortages as well as religious rites (good harvest was the gift from the gods). In order to verify community contributions, led to accounting, writing, bureaucracy. Excess grain could also be used as payment for workers involved in community construction of buildings and monuments.And that's just beer.As he examines each of his drinks, time and civilization moves toward the present day. Wine - again a healthier alternative to possibly contaminated water but also causes for excess among the Roman elite. Distilled alcohol like brandy, whiskey, rum and rye which - unfortunately were also used as trading goods in the early slave trade. Coffee and coffeehouses which became places for intellectual conversations as well as revolutionary ideas. Exploration of Europe into the Far East for spices and tea (introduced by Arabian traders as well as a bridal gift to Charles II of England) leading to the massive trading conglomerates of the British East India, Dutch East and Dutch West Trading Companies, which used opium to pay for tea instead of the silver previously required. And when the southern states of the U.S. couldn't grow tea, they switched to tobacco. Soda or dry water and the history of Coca-Cola and the cola wars. And back to the original - water.So it's really about seven drinks, not six. It's surprising how extensively interwoven into human history across the globe these six drinks are. And how much they impacted humanity - positively as well as negatively. So, next time when you share a drink, recall that it's a universal sign of hospitality and friendship. That at one time, your drink and that of your companions once shared the same vessel and the clink of glasses signifies a reuniting of that shared bottle or container. Slainte!2020-109"
179,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2511342-marjorie-elwood,4,"From the earliest fermented drinks known to the caffeinated drinks of today, what we drink, why we drink it, and where it came from have played a large part in our history.This richly detailed book divides world history into periods dominated by each of the six beverages, beginning each chapter with the origins of the drink and then delving into its history. Standage explains their effect on society: distilled spirits were durable (because of their high alcohol content) and compact and were, therefore, easier to transport than previous forms of alcohol (wine and beer). Rum – brought to Boston as raw molasses and subsequently distilled – formed a large part of early New England’s economy.Each beverage has a theme, whether it be wine symbolizing civilization and intellectual life, beer representing daily food and our social nature, or coffee exemplifying networking and innovation: “London’s coffeehouses were the crucibles of the scientific and financial revolutions that shaped the modern world.” Coca-Cola, the sixth beverage discussed, represents the rise of America to become the world’s superpower, and the mass marketing and globalization that has ensued.Full of fascinating tidbits (I had no idea that Scotch whisky is distilled beer!), this thought-provoking book was an intriguing way to learn about the history of the world through commodities. So much so that I’ve put his An Edible History of Humanity on my to-read list.If you like accessible books about the history of the world, you might also enjoy: Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond"

It drags here and there, but does have some fun facts I hadn't heard before. Kind of fun, kind of forgettable. Feels like virtue for being true, but doesn't leave a great deal of understanding in its wake."

182,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55999127-ryan-hawkins,5,"Such an enjoyable read. I love reading about food and nutrition, but this is the first food history book I've ever read. And it was right up my alley. His summary of world history in these six main drinks is actually quite accurate, and he has insights on each drink and their histories. Some chapters were slightly better than others, but each chapter really was intriguing.In short, I had no idea that these main six world drinks (seven if you include water, which is talked about briefly but well in the epilogue) really affected history so much. I now know more about beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola (and even water!), and I especially appreciate them and their histories more. It all truly is fascinating. So I definitely would recommend the book. It isn't life changing or anything, but it is an enjoyable and insightful read. For each drink, he has two well organized chapters. And then the epilogue cleverly talks about how the drink of the future looks to actually be water—it all comes full circle. So overall, I loved it. Will read it again in the future (after I forget much of the information).I'd put this right up there with The Dorito Effect in the category of non-Christian non-fiction books that I thoroughly enjoyed."
183,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6915394-kristy-miller,3,"I love books that take a different way of looking at a common subject, or something you think you know, and make you look at it a different way. And that's what Mr. Standage has done here. Instead of looking at world history through political events or from a certain country's view we see how the creation and evolution of six drinks had an impact on world history. We start with beer in the age of ancient Egyptians, move to wine in the age of Classic Greece, then on to the development of distilled spirits in western Europe during the age of exploration and colonization. After that we move to non-alcoholic drinks, starting with coffee's development in the Arabian countries and the impact it had once it reached England and France, on to Tea and how the English appropriated it from the Chinese and used the trade to control China and India, and finally on to Coke, and how it became the ubiquitous ""All-American"" brand that it is today.In book club we all found the book a little uneven, but what is interesting is that we were all speaking of different chapters. For me, I was most intrigued by the audacity of the British Empire's actions in China during the tea chapter. It is a pretty approachable history, over all. Though I wouldn't suggest the audio book; the reader was truly terrible. 3.5 Stars"

It’s not that it’s a bad book or that it’s not interesting, I just found that it could have been much briefer and at times, especially the sections on tea and coffee. The concept here of following how beverages changed and influenced society is a valid one, it was especially interesting to hear about how coffee houses took over parts of Europe as central locations for the discussion of scientific and political ideas. I also found the early history of Coca-Cola and Pepsi to be fascinating as there was information within this work that I was not aware of. Overall, this is a well written history told in an interesting way, the author just rambles on a bit in a few spots and in others is far too brief. "

Surely enjoyable if you are fan of both history and beverages.. Are you that much lucky? However this book has been to many places when I was reading it(for years) and had many drinks with me as well. It's not something you add to a book review but I wanted to keep the memory of the places with this book so here they are- AB coffee in Comilla, Saffron in sylhet, probably Takeout in Dhaka, Cocacola plant of Abdul monem, Fulkoli of Pathantulla....

It has the point of view (if you wish, you may call them “biases”) of that magazine (the author's employer), meaning, it is generally cheerful, it admires and celebrates commerce as heroic, and it doesn't spend time getting excessively hot and bothered about the exploitation and misery that inevitably accompanies human commercial activity.I hope that the author doesn't read the reviews here. If he did, he'd go insane, because he'd find out that the book was both too dry and very readable, there was both too much detail and not enough, and that each of the six parts was duller than the other five. Enjoyable quotes:“There is no history of mankind, there are only many histories of all kinds of aspects of human life.”-- Karl Popper (should be at the beginning of every published microhistory.)About tea: “The progress of this famous plant has been something very like the progress of truth; suspected at first, though very palatable to those who had the courage to taste it; resisted as it encroached; abuse as its popularity spread; and establishing its triumph at least, in cheering the whole land from the palace to the cottage, only by slow and resistless efforts of time and its own virtues.”-- Isaac D'israeli (father of British politican Benjamin Disraeli)"

We went to the library Sunday and I decided just to go ahead and return it.In short:Beer - Mesopotamia, liquid bread, drink of the peopleWine - Greeks, symposia, democracySpirits - Colonialism, Slave Trade, RevolutionCoffee - Age of reason, academic discourse, people aren't drunk all the timeTea - British EmpireCoke - AmericaThe key point i took away is that what every drink has in common is an alternative to water which could be contaminated. all these drinks involve boiling water before people realized that the boiling was the part that was important. This should be History of Western civilization in 6 glasses. I Skimmed through Tea, and looked at Coke. It was at Tea that I completely lost interest. Coffee got a very brief chapter that started in Yemen but quickly went west. Then at the beginning of the Tea chapter, the author says China was an older, more advanced civilization than any other they came in contact with, talks briefly about the Japanese Tea Ceremony and then proceeds to talk about how the west set up the tea trade with china. "
193,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37899-tom,3,"This books was a very interesting concept. Look at how six beverages are linked to various times and places in history. While the beer chapter lacked a bit for me, this may have been due to the fact that it was from the Neolithic Period, and lacked a lot of the excellent primary source material that Enlightenment coffee houses or rum drinking ship captains are accompanied by. Still it was a fascinating look at how civilization and drinks are linked. I wish it had better references and notes, but it was a nice easy read, and those two things can often be at odds.The most interesting factoid: British ships originally provided the crew with ale rations, but eventually it switched to rum, which was often drank with sugar/molasses and lime/lemon. Thus the term, Limeys, and no scurvy. The French originally received wine rations (which provided Vitamin C) but switched to brandy, which distills out the vitamins. So during the Age of Imperialism, the health of British crews increased, and the French became more susceptible to disease. The role this nutrition versus malnutrition played in naval battles and the struggle between Britain and France was probably significant."

The author uses six drinks....beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola....to illustrate how trade, colonialism, and financial stability were brought to various parts of the world through the development and influence of these drinks. It is a fun journey and has some very informative facts about how and why each of these drinks developed. But some of those early iterations, especially beer, would not be recognized in today's world and probably not palatable to modern taste. But water was so polluted even up into the 19th century, that some alternative had to be found . Fermentation or boiling were the answers and certain sicknesses declined rapidly, thus giving some of our six drinks a reputation of ""curing all illnesses"". I don't imagine the person suffering from a major hangover would agree!!"

Not a good thing to mimic.I also found multiple sections repeating themselves. It's bad enough that I've had to read 4 pages in order to understand they drank beer out of a huge bowl, but I don't need to be reminded of it in the next section and the next section to complete the total 20 pages talking about one bowl!!!Also, the typos were distracting! I almost cracked out a red pen and started marking it up!I've read fact heavy books that also put in some funny stories or jokes and I thought this book had ample opportunities to break it up a little and add some flare to the stories. It would have made it at least read-able if not quite enjoyable."

Though a lot of the information wasn't necessarily new to me, between the beer and wine in western culture and the globalisation classes I took, it was an excellent treatment of the subjects. The writing was accessible- it read sort of like a master's thesis written by someone who actually wanted someone besides his thesis committee to take interest in the subject. It felt a little repetitive at times, but all in all wasn't so bad stylistically. I'd recommend this book just sort of in general to people. It's a very readable glance into both the history of civilisation and the current model of globalisation. Though by no means not a complete treatment of these subjects, it would act as a good launching platform into new interests for any reader. Plus, despite its academic nature, it's a pretty short and easy but still information-laiden read."
197,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882126-nancy,4,"A small but very interesting read. A History Of The World In 6 Glasses is a generalized overview of how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and coca cola have steered the course of western civilization. Influences were farther reaching than I would have imagined. These beverages determined social class, sparked a revolution, affected international trade and politics, perpetuated imperialism and had a hand in globalization among other things. In his epilogue Standage stresses the importance of clean water and poses the idea that sustainable water resources may be THE impetus for future conflicts. This is not intended as a deep analysis of history, nor are you going to get a comparison study of Guinness versus PBR, or the merits of French and Italian varietals, but it is entertaining nevertheless. (And to you 'whiners' - pun intended - who define your hipness in the fault you can find in everything you read - get over yourselves.) "

Standage doesn't offer much humor, which is something that lights up nonfiction for me, but that's literally the only drawback. Otherwise, it's a terrific, competent, erudite, informative and accessible volume that just might make one pause to think with appreciation of history before having a drink next time. Standage is also notably unbiased in his writing, all viewpoints and perspectives were represented with impressive evenness, thus easily maximizing its appeal to a variety of readers. I've read Cheever's history of drinking in America, but this encompassed the entire world, centuries of civilization, not to mention it had pictures. Really enlightening, entertaining and enjoyable read for anyone with an appreciation of history. Highly recommended."

The author takes a premise that there are 6 leading drinks (glasses) that influenced the world. Each drink has its own historical era and each drink in one way or another was such a popular drink that it was a force behind change. The drinks: Beer, Wine, Distilled Spirits, Coffee, Tea and Coca Cola. Many interesting stories from each glass - with each drink being given its own section in the book so there is no overlap.

207,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Apologies to all here: much of what follows are notes that I took on some interesting points, so please forgive the rambling, disorganized narrative.The ""Six Glasses"" are: beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola. This book is a history of the world through the lens of the six glasses, so it's selective in a geographical sense, but fairly comprehensive in a temporal sense. Standage's book is just the right length: long enough to include important details, but short enough to keep the reader's interest. It's perfect as ""pop history."" Standage's initial chapter on beer, however, is a disappointment! He only gets us to 1335 B.C.E. I'm interested in beer. It's my favorite drink (sharing first place with coffee). So I'm feeling slighted. There's a lot to know about the development of beer, but Standage doesn't even get us to the point where we started adding hops. (He only makes the statement that this did not happen until the Middle Ages). We get no sense of the role of beer in cultures other than those of ancient Sumeria and Egypt. The only tidbit worth remembering about beer is that Egyptian pharaohs liked to be buried with beer-brewing equipment. I'll have to write a will now, which specifies the same for me! (On second thought, I'll say that the image of Sumerians drinking beer from long, bent straws that dip into gigantic pots that tower over their heads was amusing.)The book starts to pick up some steam when it describes how the Ancient Greeks drank wine. Elaborate rituals, called ""symposion"" (think Plato's Symposium) were commonplace. Wine was served in a giant krater (a pot) and special implements and bowls were used to extract and drink it. Furthermore, wine was always diluted with water. It was considered barbaric to drink full-strength wine. Drunkenness was discouraged; moderation encouraged. Wine was meant to enhance subtle and insightful conversation, not meant to incite rowdy drunkenness. Vast quantities of wine were traded by ship.Romans continued the wine tradition, exporting it to the northern countries, and even using wine that had ""turned"" as a water-purifying agent for soldiers who were out on long campaigns. Apparently, this was what was actually on the vinegar sponge that was offered to Jesus while he hung on the cross. There's an interesting passage about Galen and Marcus Aurelius. Galen prescribed wine as health tonic. Apparently, the older and more expensive the vintage, the better! Even so, it was used to wash down some rather vile medicinal concoctions (think ear of bat, eye of toad, etc.)Eventually, the Moors of Spain discovered that wine could be distilled in order to increase the alcohol content. The word ""alcohol"" comes from the Arabic word for distilled antinomy, which was used as eye shadow. Odd to think that Muslims, who now renounce it, were the inventors of strong spirits!Standage also makes an interesting point about how much Arab learning (algebra, trigonometry, astronomy) was used by Western Europeans in their push to find an alternate route to the East. This was felt to be necessary because Arabs dominated the spice trade routes to the east, so Western Europeans thought perhaps they could find their own route to China through the west.What they found, instead of a new road to China, was a new place to grow sugar cane! That place was the Caribbean. (Except here's another weird twist: the Arabs had somehow obtained sugar cane from Polynesians? Gotta research this one!) In Barbados, the English eventually discovered the recipe for rum, which is made from molasses -- a waste product of sugar production. Rum -- mixed with lime juice, sugar, and water -- became ""grog,"" which helped the British navy avoid scurvy and defeat the Spanish at Trafalgar. Interesting point by Standage here, about how alcohol content was tested by heating rum with a few grains of gunpowder. If the gunpowder could just barely be brought to the ignition point, that meant the rum was about 50% alcohol, and thus suitable for sailors.Rum also became instrumental in the slave trade. Africans could sell slaves for rum. The slaves would be shipped to the Caribbean to grow sugar cane, and the cycle could be perpetuated. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!Interestingly, a tax favoring British molasses (which was used in the American Colonies to make cheap rum) was credited by John Adams as one of the main spurs of the American Revolution. Standage claims that rum was the most widely consumed drink in colonial America. Early American settlers complained that the unavailability of alcohol was one of the most unbearable hardships of the new world. So when John Winthrop came over, his ship was laden with 10,0000 gallons of beer! Rum, however, had the advantage of being less perishable than beer, and it could be cheaply made in the colonies wherever molasses was imported. So it could be readily shipped, and readily made in port cities.Although rum could be cheaply made in ports, it got more expensive to produce as one ventured inland, where molasses became scarce. Furthermore, Irish and Scottish immigrants sought to make whiskey without easy access to barley. So they used rye and corn. Apparently, excellent corn mash whiskey was made in Bourbon County, KY (hence the name ""Bourbon Whiskey""). The first rebellion against the U.S. Government was inspired by an excise tax on whiskey (the tax was imposed on production, and was not dependent upon sale). The government flexed its muscles by sending troops to western Pennsylvania, in order to quell the violence against tax collectors. Standage seems to suggest that this was the first real test of federal power in the U.S. The distillers backed down, and later the government abolished the tax.As Standage moves on to coffee, I was struck by several revelations. First, that London was the first big center of coffee houses! Although we associate the British with tea, coffee was all the rage well before the tea boom got going. Standage makes a comparison of coffee houses to today's Internet. At first, I was skeptical of this claim. Yet it turns out that each coffee house was devoted to a particular trade or art! And furthermore, people picked up their mail and got their news at coffee-houses. Sometimes runners would circulate news from one coffee house to the next. So the comparison to the Internet(today's central mechanism for information exchange) is apt. Standage asserts that English coffee houses were places where scientific, political, and philosophical ideas could be openly discussed. Apparently, some coffee-house arguments about gravity and its relation to elliptical orbits caused some head-butting between Christopher Wren, Thomas Hooke, and Edmund Halley. Newton finally settled the argument by publishing the Principia -- which Standage claims was, at least in part, inspired by the coffee house argument!French coffee houses were another matter. Apparently, they were rife with government spies. Woe betide he who openly challenged the establishment! He'd end up in the Bastille, or flee to England like Voltaire did. There's an interesting story about how a French sailor brought coffee to the Caribbean. The only coffee plant in Paris was in an inaccessible royal garden. So the sailor, de Clieu, persuaded a doctor to claim (falsely) that a cutting from the tree was necessary to prepare medicine for a patient. Thanks to de Clieu's smuggling act, coffee plantations were eventually established in Brazil, which became the world's largest exporter of coffee. It seems that the French won the trade contest with the Dutch, who had already established coffee plantations in the East Indies, including Java. And the poor Arabs, who invented coffee, never really got much economic benefit from it.Perhaps the most surprising revelation about coffee is the controversy it caused wherever it was introduced. Even in Arabia, it was compared to alcohol because of its mood-altering properties. In the west, it was considered by the old guard to be culturally subversive -- which I suppose it was, but in a good way. The coffee house cultures were places where people could test new ideas in an informal setting. Much intellectual progress was accomplished there. In the chapter on tea I discovered a new drink: koumiss (fermented mare's milk!) At the end of Sung Dynasty, the Mongols took control of China. Koumiss was favored over tea by the Mongols, who lived on their horses. At the height of their power, Kublai Khan's brother erected a fountain that dispensed rice beer from China, grape wine from Persia, mead from Eurasia, and koumiss! What a marvelous image! The Mongolian empire was short-lived, so perhaps that's why I never heard of koumiss. Anyway, China got the ball rolling when it comes to tea, and it probably started gaining in popularity in the First Century, C.E. Chinese control of the tea trade actually made it more expensive than coffee for quite some time, which helps to explain why coffee was initially more popular than tea in Europe. Europeans had their own coffee plantations in the West and East Indies long before they had their own tea plantations (eventually in British-controlled India).European-controlled tea plantations didn't come until the British East India Company discovered that tea could be grown in India, some time in the 1860's. If I remember correctly, the BEIC at some point had more money than Great Britain itself, and paid ten percent of Britain's tax revenue. And it operated almost like a government unto itself in India. As the BEIC was able to bring the cost of tea down not only by growing it, but by manufacturing and shipping it as well, tea became the universal drink of Britain (ca. 1860 forward). It had formerly been the exclusive drink of the elite and the wealthy. There's an interesting interlude, beginning in 1839 or so, called ""The Opium Wars."" The British, at this time still dependent on trading for tea in China, had nothing to offer the Chinese except opium from India. This was problematic, however, because the Chinese had outlawed opium! So the BEIC used intermediaries to sell the opium for silver, which was the only thing the Chinese would accept in exchange for tea. When the Chinese became wise to this plot, they destroyed massive quantities of illegal opium. The British then declared a war (which they won with superior military and naval technology) and demanded reparations for the lost contraband! Furthermore, this is when the British invaded Hong Kong and made it part of their own political sphere. One extremely interesting point here is that tea was originally only green tea. Green tea is made from the same leaves as black tea, except that less processing is involved. Black tea is made by scoring and oxidizing the leaves before drying them. Standage points out that black tea was considered inferior by the Chinese. But for the British, it was better because it was less perishable and easier to ship long distance. Furthermore, much tea was adulterated with ""filler,"" like sawdust, grass, bugs, etc. Filler used in green tea tended to be toxic, whereas the fillers used to bulk up black tea were generally safer. So black tea thus became the British standard. I was quite amused by Standage's chapter on the final drink: Coca-Cola. I never cared for Coca-Cola. Even as a child, I hated how it left a tacky film on my teeth! Nevertheless, its origins are quite interesting. It turns out that Coca-Cola was originally formulated by John Pemberton, in Atlanta. He was a manufacturer of ""patent medicine,"" which is a term for unregulated folk-style remedies, also known as ""nostrums."" See Patent Medicine HistoryMost patent medicines were herbal or vegetable oil extracts in a suspension of alcohol. In the early 20th century, the U.S. Government finally created the FDA, in order to protect consumers from adulterated foods, poor sanitation practices in abattoirs, and from false claims about the medicinal properties of patent medicines. Because Coca-Cola contained caffeine and even (originally) a very mild dose of alkaloid stimulants (from coca leaves), the U.S. Government eventually brought suit against Coca-Cola. Apparently, the government's concern was that Coca-Cola was the first stimulant marketed to children. But the suit was brought on the ground that the name of the drink was misleading. According to Standage, Coca-Cola prevailed in the trial court (which held that the drink was flavored with kola nut, and was hence ""pure""). On appeal, however, Coca-Cola had a minor loss which resulted in the company's agreement to reduce the caffeine content. Amazingly, Coca-Cola went on to become a global drink, spread in part by military endorsement. Coca-Cola actually partnered with the U.S. military during WWII, to the extent that Coca-Cola plants were constructed on military bases. Eventually, the world began to associate Coca-Cola with the United States. Standage claims that ""Coca-Cola"" is one of the world's most readily understood words, after ""O.K."" There's much interesting material in Standage's penultimate chapter about the hostility toward Coca-Cola by the Soviet Bloc and the Arab countries. I appreciated how Standage concluded his book with water, and the bottled water craze. He points out that, in the U.S., a bottle of water costs more by volume than gasoline, but people still buy it, even though they can get a superior product straight from their home taps, at a small fraction of the cost. I also appreciated Standage's acknowledgment of the importance of potable water to world political stability and human health in general. After all, the six drinks were all initially employed (at least in part) as water-purifiers of one sort or another.Overall, this was a very entertaining and well-written book! "
208,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,4,"Beer - Wine - Alcohol/distilled - Coffee - Tea - Coca-Cola/Soda. And according to Tom Standage, they are drinks that have changed the world.And he's going to tell you why he believes that. And he gives some pretty convincing arguments. From grain used to make beer which due to water being boiled and/or fermented as well as the increased amount of vitamin B, made it a more healthy drink. Also collecting wild grains eventually moved to farming with it's guaranteed grain access which needed irrigation resulting in excess grain to store for shortages as well as religious rites (good harvest was the gift from the gods). In order to verify community contributions, led to accounting, writing, bureaucracy. Excess grain could also be used as payment for workers involved in community construction of buildings and monuments.And that's just beer.As he examines each of his drinks, time and civilization moves toward the present day. Wine - again a healthier alternative to possibly contaminated water but also causes for excess among the Roman elite. Distilled alcohol like brandy, whiskey, rum and rye which - unfortunately were also used as trading goods in the early slave trade. Coffee and coffeehouses which became places for intellectual conversations as well as revolutionary ideas. Exploration of Europe into the Far East for spices and tea (introduced by Arabian traders as well as a bridal gift to Charles II of England) leading to the massive trading conglomerates of the British East India, Dutch East and Dutch West Trading Companies, which used opium to pay for tea instead of the silver previously required. And when the southern states of the U.S. couldn't grow tea, they switched to tobacco. Soda or dry water and the history of Coca-Cola and the cola wars. And back to the original - water.So it's really about seven drinks, not six. It's surprising how extensively interwoven into human history across the globe these six drinks are. And how much they impacted humanity - positively as well as negatively. So, next time when you share a drink, recall that it's a universal sign of hospitality and friendship. That at one time, your drink and that of your companions once shared the same vessel and the clink of glasses signifies a reuniting of that shared bottle or container. Slainte!2020-109"

Standage explains their effect on society: distilled spirits were durable (because of their high alcohol content) and compact and were, therefore, easier to transport than previous forms of alcohol (wine and beer). Rum – brought to Boston as raw molasses and subsequently distilled – formed a large part of early New England’s economy.Each beverage has a theme, whether it be wine symbolizing civilization and intellectual life, beer representing daily food and our social nature, or coffee exemplifying networking and innovation: “London’s coffeehouses were the crucibles of the scientific and financial revolutions that shaped the modern world.” Coca-Cola, the sixth beverage discussed, represents the rise of America to become the world’s superpower, and the mass marketing and globalization that has ensued.Full of fascinating tidbits (I had no idea that Scotch whisky is distilled beer!), this thought-provoking book was an intriguing way to learn about the history of the world through commodities.

212,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55999127-ryan-hawkins,5,"Such an enjoyable read. I love reading about food and nutrition, but this is the first food history book I've ever read. And it was right up my alley. His summary of world history in these six main drinks is actually quite accurate, and he has insights on each drink and their histories. Some chapters were slightly better than others, but each chapter really was intriguing.In short, I had no idea that these main six world drinks (seven if you include water, which is talked about briefly but well in the epilogue) really affected history so much. I now know more about beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola (and even water!), and I especially appreciate them and their histories more. It all truly is fascinating. So I definitely would recommend the book. It isn't life changing or anything, but it is an enjoyable and insightful read. For each drink, he has two well organized chapters. And then the epilogue cleverly talks about how the drink of the future looks to actually be water—it all comes full circle. So overall, I loved it. Will read it again in the future (after I forget much of the information).I'd put this right up there with The Dorito Effect in the category of non-Christian non-fiction books that I thoroughly enjoyed."
213,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6915394-kristy-miller,3,"I love books that take a different way of looking at a common subject, or something you think you know, and make you look at it a different way. And that's what Mr. Standage has done here. Instead of looking at world history through political events or from a certain country's view we see how the creation and evolution of six drinks had an impact on world history. We start with beer in the age of ancient Egyptians, move to wine in the age of Classic Greece, then on to the development of distilled spirits in western Europe during the age of exploration and colonization. After that we move to non-alcoholic drinks, starting with coffee's development in the Arabian countries and the impact it had once it reached England and France, on to Tea and how the English appropriated it from the Chinese and used the trade to control China and India, and finally on to Coke, and how it became the ubiquitous ""All-American"" brand that it is today.In book club we all found the book a little uneven, but what is interesting is that we were all speaking of different chapters. For me, I was most intrigued by the audacity of the British Empire's actions in China during the tea chapter. It is a pretty approachable history, over all. Though I wouldn't suggest the audio book; the reader was truly terrible. 3.5 Stars"
214,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,3," I really wanted to like this book, but instead found it to be a struggle to finish at times. It’s not that it’s a bad book or that it’s not interesting, I just found that it could have been much briefer and at times, especially the sections on tea and coffee. The concept here of following how beverages changed and influenced society is a valid one, it was especially interesting to hear about how coffee houses took over parts of Europe as central locations for the discussion of scientific and political ideas. I also found the early history of Coca-Cola and Pepsi to be fascinating as there was information within this work that I was not aware of. Overall, this is a well written history told in an interesting way, the author just rambles on a bit in a few spots and in others is far too brief. "

Surely enjoyable if you are fan of both history and beverages.. Are you that much lucky? However this book has been to many places when I was reading it(for years) and had many drinks with me as well. It's not something you add to a book review but I wanted to keep the memory of the places with this book so here they are- AB coffee in Comilla, Saffron in sylhet, probably Takeout in Dhaka, Cocacola plant of Abdul monem, Fulkoli of Pathantulla....

221,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david,4,"An enjoyable and readable book, like an edition of The Economist about things that happened a long time ago. It has the point of view (if you wish, you may call them “biases”) of that magazine (the author's employer), meaning, it is generally cheerful, it admires and celebrates commerce as heroic, and it doesn't spend time getting excessively hot and bothered about the exploitation and misery that inevitably accompanies human commercial activity.I hope that the author doesn't read the reviews here. If he did, he'd go insane, because he'd find out that the book was both too dry and very readable, there was both too much detail and not enough, and that each of the six parts was duller than the other five. Enjoyable quotes:“There is no history of mankind, there are only many histories of all kinds of aspects of human life.”-- Karl Popper (should be at the beginning of every published microhistory.)About tea: “The progress of this famous plant has been something very like the progress of truth; suspected at first, though very palatable to those who had the courage to taste it; resisted as it encroached; abuse as its popularity spread; and establishing its triumph at least, in cheering the whole land from the palace to the cottage, only by slow and resistless efforts of time and its own virtues.”-- Isaac D'israeli (father of British politican Benjamin Disraeli)"
222,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/930297-elizabeth,2,"I didn't finish this book. We went to the library Sunday and I decided just to go ahead and return it.In short:Beer - Mesopotamia, liquid bread, drink of the peopleWine - Greeks, symposia, democracySpirits - Colonialism, Slave Trade, RevolutionCoffee - Age of reason, academic discourse, people aren't drunk all the timeTea - British EmpireCoke - AmericaThe key point i took away is that what every drink has in common is an alternative to water which could be contaminated. all these drinks involve boiling water before people realized that the boiling was the part that was important. This should be History of Western civilization in 6 glasses. I Skimmed through Tea, and looked at Coke. It was at Tea that I completely lost interest. Coffee got a very brief chapter that started in Yemen but quickly went west. Then at the beginning of the Tea chapter, the author says China was an older, more advanced civilization than any other they came in contact with, talks briefly about the Japanese Tea Ceremony and then proceeds to talk about how the west set up the tea trade with china. "
223,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37899-tom,3,"This books was a very interesting concept. Look at how six beverages are linked to various times and places in history. While the beer chapter lacked a bit for me, this may have been due to the fact that it was from the Neolithic Period, and lacked a lot of the excellent primary source material that Enlightenment coffee houses or rum drinking ship captains are accompanied by. Still it was a fascinating look at how civilization and drinks are linked. I wish it had better references and notes, but it was a nice easy read, and those two things can often be at odds.The most interesting factoid: British ships originally provided the crew with ale rations, but eventually it switched to rum, which was often drank with sugar/molasses and lime/lemon. Thus the term, Limeys, and no scurvy. The French originally received wine rations (which provided Vitamin C) but switched to brandy, which distills out the vitamins. So during the Age of Imperialism, the health of British crews increased, and the French became more susceptible to disease. The role this nutrition versus malnutrition played in naval battles and the struggle between Britain and France was probably significant."

The author uses six drinks....beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola....to illustrate how trade, colonialism, and financial stability were brought to various parts of the world through the development and influence of these drinks. It is a fun journey and has some very informative facts about how and why each of these drinks developed. But some of those early iterations, especially beer, would not be recognized in today's world and probably not palatable to modern taste. But water was so polluted even up into the 19th century, that some alternative had to be found . Fermentation or boiling were the answers and certain sicknesses declined rapidly, thus giving some of our six drinks a reputation of ""curing all illnesses"". I don't imagine the person suffering from a major hangover would agree!!"

Not a good thing to mimic.I also found multiple sections repeating themselves. It's bad enough that I've had to read 4 pages in order to understand they drank beer out of a huge bowl, but I don't need to be reminded of it in the next section and the next section to complete the total 20 pages talking about one bowl!!!Also, the typos were distracting! I almost cracked out a red pen and started marking it up!I've read fact heavy books that also put in some funny stories or jokes and I thought this book had ample opportunities to break it up a little and add some flare to the stories. It would have made it at least read-able if not quite enjoyable."

Though a lot of the information wasn't necessarily new to me, between the beer and wine in western culture and the globalisation classes I took, it was an excellent treatment of the subjects. The writing was accessible- it read sort of like a master's thesis written by someone who actually wanted someone besides his thesis committee to take interest in the subject. It felt a little repetitive at times, but all in all wasn't so bad stylistically. I'd recommend this book just sort of in general to people. It's a very readable glance into both the history of civilisation and the current model of globalisation. Though by no means not a complete treatment of these subjects, it would act as a good launching platform into new interests for any reader. Plus, despite its academic nature, it's a pretty short and easy but still information-laiden read."
227,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882126-nancy,4,"A small but very interesting read. A History Of The World In 6 Glasses is a generalized overview of how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and coca cola have steered the course of western civilization. Influences were farther reaching than I would have imagined. These beverages determined social class, sparked a revolution, affected international trade and politics, perpetuated imperialism and had a hand in globalization among other things. In his epilogue Standage stresses the importance of clean water and poses the idea that sustainable water resources may be THE impetus for future conflicts. This is not intended as a deep analysis of history, nor are you going to get a comparison study of Guinness versus PBR, or the merits of French and Italian varietals, but it is entertaining nevertheless. (And to you 'whiners' - pun intended - who define your hipness in the fault you can find in everything you read - get over yourselves.) "
228,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit,5,"I certainly do love a good thematic history. This was a very good one at that. Standage doesn't offer much humor, which is something that lights up nonfiction for me, but that's literally the only drawback. Otherwise, it's a terrific, competent, erudite, informative and accessible volume that just might make one pause to think with appreciation of history before having a drink next time. Standage is also notably unbiased in his writing, all viewpoints and perspectives were represented with impressive evenness, thus easily maximizing its appeal to a variety of readers. I've read Cheever's history of drinking in America, but this encompassed the entire world, centuries of civilization, not to mention it had pictures. Really enlightening, entertaining and enjoyable read for anyone with an appreciation of history. Highly recommended."

The author takes a premise that there are 6 leading drinks (glasses) that influenced the world. Each drink has its own historical era and each drink in one way or another was such a popular drink that it was a force behind change. The drinks: Beer, Wine, Distilled Spirits, Coffee, Tea and Coca Cola. Many interesting stories from each glass - with each drink being given its own section in the book so there is no overlap.

237,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Apologies to all here: much of what follows are notes that I took on some interesting points, so please forgive the rambling, disorganized narrative.The ""Six Glasses"" are: beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola. This book is a history of the world through the lens of the six glasses, so it's selective in a geographical sense, but fairly comprehensive in a temporal sense. Standage's book is just the right length: long enough to include important details, but short enough to keep the reader's interest. It's perfect as ""pop history."" Standage's initial chapter on beer, however, is a disappointment! He only gets us to 1335 B.C.E. I'm interested in beer. It's my favorite drink (sharing first place with coffee). So I'm feeling slighted. There's a lot to know about the development of beer, but Standage doesn't even get us to the point where we started adding hops. (He only makes the statement that this did not happen until the Middle Ages). We get no sense of the role of beer in cultures other than those of ancient Sumeria and Egypt. The only tidbit worth remembering about beer is that Egyptian pharaohs liked to be buried with beer-brewing equipment. I'll have to write a will now, which specifies the same for me! (On second thought, I'll say that the image of Sumerians drinking beer from long, bent straws that dip into gigantic pots that tower over their heads was amusing.)The book starts to pick up some steam when it describes how the Ancient Greeks drank wine. Elaborate rituals, called ""symposion"" (think Plato's Symposium) were commonplace. Wine was served in a giant krater (a pot) and special implements and bowls were used to extract and drink it. Furthermore, wine was always diluted with water. It was considered barbaric to drink full-strength wine. Drunkenness was discouraged; moderation encouraged. Wine was meant to enhance subtle and insightful conversation, not meant to incite rowdy drunkenness. Vast quantities of wine were traded by ship.Romans continued the wine tradition, exporting it to the northern countries, and even using wine that had ""turned"" as a water-purifying agent for soldiers who were out on long campaigns. Apparently, this was what was actually on the vinegar sponge that was offered to Jesus while he hung on the cross. There's an interesting passage about Galen and Marcus Aurelius. Galen prescribed wine as health tonic. Apparently, the older and more expensive the vintage, the better! Even so, it was used to wash down some rather vile medicinal concoctions (think ear of bat, eye of toad, etc.)Eventually, the Moors of Spain discovered that wine could be distilled in order to increase the alcohol content. The word ""alcohol"" comes from the Arabic word for distilled antinomy, which was used as eye shadow. Odd to think that Muslims, who now renounce it, were the inventors of strong spirits!Standage also makes an interesting point about how much Arab learning (algebra, trigonometry, astronomy) was used by Western Europeans in their push to find an alternate route to the East. This was felt to be necessary because Arabs dominated the spice trade routes to the east, so Western Europeans thought perhaps they could find their own route to China through the west.What they found, instead of a new road to China, was a new place to grow sugar cane! That place was the Caribbean. (Except here's another weird twist: the Arabs had somehow obtained sugar cane from Polynesians? Gotta research this one!) In Barbados, the English eventually discovered the recipe for rum, which is made from molasses -- a waste product of sugar production. Rum -- mixed with lime juice, sugar, and water -- became ""grog,"" which helped the British navy avoid scurvy and defeat the Spanish at Trafalgar. Interesting point by Standage here, about how alcohol content was tested by heating rum with a few grains of gunpowder. If the gunpowder could just barely be brought to the ignition point, that meant the rum was about 50% alcohol, and thus suitable for sailors.Rum also became instrumental in the slave trade. Africans could sell slaves for rum. The slaves would be shipped to the Caribbean to grow sugar cane, and the cycle could be perpetuated. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!Interestingly, a tax favoring British molasses (which was used in the American Colonies to make cheap rum) was credited by John Adams as one of the main spurs of the American Revolution. Standage claims that rum was the most widely consumed drink in colonial America. Early American settlers complained that the unavailability of alcohol was one of the most unbearable hardships of the new world. So when John Winthrop came over, his ship was laden with 10,0000 gallons of beer! Rum, however, had the advantage of being less perishable than beer, and it could be cheaply made in the colonies wherever molasses was imported. So it could be readily shipped, and readily made in port cities.Although rum could be cheaply made in ports, it got more expensive to produce as one ventured inland, where molasses became scarce. Furthermore, Irish and Scottish immigrants sought to make whiskey without easy access to barley. So they used rye and corn. Apparently, excellent corn mash whiskey was made in Bourbon County, KY (hence the name ""Bourbon Whiskey""). The first rebellion against the U.S. Government was inspired by an excise tax on whiskey (the tax was imposed on production, and was not dependent upon sale). The government flexed its muscles by sending troops to western Pennsylvania, in order to quell the violence against tax collectors. Standage seems to suggest that this was the first real test of federal power in the U.S. The distillers backed down, and later the government abolished the tax.As Standage moves on to coffee, I was struck by several revelations. First, that London was the first big center of coffee houses! Although we associate the British with tea, coffee was all the rage well before the tea boom got going. Standage makes a comparison of coffee houses to today's Internet. At first, I was skeptical of this claim. Yet it turns out that each coffee house was devoted to a particular trade or art! And furthermore, people picked up their mail and got their news at coffee-houses. Sometimes runners would circulate news from one coffee house to the next. So the comparison to the Internet(today's central mechanism for information exchange) is apt. Standage asserts that English coffee houses were places where scientific, political, and philosophical ideas could be openly discussed. Apparently, some coffee-house arguments about gravity and its relation to elliptical orbits caused some head-butting between Christopher Wren, Thomas Hooke, and Edmund Halley. Newton finally settled the argument by publishing the Principia -- which Standage claims was, at least in part, inspired by the coffee house argument!French coffee houses were another matter. Apparently, they were rife with government spies. Woe betide he who openly challenged the establishment! He'd end up in the Bastille, or flee to England like Voltaire did. There's an interesting story about how a French sailor brought coffee to the Caribbean. The only coffee plant in Paris was in an inaccessible royal garden. So the sailor, de Clieu, persuaded a doctor to claim (falsely) that a cutting from the tree was necessary to prepare medicine for a patient. Thanks to de Clieu's smuggling act, coffee plantations were eventually established in Brazil, which became the world's largest exporter of coffee. It seems that the French won the trade contest with the Dutch, who had already established coffee plantations in the East Indies, including Java. And the poor Arabs, who invented coffee, never really got much economic benefit from it.Perhaps the most surprising revelation about coffee is the controversy it caused wherever it was introduced. Even in Arabia, it was compared to alcohol because of its mood-altering properties. In the west, it was considered by the old guard to be culturally subversive -- which I suppose it was, but in a good way. The coffee house cultures were places where people could test new ideas in an informal setting. Much intellectual progress was accomplished there. In the chapter on tea I discovered a new drink: koumiss (fermented mare's milk!) At the end of Sung Dynasty, the Mongols took control of China. Koumiss was favored over tea by the Mongols, who lived on their horses. At the height of their power, Kublai Khan's brother erected a fountain that dispensed rice beer from China, grape wine from Persia, mead from Eurasia, and koumiss! What a marvelous image! The Mongolian empire was short-lived, so perhaps that's why I never heard of koumiss. Anyway, China got the ball rolling when it comes to tea, and it probably started gaining in popularity in the First Century, C.E. Chinese control of the tea trade actually made it more expensive than coffee for quite some time, which helps to explain why coffee was initially more popular than tea in Europe. Europeans had their own coffee plantations in the West and East Indies long before they had their own tea plantations (eventually in British-controlled India).European-controlled tea plantations didn't come until the British East India Company discovered that tea could be grown in India, some time in the 1860's. If I remember correctly, the BEIC at some point had more money than Great Britain itself, and paid ten percent of Britain's tax revenue. And it operated almost like a government unto itself in India. As the BEIC was able to bring the cost of tea down not only by growing it, but by manufacturing and shipping it as well, tea became the universal drink of Britain (ca. 1860 forward). It had formerly been the exclusive drink of the elite and the wealthy. There's an interesting interlude, beginning in 1839 or so, called ""The Opium Wars."" The British, at this time still dependent on trading for tea in China, had nothing to offer the Chinese except opium from India. This was problematic, however, because the Chinese had outlawed opium! So the BEIC used intermediaries to sell the opium for silver, which was the only thing the Chinese would accept in exchange for tea. When the Chinese became wise to this plot, they destroyed massive quantities of illegal opium. The British then declared a war (which they won with superior military and naval technology) and demanded reparations for the lost contraband! Furthermore, this is when the British invaded Hong Kong and made it part of their own political sphere. One extremely interesting point here is that tea was originally only green tea. Green tea is made from the same leaves as black tea, except that less processing is involved. Black tea is made by scoring and oxidizing the leaves before drying them. Standage points out that black tea was considered inferior by the Chinese. But for the British, it was better because it was less perishable and easier to ship long distance. Furthermore, much tea was adulterated with ""filler,"" like sawdust, grass, bugs, etc. Filler used in green tea tended to be toxic, whereas the fillers used to bulk up black tea were generally safer. So black tea thus became the British standard. I was quite amused by Standage's chapter on the final drink: Coca-Cola. I never cared for Coca-Cola. Even as a child, I hated how it left a tacky film on my teeth! Nevertheless, its origins are quite interesting. It turns out that Coca-Cola was originally formulated by John Pemberton, in Atlanta. He was a manufacturer of ""patent medicine,"" which is a term for unregulated folk-style remedies, also known as ""nostrums."" See Patent Medicine HistoryMost patent medicines were herbal or vegetable oil extracts in a suspension of alcohol. In the early 20th century, the U.S. Government finally created the FDA, in order to protect consumers from adulterated foods, poor sanitation practices in abattoirs, and from false claims about the medicinal properties of patent medicines. Because Coca-Cola contained caffeine and even (originally) a very mild dose of alkaloid stimulants (from coca leaves), the U.S. Government eventually brought suit against Coca-Cola. Apparently, the government's concern was that Coca-Cola was the first stimulant marketed to children. But the suit was brought on the ground that the name of the drink was misleading. According to Standage, Coca-Cola prevailed in the trial court (which held that the drink was flavored with kola nut, and was hence ""pure""). On appeal, however, Coca-Cola had a minor loss which resulted in the company's agreement to reduce the caffeine content. Amazingly, Coca-Cola went on to become a global drink, spread in part by military endorsement. Coca-Cola actually partnered with the U.S. military during WWII, to the extent that Coca-Cola plants were constructed on military bases. Eventually, the world began to associate Coca-Cola with the United States. Standage claims that ""Coca-Cola"" is one of the world's most readily understood words, after ""O.K."" There's much interesting material in Standage's penultimate chapter about the hostility toward Coca-Cola by the Soviet Bloc and the Arab countries. I appreciated how Standage concluded his book with water, and the bottled water craze. He points out that, in the U.S., a bottle of water costs more by volume than gasoline, but people still buy it, even though they can get a superior product straight from their home taps, at a small fraction of the cost. I also appreciated Standage's acknowledgment of the importance of potable water to world political stability and human health in general. After all, the six drinks were all initially employed (at least in part) as water-purifiers of one sort or another.Overall, this was a very entertaining and well-written book! "
238,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,4,"Beer - Wine - Alcohol/distilled - Coffee - Tea - Coca-Cola/Soda. And according to Tom Standage, they are drinks that have changed the world.And he's going to tell you why he believes that. And he gives some pretty convincing arguments. From grain used to make beer which due to water being boiled and/or fermented as well as the increased amount of vitamin B, made it a more healthy drink. Also collecting wild grains eventually moved to farming with it's guaranteed grain access which needed irrigation resulting in excess grain to store for shortages as well as religious rites (good harvest was the gift from the gods). In order to verify community contributions, led to accounting, writing, bureaucracy. Excess grain could also be used as payment for workers involved in community construction of buildings and monuments.And that's just beer.As he examines each of his drinks, time and civilization moves toward the present day. Wine - again a healthier alternative to possibly contaminated water but also causes for excess among the Roman elite. Distilled alcohol like brandy, whiskey, rum and rye which - unfortunately were also used as trading goods in the early slave trade. Coffee and coffeehouses which became places for intellectual conversations as well as revolutionary ideas. Exploration of Europe into the Far East for spices and tea (introduced by Arabian traders as well as a bridal gift to Charles II of England) leading to the massive trading conglomerates of the British East India, Dutch East and Dutch West Trading Companies, which used opium to pay for tea instead of the silver previously required. And when the southern states of the U.S. couldn't grow tea, they switched to tobacco. Soda or dry water and the history of Coca-Cola and the cola wars. And back to the original - water.So it's really about seven drinks, not six. It's surprising how extensively interwoven into human history across the globe these six drinks are. And how much they impacted humanity - positively as well as negatively. So, next time when you share a drink, recall that it's a universal sign of hospitality and friendship. That at one time, your drink and that of your companions once shared the same vessel and the clink of glasses signifies a reuniting of that shared bottle or container. Slainte!2020-109"

Standage explains their effect on society: distilled spirits were durable (because of their high alcohol content) and compact and were, therefore, easier to transport than previous forms of alcohol (wine and beer). Rum – brought to Boston as raw molasses and subsequently distilled – formed a large part of early New England’s economy.Each beverage has a theme, whether it be wine symbolizing civilization and intellectual life, beer representing daily food and our social nature, or coffee exemplifying networking and innovation: “London’s coffeehouses were the crucibles of the scientific and financial revolutions that shaped the modern world.” Coca-Cola, the sixth beverage discussed, represents the rise of America to become the world’s superpower, and the mass marketing and globalization that has ensued.Full of fascinating tidbits (I had no idea that Scotch whisky is distilled beer!), this thought-provoking book was an intriguing way to learn about the history of the world through commodities. So much so that I’ve put his An Edible History of Humanity on my to-read list.If you like accessible books about the history of the world, you might also enjoy: Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond"

242,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55999127-ryan-hawkins,5,"Such an enjoyable read. I love reading about food and nutrition, but this is the first food history book I've ever read. And it was right up my alley. His summary of world history in these six main drinks is actually quite accurate, and he has insights on each drink and their histories. Some chapters were slightly better than others, but each chapter really was intriguing.In short, I had no idea that these main six world drinks (seven if you include water, which is talked about briefly but well in the epilogue) really affected history so much. I now know more about beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola (and even water!), and I especially appreciate them and their histories more. It all truly is fascinating. So I definitely would recommend the book. It isn't life changing or anything, but it is an enjoyable and insightful read. For each drink, he has two well organized chapters. And then the epilogue cleverly talks about how the drink of the future looks to actually be water—it all comes full circle. So overall, I loved it. Will read it again in the future (after I forget much of the information).I'd put this right up there with The Dorito Effect in the category of non-Christian non-fiction books that I thoroughly enjoyed."
243,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6915394-kristy-miller,3,"I love books that take a different way of looking at a common subject, or something you think you know, and make you look at it a different way. And that's what Mr. Standage has done here. Instead of looking at world history through political events or from a certain country's view we see how the creation and evolution of six drinks had an impact on world history. We start with beer in the age of ancient Egyptians, move to wine in the age of Classic Greece, then on to the development of distilled spirits in western Europe during the age of exploration and colonization. After that we move to non-alcoholic drinks, starting with coffee's development in the Arabian countries and the impact it had once it reached England and France, on to Tea and how the English appropriated it from the Chinese and used the trade to control China and India, and finally on to Coke, and how it became the ubiquitous ""All-American"" brand that it is today.In book club we all found the book a little uneven, but what is interesting is that we were all speaking of different chapters. For me, I was most intrigued by the audacity of the British Empire's actions in China during the tea chapter. It is a pretty approachable history, over all. Though I wouldn't suggest the audio book; the reader was truly terrible. 3.5 Stars"
244,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10013767-jeff-mauch,3," I really wanted to like this book, but instead found it to be a struggle to finish at times. It’s not that it’s a bad book or that it’s not interesting, I just found that it could have been much briefer and at times, especially the sections on tea and coffee. The concept here of following how beverages changed and influenced society is a valid one, it was especially interesting to hear about how coffee houses took over parts of Europe as central locations for the discussion of scientific and political ideas. I also found the early history of Coca-Cola and Pepsi to be fascinating as there was information within this work that I was not aware of. Overall, this is a well written history told in an interesting way, the author just rambles on a bit in a few spots and in others is far too brief. "

It's not something you add to a book review but I wanted to keep the memory of the places with this book so here they are- AB coffee in Comilla, Saffron in sylhet, probably Takeout in Dhaka, Cocacola plant of Abdul monem, Fulkoli of Pathantulla....

It has the point of view (if you wish, you may call them “biases”) of that magazine (the author's employer), meaning, it is generally cheerful, it admires and celebrates commerce as heroic, and it doesn't spend time getting excessively hot and bothered about the exploitation and misery that inevitably accompanies human commercial activity.I hope that the author doesn't read the reviews here. If he did, he'd go insane, because he'd find out that the book was both too dry and very readable, there was both too much detail and not enough, and that each of the six parts was duller than the other five. Enjoyable quotes:“There is no history of mankind, there are only many histories of all kinds of aspects of human life.”-- Karl Popper (should be at the beginning of every published microhistory.)About tea: “The progress of this famous plant has been something very like the progress of truth; suspected at first, though very palatable to those who had the courage to taste it; resisted as it encroached; abuse as its popularity spread; and establishing its triumph at least, in cheering the whole land from the palace to the cottage, only by slow and resistless efforts of time and its own virtues.”-- Isaac D'israeli (father of British politican Benjamin Disraeli)"

This should be History of Western civilization in 6 glasses. I Skimmed through Tea, and looked at Coke. It was at Tea that I completely lost interest. Coffee got a very brief chapter that started in Yemen but quickly went west. Then at the beginning of the Tea chapter, the author says China was an older, more advanced civilization than any other they came in contact with, talks briefly about the Japanese Tea Ceremony and then proceeds to talk about how the west set up the tea trade with china.

253,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37899-tom,3,"This books was a very interesting concept. Look at how six beverages are linked to various times and places in history. While the beer chapter lacked a bit for me, this may have been due to the fact that it was from the Neolithic Period, and lacked a lot of the excellent primary source material that Enlightenment coffee houses or rum drinking ship captains are accompanied by. Still it was a fascinating look at how civilization and drinks are linked. I wish it had better references and notes, but it was a nice easy read, and those two things can often be at odds.The most interesting factoid: British ships originally provided the crew with ale rations, but eventually it switched to rum, which was often drank with sugar/molasses and lime/lemon. Thus the term, Limeys, and no scurvy. The French originally received wine rations (which provided Vitamin C) but switched to brandy, which distills out the vitamins. So during the Age of Imperialism, the health of British crews increased, and the French became more susceptible to disease. The role this nutrition versus malnutrition played in naval battles and the struggle between Britain and France was probably significant."

The author uses six drinks....beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola....to illustrate how trade, colonialism, and financial stability were brought to various parts of the world through the development and influence of these drinks. It is a fun journey and has some very informative facts about how and why each of these drinks developed. But some of those early iterations, especially beer, would not be recognized in today's world and probably not palatable to modern taste. But water was so polluted even up into the 19th century, that some alternative had to be found . Fermentation or boiling were the answers and certain sicknesses declined rapidly, thus giving some of our six drinks a reputation of ""curing all illnesses"". I don't imagine the person suffering from a major hangover would agree!!"

Not a good thing to mimic.I also found multiple sections repeating themselves. It's bad enough that I've had to read 4 pages in order to understand they drank beer out of a huge bowl, but I don't need to be reminded of it in the next section and the next section to complete the total 20 pages talking about one bowl!!!Also, the typos were distracting! I almost cracked out a red pen and started marking it up!I've read fact heavy books that also put in some funny stories or jokes and I thought this book had ample opportunities to break it up a little and add some flare to the stories.

Though a lot of the information wasn't necessarily new to me, between the beer and wine in western culture and the globalisation classes I took, it was an excellent treatment of the subjects. The writing was accessible- it read sort of like a master's thesis written by someone who actually wanted someone besides his thesis committee to take interest in the subject. It felt a little repetitive at times, but all in all wasn't so bad stylistically. I'd recommend this book just sort of in general to people. It's a very readable glance into both the history of civilisation and the current model of globalisation. Though by no means not a complete treatment of these subjects, it would act as a good launching platform into new interests for any reader. Plus, despite its academic nature, it's a pretty short and easy but still information-laiden read."
257,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1882126-nancy,4,"A small but very interesting read. A History Of The World In 6 Glasses is a generalized overview of how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and coca cola have steered the course of western civilization. Influences were farther reaching than I would have imagined. These beverages determined social class, sparked a revolution, affected international trade and politics, perpetuated imperialism and had a hand in globalization among other things. In his epilogue Standage stresses the importance of clean water and poses the idea that sustainable water resources may be THE impetus for future conflicts. This is not intended as a deep analysis of history, nor are you going to get a comparison study of Guinness versus PBR, or the merits of French and Italian varietals, but it is entertaining nevertheless. (And to you 'whiners' - pun intended - who define your hipness in the fault you can find in everything you read - get over yourselves.) "

Standage doesn't offer much humor, which is something that lights up nonfiction for me, but that's literally the only drawback. Otherwise, it's a terrific, competent, erudite, informative and accessible volume that just might make one pause to think with appreciation of history before having a drink next time. Standage is also notably unbiased in his writing, all viewpoints and perspectives were represented with impressive evenness, thus easily maximizing its appeal to a variety of readers. I've read Cheever's history of drinking in America, but this encompassed the entire world, centuries of civilization, not to mention it had pictures.

Each drink has its own historical era and each drink in one way or another was such a popular drink that it was a force behind change. The drinks: Beer, Wine, Distilled Spirits, Coffee, Tea and Coca Cola. Many interesting stories from each glass - with each drink being given its own section in the book so there is no overlap.

267,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Apologies to all here: much of what follows are notes that I took on some interesting points, so please forgive the rambling, disorganized narrative.The ""Six Glasses"" are: beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola. This book is a history of the world through the lens of the six glasses, so it's selective in a geographical sense, but fairly comprehensive in a temporal sense. Standage's book is just the right length: long enough to include important details, but short enough to keep the reader's interest. It's perfect as ""pop history."" Standage's initial chapter on beer, however, is a disappointment! He only gets us to 1335 B.C.E. I'm interested in beer. It's my favorite drink (sharing first place with coffee). So I'm feeling slighted. There's a lot to know about the development of beer, but Standage doesn't even get us to the point where we started adding hops. (He only makes the statement that this did not happen until the Middle Ages). We get no sense of the role of beer in cultures other than those of ancient Sumeria and Egypt. The only tidbit worth remembering about beer is that Egyptian pharaohs liked to be buried with beer-brewing equipment. I'll have to write a will now, which specifies the same for me! (On second thought, I'll say that the image of Sumerians drinking beer from long, bent straws that dip into gigantic pots that tower over their heads was amusing.)The book starts to pick up some steam when it describes how the Ancient Greeks drank wine. Elaborate rituals, called ""symposion"" (think Plato's Symposium) were commonplace. Wine was served in a giant krater (a pot) and special implements and bowls were used to extract and drink it. Furthermore, wine was always diluted with water. It was considered barbaric to drink full-strength wine. Drunkenness was discouraged; moderation encouraged. Wine was meant to enhance subtle and insightful conversation, not meant to incite rowdy drunkenness. Vast quantities of wine were traded by ship.Romans continued the wine tradition, exporting it to the northern countries, and even using wine that had ""turned"" as a water-purifying agent for soldiers who were out on long campaigns. Apparently, this was what was actually on the vinegar sponge that was offered to Jesus while he hung on the cross. There's an interesting passage about Galen and Marcus Aurelius. Galen prescribed wine as health tonic. Apparently, the older and more expensive the vintage, the better! Even so, it was used to wash down some rather vile medicinal concoctions (think ear of bat, eye of toad, etc.)Eventually, the Moors of Spain discovered that wine could be distilled in order to increase the alcohol content. The word ""alcohol"" comes from the Arabic word for distilled antinomy, which was used as eye shadow. Odd to think that Muslims, who now renounce it, were the inventors of strong spirits!Standage also makes an interesting point about how much Arab learning (algebra, trigonometry, astronomy) was used by Western Europeans in their push to find an alternate route to the East. This was felt to be necessary because Arabs dominated the spice trade routes to the east, so Western Europeans thought perhaps they could find their own route to China through the west.What they found, instead of a new road to China, was a new place to grow sugar cane! That place was the Caribbean. (Except here's another weird twist: the Arabs had somehow obtained sugar cane from Polynesians? Gotta research this one!) In Barbados, the English eventually discovered the recipe for rum, which is made from molasses -- a waste product of sugar production. Rum -- mixed with lime juice, sugar, and water -- became ""grog,"" which helped the British navy avoid scurvy and defeat the Spanish at Trafalgar. Interesting point by Standage here, about how alcohol content was tested by heating rum with a few grains of gunpowder. If the gunpowder could just barely be brought to the ignition point, that meant the rum was about 50% alcohol, and thus suitable for sailors.Rum also became instrumental in the slave trade. Africans could sell slaves for rum. The slaves would be shipped to the Caribbean to grow sugar cane, and the cycle could be perpetuated. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!Interestingly, a tax favoring British molasses (which was used in the American Colonies to make cheap rum) was credited by John Adams as one of the main spurs of the American Revolution. Standage claims that rum was the most widely consumed drink in colonial America. Early American settlers complained that the unavailability of alcohol was one of the most unbearable hardships of the new world. So when John Winthrop came over, his ship was laden with 10,0000 gallons of beer! Rum, however, had the advantage of being less perishable than beer, and it could be cheaply made in the colonies wherever molasses was imported. So it could be readily shipped, and readily made in port cities.Although rum could be cheaply made in ports, it got more expensive to produce as one ventured inland, where molasses became scarce. Furthermore, Irish and Scottish immigrants sought to make whiskey without easy access to barley. So they used rye and corn. Apparently, excellent corn mash whiskey was made in Bourbon County, KY (hence the name ""Bourbon Whiskey""). The first rebellion against the U.S. Government was inspired by an excise tax on whiskey (the tax was imposed on production, and was not dependent upon sale). The government flexed its muscles by sending troops to western Pennsylvania, in order to quell the violence against tax collectors. Standage seems to suggest that this was the first real test of federal power in the U.S. The distillers backed down, and later the government abolished the tax.As Standage moves on to coffee, I was struck by several revelations. First, that London was the first big center of coffee houses! Although we associate the British with tea, coffee was all the rage well before the tea boom got going. Standage makes a comparison of coffee houses to today's Internet. At first, I was skeptical of this claim. Yet it turns out that each coffee house was devoted to a particular trade or art! And furthermore, people picked up their mail and got their news at coffee-houses. Sometimes runners would circulate news from one coffee house to the next. So the comparison to the Internet(today's central mechanism for information exchange) is apt. Standage asserts that English coffee houses were places where scientific, political, and philosophical ideas could be openly discussed. Apparently, some coffee-house arguments about gravity and its relation to elliptical orbits caused some head-butting between Christopher Wren, Thomas Hooke, and Edmund Halley. Newton finally settled the argument by publishing the Principia -- which Standage claims was, at least in part, inspired by the coffee house argument!French coffee houses were another matter. Apparently, they were rife with government spies. Woe betide he who openly challenged the establishment! He'd end up in the Bastille, or flee to England like Voltaire did. There's an interesting story about how a French sailor brought coffee to the Caribbean. The only coffee plant in Paris was in an inaccessible royal garden. So the sailor, de Clieu, persuaded a doctor to claim (falsely) that a cutting from the tree was necessary to prepare medicine for a patient. Thanks to de Clieu's smuggling act, coffee plantations were eventually established in Brazil, which became the world's largest exporter of coffee. It seems that the French won the trade contest with the Dutch, who had already established coffee plantations in the East Indies, including Java. And the poor Arabs, who invented coffee, never really got much economic benefit from it.Perhaps the most surprising revelation about coffee is the controversy it caused wherever it was introduced. Even in Arabia, it was compared to alcohol because of its mood-altering properties. In the west, it was considered by the old guard to be culturally subversive -- which I suppose it was, but in a good way. The coffee house cultures were places where people could test new ideas in an informal setting. Much intellectual progress was accomplished there. In the chapter on tea I discovered a new drink: koumiss (fermented mare's milk!) At the end of Sung Dynasty, the Mongols took control of China. Koumiss was favored over tea by the Mongols, who lived on their horses. At the height of their power, Kublai Khan's brother erected a fountain that dispensed rice beer from China, grape wine from Persia, mead from Eurasia, and koumiss! What a marvelous image! The Mongolian empire was short-lived, so perhaps that's why I never heard of koumiss. Anyway, China got the ball rolling when it comes to tea, and it probably started gaining in popularity in the First Century, C.E. Chinese control of the tea trade actually made it more expensive than coffee for quite some time, which helps to explain why coffee was initially more popular than tea in Europe. Europeans had their own coffee plantations in the West and East Indies long before they had their own tea plantations (eventually in British-controlled India).European-controlled tea plantations didn't come until the British East India Company discovered that tea could be grown in India, some time in the 1860's. If I remember correctly, the BEIC at some point had more money than Great Britain itself, and paid ten percent of Britain's tax revenue. And it operated almost like a government unto itself in India. As the BEIC was able to bring the cost of tea down not only by growing it, but by manufacturing and shipping it as well, tea became the universal drink of Britain (ca. 1860 forward). It had formerly been the exclusive drink of the elite and the wealthy. There's an interesting interlude, beginning in 1839 or so, called ""The Opium Wars."" The British, at this time still dependent on trading for tea in China, had nothing to offer the Chinese except opium from India. This was problematic, however, because the Chinese had outlawed opium! So the BEIC used intermediaries to sell the opium for silver, which was the only thing the Chinese would accept in exchange for tea. When the Chinese became wise to this plot, they destroyed massive quantities of illegal opium. The British then declared a war (which they won with superior military and naval technology) and demanded reparations for the lost contraband! Furthermore, this is when the British invaded Hong Kong and made it part of their own political sphere. One extremely interesting point here is that tea was originally only green tea. Green tea is made from the same leaves as black tea, except that less processing is involved. Black tea is made by scoring and oxidizing the leaves before drying them. Standage points out that black tea was considered inferior by the Chinese. But for the British, it was better because it was less perishable and easier to ship long distance. Furthermore, much tea was adulterated with ""filler,"" like sawdust, grass, bugs, etc. Filler used in green tea tended to be toxic, whereas the fillers used to bulk up black tea were generally safer. So black tea thus became the British standard. I was quite amused by Standage's chapter on the final drink: Coca-Cola. I never cared for Coca-Cola. Even as a child, I hated how it left a tacky film on my teeth! Nevertheless, its origins are quite interesting. It turns out that Coca-Cola was originally formulated by John Pemberton, in Atlanta. He was a manufacturer of ""patent medicine,"" which is a term for unregulated folk-style remedies, also known as ""nostrums."" See Patent Medicine HistoryMost patent medicines were herbal or vegetable oil extracts in a suspension of alcohol. In the early 20th century, the U.S. Government finally created the FDA, in order to protect consumers from adulterated foods, poor sanitation practices in abattoirs, and from false claims about the medicinal properties of patent medicines. Because Coca-Cola contained caffeine and even (originally) a very mild dose of alkaloid stimulants (from coca leaves), the U.S. Government eventually brought suit against Coca-Cola. Apparently, the government's concern was that Coca-Cola was the first stimulant marketed to children. But the suit was brought on the ground that the name of the drink was misleading. According to Standage, Coca-Cola prevailed in the trial court (which held that the drink was flavored with kola nut, and was hence ""pure""). On appeal, however, Coca-Cola had a minor loss which resulted in the company's agreement to reduce the caffeine content. Amazingly, Coca-Cola went on to become a global drink, spread in part by military endorsement. Coca-Cola actually partnered with the U.S. military during WWII, to the extent that Coca-Cola plants were constructed on military bases. Eventually, the world began to associate Coca-Cola with the United States. Standage claims that ""Coca-Cola"" is one of the world's most readily understood words, after ""O.K."" There's much interesting material in Standage's penultimate chapter about the hostility toward Coca-Cola by the Soviet Bloc and the Arab countries. I appreciated how Standage concluded his book with water, and the bottled water craze. He points out that, in the U.S., a bottle of water costs more by volume than gasoline, but people still buy it, even though they can get a superior product straight from their home taps, at a small fraction of the cost. I also appreciated Standage's acknowledgment of the importance of potable water to world political stability and human health in general. After all, the six drinks were all initially employed (at least in part) as water-purifiers of one sort or another.Overall, this was a very entertaining and well-written book! "

And according to Tom Standage, they are drinks that have changed the world.And he's going to tell you why he believes that. And he gives some pretty convincing arguments. From grain used to make beer which due to water being boiled and/or fermented as well as the increased amount of vitamin B, made it a more healthy drink. Also collecting wild grains eventually moved to farming with it's guaranteed grain access which needed irrigation resulting in excess grain to store for shortages as well as religious rites (good harvest was the gift from the gods). In order to verify community contributions, led to accounting, writing, bureaucracy. Excess grain could also be used as payment for workers involved in community construction of buildings and monuments.And that's just beer.As he examines each of his drinks, time and civilization moves toward the present day. Wine - again a healthier alternative to possibly contaminated water but also causes for excess among the Roman elite. Distilled alcohol like brandy, whiskey, rum and rye which - unfortunately were also used as trading goods in the early slave trade. Coffee and coffeehouses which became places for intellectual conversations as well as revolutionary ideas. Exploration of Europe into the Far East for spices and tea (introduced by Arabian traders as well as a bridal gift to Charles II of England) leading to the massive trading conglomerates of the British East India, Dutch East and Dutch West Trading Companies, which used opium to pay for tea instead of the silver previously required. And when the southern states of the U.S. couldn't grow tea, they switched to tobacco. Soda or dry water and the history of Coca-Cola and the cola wars. And back to the original - water.So it's really about seven drinks, not six. It's surprising how extensively interwoven into human history across the globe these six drinks are. And how much they impacted humanity - positively as well as negatively. So, next time when you share a drink, recall that it's a universal sign of hospitality and friendship. That at one time, your drink and that of your companions once shared the same vessel and the clink of glasses signifies a reuniting of that shared bottle or container. Slainte!2020-109"

Standage explains their effect on society: distilled spirits were durable (because of their high alcohol content) and compact and were, therefore, easier to transport than previous forms of alcohol (wine and beer). Rum – brought to Boston as raw molasses and subsequently distilled – formed a large part of early New England’s economy.Each beverage has a theme, whether it be wine symbolizing civilization and intellectual life, beer representing daily food and our social nature, or coffee exemplifying networking and innovation: “London’s coffeehouses were the crucibles of the scientific and financial revolutions that shaped the modern world.” Coca-Cola, the sixth beverage discussed, represents the rise of America to become the world’s superpower, and the mass marketing and globalization that has ensued.Full of fascinating tidbits (I had no idea that Scotch whisky is distilled beer!), this thought-provoking book was an intriguing way to learn about the history of the world through commodities. So much so that I’ve put his An Edible History of Humanity on my to-read list.If you like accessible books about the history of the world, you might also enjoy: Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond"

And it was right up my alley. His summary of world history in these six main drinks is actually quite accurate, and he has insights on each drink and their histories. Some chapters were slightly better than others, but each chapter really was intriguing.In short, I had no idea that these main six world drinks (seven if you include water, which is talked about briefly but well in the epilogue) really affected history so much. I now know more about beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola (and even water!), and I especially appreciate them and their histories more. It all truly is fascinating. So I definitely would recommend the book. It isn't life changing or anything, but it is an enjoyable and insightful read. For each drink, he has two well organized chapters. And then the epilogue cleverly talks about how the drink of the future looks to actually be water—it all comes full circle. So overall, I loved it. Will read it again in the future (after I forget much of the information).I'd put this right up there with The Dorito Effect in the category of non-Christian non-fiction books that I thoroughly enjoyed."

And that's what Mr. Standage has done here. Instead of looking at world history through political events or from a certain country's view we see how the creation and evolution of six drinks had an impact on world history. We start with beer in the age of ancient Egyptians, move to wine in the age of Classic Greece, then on to the development of distilled spirits in western Europe during the age of exploration and colonization. After that we move to non-alcoholic drinks, starting with coffee's development in the Arabian countries and the impact it had once it reached England and France, on to Tea and how the English appropriated it from the Chinese and used the trade to control China and India, and finally on to Coke, and how it became the ubiquitous ""All-American"" brand that it is today.In book club we all found the book a little uneven, but what is interesting is that we were all speaking of different chapters. For me, I was most intrigued by the audacity of the British Empire's actions in China during the tea chapter. It is a pretty approachable history, over all. Though I wouldn't suggest the audio book; the reader was truly terrible. 3.5 Stars"

It’s not that it’s a bad book or that it’s not interesting, I just found that it could have been much briefer and at times, especially the sections on tea and coffee. The concept here of following how beverages changed and influenced society is a valid one, it was especially interesting to hear about how coffee houses took over parts of Europe as central locations for the discussion of scientific and political ideas. I also found the early history of Coca-Cola and Pepsi to be fascinating as there was information within this work that I was not aware of. Overall, this is a well written history told in an interesting way, the author just rambles on a bit in a few spots and in others is far too brief. "

It's not something you add to a book review but I wanted to keep the memory of the places with this book so here they are- AB coffee in Comilla, Saffron in sylhet, probably Takeout in Dhaka, Cocacola plant of Abdul monem, Fulkoli of Pathantulla....

It has the point of view (if you wish, you may call them “biases”) of that magazine (the author's employer), meaning, it is generally cheerful, it admires and celebrates commerce as heroic, and it doesn't spend time getting excessively hot and bothered about the exploitation and misery that inevitably accompanies human commercial activity.I hope that the author doesn't read the reviews here. If he did, he'd go insane, because he'd find out that the book was both too dry and very readable, there was both too much detail and not enough, and that each of the six parts was duller than the other five. Enjoyable quotes:“There is no history of mankind, there are only many histories of all kinds of aspects of human life.”-- Karl Popper (should be at the beginning of every published microhistory.)About tea: “The progress of this famous plant has been something very like the progress of truth; suspected at first, though very palatable to those who had the courage to taste it; resisted as it encroached; abuse as its popularity spread; and establishing its triumph at least, in cheering the whole land from the palace to the cottage, only by slow and resistless efforts of time and its own virtues.”-- Isaac D'israeli (father of British politican Benjamin Disraeli)"

This should be History of Western civilization in 6 glasses. I Skimmed through Tea, and looked at Coke. It was at Tea that I completely lost interest. Coffee got a very brief chapter that started in Yemen but quickly went west. Then at the beginning of the Tea chapter, the author says China was an older, more advanced civilization than any other they came in contact with, talks briefly about the Japanese Tea Ceremony and then proceeds to talk about how the west set up the tea trade with china.

283,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37899-tom,3,"This books was a very interesting concept. Look at how six beverages are linked to various times and places in history. While the beer chapter lacked a bit for me, this may have been due to the fact that it was from the Neolithic Period, and lacked a lot of the excellent primary source material that Enlightenment coffee houses or rum drinking ship captains are accompanied by. Still it was a fascinating look at how civilization and drinks are linked. I wish it had better references and notes, but it was a nice easy read, and those two things can often be at odds.The most interesting factoid: British ships originally provided the crew with ale rations, but eventually it switched to rum, which was often drank with sugar/molasses and lime/lemon. Thus the term, Limeys, and no scurvy. The French originally received wine rations (which provided Vitamin C) but switched to brandy, which distills out the vitamins. So during the Age of Imperialism, the health of British crews increased, and the French became more susceptible to disease. The role this nutrition versus malnutrition played in naval battles and the struggle between Britain and France was probably significant."

The author uses six drinks....beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola....to illustrate how trade, colonialism, and financial stability were brought to various parts of the world through the development and influence of these drinks. It is a fun journey and has some very informative facts about how and why each of these drinks developed. But some of those early iterations, especially beer, would not be recognized in today's world and probably not palatable to modern taste. But water was so polluted even up into the 19th century, that some alternative had to be found . Fermentation or boiling were the answers and certain sicknesses declined rapidly, thus giving some of our six drinks a reputation of ""curing all illnesses"". I don't imagine the person suffering from a major hangover would agree!!"

Not a good thing to mimic.I also found multiple sections repeating themselves. It's bad enough that I've had to read 4 pages in order to understand they drank beer out of a huge bowl, but I don't need to be reminded of it in the next section and the next section to complete the total 20 pages talking about one bowl!!!Also, the typos were distracting! I almost cracked out a red pen and started marking it up!I've read fact heavy books that also put in some funny stories or jokes and I thought this book had ample opportunities to break it up a little and add some flare to the stories.

Though a lot of the information wasn't necessarily new to me, between the beer and wine in western culture and the globalisation classes I took, it was an excellent treatment of the subjects. The writing was accessible- it read sort of like a master's thesis written by someone who actually wanted someone besides his thesis committee to take interest in the subject. It felt a little repetitive at times, but all in all wasn't so bad stylistically. I'd recommend this book just sort of in general to people. It's a very readable glance into both the history of civilisation and the current model of globalisation. Though by no means not a complete treatment of these subjects, it would act as a good launching platform into new interests for any reader.

A History Of The World In 6 Glasses is a generalized overview of how beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and coca cola have steered the course of western civilization. Influences were farther reaching than I would have imagined. These beverages determined social class, sparked a revolution, affected international trade and politics, perpetuated imperialism and had a hand in globalization among other things. In his epilogue Standage stresses the importance of clean water and poses the idea that sustainable water resources may be THE impetus for future conflicts. This is not intended as a deep analysis of history, nor are you going to get a comparison study of Guinness versus PBR, or the merits of French and Italian varietals, but it is entertaining nevertheless. (And to you 'whiners' - pun intended - who define your hipness in the fault you can find in everything you read - get over yourselves.) "

Standage doesn't offer much humor, which is something that lights up nonfiction for me, but that's literally the only drawback. Otherwise, it's a terrific, competent, erudite, informative and accessible volume that just might make one pause to think with appreciation of history before having a drink next time. Standage is also notably unbiased in his writing, all viewpoints and perspectives were represented with impressive evenness, thus easily maximizing its appeal to a variety of readers. I've read Cheever's history of drinking in America, but this encompassed the entire world, centuries of civilization, not to mention it had pictures.

Each drink has its own historical era and each drink in one way or another was such a popular drink that it was a force behind change. The drinks: Beer, Wine, Distilled Spirits, Coffee, Tea and Coca Cola. Many interesting stories from each glass - with each drink being given its own section in the book so there is no overlap.

297,0802715524,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Apologies to all here: much of what follows are notes that I took on some interesting points, so please forgive the rambling, disorganized narrative.The ""Six Glasses"" are: beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and Coca-Cola. This book is a history of the world through the lens of the six glasses, so it's selective in a geographical sense, but fairly comprehensive in a temporal sense. Standage's book is just the right length: long enough to include important details, but short enough to keep the reader's interest. It's perfect as ""pop history."" Standage's initial chapter on beer, however, is a disappointment! He only gets us to 1335 B.C.E. I'm interested in beer. It's my favorite drink (sharing first place with coffee). So I'm feeling slighted. There's a lot to know about the development of beer, but Standage doesn't even get us to the point where we started adding hops. (He only makes the statement that this did not happen until the Middle Ages). We get no sense of the role of beer in cultures other than those of ancient Sumeria and Egypt. The only tidbit worth remembering about beer is that Egyptian pharaohs liked to be buried with beer-brewing equipment. I'll have to write a will now, which specifies the same for me! (On second thought, I'll say that the image of Sumerians drinking beer from long, bent straws that dip into gigantic pots that tower over their heads was amusing.)The book starts to pick up some steam when it describes how the Ancient Greeks drank wine. Elaborate rituals, called ""symposion"" (think Plato's Symposium) were commonplace. Wine was served in a giant krater (a pot) and special implements and bowls were used to extract and drink it. Furthermore, wine was always diluted with water. It was considered barbaric to drink full-strength wine. Drunkenness was discouraged; moderation encouraged. Wine was meant to enhance subtle and insightful conversation, not meant to incite rowdy drunkenness. Vast quantities of wine were traded by ship.Romans continued the wine tradition, exporting it to the northern countries, and even using wine that had ""turned"" as a water-purifying agent for soldiers who were out on long campaigns. Apparently, this was what was actually on the vinegar sponge that was offered to Jesus while he hung on the cross. There's an interesting passage about Galen and Marcus Aurelius. Galen prescribed wine as health tonic. Apparently, the older and more expensive the vintage, the better! Even so, it was used to wash down some rather vile medicinal concoctions (think ear of bat, eye of toad, etc.)Eventually, the Moors of Spain discovered that wine could be distilled in order to increase the alcohol content. The word ""alcohol"" comes from the Arabic word for distilled antinomy, which was used as eye shadow. Odd to think that Muslims, who now renounce it, were the inventors of strong spirits!Standage also makes an interesting point about how much Arab learning (algebra, trigonometry, astronomy) was used by Western Europeans in their push to find an alternate route to the East. This was felt to be necessary because Arabs dominated the spice trade routes to the east, so Western Europeans thought perhaps they could find their own route to China through the west.What they found, instead of a new road to China, was a new place to grow sugar cane! That place was the Caribbean. (Except here's another weird twist: the Arabs had somehow obtained sugar cane from Polynesians? Gotta research this one!) In Barbados, the English eventually discovered the recipe for rum, which is made from molasses -- a waste product of sugar production. Rum -- mixed with lime juice, sugar, and water -- became ""grog,"" which helped the British navy avoid scurvy and defeat the Spanish at Trafalgar. Interesting point by Standage here, about how alcohol content was tested by heating rum with a few grains of gunpowder. If the gunpowder could just barely be brought to the ignition point, that meant the rum was about 50% alcohol, and thus suitable for sailors.Rum also became instrumental in the slave trade. Africans could sell slaves for rum. The slaves would be shipped to the Caribbean to grow sugar cane, and the cycle could be perpetuated. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!Interestingly, a tax favoring British molasses (which was used in the American Colonies to make cheap rum) was credited by John Adams as one of the main spurs of the American Revolution. Standage claims that rum was the most widely consumed drink in colonial America. Early American settlers complained that the unavailability of alcohol was one of the most unbearable hardships of the new world. So when John Winthrop came over, his ship was laden with 10,0000 gallons of beer! Rum, however, had the advantage of being less perishable than beer, and it could be cheaply made in the colonies wherever molasses was imported. So it could be readily shipped, and readily made in port cities.Although rum could be cheaply made in ports, it got more expensive to produce as one ventured inland, where molasses became scarce. Furthermore, Irish and Scottish immigrants sought to make whiskey without easy access to barley. So they used rye and corn. Apparently, excellent corn mash whiskey was made in Bourbon County, KY (hence the name ""Bourbon Whiskey""). The first rebellion against the U.S. Government was inspired by an excise tax on whiskey (the tax was imposed on production, and was not dependent upon sale). The government flexed its muscles by sending troops to western Pennsylvania, in order to quell the violence against tax collectors. Standage seems to suggest that this was the first real test of federal power in the U.S. The distillers backed down, and later the government abolished the tax.As Standage moves on to coffee, I was struck by several revelations. First, that London was the first big center of coffee houses! Although we associate the British with tea, coffee was all the rage well before the tea boom got going. Standage makes a comparison of coffee houses to today's Internet. At first, I was skeptical of this claim. Yet it turns out that each coffee house was devoted to a particular trade or art! And furthermore, people picked up their mail and got their news at coffee-houses. Sometimes runners would circulate news from one coffee house to the next. So the comparison to the Internet(today's central mechanism for information exchange) is apt. Standage asserts that English coffee houses were places where scientific, political, and philosophical ideas could be openly discussed. Apparently, some coffee-house arguments about gravity and its relation to elliptical orbits caused some head-butting between Christopher Wren, Thomas Hooke, and Edmund Halley. Newton finally settled the argument by publishing the Principia -- which Standage claims was, at least in part, inspired by the coffee house argument!French coffee houses were another matter. Apparently, they were rife with government spies. Woe betide he who openly challenged the establishment! He'd end up in the Bastille, or flee to England like Voltaire did. There's an interesting story about how a French sailor brought coffee to the Caribbean. The only coffee plant in Paris was in an inaccessible royal garden. So the sailor, de Clieu, persuaded a doctor to claim (falsely) that a cutting from the tree was necessary to prepare medicine for a patient. Thanks to de Clieu's smuggling act, coffee plantations were eventually established in Brazil, which became the world's largest exporter of coffee. It seems that the French won the trade contest with the Dutch, who had already established coffee plantations in the East Indies, including Java. And the poor Arabs, who invented coffee, never really got much economic benefit from it.Perhaps the most surprising revelation about coffee is the controversy it caused wherever it was introduced. Even in Arabia, it was compared to alcohol because of its mood-altering properties. In the west, it was considered by the old guard to be culturally subversive -- which I suppose it was, but in a good way. The coffee house cultures were places where people could test new ideas in an informal setting. Much intellectual progress was accomplished there. In the chapter on tea I discovered a new drink: koumiss (fermented mare's milk!) At the end of Sung Dynasty, the Mongols took control of China. Koumiss was favored over tea by the Mongols, who lived on their horses. At the height of their power, Kublai Khan's brother erected a fountain that dispensed rice beer from China, grape wine from Persia, mead from Eurasia, and koumiss! What a marvelous image! The Mongolian empire was short-lived, so perhaps that's why I never heard of koumiss. Anyway, China got the ball rolling when it comes to tea, and it probably started gaining in popularity in the First Century, C.E. Chinese control of the tea trade actually made it more expensive than coffee for quite some time, which helps to explain why coffee was initially more popular than tea in Europe. Europeans had their own coffee plantations in the West and East Indies long before they had their own tea plantations (eventually in British-controlled India).European-controlled tea plantations didn't come until the British East India Company discovered that tea could be grown in India, some time in the 1860's. If I remember correctly, the BEIC at some point had more money than Great Britain itself, and paid ten percent of Britain's tax revenue. And it operated almost like a government unto itself in India. As the BEIC was able to bring the cost of tea down not only by growing it, but by manufacturing and shipping it as well, tea became the universal drink of Britain (ca. 1860 forward). It had formerly been the exclusive drink of the elite and the wealthy. There's an interesting interlude, beginning in 1839 or so, called ""The Opium Wars."" The British, at this time still dependent on trading for tea in China, had nothing to offer the Chinese except opium from India. This was problematic, however, because the Chinese had outlawed opium! So the BEIC used intermediaries to sell the opium for silver, which was the only thing the Chinese would accept in exchange for tea. When the Chinese became wise to this plot, they destroyed massive quantities of illegal opium. The British then declared a war (which they won with superior military and naval technology) and demanded reparations for the lost contraband! Furthermore, this is when the British invaded Hong Kong and made it part of their own political sphere. One extremely interesting point here is that tea was originally only green tea. Green tea is made from the same leaves as black tea, except that less processing is involved. Black tea is made by scoring and oxidizing the leaves before drying them. Standage points out that black tea was considered inferior by the Chinese. But for the British, it was better because it was less perishable and easier to ship long distance. Furthermore, much tea was adulterated with ""filler,"" like sawdust, grass, bugs, etc. Filler used in green tea tended to be toxic, whereas the fillers used to bulk up black tea were generally safer. So black tea thus became the British standard. I was quite amused by Standage's chapter on the final drink: Coca-Cola. I never cared for Coca-Cola. Even as a child, I hated how it left a tacky film on my teeth! Nevertheless, its origins are quite interesting. It turns out that Coca-Cola was originally formulated by John Pemberton, in Atlanta. He was a manufacturer of ""patent medicine,"" which is a term for unregulated folk-style remedies, also known as ""nostrums."" See Patent Medicine HistoryMost patent medicines were herbal or vegetable oil extracts in a suspension of alcohol. In the early 20th century, the U.S. Government finally created the FDA, in order to protect consumers from adulterated foods, poor sanitation practices in abattoirs, and from false claims about the medicinal properties of patent medicines. Because Coca-Cola contained caffeine and even (originally) a very mild dose of alkaloid stimulants (from coca leaves), the U.S. Government eventually brought suit against Coca-Cola. Apparently, the government's concern was that Coca-Cola was the first stimulant marketed to children. But the suit was brought on the ground that the name of the drink was misleading. According to Standage, Coca-Cola prevailed in the trial court (which held that the drink was flavored with kola nut, and was hence ""pure""). On appeal, however, Coca-Cola had a minor loss which resulted in the company's agreement to reduce the caffeine content. Amazingly, Coca-Cola went on to become a global drink, spread in part by military endorsement. Coca-Cola actually partnered with the U.S. military during WWII, to the extent that Coca-Cola plants were constructed on military bases. Eventually, the world began to associate Coca-Cola with the United States. Standage claims that ""Coca-Cola"" is one of the world's most readily understood words, after ""O.K."" There's much interesting material in Standage's penultimate chapter about the hostility toward Coca-Cola by the Soviet Bloc and the Arab countries. I appreciated how Standage concluded his book with water, and the bottled water craze. He points out that, in the U.S., a bottle of water costs more by volume than gasoline, but people still buy it, even though they can get a superior product straight from their home taps, at a small fraction of the cost. I also appreciated Standage's acknowledgment of the importance of potable water to world political stability and human health in general. After all, the six drinks were all initially employed (at least in part) as water-purifiers of one sort or another.Overall, this was a very entertaining and well-written book! "

And according to Tom Standage, they are drinks that have changed the world.And he's going to tell you why he believes that. And he gives some pretty convincing arguments. From grain used to make beer which due to water being boiled and/or fermented as well as the increased amount of vitamin B, made it a more healthy drink. Also collecting wild grains eventually moved to farming with it's guaranteed grain access which needed irrigation resulting in excess grain to store for shortages as well as religious rites (good harvest was the gift from the gods). In order to verify community contributions, led to accounting, writing, bureaucracy. Excess grain could also be used as payment for workers involved in community construction of buildings and monuments.And that's just beer.As he examines each of his drinks, time and civilization moves toward the present day. Wine - again a healthier alternative to possibly contaminated water but also causes for excess among the Roman elite. Distilled alcohol like brandy, whiskey, rum and rye which - unfortunately were also used as trading goods in the early slave trade. Coffee and coffeehouses which became places for intellectual conversations as well as revolutionary ideas. Exploration of Europe into the Far East for spices and tea (introduced by Arabian traders as well as a bridal gift to Charles II of England) leading to the massive trading conglomerates of the British East India, Dutch East and Dutch West Trading Companies, which used opium to pay for tea instead of the silver previously required. And when the southern states of the U.S. couldn't grow tea, they switched to tobacco. Soda or dry water and the history of Coca-Cola and the cola wars. And back to the original - water.So it's really about seven drinks, not six. It's surprising how extensively interwoven into human history across the globe these six drinks are. And how much they impacted humanity - positively as well as negatively. So, next time when you share a drink, recall that it's a universal sign of hospitality and friendship. That at one time, your drink and that of your companions once shared the same vessel and the clink of glasses signifies a reuniting of that shared bottle or container. Slainte!2020-109"

Standage explains their effect on society: distilled spirits were durable (because of their high alcohol content) and compact and were, therefore, easier to transport than previous forms of alcohol (wine and beer). Rum – brought to Boston as raw molasses and subsequently distilled – formed a large part of early New England’s economy.Each beverage has a theme, whether it be wine symbolizing civilization and intellectual life, beer representing daily food and our social nature, or coffee exemplifying networking and innovation: “London’s coffeehouses were the crucibles of the scientific and financial revolutions that shaped the modern world.” Coca-Cola, the sixth beverage discussed, represents the rise of America to become the world’s superpower, and the mass marketing and globalization that has ensued.Full of fascinating tidbits (I had no idea that Scotch whisky is distilled beer!), this thought-provoking book was an intriguing way to learn about the history of the world through commodities. So much so that I’ve put his An Edible History of Humanity on my to-read list.If you like accessible books about the history of the world, you might also enjoy: Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond"
