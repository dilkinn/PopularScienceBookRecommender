0,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/235151-richard,3,"The Meaning of it All is based on lectures given by Richard Feynman to lay audiences at the University of Washington, Seattle, over three nights in April 1963, on science and its relationship to social problems and religion. (All of Feynman's published books are similarly based on recordings of lectures or conversations.) It pains me to say anything negative about a book by Feynman but this is one that probably should never have been published, except as part of a ""Complete Works"" set. This is partly due to a lack of editorial cleanup, and partly because Feynman appears to have been in rare bad form for these talks. (Well, bad compared to the rest of his stuff; if this were the only book of his philosophy in existence then it would be imperfect but still kinda awesome.)There's not much here that Feynman hasn't expressed elsewhere with greater eloquence. In these lectures he makes a number of false starts and abrupt stops, and some minor errors most of which should have been fixed by an editor. At one point for instance, he uses ""infinitesimal"" when he obviously means to say ""infinite."" The only reason for leaving such mistakes intact is, I think, that the book was published posthumously and the publishers were afraid to touch Feynman's words without his approval. I'm pretty sure that Feynman would have found that elevation of reverence over substance to be absurd. There's only one clear instance in the book in which an editor has touched the material; a parenthetical notation that Feynman had completed a sentence with a hand gesture instead of words.At another point, Feynman apologizes for his limited knowledge of world religions and expresses the hope that ""Hindus and Arabs"" wouldn't feel excluded by his references to the religion with which he was most familiar, Christianity (Feynman had been born to a Jewish family but was an atheist). My guess is that he was either winking at the audience when he said that (laughing at his own provincialism), or that he simply misspoke. In either case, though this error is trivial and irrelevant, its inclusion will, I suspect, give some readers an excuse to dismiss his arguments as products of ignorance.My recommendation to all but the most die-hard completists is to skip The Meaning of it all and instead pick up  Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman,  QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter and  The Character of Physical Law. Surely You're Joking... is a collection of anecdotes reflecting Feynman's eclectic range of interests (nude portraiture, safecracking, bongo playing, hieroglyphic translating etc) and his singular outlook on life. QED and The Character of Physical Law are by far the deepest and yet the most accessible math-free science books that I've ever come across."
1,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2492588-katie,5,"What a wonderful, quick, fascinating read. I'd say this is my new manifesto if the idea of having a manifesto didn't go against nearly everything inside. This is the first thing I've read by Richard Feynman and I'm very excited to read more. He's clearly one of those people who is talented at everything, and could have been a celebrated poet or an economist if he didn't become a physicist instead.I'm a little surprised to see some many reviews here that suggest that this collection of lectures is scattershot or unfocused. Feynman jumps around from example to example, but the whole thing works really well as a celebration of uncertainty and openness. I liked this, because I think uncertainty is a hugely undervalued trait (at least in American society, I can't speak for elsewhere). It's often see as a sign of weakness or cowardice, which is silly: it's often difficult and frightening to remain undecided about something, and requires a good deal of personal strength and questioning. But Feynman notes that this indecision is hugely valuable, in science and beyond: it's the only way to discover new questions and new possibilities and it keeps the world open to change and growth. These lectures are permeated with a kind of cautious idealism that I found to be really attractive. You could read through it in an afternoon, and I highly recommend it.PS: The title of this book is terrible and I'm 95% sure Richard Feynman didn't choose it. "

3,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"There are 3 lectures by Feynman here that he presented in Seattle, WA in the early 60s, about 1963, I think. We were still lagging behind the USSR in the Space Race & there are other references that might not mean much to the younger folks, but not many. I think Richard Dawkins is a worthy scientific successor to Feynman's ideas & I see the roots of many of them here. (Personally, Feynman was far more of a hoot than Dawkins.) IOW, he's the finest kind of scientist.The lectures are about the Uncertainty of Science. The first is its nature, doubt, & uncertainty. He makes a great comparison to finer sifting in our discoveries as we know more, look harder, & get better tools to look deeper.The second is its impact on other fields, specifically politics & religion. His main points here are that we shouldn't be looking for politicians with the answers, but those with the best plan to obtain the answers. Obviously they can't be experts on everything & yet they promise just that, so now no one believes campaign promises. Religion should be subject to verifiable scrutiny just like everything else. If a supposed saint's bones really do help treat an illness, the process to determine that should be held up to open experimental confirmation just like any other medicine, not closed sessions of the church & anecdotal evidence. Of course, more than likely they couldn't, but there is a possibility. The third is about a variety of subjects; what society looks like to him. This was by far the best. He had some great ideas & observations, if few solutions & conclusions. I really like his idea that we should change our arguments into discussions about goals. He says he really likes the goals of the Pope, but doesn't like how he arrived at them.This is short, just a few hours to listen to & well worth every minute. Highly recommended. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is there isn't much that's new.3 how society looks to him."
4,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,2,"I respect Mr Feynman's intelligence and skill as a lecturer. His reputation makes me feel bad about giving this book only two stars. But this book isn't his best work. The three lectures in this book were given in 1963. It's interesting to speculate how his speech would be different if given today. In 1963 the lectures may have seemed more cutting edge. I was particularly interested in what he had to say about the relationship between religion and science. Well, he did a fine job describing the conflict between religion and science. Then he asked the question, ""How can religion and science coexist without being a threat to each other?"" His answer was, ""I don't know."" I suppose that shows he's smart enough to not wade into theology. But I was disappointed. One interesting thing he said is that there are some scientists who believe in God, but there aren't very many who have an image of God that matches that of their parents. Of course that's true of many non-scientists too."
5,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12823484-anupam-ranku,4,"Reading Richard Feynman's book is always entertaining. This book consists of a transcript of three lectures. I think listening to the lectures would have been more fun. Some notable lines:- Keep trying new solutions is the way to do everything.- For billions of years, this ball was spinning with its sunsets and its waves and the sea and the noises, and there was nothing alive to appreciate it. - This piece of dirt waits four and a half billion years and evolves and changes, and now a strange creature stands here with instruments and talks to the strange creatures in the audience. What a wonderful world! - For a long time, no one even noticed the phenomenon of electricity, except once in a while when they rubbed a piece of amber and it attracted a piece of paper. And yet today we find, by playing with these things, that we have a tremendous amount of machinery inside. Yet science is still not thoroughly appreciated. - The old laws may be wrong. How can an observation be incorrect? If it has been carefully checked, how can it be wrong? Why are physicists always having to change the laws? The answer is, first, that the laws are not the observation and, second, that experiments are always inaccurate. The laws are guessed laws, extrapolations, not something that the observations insist upon. They are just good guesses that have gone through the sieve so far. Laws are extrapolations into the unknown. -Scientists are used to dealing with doubt and uncertainty. All scientific knowledge is uncertain. This experiments with doubt and uncertainty are important. I believe that it is of very great value and one that extends beyond the sciences. I feel a responsibility to proclaim the value of this freedom and to teach that doubt is not to be feared, but that it is to be welcomed as the possibility of a new potential for human beings. -The science student begins to doubt, and then he begins to disbelieve perhaps, in his father's God. By God, I mean the kind of personal God, to which one prays, who has something to do with creation.- The attitude of mind of the populace, that they have to have an answer (even though it is wrong or made up) and that a man who gives an answer is better than a man who gives no (specific) answer (even though he has a way of getting at the answer)."

7,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,5,A really nice and short read on the meaning of doing science and it’s inherent uncertainty. A very useful read for aspiring scientists as well as the average layman.
8,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,4,"I know this may be a shock, but I've never read Feynman until now. Of course, I pick a transcription of a three night series of lectures for my first, rather than his...more thought out writings. But, one gets a sense of his humor. The three lectures, in 1963 Seattle, were titled, ""The Uncertainty of Science"", ""The Uncertainty of Values"", and ""This Unscientific Age"". Feynman's first two lectures had structure, and yet this still reads like the spoken lecture it was - sidetracks here and there. Okay, he was all over the place, and he admits his third lecture is a collection of thoughts, with less structure, certainly, and it reads like it.Takeaways...In The Uncertainty of Science, Feynman talks about science being ""a method of finding things out"". Observation is king in this aspect: if ""there is an exception to any rule, and if it can be rpoved by observation, that rule is wrong."" Simple, yet not simple. And But if a thing is not scientific, if it cannot be subjected to the test of observation, this does not mean that it is dead, wrong, or stupid. ... Scientists take all those things that can be analyzed by observation, and thus the things called science are found out. But there are some things left out, for which the method does not work. This does not mean those things are unimportant.What follows is one of the many times he was all over the place that I mentioned at the start.Feynman says that the more specific a scientific ""rule is, the more interesting it is. The more definite the statement, the more interesting it is to test."" I like that but he jumps right into Words can be meaningless. If they are used in such a way that no sharp conclusions can be drawn, as in my example of “oomph,” then the proposition they state is almost meaningless, because you can explain almost anything by the assertion that things have a tendency to motility. A great deal has been made of this by philosophers, who say that words must be defined extremely precisely. Actually, I disagree somewhat with this; I think that extreme precision of definition is often not worthwhile, and sometimes it is not possible—in fact mostly it is not possible, but I will not get into that argument here.I think his point is meaningless. Definitions are not the issue. What words are used is. Regardless, he closes that first lecture with ""Doubt is clearly a value in the sciences. Whether it is in other fields is an open questions and an uncertain matter."" If any scientist claims no uncertainty, I think said scientist needs to go back to school.In his second lecture, The Uncertainty of Values, Feynman skirts and flirts with something Gould thought was non-overlapping. He says So I have developed in a previous talk, and I want to maintain here, that it is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn’t get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.By being uncertain, we can progress. On the other end, there is little as certain as a devout religious man, who will not progress. My thoughts, not his. At least not here. He does pose a thought exercise of a young man (recall, this is 1963...) of a religious family going off to a university to study science who learns to doubt. Feynman believed without data that more than half of scientists did not believe in their father's God and asks, why?By answering this question I think that we will point up most clearly the problems of the relation of religion and science. Well, why is it? There are three possibilities. The first is that the young man is taught by the scientists, and I have already pointed out, they are atheists, and so their evil is spread from the teacher to the student, perpetually. . . . Thank you for the laughter. If you take this point of view, I believe it shows that you know less of science than I know of religion.""If you take this point of view..."" Love it! The second possibility was an assumption that a little knowledge was dangerous and the young man having learned a little science now thought he knew everything. And the third possibility was that the young man didn't understand science correctly, because science cannot disprove God. Feynman says ""It is not my purpose to disprove anything."" Maybe...maybe not. But Feynman does take the discussion in the right direction"" 'Is there a God, or isn't there a God?"" changes to the question 'How sure am I that there is a God?' "" Now, continuing along what Gould would later label Non Overlapping Majesteria, Feynman says that ethical values lie outside the scientific realm, and responding to people who thought that science should have some conclusions about moral values:I have several reasons for that. You see, if you don’t have a good reason, you have to have several reasons [I laughed out loud at that!], so I have four reasons to think that moral values lie outside the scientific realm. First, in the past there were conflicts. The metaphysical positions have changed, and there have been practically no effects on the ethical views. So there must be a hint that there is an independence. Second, I already pointed out that, I think at least, there are good men who practice Christian ethics and don’t believe in the divinity of Christ. [...] The third thing is that, as far as I know in the gathering of scientific evidence, there doesn't seem to be anywhere, anything that says whether the Golden Rule is a good one or not. I don't have any evidence of it on the basis of scientific study.  And finally I would like to make a little philosophical argument [...] ""What should I do? Should I do this?""... scientifically cannot be answered. Cause and effect can usually be determined, but an effect from cause may not necessarily follow. As to his first point and the hint of independence, I say there is a hint, but not confirmation. And to his second point, he traps himself with naming Christian ethics, which are neither exclusive nor original. (Nor divinely revealed.) In 1963, Russia was still the big threat, and he had thoughts on it:Russia is a backward country. Oh, it is technologically advanced. I described the difference between what I like to call the science and technology. It does not apparently seem, unfortunately, that engineering and technological development are not consistent with suppressed new opinion. It appears, at least in the days of Hitler, where no new science was developed, nevertheless rockets were made, and rockets also can be made in Russia. I am sorry to hear that, but it is true that technological development, the applications of science, can go on without the freedom. Russia is backward because it has not learned that there is a limit to government power. The great discovery of the Anglo-Saxons is—they are not the only people who thought of it, but, to take the later history of the long struggle of the idea—that there can be a limit to government power. Today, members of a certain non-progressive political party claim to want to reduce government, yet they actually want to increase their power. Feynman also says The fact that Russia is not free is clear to everyone, and the consequences in the sciences are quite obvious. One of the best examples is Lysenko, who has a theory of genetics, which is that acquired characteristics can be passed on to the offspring. This is probably true.Yeah. You can imagine my reaction. He qualifies that by saying that the major part of genetic behavior is different than Lysenko's theory. I suppose that's the good, uncertain, scientist talking. Feynman's last lecture was as noted above, admittedly a collection of ideas and not with a specific point. He titled it ""The Unscientific Age"". Little did he know that 50 years later it would get worse. On judging an idea, an example: The first one [example] has to do with whether a man knows what he is talking about, whether what he says has some basis or not. And my trick that I use is very easy. If you ask him intelligent questions—that is, penetrating, interested, honest, frank, direct questions on the subject, and no trick questions—then he quickly gets stuck. A rather sad assessment, he tells a story about politicsSuppose two politicians are running for president, and one goes through the farm section and is asked, “What are you going to do about the farm question?” And he knows right away—bang, bang, bang. Now he goes to the next campaigner who comes through. “What are you going to do about the farm problem?” “Well, I don’t know. I used to be a general, and I don’t know anything about farming. But it seems to me it must be a very difficult problem, because for twelve, fifteen, twenty years people have been struggling with it, and people say that they know how to solve the farm problem. And it must be a hard problem. So the way that I intend to solve the farm problem is to gather around me a lot of people who know something about it, to look at all the experience that we have had with this problem before, to take a certain amount of time at it, and then to come to some conclusion in a reasonable way about it. Now, I can’t tell you ahead of time what conclusion, but I can give you some of the principles I’ll try to use - not to make things difficult for individual farmers, if there are any special problems we will have to have some way to take care of them,"" etc., etc., etc. Now such a man would never get anywhere in this country, I think. It's never been tried, anyway., This is in the attitude of mind of the populace, that they have to have an answer and that a man who gives an answer is better than a man who gives no answer, when the real fact of the matter is, in most cases, it is the other way around.I have direct experience with this. I gave the second answer in an interview. Not what the hiring authority was looking for, or wanting. And in today's politics, baldfaced lies are preferred by a certain minority of the electorate to anyone who honestly says we have to put in some work.Asking how we get new ideas, he answers ""by analogy"" and then illustratesFirst, we take witch doctors. The witch doctor says he knows how to cure. There are spirits inside which are trying to get out. You have to blow them out with an egg, and so on. Put a snakeskin on and take quinine from the bark of a tree. The quinine works. He doesn’t know he’s got the wrong theory of what happens. If I’m in the tribe and I’m sick, I go to the witch doctor. He knows more about it than anyone else. But I keep trying to tell him he doesn’t know what he’s doing and that someday when people investigate the thing freely and get free of all his complicated ideas they’ll learn much better ways of doing it. Who are the witch doctors? Psychoanalysts and psychiatrists, of course. If you look at all of the complicated ideas that they have developed in an infinitesimal amount of time, if you compare to any other of the sciences how long it takes to get one idea after the other, if you consider all the structures and inventions and complicated things, the ids and the egos, the tensions and the forces, and the pushes and the pulls, I tell you they can't all be there. It's too much for one brain or a few brains to have cooked up in such a short time. However, I remind you that if you're in the tribe, there's nobody else to go to.Okay, I quoted this because his analogy of psychoanalysts to witch doctors was a gem. And damn if he isn't spot on: so much mumbo jumbo in such a comparatively short (in the grand humanity scheme of things) amount of time.So, I whetted my appetite and now need to read more substance from the great physicist."
9,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,3,"This book is a short read. It is based on three-part public lecture given by Feynman in 1963 in which he talked about various topics. In general they're enjoyable, especially those that deal with science, but he also speaks about politics. The following points are my summary for the most important topic he tackled:*The nature of science, the fact that it can be used for good or evil purposes.*Nature and its poetry that is way more beautiful than myths, because its imagination is more than that of humans. *The unification of electric and magnetic power by Michael Faraday.*Observation as a final judge in the truth of an idea and its limitations (can't answer ethical questions)*Importance of doubt in science and its uncertainty.*Relationship between science and religion. He is rather cautious in this part and only shyly says that science can erode religion, because it encourages doubt. This is understandable in the time these lectures were given when in the United State atheism was equated with Communism which was seen as the enemy, which takes us to the next point..*Criticism of USSR's lack of freedom and domination over eastern Europe. Of course as with many American's Feyman fails to criticize his own country's interventions in other countries of the world.*Lysenkoism in USSR which is a great example about how politics can ruin scientific advancement.*Support for limited government, freedom of thought and inquiry.*How to think scientifically about different topics including telepathy (mind reading), flying saucers, astrology, chance, faith healing, conspiracy theories, prayer and nuclear testing.*Criticism of the hard spelling of English words.*Criticism of psychoanalysis and psychiatry. He equates the both, which is a big mistake in my opinion, but again psychiatry was new back them and the reputation of psychoanalysis was all-over it. It was hard for non-specialists to know the difference."
10,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6919411-ahmad-ashkaibi,4,"When I read a book for someone like Richard Feynman, the first things jumps to my mind is how lucky were his students. I wish I could meet someone like him in person. I could listen to him talk for hours.In this book, Feynman talks about the relationship between science and people. These were three lectures presented by Professor Feynman at California Institute University, in 1963.In the first lecture, he talks about the uncertainty of science. Everything about science is uncertain; the scientific findings themselves, the purposes of the scientific researches, and the consequences of the science development. The second lecture is about the uncertainty of values. He compares the scientific findings to the religious and moral values. I quote his words here: “I do not believe that the scientist can have that same certainty of faith that very deeply religious people have”. In the Final Lecture, he talks how we’re living in an unscientific age. He means by that, that despite the development of science, but people are still following the power of economy and strategical leadership, and not necessarily the value of the scientific findings.Richard Feynman is a very fine physicist, but he is also a very fine philosopher. I strongly recommend this book to everybody in science business; i.e. professors, researchers, students, etc.It was a great book. I’ve enjoyed it."
11,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2623195-susan,3,I felt the chapter The Unscientific Age redeemed this book. I barely could keep my attention on it. But when I came to the final chapter his point finally clicked. I think he has quite a bit to say about conspiracy theories and widespread paranoia. I wish the American public could read this chapter! Besides that though I felt the book was too rambling and not pointed and emphatic enough. It is almost like he wanted all his words to maintain a sort of equivalent nature. Not good when writing a book where you want to make a strong point about things.
12,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26855073-lada,4,"There's not much here that a scientist probably has not thought of on their own, nor is it expressed in a way that would make you pause and think of things in a new way, but the historical context (civil rights, space exploration, cold war) and the fact that it is a self-admitted brain dump by Freynman, make it a worthwhile read."
13,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20883747-daniel-kraft,1,"The reason I read this book is because of Feynman was a part of the Manhattan project (also because he was a nobel laureate). The perspective on ‘meaning’ or ‘value’ where Feynman “[…] will discuss the impact of scientific views on political questions, in particular the question of national enemies, and on religious questions”, is unique and extremely interesting. It is a rare occurrence considering that Feynman was instrumental, and fully aware of what he was doing, in the creation of the atomic bomb, and also provides a view on the relation between science and meaning/value(s). My interest in ""The Meaning of It All"" was not regarding Feynman as a physicist, but as an ethicist. The Manhattan project (Feynman was involved 1942-1945) was a race - USA wanted to develop nuclear weapon before Germany did during WWII. To give a little context, here’s an overiew of some events.1945-04-30 Hitler commits suicide,1945-05-07 Germany surrenders WWII,1945 July. The Szilárd petition was signed by 70 Manhattan project scientists (not Feynman).1945-07-16 Trinity test was conducted,1945-08-06 Little boy drops on Hiroshima, Japan. 66 000 dead. 69 000 injured,1945-08-09 Fat man drops on Nagasaki, Japan. 60-80 000 dead.Feynman was present during the Trinity test and was asked to follow along the plane that dropped Little boy. From a scientist point of view, I can understand that there’s a beauty igniting the light that fuels the stars. If this light is so intense it can be seen from another planet - and if I knew it would be used on people - I would think twice about what I was a part of creating. This is what Feynman should have written about.Unfortunately Feynman doesn’t provide any satisfying ‘rationales’ or ‘justifications’ or ‘reflections’. Feynman writes “The most obvious characteristic of science is its application, the fact that as a consequence of science one has a power to do things. And the effect this power has had need hardly be mentioned.“ He continues by adding some examples after stating “[n]ow this power to do things carries with it no instructions on how to use it, whether to use it for good or for evil. The product of this power is either good or evil, depending on how it is used.“ A little later, somewhat redundant, Feyman says: “I think a power to do something is of value. Whether the result is a good thing or a bad thing depends on how it is used, but the power is a value” and continues “[t]o every man is given the key to the gates of heaven. The same key opens the gates of hell.” The latter has become a famous quote although in this context it is trivial - it does not explain anything. No principle can be derived from it or the arguments above. It is ‘the instructions to use power’ that is crucial to discuss; if there are none, it is absolutely necessary to invent them. I think the key to Feynman’s psychology comes from this passage:All the major problems of the relations between society and science lie in this same area. When the scientist is told that he must be more responsible for his effects on society, it is the applications of science that are referred to. If you work to develop nuclear energy you must realize also that it can be used harmfully. Therefore, you would expect that, in a discussion of this kind by a scientist, this would be the most important topic. But I will not talk about it further. I think that to say these are scientific problems is an exaggeration. They are far more humanitarian problems. The fact that how to work the power is clear, but how to control it is not, is something not so scientific and is not something that the scientist knows so much about.”There is a difference between to “develop nuclear energy” and to ‘develop a nuclear bomb’. One cannot separate ‘scientific problems’ from ‘humanitarian problems’ as the first have implications on the other. Secondly, there are not so many different things you can do with a bomb (considering this is my interest in the book). The quote that science can be used for ‘doing good or bad’ serves little to no value when discussing the ethical dilemma here. Especially because Feynman doesn’t want to talk about it further (but still do later on). When discussing the uncertainty of values Feynman says “I say that we do not know what is the meaning of life and what are the right moral values, that we have no way to choose them and so on. No discussion can be made of moral values, of the meaning of life and so on, without coming to the great source of systems of morality and descriptions of meaning, which is in the field of religion.” It is negligent to just not care about problems because the (relevant) problems are “in the field of religion”. From here on the discourse mainly consist of binary oppositions; freedom/unfreedom, USA/Russia, good/evil, christianity/atheism, etc. The distinction between science and moral, is could be phrased by, “[...] I would like to make a little philosophical argument to explain why theoretically I think that science and moral are independent.” The basic question (sort of) in scientific inquiry (a) ‘if I do this what will happen?’ and is completely different to (b) ‘should I do this’. The latter would be a question that could not be answered whilst the first one can, according to Feynman. In-depth-analysis is never given. The argument kind of goes full circle on the finishing note “[y]ou see, at the end you must have some ultimate judgment”. Clarification on who/what/why the ultimate judgment is, Feynman doesn’t go into further detail on.All these generalizations and dead ends are extremely frustrating while reading. Everything Feynman has to say about ethics or meaning or value is trivial. The entire field of moral philosophy is overlooked. And this completely astonished me while reading, considering the impact Feynman has.From the overview of events presented earlier, listening to Feynman-interviews, I know two things. First of all that Feynman was in crucial for the Manhattan project, fully aware of what was going on, and first handedly experienced all of the events. Secondly he was convinced by the justification for creating a WMD (‘either the Germans do it or we do it’). It surprised me learning that the key scientists (and especially Feynman considering the opportunity in a book like this) in the Manhattan project never openly discuss (i) the realization that Germany was never so far in producing nuclear weapons, (ii) the continuation of the Manhattan project after Germany’s surrender, (iii) the Szilárd petition, (iv) why Japan was the target and not Germany, (v) why civilians where the target, (vi) alternatives to ending the war than nuclear bombs, (vii) the necessity of dropping not one but two (!) nuclear bombs, (viii) lastly and perhaps most important, that one of the most basic principles in science is that you can repeat what you discover. Why was it never discussed that the enemies of USA would also have nuclear weapons in the forseeable future? These things should be what Feyman discussed in a book with the title “The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen-Scientist!The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were means justifying an end. The end here is probably asserting dominance. And to some extent ending WWII. Even though the means here were extremely excessive, there still has been a principle formulated, which could be rephraesed as ‘justification through teleological value model’. G.E.M. Anscombe famously wrote in Mr. Truman’s Degree:“The action was necessary, or at any rate it was thought by competent, expert military opinion to be necessary; it probably saved more lives than it sacrificed; it had a good result, it ended the war. Come now: if you had to choose between boiling one baby and letting some frightful disaster befall on a thousand people - or a million people, if a thousand is not enough - what would you do? Are you going to strike an attitude and say 'You may not do evil that may come'? […]”The heat wave from Little boy caused all water to boil. Infants and children that were bathed when Little boy were dropped on Hiroshima, boiled to death. Whether this is justified should be the starting point of any discussion regarding justification of scientific research. Not filling a book on the topic ‘meaning’ with playful scientific method.As a Swede there’s an interesting parallell to Alfred Nobel, the “dynamite king”, who gained a fortune creating a powerful weapon. And devoted the same fortune to charity. According to legacy Nobel’s brother Ludvig Nobel died from a heart attack in France and a French paper mixed up Ludvig and Alfred. The obituary supposedly said that Alfred Nobel, the ‘merchant of death’ gained his fortune because of his innovations lead to new ways to ‘mutilate and kill’. This lead to a crisis of conscience and Nobel’s will was rewritten - this is the reason the Nobel prize is given annually."
14,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1895570-jim,5,"Richard P. Feynman's The Meaning Of It All: Thoughts Of A Citizen-scientist is a delightful series of three lectures on the uncertainty of science, then of values, and ending with the best of all -- ""This Unscientific Age"" -- which deals with popular notions which militate against science in favor of various shaky beliefs.Feynman is a great believer in uncertainty as a guiding principle in life:I made an impassioned plea for the idea that it's good to have an open channel, that there's value in uncertainty, that it's more important to permit us to discover new things, rather than to choose a solution that we now make up -- that to choose a solution, no matter how we choose it now is to choose a much worse thing than what we would get if we waited and worked things out. And that's where I made the choice, and I'm not sure of that choice. Okay, I have now destroyed authority.In an age of cockamamie beliefs ranging from fundamentalist religion to astrology to New Age, it is better, according to Feynman, to hold back and consider the issue more systematically and at greater length.It is a pity that we no longer have Feynman with us: We need him more than ever at this time of division."

The value is in the power scientific findings harness and wield, but finding new ways to do things (the definition of Science)requires we look at this new power and ask ourselves ""what could the scientific experiment/findings cause to happen and do I want that result to occur?"" (IE. nuclear bombs etc) basically, moral and ethical questions have been sitting outside the boundaries of Science. who is going to ensure we aren't shooting ourselves in the foot? what we don't know is hurting us. A problem, however, is whether scientists (and average citizens) find value in placing importance on the realities Uncertainty places. Read Black Swan along with this book for additional insight into uncertainties and other related concepts slightly over my head. (You can learn from directly from the statistician's mouth.)My favorite point he makes around page 105 when he talks about people lacking a proper sense of proportion, which is sometimes a result of people, and even countries, using a certain method of paralysis against them, and what the bigger picture reveals in any given situation. I agree with this and see this behavior in alot of people today. one example of opinion, a statement on page 106, states: ""I think we should have more abject honesty in political matters."" ...hehe, good luck with that one. He gives other amazing examples and ideas. I'll end with two statements he made and play them back to back:""There is no authority who decides what is a good idea.""""...because it is interesting that human relationships, if there is an independent way of judging truth, can become unargumentative.

I can hear, even picture Feynman when reading it; he had a distinctive way of speaking that was very natural and not polished at all, including hesitations, corrections and minor mistakes of language. Not often did he memorise a speech.Here, Feynman wades a long way beyond his own territory to examine the relationship of science to politics, religion and other aspects of wider Western civilisation. He repeatedly points out that he is no authority, he could be wrong in his conclusions and so forth, which leads one towards examining his arguments on their merits rather than the celebrity or reputation of Feynman himself...which is exactly what Feynman wanted to achieve, I suspect: Don't take my word for it, question, examine and test for yourself - or put another way, take a more scientific approach to questions that are amenable to that approach.If you want to know how to do that, well this book is a reasonable starting point. Other works by Feynman could help, too. It does no harm for practising scientists to be reminded of some basic principles, too. Various people have been insisting that I should respect Argument from Authority, recently and it is literally depressing me that they cannot see that if scientists took such an approach we would still have Plato's world-view."

The Nobel Prize winning physicist is often quoted in popular science; I thought it was about time I read him in his own words. This book contains three public lectures given in 1963. The first, entitled, ‘The Uncertainty of Science’, addresses the importance of doubt in science as the catalyst for ideas and progress and introduces his views on the remarkable process of scientific discovery.He counters the misconception that science is dull with rich imagery:‘The world is a spinning ball, and people are held on it on all sides, some of them upside down. And we turn like a spit in front of a great fire. We whirl around the sun…But see that the imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man. No one who did not have some inkling of this through observations could have imagined such a marvel as nature is.’The themes of freedom and discovery remain in his second lecture on values, illustrated through an impressive employment of philosophy and ethics. His confident rhetoric shows in places a sensitive balance that allows the audience to consider his statements without pressure. I really enjoy reading lectures because so much of the speaker’s personality comes across. More at http://eveproofreads.com/2012/06/27/t..."

She said the lead technical person in the investigation was this interesting scientist, who I later found out was Richard Feynman. Luckily, my wife had recorded the movie as well as a small documentary of this ""scientist"". After watching both pieces, I was amazed I'd never heard of this man, but was so glad that she'd shown these movies to me. About the book. The only reason I gave this book 3 stars, is because I struggled with the delivery of the speech being transcribed in print. I've seen videos of Mr. Feynman before, and found him lively and amazing and the way he speaks just didn't work for me in print. The topics were right on the money though and I would recommend this book to anyone who finds Mr. Feynman as amazing as I do or if they want to hear perspectives on topics such as religion, politics, etc., put forth by a brilliant mind."

Certainly not a must-read, but it opened my mind on certain issues. To be honest, format isn’t optimal. The book consists of three lectures written down, unsummarised. That makes the book light to read. Feynman is a great thinker. He has the ability to word things simply, yet powerful. He’s gentle, yet to the point. He dwindles on the subjects of morals, possibility versus probability, uncertainty. He leaves the conclusion to the public (or reader in this case)There are no hard truths.

He's engaging enough, but the subject matter is rather thin, especially if you're already pretty committed to a scientific worldview.This is probably pretty good if you are looking to read some basic philosophy from a leading scientist's point of view, but if, like me, you came into this expecting more hard science, you're likely to be a little disappointed."

The first two are quite short, and the third one touches briefly upon a myriad topics - science, religion, politics, astrology, propaganda, scammers, advertising, statistics, and basically, sensible free-thinking and philosophy. Hardly any of this has dated at all over the last 50yrs, and is arguably more relevant these days. In case you are deterred by the 'scientific' look of this book, don't be. There are no equations, no hard maths, just lots of conversational questions to ponder. It's a great book, but to me, that is its weakness. It tries to point out the illogical and silly, superstitious way many of us behave, and is therefore most useful to those kinds of superstitious halfwits who would never consider reading such a book.

Feynman's other books are really fantastic. Feynman really goes off his topics of real expertise and writes about politics, about philosophy and even ventures into theology. Feynman's brilliance still shines through and there are some points I haven't read in his other books. In particular the Feynman talks about how we should include so much uncertainty into our world view and how it should affect our political and other views more than it does.

33,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5536017-david-cooke,1,"This is easily the worst thing I've ever read by Richard Feynman, and is a perfect example of a physicist getting too far afield.Given the issues today around uncertainty in science being manipulated by politics, I thought this would be a perfectly timed read - when I saw it in the used book store, it immediately called to me. Unfortunately, these lectures were either not worth printing in the first place or, at the very least, have not aged well in the slightest.They are not well-structured at all. Even Feynman acknowledges that they are basically off the cuff, and he gets through his main point in advance of the final lecture, which makes the last lecture especially painful and scattershot.There are a handful of key mistakes made here apart from the haphazard construction:First and foremost, it's chock full of old man ranting. If you want to hear a quintessential example of scientific mansplaining, this book is unfortunately a great depiction of Feynman's massive ego. I find that usually his ego ends up adding a humorous larger than life characteristic, but here it just comes of as condescending and foppish, since he is speaking out of his ass.Secondly, the material is exceptionally dated. His commentary on Soviet science is so ridiculously ""rah rah US, communists bad"" that it is impossible to be taken seriously. His take on politics feels so out of step with the history that follows that it just reinforces the ""old man ranting"" aspect that makes this certainly brilliant man come off as aloof and curmudgeonly.Thirdly, the philosophical elements at play here are illustrated more through anecdotes than thorough scientific examination, which just reinforces the half-ass-ism of the lectures. Occasionally, there is a good point made, and the underlying notion of uncertainty at the core of the first two lectures could have been fine-tuned to a more interesting purpose. But ultimately he just seems more interested in mocking people he disagrees with, which is obviously a terribly alienating way to communicate.Honestly, this book was so bad that it makes me want to revisit other Feynman books I've read because it's been so long. I always had thought that he was an egotistical Renaissance man, but I thought his liberal arts approach to scientific life compelling. But maybe I let the larger than life elements of his character obscure his flaws. I sure hope not."
34,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"These three lectures by Feynman are not particularly interesting. The most engaging lecture is on the uncertainty of science where Feynman stresses the value of doubt for the integrity of the scientific process. In this lecture, Feynman states, interestingly, that ""The rules that describe nature seem to be mathematical....Why nature is mathematical is...a mystery."" In his second lecture on the uncertainty of value, Feynman argues that science and values are two separate realms and that science is not helpful in the realm of values that require some sort of ultimate judgement. On the question of values, such as love, individuality, self-interest, the human race, respect,freedom and equality, are these off limits to (biological) science, leaving them to the mysteries of religion and metaphysics? Feynman closes that lecture by stating, ""No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles, nor to prescribe in any way the character of the questions investigated. Neither may government determine the aesthetic value of artistic creations, nor limit the forms of literary or artistic expressions. Nor should it pronounce on the validity of economic, historic, religious, or philosophical doctrines. Instead, it has the duty to its citizens to maintain the freedom, to let those citizens contribute to the further adventure and the development of the human race."" There are a lot of Feynman values in this statement. They all seem reasonable enough, but what is 'reasonable'? As to why his personal opinion should hold sway, he doesn't say and this lecture seems to remove him from that kind of debate. Is the science relating to our evolutionary origins relevant? The third lecture, on the ""unscientific age,"" doesn't offer much.  "
35,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,3,"Originally published on my blog here in July 2001.These three lectures, about science, society, philosophy, religion and so on, were delivered in the early sixties but not published until after Feynman's death. They read as though they are basically transcriptions of more or less off the cuff speaking rather than as composed in written form for the book.Basically the theme of the talks is how science relates to society's other concerns, with interesting digressions on subjects like why politicians' promises can't be trusted (because real life situations are often too complex for sound bit answers). The sections where Feynman defines science and where he talks about religion are particularly interesting, but there are thought provoking ideas throughout.There are two - at least - disappointing aspects to the lectures. One is the occasional piece of naive American patriotism, endorsing the space race, for example, because it wouldn't do to let the Russians get too far ahead. This is more a product of the time and place than anything else, but it certainly dates what is said and reduces the impact of the more interesting bits.The other problem is more serious, and pervades the whole book. The general tone of the lectures is over-simplified, and has a tendency when written down rather than spoken to come over as patronising. Feynman was a great communicator, and I suspect this problem is a result of the lectures being transcribed from the oral to written medium without editing. The Meaning of It All is interesting, but could have been fascinating if intended to be a book from the start. "
36,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8907630-camilla,3,"This book is based off a series of lectures Feynman gave for laymen audiences. I don't think the editors changed enough to say it is ""based off"" the lectures, actually--even ""Thank you for the laugh"" and that sort of thing are left in. The lectures cover science and its relation to doubt, religion, and politics. Feynman is critical of his lectures, and with some reason to be, but none of the reasons matter much. It was a pleasure to listen to this, despite its faults.The lectures were repetitive, both over the course of all of them and in each one. It seemed like he had some difficulty explaining his ideas. In one, he basically said he ran out of ideas and was going to ramble for a while. The ideas were solid and coherent, though I doubt some of them would stand up against, say, some philosophers. I thought it was strongest when he kept to science, and I think he did too. Why wouldn't it be? He was a scientist and knew that best.Feynman comes across as extremely likeable in this collection. The audiobook narrator was great, and conveyed Feynman's enthusiasm well. This would really be 3 1/2 stars if Goodreads would allow that. I genuinely enjoyed listening to it, but it is repetitious, and clever if less than brilliant. I'd recommend it if you're a big Feynman fan or have a few hours to kill, but it isn't a must read, I'm afraid."

Feynman's engaging and modest style can be clearly seen, but the lectures do not translate well onto the printed page. He rambles and makes a number of minor points, the most important of which is that things are uncertain. He goes after the Soviets, faith healers and mind readers, politicians, etc. in a relaxed and extremely modest style. He equivocates a lot, but that is his point about uncertainty. He even makes it clear that he doesn't know whether continued testing of nuclear weapons is or is not a good idea. I was very disappointed, considering Feynman's reputation as about the most brilliant man extant, and I suspect were Feynman still alive (he died in 1988) he would not have allowed this book to be published. It is dated and mediocre. What works with a lecture group may not work so well in a book, and it doesn't here. This is the political Feynman, not the physicist. Still it's nice to know (I guess) that a brilliant man can sound so ordinary. It just goes to show that no matter how brilliant and accomplished someone may be in his own field, it doesn't necessarily mean he is an expert in another. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

The problem is that everything he has written was already published. Al of the 'new' books you find 'written' by Feynman in the last decade or so are just collections that reorganize his short anecdotes already published in different volumes.This 'book' is a collection of talks that he gave late in his life. It has all the interesting ideas and anecdote you expect from Feynman, but they're kind of scatterbrained. This may have worked in a lecture format but when it's written you find yourself constantly asking 'what the hell is he talking about.' There were some good observations about politicians that are especially poignant considering our previous and current president, among other interesting ideas of applying scientific thinking to other realms of life. Additionally, I don't think Feynman would have approved this title of 'The Meaning of it all'. The whole point of the lectures is that the best way to move forward in any area of life and culture is to admit you are ignorant of most things in life. "

This short volume / audio production is a transcription / reading of three lectures the great physicist and practical joker gave at the University of Washington in 1963 on the relationship between science and society.

56,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1597857-robert,5,"The Meaning of it All is an excellent compilation of three lectures Richard Feynman delivered at the beginning of the so-called counter-culture movement, when a revolution in social norms occurred in the United States. Many people in the past “insisted that the rest of the world agree with them. And they would do things that were directly inconsistent with their own beliefs in order to maintain that what they said was true.” This particular comment by Feynman, made in April 1963, stands out for me. I think of the Berkeley free speech movement that emerged out of Feynman’s era, a movement that no longer (in 2017) supports free speech.What many of the anti-conservative liberals of this decade have forgotten were Feynman’s observations about our society, “Western civilization, it seems to me, stands by two great heritages. One is the scientific spirit of adventure – the adventure into the unknown, an unknown that must be recognized as unknown in order to be explored, the demand that the unanswerable mysteries of the universe remain unanswered, the attitude that all is uncertain. To summarize it: humility of the intellect . . . The other great heritage is Christian ethics – the basis of action on love, the brotherhood of all men, the value of the individual, the humility of the spirit. These two heritages are logically thoroughly consistent. But logic is not all. One needs one’s heart to follow an idea.”Feynman highlighted the dangers of government management, especially for those people who think that government is the solution to society’s ills: “I think that Russia [commonly called the USSR back then] represents danger in saying that the solution to human problems is known, that all effort should be for the state, for that means there is no novelty. The human machine is not allowed to develop its potentialities, its surprises, its varieties, its new solutions for difficult problems, its new points of view . . .’Feynman supports that the imperfect American government is a better political institution than most, “The government of the United States was developed under the idea that nobody knew how to make a government, or how to govern. The result is to invent a system to govern when you don’t know how. The result is to invent a system to govern when you don’t know how. And the way to arrange it is to permit a system, like we have, wherein new ideas can be developed and tried out and thrown away. The writers of the Constitution knew of the value of doubt . . .”He reinforces his point, “Doubt and discussion are essential to progress. The United States government is new, it’s modern, and it is scientific. It is all messed up too. Senators sell their votes for a dam in their state and discussions get all excited and lobbying replaces the minority’s chance to represent itself, and so forth. The government of the United States is not very good, but it, with the possible exception the government of England, is the most satisfactory, the most modern, but not very good.”Feynman is a firm believer in government staying out of what it cannot discover and what it does not know, “No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles, nor to prescribe in any way the character of the questions investigated. Neither may a government determine the aesthetic value of artistic creations, nor limit the forms of literary or artistic expression. Nor should it pronounce on the validity of economic, historic, religious, or philosophical doctrines. Instead it has a duty to its citizens to maintain the freedom, to let those citizens contribute to the further adventure and the development of the human race.”Agreed."
57,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072527-nicholas,2,"This book contains a series of three lectures given at the University of Washington on the role of science in modern society. Feynman himself was against the publication of these lectures feeling that they lacked polish, focus and ultimately wouldn't be the same on paper as they were in person. Anyone who's ever seen the man in action can readily attest to his electrifying personality; it is really quite conceivable that you could listen to him talk about anything forever. I have to say that Feynman's instinct was right. While he does make some interesting points and observations about the role of science and common misperceptions related to scientific endeavor, these lectures lack focus. There are tons of tangents and anecdotes, brilliantly funny and charming, to be sure, but of the sort that lend themselves to the type of barroom storytelling Feynman was famous for - not in a published work.The outline of the lecture series is roughly as follows:Lecture 1: What the heck do people mean when they talk about science? Feynman presents a three-part definition. Science is a method for finding things out about the universe, it is the corpus of things that we do find out (the information and knowledge), and it is the application of this information for practical purposes (technology). What value does it have? Why should we fund it? Pursue it? For the very fact that science is exciting. The things we learn themselves are valuable in and of themselves in that they give us a sense of wonder about the universe. He leads out with a point that seems counterintuitive and thus always misunderstood. Science is the pursuit of answers, but really, all good science rests on uncertainty. Science is never, ever certain of things. We sift through explanations for observable phenomena and as our technology and understanding progresses the holes in the sieve become smaller and more discerning. Any theory we have to explain things, the laws of the universe themselves, are merely our best guesses within a certain degree of uncertainty. The prime example of this is the relationship between motion and mass. It was thought, in the past that an object maintained its mass no matter how fast it traveled. This hypothesis was tested, using a spinning top. When scientists weighed the top in motion and at rest they found the mass to be ""the same"" - validating the theory and elevating it to a law of nature, and they were right, to within the degree of accuracy they were capable of measuring mass and to the extent they were able to speed it up. Relativity smashed this idea. It turns out, if you accelerate an object to somewhere near the speed of light, its mass does indeed change and becomes heavier. Even a top traveling at nonrelativistic speeds changes mass, but only to a few parts in a billion, and thus, it is almost imperceptible. Anyway, the point is we must be skeptical of all our ideas if science is to thrive and survive, even with our most cherished and commonsense laws. I think this notion especially pertinent in our age of undetectable dark matter. Seems like almost everyone I read is universally convinced of the existence of matter we have not seen or detected directly merely by the effect it has on matter we can see. It may well be true, that the presence of dark matter is the reason for faster than expected galactic rotation and the like - it is certainly the most plausible answer in a field of many, but the ridicule which MOND activists and people who challenge the idea of dark matter with alternatives receive seems unhelpful and indeed counterproductive to the advancement of science. Challenging ideas should be entertained and tested as hurdles which probable explanations need to fly over if they wish to survive. They should be welcome as tests, not dismissed as quackery outright because they don't presume to follow the generally accepted norm. These arguments very closely mirror those presented by Lee Smolin in The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next and are worth taking seriously in physics departments and grant-giving institutions worldwide.Lecture 2: What are the limits of science? In this lecture Feynman focuses pretty much on what science cannot be used for and particularly focuses on the realm of value judgments. He does so by pointing out frequent clashes between science and religion from a historical point of view and tries to ameliorate the tension between the two. His arguments are lucid, without condescension and full of the usual self-deprecating humor that I think many atheists today lack when dealing with religious people they disagree with chiefly by admitting his own ignorance on certain issues and relegating his criticisms to only pertinent parts of religions with which the scientific mind might conflict (these he terms metaphysics or the explanations given in religions for what things are, e.g. what is the universe, what kind of thing God is). In this realm, there have been great conflicts between religion and science that predate, but are most famously illustrated by the conflict between Galileo's observations and insistence in a heliocentric solar system and the Church's insistence on the ancient Ptolemaic model of geocentrism. Feynman admits in this respect the world's religions have been forced to give ground to science, but what has remained untouched are the values and ethics which religions harbor and inspire in humankind. Science can give no aid to deciding which ethical, or political systems for that matter, are superior to any other because it's not something science can directly measure through its chief analytical tool: observation. In the end, judgment must stem from the individual and because of our mutual uncertainty we should have tolerance and promote an acknowledgement of our own ignorance in matters - a viewpoint that naturally leads to humility and all of us getting along a lot better.Lecture 3: In what areas can science or scientific thinking be put to broader use in society? This is probably the most jumbled and convoluted lecture in the series, but also the most charming and witty. The basic argument: if we were all a little more scientific and rational with our thinking perhaps we wouldn't be taken advantage of by advertisers so much and believe in dumb things like psychic powers and ufos. Again, the key to everything is uncertainty. There's no way to disprove all of these dumb things. So what makes them dumb? Their exceeding unprobability, not their lack of possibility. If you're a big Feynman fan and know him very well, this might still contain some value for you, but if you're looking for some insight into one of the 20th century's greatest thinkers and personalities, you're better off sticking with Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!, which is a shame because I think the core theme of acknowledging that we don't really know anything as certainly as we think we do is worth reminding a people and civilization in love with our own capability and strength. In an era when breakthrough follows breakthrough, it's important to remember that no matter how stunningly smart we think we are, we'll never know everything there is to know with absolute certainty - and why would we?! It would take the mystery and motivation out of the pursuit of science and we'd be a poorer culture for it. I'd love to get my hands on a recording of the lecture! I'm sure it would be much, much better!"
58,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53026475-maurice-williams,5,"Richard Feynman was an American scientist famous for his work on the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. He also assisted on the American development of the atomic bomb during WWII. After his death he was credited as being one of the ten greatest physicists of all time. He made a famous speech about the compatibility of science with religion. I bought “The Meaning of it All” and read it with great interest because I wanted to see what this famous scientist had to say on this subject.He starts off saying: ""What do I know of religion and politics?” Some of his friends who knew what he was going to talk about laughed and said they would like to come and hear what he has to say. They never knew he was interested very much in those things. Feynman says that he was interested, but he earlier would not dare talk about them.In speech, Feynman affirms that he believes there is a conflict between science and religion. A young man goes to the university to study science. But he learns to doubt. A scientist should doubt when investigating nature. But the student carries it further and begins to doubt the religion he leaned as a child, a religion that teaches that God is a real person to whom everyone should pray, and God has something to do with creation and with morals.The problems between religion and science are threefold. The first is that many scientists are atheists and second: ""their evil is spread from the teacher to the student, perpetually” .The audience laughs. He counters with: “Thank you for your laughter. If you take this point of view, I believe you know less of science than I know of religion."" He has a sense of humor. He goes on to the third reason: Science cannot disprove the existence of God. He say he agrees ""that a belief in science and religion is consistent. I do not know exactly how they believe in God. But their belief in God and their action in science is thoroughly consistent. It is consistent, but it is difficult.""He thinks there are two reasons for that difficulty. The first is the student is trained to doubt and then investigate and find for himself if there is any certainty in what he is investigating. Applying that to his religion, the student begins to doubt if there is a personal God that he should approach by prayer. He wonders: ""How sure am I that there is a God? He winds up not being 100% sure. The result of this self-study or thinking, or whatever it is, often ends with a conclusion that it is close to certainty that there is a God. And it often ends; on the other hand, with the claim that it is almost certainly wrong to believe that there is a God.""The second reason for that difficulty is that, after the student learns about how immense the universe is and how small he is, living on a tiny obscure planet within one of the many different galaxies, he begins to wonder if the God he previously believed in is big enough to have created the whole universe. He begins to wonder if prayer is actually heard.Feynman describes three aspects of religion. First, there is the metaphysical aspect that tells what things are and where they come from and what man is and what God is and what properties God has, and so on. Second: it then tells how to behave in a moral way. This is the ethical aspect of religion. And since humans are weak, the third aspect of religion is that it gives a powerful inspiration to act well. Not only that, it gives inspiration to the arts and many other activities of human beings.I'm going to quote Feynman's own explanation of this: ""These three aspects of religion are very closely interconnected in the religion's view. First of all, it usually goes like this: that the moral values are the word of God. Being the word of God connects the ethical and metaphysical aspects of religion. And finally, that also inspires the inspiration, because if you are working for God and obeying God's will, you are in some way connected to the universe. Your actions have a meaning in the greater world, and that is an inspiring aspect. So these three aspects are very well integrated and interconnected. The difficulty is that science occasionally conflicts with the first two categories, that is, with the ethical and the metaphysical aspects of religion.""Feynman gives some historical examples: ""There was a big struggle when it was discovered that the Earth rotates on its axis and goes around the sun. It was not supposed to be the case according to the religion of the time. There was a terrible argument and the outcome was, in that case, that religion retreated from the position that the Earth stood at the center of the universe. But at the end of the retreat there was no change in the moral viewpoint of religion.He then discusses: ""another tremendous argument when it was found likely that man descended from animals. Most religions have retreated once again from the metaphysical position that it wasn't true. The result is no particular change in the moral view."" Here I want to add my ideas on this. The first big struggle was whether the Earth revolved around the sun or whether the sun revolved around the Earth. I think this is a question of how the physical universe actually is and not a question about what God revealed. I don't think God intended to reveal to humans the science of how the universe works. Humans are perfectly capable of discovering that on their own. So I think religion was correct to retreat from this first struggleThe second struggle was the question of who created man, Either God did or man just evolved from lower life. An integral part of God's revelation is that he created man. Man did not spontaneously evolve from lower life forms. Religion is correct to insist that God created man. It was not revealed exactly how God did it. I think the various steps how did it falls into the realm of science that men will eventually learn through their own endeavors. I personally have no problem in presuming the procedure God used looks very much like evolution. But whether God created man through evolution or some other procedure, God did indeed create man. So I think religion is correct not to retreat from this struggleFeynman goes on to discuss the moral code of religion. He observes that dogmas of religion might come under re-examination under pressure of scientific discoveries, but the ethical or moral aspect religion doesn't come under the same pressure. People try to adhere to the Golden Rule whether they believe in God or not. He mentions men he thinks: ""are good men who practice Christian ethics and don't believe in the divinity of Christ."" I think this adhering to the Golden Rule is based upon Natural Law which is the supposition that God infuses into human beings an instinctive recognition of certain rights and behavior, what is right and wrong, which can be understood through human reason. But since humans are created with free will, they have the ability to violate that Natural Law if they choose to do soAfter reading ""The Meaning of it All"" I am still convinced that what Jesus Christ revealed is true. It is not my belief in him that makes what he says true. It's the other way around. I am convinced what he said really is true; that's why I believe. I put my faith in the reliability of what he said. His first followers believed he rose from the dead. I also am convinced he did rise from the dead. That makes him far more than merely human. He is The Christ, the human son of the divine God who created the universe."
59,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58236975-wyatt,4," ""But my atheistic scientific colleagues, which does not include all scientists— I cannot tell by their behavior, because of course I am on the same side, that they are particularly different from the religious ones, and it seems that their moral feelings and their understandings of other people and their humanity and so on apply to the believers as well as the disbelievers.""  ""The common human problem, the big question, always is 'Should I do this?'""  ""This is in the attitude of mind of the populace, that they have to have an answer and that a man who gives an answer is better than a man who gives no answer, when the real fact of the matter is, in most cases, it is the other way around. And the result of this of course is that the politician must give an answer. And the result of this is that political promises can never be kept. It is a mechanical fact; it is impossible. The result of that is that nobody believes campaign promises. And the result of that is a general disparaging of politics, a general lack of respect for the people who are trying to solve problems, and so forth. It’s all generated from the very beginning (maybe— this is a simple analysis). It’s all generated, maybe, by the fact that the attitude of the populace is to try to find the answer instead of trying to find a man who has a way of getting at the answer.""The ideas presented here are largely pretty fascinating, but the format makes it hard to follow, and is the one reason I docked a star. As far as I can tell, these three lectures given by Dr. Feynman were painstakingly transcribed while he gave them (or from an audio recording after the fact), and he has a particularly meandering way of speech that often makes it hard to get to the crux of what he's saying. What's more: it's clear that he struggled to contain all of his ideas to three lectures; the third one was much longer than the first two, and towards the end, he starts listing and teasing towards some ideas that he (me, too) clearly wishes he could develop more, which makes it feel pretty rushed (I imagine him speaking faster and faster as students start trickling out to get to their next class). That being said, the ideas Feynman expresses--which mainly have to do with the connection of science to politics, religion, and the way we go about our everyday lives--are plenty interesting enough to make it worth it. And it's certainly possible that smarter people than me will have no trouble with this text."
60,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114963797-vijaya-lakshmi,4,"Richrad P. Feyman a highly revered scientist gave 3 lectures in 1963 and their compilation is a highly thought provoking book called Meaning Of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist. He went on to win noble prize with 2 other scientists in 1965 for quantum aerodynamic Despite people asking permission to publish these lectures Feynman refused it until he was alive. it was later in 1998 that the family decided to get these published. As a scientist he was well aware of the fact that scientist’s views, apart from the ones on science are not appreciated, in fact they are ridiculed.SO in these lectures he takes up less well-known of his views, on the complexities of religion, society, politics, and social issues. In his first lecture The Uncertainty of Science, he discusses why not knowing something is good .In that you make an effort to know it and in the effort you may know the unknown and also learn a multitude of other things. In short not knowing is the beginning of a learning process. Uncertainty and doubt are good for science.The Second lecture: The Uncertainty of Values deals with his views on Science Religion and politics. He acknowledges science's limitations and says that it does not have the value system that religions have. He also shatters popular belief about education. In his own words:“At some time people thought that the potential that people had was not developed because everyone was ignorant and that education was the solution to the problem, that if all people were educated, we could all perhaps be Voltaires. But it turns out that falsehood and evil can be taught as easily as good. Education is a great power, but it can work either way.”The final chapter, This Unscientific AgeHe talks on diverse topics as faith healing, , politics, psychic phenomena, TV commercials etc. He explains why it is easy for us to fall for popular beliefs and customs without questioning them. This is my first Feynman book and despite me being religious and him being an atheist I could see how true his observations are. A highly recommended short read, the questions that Feynman puts and explains through examples will definitely hit a chord. This is a short book which will make you ponder and question things."
61,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35575939-rodrigo-posada,4,"Richard Feynman was a brilliant scientist with an impressive resume under his belt. Being amongst the Manhattan Project team during WWII, he was also a professor at Cornell and CalTech and even went on to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. Feynman definitely had a lot to say about many different topics ranging from physics, psychology, economics, life, religion and everything in between. In this collection of his lectures, he ventures on and discusses his own way of thinking and his mentality behind it. He divides his lectures into 3 parts each dealing with The Uncertainty of Science, Uncertainty of Values, and the Unscientific Age- mostly discussing the relevance of science and uncertainty, where no human knows anything for certain, but we use science as a process of elimination to reject theories that do not fit. Parallel to how scientist always have been able to confirm or reject theories- like the universe revolving around Earth. Feynman also dives into the core of religion and the history of conflict between religion and science, the former being the one that answers those questions the latter could not. And even dealing with how to be more creative, how ""truth"" is just ideas built on top of already accepted realities, and so on.Overall it was quite a nice and concise read. Feynman is quite a mind with definitely a lot to say about the world around him. While sometimes it felt a little too dull or redundant, Feynman was pretty sharp with his rational and the support behind it. Its always refreshing to hear new ways to look at things. "
62,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24115945-minhhai,4,"This is the transcript of 3 lectures that Feynman gave in 4/1963 at the Univ. of Washington at which he discussed the basic principles of science and its relation to society, religion and politics. I enjoyed the discussions and found many of his ideas and viewpoints very interesting.Feynman pointed out a surprising fact that science has been built upon uncertainty, not certainty as most of us would think. It's the uncertainty that allows scientific progress, and scientists know how to embrace it. He related it to some forms of ""bad science"", theories that assert certainties within a short amount of time, that we should beware of. That's also the key to explain the difficulty in reconciling science with other fields such as religion and politics in which the populace want to be assured with certainty.It's an entertaining read. However, it's spoken English, dictated into text without the context of the audience, so we easily miss most of the jokes and audience laughters. The last and longest chapter, Feynman seemed to wander through random stories without a clear structure, which makes it hard to follow his point.Overall, I believe general audience, especially non-scientists, will find intriguing discussions as well as amusement in these witty lectures by Feynman."

Feynman, this book really did give me a taste of how multifaceted Dr. Feynman was apart from being an absolutely brilliant physicist and teacher! I'm looking forward to reading more of his works (especially Q.E.D.: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter and Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman). It was a slow read for me because I needed more time to fully soak in his ideas and also formulate my own opinions on them. Out of all the three lectures, I enjoyed the first one titled  The Uncertainty of Science  the most. It was full of simple lines that made me smile! All the lectures had some really great ideas, including some that surprisingly hold true even now, more than half a century later! In fact, few statements were strikingly relevant to the present COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, it was a very satisfying read and I am highly grateful to my Physics teacher for recommending it to me! ""...it is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn't get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man."""
64,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31899143-em,4,"I actually began this book in June and read it in such fits and starts that I don’t know that I’ve retained any of it. Still I did not need to read this one aloud as I did with ‘Six Easy Pieces’ years ago. This book published ten years after his death is taken from three lectures he gave in April 1963 and is very much of the context of that time; the height of the cold war with the USSR and the fight for technological supremacy. He had some interesting thoughts about science and religion indicating that doubt is necessary for science, and while a scientist may have a religious belief, it can never be the certitude of unshakeable faith. The more scientific knowledge to which someone is exposed, the more uncertainty they will exhibit about life. The last lecture was very rambling and somewhat paranoid and indicative of that time. But he makes one of the most valid points in the last pages, which is if people come to the same conclusion or philosophical points of view from different methods and vastly disparate motivations, they shouldn’t argue which path to the same point was best or more correct. Not an easy or quick read, but well worth the time and effort."
65,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75958334-lynn,2,"The Meaning of It All might be better enjoyed as an audio adaptation considering the text is literally a transcription, complete with odd sentence structures that may be inherent with winding musings. As such, I ended up reading this aloud to myself or else I would find myself rereading the same sentence and falling asleep.The content is largely a philosophical stream of conscious, discussing the nature of the scientific mind and its role in larger society with respect to religion, politics, and everyday life. However, Feynman limits his musings to a short leash; any moment he wanders into a new topic, he doubles back and remarks that discussion will be for a different day, a different time...In the end, the material only seems to graze the surface of the meaning of it all, always inviting you to come explore the depths of the question but never seeming to take the initiative itself. Maybe it is worth reading if you are already a fan of Feynman. Maybe it is worth reading if you've never heard of Feynman. But if you decide not to, I don't think you will be missing out on much."
66,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7197098-richard,4,"The transcripts of three lectures, so the book is concise and has the informal feel of a discussion in front of a general audience.The word ""science"" has three meanings in general culture: (1) a way of finding the truth, (2) a set of wonderful discoveries, and (3) technologies. It's that first meaning that most interests him, and which he discusses in the context of our every day approach to a world that is too complicated to understand.His take on religion is reassuringly undogmatic. The scientific method is to be skeptical about everything. We *want* new ideas, so don't rule anything out. But unlike math, in which everything is true or false, there are no final certainties in science: truth is about *likelihood"", and it can be shattered with a single experiment.He *does* rip apart some ideas, like astrology for example, or certain kinds of faith healing. Don't waste your time on ideas that have internally inconsistent or conspiracy-minded ways of thinking. But he emphasizes that scientific truth comes in degrees; don't shut out anything a priori.Good advice."

The first part of the book is fascinating about Fenyman defining science and how he understand it. I feel that everyone should read this book (especially students). Doubt is fundamental to all human development and scientific inquiry. It is not about having a final answer but building on top of the existing observations. Amazed to hear Fenyman speak about it in such simple and clear words.Though there are parts in which there is overwhelming patriotism but it also shows up how Fenyman was a liberal and how he believed that freedom to choose and doubt was a principle he was ready to fight for. Criticizing that in 2017 seems childish without taking into consideration that this speech was in 1963 at the heights of cold war. But even in those it shows how Fenyman continues to maintain his logical reasoning and how he upholds the law and liberty.

The way he talks about politicians and their inability to make due on the promises is funny. The way he talks about our space agencies travels to Venus is also enlightening. These are all just a few snippets of a brilliant dude. Ok you have to read it for yourself I can’t explain it maybe you doubt this and that itself is useful. "
69,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85363466-sebastian-magri,3,"""The Meaning of It All"" is an adaption of three-part lecture set that Feynman conducted. Overall, Feynman's points are well thought out. His arguments constitute his personal beliefs and views. With all of Feynman's works, the reader can hear Feynman's unique and characteristic tone through the text. The book is a shorter read and can be read in a day or two depending on reading level. I don't know if I would recommend this as a philosophical text. There are much more ground breaking and challenging works that are out there. However, it is a great read for those who want to have a peek into the mind of someone as renowned as Feynman. There are still some stellar points that Feynman challenges the reader to. He points out the necessity and utility of doubt in the scientific community, how we aren't in as much of a scientific age as we think we are, and reveals his opinions on the relationships between religion and science.I would highly recommend to the Feynman enthusiast (such as myself), not necessarily for a lot else. But it was still a solid read."
70,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69682214-wei-lun,4,"Feynman puts on no airs and lays his thoughts bare in this short collection of the 3 lectures he gave at the University of Washington in 1963. He discusses the scientific method; how scientific findings are established with varying degrees of uncertainty that allow them to be challenged, reviewed or even upended when contrary results crop up, and how that in itself allows the dynamic refinement of our understanding of the world; how science can make no value judgments about what to do - that's up to us; the incompatibility of religion with science due to the former's (often) inherent inability to accept uncertainty; and how despite our triumphs in science and engineering we remain an unscientific age due to our tendency to take cues from anecdotes and habit.As other reviewers have alluded to, Feynman doesn't present any groundbreaking new arguments; instead we're given a refreshing reexamination of science and society from the basics."
71,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49461014-taylor-zenz,5,"Richard Feynman’s lectures are brilliant and no review or words I give could do him justice, so I leave the two most impactful quotes (for myself) from these texts below: “It [imagination in science] is unlike that of the artist. The great difficulty is in trying to imagine something that you have never seen, that is consistent in every detail with what has already been seen, and that is different from what has been thought of; furthermore, it must be definite and not a vague preposition. That is, indeed, difficult.” “If we did not desire to look in any new direction… we would not get any new ideas. There would be nothing worth checking, because we would know what is true.… I feel a responsibility to proclaim the value of this freedom, and to teach that doubt is not to be feared, but that it is to be welcomed as the possibility of a new potentiometer for human beings. If you know that you are not sure, you have a chance to improve the situation.”"

But to be honest, this book does not meet my expectation, especially when the book is titled ""The Meaning of it all"".The content of this book, to me, is not of anything extraordinary although I really enjoy Feynman's view and argument of the relation between science and religion. The ideas are presented in a down-to-earth manner and a dry tone, which is exactly how a smart scientist would respond and because this book is the script of Feynman's lectures so the wording may not that well organized compared to a book written by Feynman.It is interesting to know a distinguished scientist like Feynman on social matters, but in the scope of this book (or 3 lectures at the University of Washington), this does not impress me.

That's the main reason I love this books. I don't state here in the review that, hey, I found that and that thing interesting – most probably, your pages of interest will be different.

After not finding ""Surely You're Joking"" very interesting or insightful, I find myself disappointed in his lectures as well. The majority of his beliefs are deeply rooted in political matters and become shortsighted because of it. He seems to have had a deep hatred of anything socialist and specifically soviet and was enamoured by capitalism, considering it to almost lack flaws. He could not foresee a world in which extreme inequality would lead to regulatory capture and corporate rent-seeking to the detriment of scientific development through the collapse of public education. His beliefs and ways of looking at the world did not stand the test of time, at least that's my opinion from reading this. "

I began reading it then, but didn’t finish it. Maybe it just wasn’t the right time. I re-read it and finished it this past week, and found it to be fascinating and so helpful, exactly as it was intended by my dad’s friend. These lectures hit at the points of friction between science and religion in ways that aren’t theoretical or heady but absolutely practical: how scientists think about things differently, particularly the value of doubt and uncertainty. The only downside is that these are transcribed lectures, so you have to really concentrate to get the meaning sometimes, as his style of speaking is very informal."
76,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11858843-andrew,3,"Before reading this book, read ""Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman"" to properly understand Feynman and all of his quirks. After that you can appreciate ""The Meaning of It All"" to a fuller degree. This book is based on Feynman's lectures in 1963. Feynman brushes on topics of science, religion and other societal issues. This book lacks the same bang as other Feynman books. However, there are a few great insights and observations from Feynman in this book.  The majority of this book is captured in Feynman's other works. Sadly the editors didn't clean this book up because it was published posthumously. "

It could have been named ""The Uncertainty of It All"", as Feynman always, throughout his career, emphasized the importance of doubt and uncertainty as the driving force of science and discovery, and this book summarizes his thoughts about that. This short read is not a literary masterpiece, as some of the thoughts are a little bit unstructured, quickly jumping from one topic to another, so while reading this you'll rather have an impression of having a conversation with the author. But it's a fascinating read anyway, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in science, especially to students."
78,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75509846-matthew-to,3,"To make it more clear, this is an average of two scores, a 5 and a 2. The five is for the first two chapters, brilliantly written, informative, and thought-provoking. If those two chapters were all it's there, this book might have entered my top 10. But the last section, the 2, broke the book for me. Feynman's idea was all over the place, the flow is not natural, thus making it extra hard for anything to stick in my brain. It was, and I regret to say this, almost painfully messy, which Feynman himself admits in the start of that section. This book would've worked better if the last chapter had the edit it needs. I am sad to say but, this book does not do Feynman justice. (less) "
79,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69302379-anh-tran,3,"It's a good book but not an outstanding one, I admit that I agree with the comments saying that this is not a book that can illustrate Feynman's brilliant mind. However, it is still worth a try, due to the way the physicist gave three short and dynamic talks regarding his view on major philosophic and politic aspects of physic. Personally I like the the whole book except for the third part, it's somehow wordy and difficult to follow the what the speaker wanted to convey. What's more, though most of the ideas are now quite familiar (a long time has passed by since 1963), they are still thought-provoking and remain unanswered questions of science."
80,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586014-stacie,3,"I liked the scientist's spin on religion. He states that doubt is so important to science, because it leads to discovery. ""...it is important to doubt and doubt is not a fearful thing, but a thing of very great value."" Maybe it's in my head, but I think that implies that it should be integral to all the ways we think about the world, including religion.This book was a little hard to read because it seems like it's written word for word from his lectures, so it's not edited like books normally are. It doesn't flow as well as a book trying to make an argument. I wasn't inspired to read it, so it took me a while to get through."
81,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28709388-andrzej,4,"This my first book of R. Feynman. Yes, the form is chaotic, but some thoughts are really hitting the point. The major one is the unavoidability of doubts and uncertainty which seems to be embraced with love by scientists (or at least most of them) and ignored by religion leaders and politicians (not only totalitarian ones). Thus nobody with serious doubts can win any election. And probably this is our tragedy or at least the biggest challenge of all.Also Feynman understanding of honesty as supplying complete information on a certain topic is interesting, because it does mean that practically nobody is honest."
82,0465023940,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"These three lectures are organized around the theme “A scientist looks at society.” They were delivered in the 1960’s, after Feynman was a well-known physicist, but just before he won the Nobel Prize. These lectures are smart, and interesting, but not the place to start as an introduction to this man I think. They are transcribed directly from audio recordings of his speeches, so while they flow well, they’re not as polished as his books, or books written about the stories he has told. I actually read that he did not want these lectures published, but that they were published anyway after his death. "

Since the book is a transcription of three lectures the tone felt conversational and is a great lesson on how to transcribe dialogue to the page, since Stephen King, among others, recommends we write dialogue that mimics the way people actually speak and sound. I appreciated Feynman's observations regarding politics and the way in which Americans elect our politicians. His English professor analogy was also a hoot and got me thinking about how steeped in tradition many English professors are and how this hinders new ideas. XO. "

Even the most literate and articulate among us may not appear so when our words are transcribed, verbatim, to the page. Verbal and written communication are so different.

Some interesting points made about science methods & uncertainty, and how normal this should be in every aspect of life, a few nice phrases on freedom to improve and express ideas, a simple approach of the relation of religion and science and whether one can tell if God exists or not, many funny examples from everyday life to illustrate his points.

This is mostly a general ramble of a series of three public lectures. There are some Feynman gems (if you can’t test it, it’s not science; a discourse of faith and science - science can’t get you to morality), but overall it seems a rather extemporaneous ramble - which Feynman states at the start of the third lecture when he states he already covered what he intended in the first two lectures, but was on contract to do three.
