There is something exuberantly cathartic and empowering about releasing tension, frustration and any emotion with a string of some salty expletives! Thank you for making it official."
1,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7359586-stacee,3,"As someone who loves the f-word, I was instantly intrigued by this book. I enjoyed getting various bits of the history of swearing and seeing different scientific experiments and team building activities. I especially enjoyed the chapter on ladies who swear. There were a few sections that did get a little dry, but there was a lot of humor and the science wasn’t too overly science-y. Overall, it was an interesting topic and learning a few new words was an added bonus. **Huge thanks to WW Norton & Company for providing the arc free of charge** "
2,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65094647-dani-touch-my-spine-book-reviews,5,"I picked up this book because I honestly talk like a sailor. I say ‘fuck’ too much and it’s like a second language to me. I was raised in The South and we are taught ladies should not use foul language. Well I say, “Fuck that shit!” I loved this book because it had history and proof that swearing is good for you. I read this non fiction book in a few sittings and it was fun. To cut to the chase, this book was the shit!"

I cannot stand “fowl” language!When I finished the book, I was tempted to swearily start off to make a point but then I thought, fuck that shite for a load of old bollocks. There is no rule against profanities. There is however a request to ""Please respect other people’s views and beliefs"". I find this most peculiar. I am quite prepared to respect other people, but ""views and beliefs""? Some ""views and beliefs"" are simply not respectable. For example I cannot respect the view that women are inferior, or the belief that the moon is made of green cheese."
4,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,4,"So firstly, this was fun and liked it and I admire its enthusiasm. Any book that tries to break down the taboo veil surrounding swearing is good in my book. I do not understand the fixation that some people have about swearing, and I probably never will. But this book does a really good job laying out a general overview of, as the title tells you, why swearing is good for you.This is actually why I'm only giving it three and a half stars, because as always seems to be the case with these pop science books, I wanted more detail, more oomph. More evidence. More science and psychology. But really it's just an overview of other people's science; so as long as you know that going in, you'll have a good time. And Emma Byrne is a fun author! She swears while she's telling us about swearing and the history of studying swearing in neuroscience, psychology, animal studies, foreign languages, etc.To overview an overview, we learn that: Swearing is a natural pain reliever, prevents violence in societies that use it (both human and animal), varies from culture to culture depending on the taboos of that culture, and is very often the only remnants of language in people with brain damage because our urge to swear comes from a different place in our brains. We also learn that in other primates that learn language, they spontaneously develop swearing on their own. This was the most fascinating part of the book to me. Washoe the chimpanzee developed a taboo around being dirty (related to excretion) and began using the word dirty as a way to demean or tease others. She also developed slurs! She used the word ""monkey"" to refer to primates who couldn't sign. They once documented her calling a macaque she didn't like ""dirty monkey,"" which was Very Bad to her. I find this fascinating. Those words do not have much impact to English speakers, but to her they were the equivalent of calling someone a stupid shithead.There was also a chapter in the book covering Tourette's, which was subtitled ""Why this chapter shouldn't be in this book,"" that I also found fascinating. She included it because the perceptions people generally hold about people with the syndrome are linked directly with swearing, but really the two are tangentially related. Only about 25% of people with TS develop tics related to swearing, along with other physical and verbal tics, and the importance of those tics has nothing do with the way non-TS people use swearing. There's also a chapter about gender and swearing, and swearing in the workplace (often used to develop camaraderie! and people who can't learn the lingo are often excluded and don't remain at that workplace for long).All in all, would recommend, but it most just whetted my appetite for other books about swearing and language and science and shit. Maybe I should finally get to that audiobook copy of What the F I downloaded a couple of years ago . . . (a book which she cites as one of her sources).[3.5 stars]Read Harder Challenge 2018: A book of social science."
5,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35789244-paul,5,"This book is both screamingly funny in parts, a social science observation in parts, and compares swear words in other languages besides English. I found the chapter on Tourette's the most interesting, even if the author says it shouldn't be in the book.I've always had a really liberal vocabulary, except I will not say words that are hurtful, racist, or sexist. For 30 years I taught magazine writing at the university level, and I could never stop saying ""the f-ing table of contents is buried after the first article."" I have a slight case of Tourette's, so swearing never bothers me unless it's mean. While I was teaching, I generally got favorable reviews, except someone on Rate My Professor said, ""Beware! Curses a lot!"" along with a generally favorable review.My wife always told me it wasn't smart to swear in front of classes, but I had real trouble stopping. Just about all I ever did was use ""f-ing"" as an adjective or adverb, never to address someone. I thought it was collegial and jocular. Once I tried to specifically stop swearing in my class, and I would get into difficulties like, ""This article is an f- f-f -f really bad article."" It was very hard to stop. In the chapter on Tourette's the author says it's better to let fly than trying to suppress one's tics, because then they come out in great bunches. So I'd always tell my classes that I had a slight case of Tourette's. That went along fine for about 27 years until I had a student in my class send an anonymous email to the chairman of the journalism dept., the chairman of the college, and the president of the university. The dept. chairman called me in and said he would never say ""fuck"" in front of a class. He let me read the student's anonymous complaint about me always using the F word and how scandalized she was. The chairman couldn't tell me her name.So I was very careful to see who in this class had outed me. I found out when one girl wrote her personal experience on when she discovered Jesus. This girl's first assignment about a vividly remembered subjective experience was, ""I was in high school when I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior."" Later, on her next assignment, she interviewed Fred Farkington, of whom she said, ""Fred didn't have Jesus come into his life until he was 22."" Now, I happen to be a personal friend of Jesus, but I don't think He gives a flying F about how you talk unless you are mean to people or lie to them. So I ask, is it worse to say the F word in a class, or is it worse to be a passive-aggressive religious fundamentalist who tries to get people in trouble by projecting her righteousness on the world and pointing out where others' is lacking?I would call the religious bigot someone whom Jesus would probably like a lot less than one who says the F word in class. What if I'd been Muslim or Jewish or Hindu? I don't think that any of the major religions condemn casual swearing as much as they do murder or f-f-f-f-f-f-f---having sex with someone's wife.Anyway, this book is a great sociologist/psychologist primer on ""swear"" words and their relative content and context in various societies. It's really enlightening in that regard. I thought the best chapter was how sexism still prevailed in the area of swearing, and the norms were nearly always unwritten. The author traces some judgments about swearing to a couple of highly self-principled (in their eyes) essayists from 1600 or 1700. The main residue as a cultural tradition is that women are soft and fragile and can't bear to hear swear words without fainting, whereas men just by god tell it as they see it. This is a highly artificial standard, and one that is only encouraged by the patriarchal society.The author details research about the incidence of swearing among men and women, and found it fairly close to equal, except women were outed and implied to be sluts and ""loose women"" if they indulged in it. A woman could never swear to a superior in business, whereas for men it's just considered part of doing business. A lot of that continues today, which has nothing to do with religion and much to do with sociology: groups in power always try to maximize their power before groups who are not in power. Men have always been the power holders in American and perhaps even Western society, and they have historically liked women to be chattel or certainly weaker and lesser than themselves. No one said it had to be this way; there's no reason it should continue this way. The author points this out nicely through experiments in which the subjects are assessed for their idea of ""proper"" words to use in society. The women generally chose modified or softer words to negatively describe a person or situation, whereas the men just generally swore randomly without thinking.This was valuable to know, as well as several situations of chimpanzees signing words like ""dirty"" when they were mad at someone or another signing monkey. This seemingly natural evocation of what humans would consider swear words shows to a degree that, anthropologically, swearing just erupts.The whole book is both hilarious and fascinating. I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind."
6,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Reviewed for the Bibliophibian.Yes, really, and this really is a serious book, referring to studies and discussing them in a sober and mostly non-profane fashion. At times the casual swearing seemed a little much (a bit of a gimmick, rather than me feeling bad about swearing at all), but there’s a lot of fascinating stuff in here. There’s a chapter on Tourette’s, for example: although Byrne explains that it doesn’t really belong in a book about swearing being good for you, because in the case of Tourette’s it ends up being alienating and awful, but it goes into what causes people with Tourette’s to swear, and a little bit about what that tells us about swearing in general.There’s also a really horrifying (to me) discussion of the fact that women with cancer who swear (due to their cancer but not necessarily about their cancer) tend to lose the support of the people around them, even their close female friends. They’re dealing with something fucking horrifying, they’re probably in pain and exhausted, but they’ve got to watch their language too? I hope Byrne’s hypothesis that this effect will fade with more recent generations is correct.There’s also discussion of swearing and gender, and my favourite bit, the discussion of swearing in toilet trained chimps. (Teach a chimp that poop is dirty and it will see it as such, act ashamed if caught pooping somewhere it shouldn’t, and start using dirtiness as an insult!)It’s all pretty fascinating, and while I’m not a major swearer unless I’m doing the final missions in Mass Effect, at which point the brain to mouth filter drops out of the picture, I’m glad to acknowledge that sometimes, it turns out it really is good for you — helping you to bear pain and stress, bonding you with teammates, etc, etc."
7,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015287-molly,4,"I received access to this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. If you are looking for exciting new swears to use, this is not the book for you - especially since researchers are apparently hesitant to use the *actual* swear words patients employ when writing studies, something that is slowly turning around (thank goodness). If you are interested in how swearing helps you to withstand or alleviate pain, strengthens bonds between colleagues and teammates, or how it disparately affects men and women in social situations, though, then this *is* the book for you! I learned a lot here, and there was a bonus chapter on Tourette's syndrome that really opened my eyes to that particular condition and corrected some previous assumptions I had about its relationship to unprompted cursing. Byrne writes very accessible prose, even when she is reporting on academic studies, and that made this title much more fun than it might otherwise have been. Next time someone scolds me about my occasionally sailor-esque vocabulary, I'm hoping to have a copy of this book on hand to chuck at them. Or I'll just ramp up my swearing."
8,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61912977-kevin,2,"I hate it when I start a book that I'm looking forward too only to run into intellectually questionable assertions with no explanation of what the author means. She really ought to stick to robot science rather than delve into generalisations about culture, history, neurology, etc. I put the book down after the section entitled ""The Case of the Disappearing Cock and Ass: Notes on Transatlantic Swearing."" In this section she asserts that North Americans have trouble understanding UK swearing because of ""Genetic drift"" between ""the two cultures."" For me this assertion demands explanation because in context of the book it sounds like she is saying that culture is the result of biology. A most questionable assertion, and combined with the smugness of her hypocritical (considering that this entire book has nothing to do with her field) reply to critics detailed on page 4, as well as a few other 'wtf' type moments, I was left disinclined to finish the book. She claims to be a scientist, but takes an approach to her subject that lacks rigorous study or even a basic familiarity with what she is talking about. (ie. in her estimation, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Republic of Ireland are one culture when it comes to swearing, while the US and Canada are another. As a Canadian, to the author I say pick up a fucking history book. As a North American I say have you even noted the exponentially larger population of the USA compared to all the other nations she identified? As someone who graduated high school science I say stop taking your personal experience as an example of a general condition). Utter trash. Two stars because it has some interesting bits too, but can the author be trusted? I don't think so.Note: I didn't buy the book, it was a gift. I expressed interest after hearing bits of a radio interview promoting the book. "
9,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7382663-chris,2,"Save yourself the bother. Here's all you need to know:- Swearing increases tolerance to pain.- Swearing can be triggered by damage to specific parts of the brain.- Swearing can help teams to bond.- Chimpanzees swear.- Swearing is subtley different between males and females.- Swearing is differently nuanced in other languages.Everything else is padding and repetition.Other than that, fuck all."
10,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27819723-michele-long,4,"If you are going to ""read"" this book, I highly recommend the audiobook. I typically don't listen to audiobooks, except for the occasional 5+ hour car ride. Well let me just say, audiobook is the way to go with this one! The first half of the book was not only interesting, but was so much fun (probably more fun than I should admit) listening to a woman spewing cuss words in a British accent like it was nothing. She even eases smoothly back and forth from different languages. That alone was worth the listen. The second half is a little slower and takes more effort to listen to, as it is more about the science and studies of language and not so many cuss words themselves. However, it was still interesting to hear about the studies. I've always been the type that felt cussing had its place. I don't cuss left and right like some people I know, but I do believe certain words used in specific ways and places in our language gives a more appropriate emphasis on what we are trying to say. Cuss words have their purpose. "
11,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,3,"Surprisingly, I found Swearing is Good for You: The Amazing Science of Bad Language by Emma Byrne to be a bit of a slog. The subject matter is near and dear to my heart and the introduction is funny and promised a good read but this skinny book (201 pages minus the notes and bibliography) took forever to get through. It’s not as funny nor as interesting as I thought it would be.Byrne’s book sets out to disprove all the shit that profanity-users like myself hear about profanity: only people with low intelligence, loose morals and no imagination use “bad” words. Bullshit. I didn’t really need her book to tell me this is all nonsense because I myself am extremely intelligent, have too much imagination (usually at 3 am when the house is creaking), and my morals are just fine. The author addresses the use of profanity as a strong emotional response to pain, stress, anger, fear, joy, etc. People who have had strokes or other illnesses that damaged the brain can sometimes still communicate through swearing (even though they’re usually encouraged not to) even when all other words have left them. Profanity is also used as a way of bonding in the workplace, and not just by men. Casual insults and swearing are a sign of good teamwork; of coworkers who are comfortable with each other and work well together. The best (and by far the most fascinating for me) chapter is “You damn dirty ape”: (other) primates that swear. Byrne discusses chimpanzees who were taught sign language and created their own swear words based on what they (the chimpanzees) knew to be taboos or bad behavior. Not only did these chimpanzees create swear words, but they knew when to use them and they also passed along the sign language to younger chimpanzees who joined the family. I think my problem with this book was that, once I got into it, none of it really surprised me. Not that I’m a genius or anything, I just mean that it all seems reasonable to me. Profanity (which arises from taboo words/oaths) is extremely emotional? Well, yeah. That if you hit your thumb with a hammer instead of the nail and scream, “oh fuck!” you actually feel better because expressing your pain via emotions lessens the physical pain? Hell yeah. Why else would I yell “oh fuck!” when I’ve hurt myself? The notion that swearing in the workplace can bond you to your coworkers or is a way of gaining acceptance in the workplace culture (assuming the workplace culture enjoys a good “fuck/hell/shit/dick” once in a while) or that only colleagues who trust each other and like each other engage in casual insults and cursing is not a newsflash. At least, I don’t think so. The last chapter in the book deals with profanity and translations and how you can’t simply translate a curse word in English into the same word in, say, Italian. Taboos are a product of their culture and what may be taboo in one culture is not in another. So a powerful American English profanity may mean nothing in say, German or Japanese. The author uses the example of the movie Pulp Fiction and the problem translators had with all the “fucks” (1.74 per minute). Spanish speakers don’t use “fuck” the same way Americans do, so the translators often had to use other taboo/swear words (“Go to the devil!”). This is a great example but Byrne (weirdly) doesn’t mention if this is for Mexican Spanish speakers or Spain Spanish. The cultures are different, thus I would guess that the kind of profanity used is also different. I remember when the movie Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me came out. I read an article about how the British were somewhat taken aback by the casual American use of a word, that to them, is a fairly strong curse word. It’s like we had title the movie: The Spy Who Fucked Me. But the word “shagged” means nothing to us (unless you mean shag rugs or Shaggy of Scooby-Doo fame) so the MPAA (those censorship assholes) gave the film title a big thumbs up. But none of this is a revelation to me. It’s not that I’ve ever sat down and deliberately pondered it, it’s just that (like much of the book) when I’m reading it I’m thinking, well, duh, yeah. Generally the book is informative and interesting, but not surprising (except for the chimpanzees—that was an eye-opener and I want to read more on the subject). Maybe it’s because I’ve taken classes in linguistics and this knowledge was just sitting in my brain waiting to be revived? Or because it all seems so reasonable that I’ve never really thought about it? I will bitch about some stuff that irritated me. One thing to remember for the American reader is that this is a British author discussing (mostly) British culture and (a lot of) British culture-based research. If this were a book about chemistry, that possibly wouldn’t matter but as she often uses examples based on (British) culture, it is relevant. American culture and British culture are very different. When she makes somewhat generic statements about profanity and taboos and culture, does she mean only British culture? That’s difficult to know. In her chapter on gender and swearing, Byrne writes: “Sometime around the early eighteenth century there was a significant change in culture” (145). Does she mean ONLY British culture? It’s not clear, but as she is British, I’d guess that’s so. Does this mean her statement (hell, the whole chapter) is accurate for ONLY British culture? Tough to know. She also writes sentences like this: “Some words make for terrific indicators of social difference: think of the class and age distinctions in England that underlie the difference between ‘mum’ and ‘mummy’” (155). Um…I’m American. I have no fucking clue. I mention this only because the book was sold without it being identified as a British book, which makes a difference for American (and probably other cultures) readers. However (and I find this really weird), the American (?) publishers changed any mention of “football” to “soccer,” even though the whole book itself is very British-y. I disliked the entire chapter about Tourette’s Syndrome which she subtitled “Why This Chapter Shouldn’t be in This Book.” She’s right, it shouldn’t be. People afflicted with TS use profanity against their will; they do not have involuntary movements or sounds, those outbursts are unvoluntary—that is, they don’t want to make them but can’t control them. Profanity is shouted because it is deeply emotional, but the person shouting does not want to use the profanity at all. So while I could understand her briefly mentioning TS, it doesn’t deserve a whole chapter. She included it as an excuse to lecture readers about TS and how awful it is and how we (the ignorant, unfeeling public) should not mock or abuse someone afflicted with TS. I agree with what she’s saying but how she says it pisses me off. The last paragraph is very “let’s shame the reader into being more tolerant” and condescending.The only major mention of American swearing culture is a trip she took to Illinois to interview some pursed lip, tight-assed, prissy misogynist named James V. O’Connor, founder of the Cuss Control Academy. This linguistic Puritan delivers speeches around the country to corporations and schools about how not to swear. Why is swearing such an epidemic now (vs. being an ongoing problem)? Guess…c’mon…who’s the culprit here? Why, women of course! His list: the civil rights movement, the antiwar movement, women’s liberation, women entering the workplace…really, the guy is no different than any other old white guy bigot misogynist. His nostalgia for a “simpler” and more “respectable” time is when white men ruled and nothing stood in their way. And isn’t that the point? The author is a chicken and does not call him out on his clean-talking campaign for what it is (she “scurries” home) and not only that, she doesn’t even call him out in her own fucking book. Byrne, you’re a wuss. She also overuses the word “jocular.” It’s everywhere. Maybe it’s a favorite of the British, but every time I read it I thought of Father Mulcahy of M*A*S*H: “Jocularity! Jocularity!”My only other complaint (I guess I had a lot of them) is the section dividers. For a book about profanity, you’d think the design department could come up with something more creative than a single exclamation mark (!) to separate sections. How boring. At least use all of the profanity symbols: #$!&@.Swearing is Good For You but I don’t need this book to tell me so. This is mildly interesting and somewhat amusing, but Emma Byrne is a poor woman’s Mary Roach. Go find a Mary Roach book (she’s a science writer) and I’m sure you’ll agree."
12,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32598115-becky,5,This is the most hilarious book chock-full of f*cking awesome stories about swearing and human nature. Spontaneous swearing with chimps to a scary as h*ll brain injury this was a wild ride that I didn't want to put down.
13,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10646666-kat,4,"Thank you to Netgalley and W. W. Norton & Company for an E-ARC of this novel.I must say I didn't give this book much credit before I read it because 1) new author (always skeptical) and 2) the title seemed a little hard to believe. Emma Byrne does an excellent job on making a case for the science behind bad language. The history of swearing and how is benefits our health is quite incredible. Byrne states in her novel that ""swearing has helped to develop the field of neurosciences through studies of emotions and the human brain"". It is a fascinating book filled with great history, swears, and information. I would recommend this read, but only to adults. ;) I think a lot of Christians will turn away from the title, as might I have, but I have a degree in Social Sciences. I found it thought provoking and insightful from a scholarly point of view. Emma Byrne has created a book for English, Psych, Sociology majors that is a great introspect to the human behavior. I think mainstream readers will like it because not only is it funny, but her history of swearing as a language is quite fascinating. "
14,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946844-amy,5,"Swearing is Good for You is a book on the many largely unknown and underappreciated aspects of swearing and it's adjacent fields of study. The chapters are mostly standalones tied together by the overall theme of the book, and I especially liked the chapters swearing and pain (chapter 2), primate studies and how chimpanzees invented swearing in sign (chapter 5), and the cross cultural study of swearing as a expression of emotion (chapter 7) because the information was compeltely new to me. Not that the other chapters weren't, bit these three top the list of favorites due to their subject matter and the fact that the other chapters had info that I was at least passingly familiar with. Overall, Swearing is Good for You is an excellent overview of the importance and function of swearing as a part of language, one that is well written and put together with accesibility for a general audience in mind. It is a book that I have recommended."
15,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27043120-candice,5,"“Swearing is Good for You” surpasses simple humor or personal validation. Emma Byrne has included chapters on; neuroscience, pain perception, Tourette’s syndrome, workplace swearing, other primates that swear, gender differences and swearing in other languages. I found her book thorough and well-written. My favorite part of the book is her explanation of British cursing. I will now have a much greater appreciation for BBC television programs! "
16,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48826495-dcorney,5,"I really enjoyed reading this - it's a nice mix funny anecdotes and clear examples of recent research about swearing, from neuroscience, workplace studies, gender studies and so on. I loved the explanations of why we swear (such as avoiding violence, team-bonding) that go beyond just describing how people swear."
17,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10436570-perry,4,"Excellent book on the power and utility of swearing. I gave swearing up for awhile when I thought ""go away"" and ""nonsense"" were as good as F-off and BS, but there is power in the swears."
18,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62296346-emma-gerts,4,"This was a delightful and interesting read, as I had hoped. Byrne's fluent, friendly tone is easy to read without feeling patronising or less rigorously scientific for it. She's clearly passionate about the social and neurological implications of swearing, and this runs the gamut from swearing as relief for physical and mental pain, as a social lubricant and tool of bonding, to the social and cultural differences between swearing in different languages and cultures and what it says about us. Her chapter of gender-based swearing was particularly interesting, as were the experiments she discussed regarding the value of swearing as pain relief. I was also delighted by her break down of popular movies based on the 'fpm' or 'fucks per minute'. While this book could have easily been gratuitous, clikcbait style science, it was genuinely fun while also being engaging and informative. The lack of censorship of the various swears included was also a refreshing change from having everything bleeped out. Overall this was a really interesting read! I can recommend for anyone who's interested in language and culture, as long as you aren't prudish about a few fucks. "
19,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40442871-s-c-worrall,5,"This is a really funny, and clever, book. I recently had the pleasure to interview the author, Emma Byrne, for National Geographic's weekly column, Book Talk. And as Emma shows in her book, Swearing Is Good for You: The Amazing Science of Bad Language, far from being simply lazy language or an abusive lapse in civility, new research reveals that profanity has many positive virtues, from promoting trust and teamwork in the office to increasing our tolerance to pain."

Mostly, it validated my (occasional to moderate) swearing. "

26,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31959466-lc,4,Bloody hilarious and fucking fascinating. 
27,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21404055-heather-caliri,4,"This is a fascinating book--chock full of surprising research that uses swearing (a convenient inroads into our psyche and emotions) to reveal the inner workings of our brains. I appreciated the demystifying of what swearing is, and how it relates to gender, camraderie, and mental function. Still, I found myself unconvinced of Byrne's primary thesis, summed up in her title. I wished she'd explored some of the darker sides of foul language, like how its blunt edges are used by abusive people. I found myself wondering how victims in the #metoo movement see the swearing and crudity of the people who injured them. I don't find swearing generally offensive, but when it's used as aggression, or to make a work situation turn toxic, I don't think it's by accident. I wished Byrne had looked a little past the surface of how swearing functions and broken down whether or not the actual cuss words are what make abuse happen through speech."
28,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2377700-alisse,5,"This brief little book wasn’t just a list of creative ways to swear—which I would have enjoyed—but instead was a fascinating collection of social psychology and neuroscience research about how swearing affects us. Turns out, pretty profoundly (not surprised). And it IS good for you....unless you’re a woman and you’re being judged by your swearing. But the author, a woman in a man’s field, says to lean into it. Make it less taboo. But not so commonplace that it loses its impact. Oh, it also had some hilarious lists and charts of swear words. So still very very funny (and sarcastic, and British). "

A little bit of neuroscience, psychology, sociology, history, and linguistics, written in such a way as to be accessible to folks who don't study those fields. Being a popular-science book, you'll learn plenty but it won't be so dense as to bore or confuse you! This read was quick, easy, and abso-fucking-lutely worth the time."

Then it moved to a few chapters that I thought would be more social commentary but instead went back in history. I am not shitting you. Save yourself some time and just watch a Dave Chappelle show and laugh your swearing ass off!

Felt like this book was not cohesive, there were too many different things being discussed. There were some very intriguing topics, I did enjoy bits and parts of this book, but overall I felt as if I was reading multiple essays written about entirely different subjects rather than an actual book by one author. Maybe that’s what she wanted the book to be, but it was just not for me. "
42,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/431213-anne,3,"This was a bit of a mixed bag for me. The general tone and topic were incredibly entertaining; I really enjoyed learning about the parts of the brain underlying swearing behavior, the gender differences in swearing, and even the cultural differences. And, yes, I definitely enjoyed how the author peppered delightful swear words throughout. But sometimes it seemed like she was stretching from swearing to behaviors, albeit swearing-based ones, far beyond swearing. In fact, she came right out and said the chapter on Tourette's Syndrome didn't belong because the causes of swearing for sufferers of that are unrelated to swearing behavior for non-sufferers (I took that as permission to just skip the chapter). And I almost stopped reading the book in the swearing in the workplace chapter, which wasn't so much about swearing as it was a glorification of hostile work environments (buy hey, I'm from the U.S., perhaps what I consider to be a hostile workplace is swell place to work in the U.K.).Overall, I'm happy I read it - it was a quick and easy read. I just wish I was able to like it more."
43,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13146648-stacey-roach,2,"2.5 The title and comparison to Mary Roach was intriguing but the content fell short. I felt like I was often reading a lit review of linguistic and psycholinguistic studies that didn’t really pertain to swearing at all. Byrne tends to regurgitate information from these studies without providing how they correlate to swearing until the last paragraph of the chapter. More case studies and personal interviews with researchers (a la Mary Roach) would have made the book much more enjoyable. That said, I loved the chapter about the chimps- likely because there was something to connect to. Though I didn’t love the book, I do appreciate receiving this book as a free ARC on goodreads giveaway. "

It never really became clear to me why swearing is good for you, which I was hopeful of because I participate now and again.

47,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1070689-laurla2,5,"--I enjoyed this book.""swearing makes the heart beat faster and primes us to think aggressive thoughts while, paradoxically, making us less likely to be physically violent.""""in an experiment, volunteers held their hands in ice water and were allowed one swear word and one neutral word describing a table, chose randomly from a list of five. while swearing, volunteers could keep their hands in the water nearly half as long again as when they used their table-based adjectives. not only that, but while they were swearing the volunteers' heart rates went up and their perception of pain went down. in other words, the volunteers experienced LESS pain while swearing. its an easy experiment to try for yourself at home.""""in aphasic patients (inability to comprehend and formulate language because of damage to specific brain regions) a professor noted that they could swear far more easily than they (patients) could manage any of the other words they tried to use, that the swearing was fluent and easy to understand while his other speech was slurred and strained. a patient could communicate, under the right conditions, using swearing as a gateway to other forms of expression. this really depressing swearing is the one remaining means of communication that can be used by people who have suffered a massive and life changing illness or injury. but rather than encourage them to use what little language they have left, the emphasis is still on teaching stroke victims to control their swearing. essentially silencing what's left of these patients' voices because of our own strong feelings about strong language. """"fluency with swearing, knowing when to swear and when not to swear, is positively correlated with fluency in language overall. contrary to popular belief, people who can confidently use the widest range of vocabulary also tend to know and deploy the most swear words.""""research shows that we are still a lot more judgmental of women who use taboo language than we are of men. but this double standard is relatively new. sometime around the early eighteenth century there was a significant change in culture. male and female language began to undergo a shift that can best be described as power for men vs purity for women."" ""so much of the way we judge women's language, and their behavior, still rests on the antiquated double standards of a handful of long-dead churchmen.""-when women swear they tend to do so for the same reasons that men do. but discovering that women do, in fact, swear has perplexed some researchers. while there hasn't been a study to look specifically at the reasons why MEN swear, womens swearing seems to have demanded an explanation.-translating profanity is challenging. in English, fuck can be used as a verb (fuck you), adjective (its fucked), noun (I don't give a fuck), and either literally (we fucked), figuratively (don't fuck with me), or as an interjection on its own (FUCK!). in Spanish however, there is no single word that can form such feats of lexical gymnastics. the translator has to inject a much wider variety of vocabulary into the script."
48,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11462078-anne,5,"Okay so first you need to know that I read anything I can get my hands on about how swearing works in the brain. So even though I didn’t know about this book before I got it for Christmas it was a perfect fit for me. Second, I learned a lot of things in this book that other reading on the topic hadn’t taught me. For example, there’s an entire chapter on Tourette’s, how it works, and why it really doesn’t fit with the rest of the content of this book because cursing as part of a tic doesn’t behave like any other kind of cursing. I also learned a ton about how fluency in secondary languages doesn’t necessarily translate to emotional impact — unless you were learning some other aspect of emotional impact (such as the angst of being an adolescent) at the same time you were immersed in your second language. This directly impacts how and in what language you swear. The book is barely 200 pages and covered neuroscience, pain management, Tourette’s, workplace swearing, chimpanzee swearing, gender and swearing, and swearing in other languages. It does not cover any particular case or topic in depth but rather serves as a well-written and intriguing survey of modern knowledge about the field. Considering that in most cultures the taboos around swearing extend to studying the taboos around swearing, the very presence of the book indicates both shifting cultural norms and the fact that we still have a lot to learn. I loved this book and recommend it to anyone with interests in linguistics or neuroscience or both. "
49,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14766521-peter-dickerson,5,"I finally finished reading this book. Swearing is Good for You, The Amazing Science of Bad Language, 2017, Emma Byrne, 201 pgs. The cover caught my attention, and I was interested in whether it would tell me whether I swear too much or at the wrong times?It is an academic analysis of swearing, using taboo language, and the difference in use between genders, languages, and cultures. The discussion of the Washoe Project was fascinating and horrifying. The analysis or our use of swearing is interesting, important, relevant, and answers a number of questions. Swearing does affect us all. Two quotes that I did like were as follows:‘When I was about nine years old, I was smacked for calling my brother a ‘twat’. I had no idea what a twat was - I thought it was just a silly way of saying ‘twit’ - but that smack taught me that some words are more powerful than others and that I had to be careful how I used them’ (p. 1). ‘Research shows that women are using swearing and other equally powerful forms of language more effectively than ever, but that same research shows that doing so still comes at a greater social risk for women: a man swearing is more likely to be seen as jocular or strong; women are likely to be seen as unstable or untrustworthy. To which I can only ask: where the fuck did this bullshit come from?’ (P. 147)."
50,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"Damn, this is an interesting book.Byrne looks into the history and psychology of swearing. She's quite funny and not afraid to toss an f-bomb here and there.Chapters include the neuroscience of swearing, swearing as it relates to pain (it helps!), gender differences in swearing, workplace swearing, and Tourette's syndrome. My favorite chapters looked at how apes that are taught to communicate by signing manage to invent swearing on their own. And the final chapter on swearing in other languages was quite interesting. Sometimes, it seems, we swear more easily in our native tongue -- but in other situations, a second language fits the bill.The major insight I learned from this book is how basic and primal swearing is, lodged deep in the emotion centers of our brain and an absolutely integral part of human communication. Also, it happened that while I was reading, an episode of The Allusionist popped up in my podcast app featuring an interview with Byrne about this book."
51,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467189-suep,3,"I am a swearer. I practice daily while driving. I keep both hands on the wheel, stare straight ahead, practice the ‘mindfulness’ half-smile, and let’er rip. I cause no harm. No one knows. I’m a secret swearer, in the car. I warn people that ride with me about my habit. They all chuckle, at first, then they become very quiet. I feel bad but it’s better for me to let out the words then to attempt to show stupid drivers they are stupid by driving just like them. So, naturally I was attracted to this book by its title and cover. Yes. I do judge books by the cover. Don’t say you don’t. Anyways, swearing is good for you and we still have a long way to go. It helps increase pain tolerance, isn’t as acceptable by women of a more mature age, is bonding, is different in different countries, blah blah blah. I was all into this book and then, like a good swear word overused, it lost its punch. So, I’ll just say it’s a good book. Full of .... research, you thought I was going to say *hit, huh? Come on, give me some credit. I’m not driving. "
52,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534197-liz,3,"Unique, passionate personal study made into a shorter length book. The author sits firmly on side of swearing is good and has purpose in language. “Swearing is like mustard; a great ingredient but a lousy meal.” Utilizing numerous research studies and linguistic studies she dives into several angles and questions of swearing, including quite a few examples across different languages/cultures. While I found several points quite interesting and thought provoking, I’m not sure all would enjoy this book hence the lower stars. She is a bit repetitive and rambling in her points, but I can appreciate the breadth of research she put in to argue her various points. Chapter 1 on the neuroscience of swearing was fascinating. The emotional connections to swearing are a key piece to her arguments that we need swearing. Chapter 2 on pain and swearing was hilarious since many studies in this arena are done with pregnant women; who else would voluntarily be subjected to pain? Pain tolerance goes up with swearing. "
53,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67946357-or,4,"I bet a title idea for the book at one point was ""Swear! What is good for? Absolutely something"". It's a book about swearing, when it started, why, who swears, swearing in languages other than English, swearing among animals, translation of swearing and so on.I'm not much of a swearer, if at all, so I couldn't really relate to all the research mentioned in the book that's supposed to explain why swearing is good for me (even if done intentionally for the benefits of swearing). I don't mind swear words, but I really don't like it when they're directed at people just to hurt them. However, I was still very interested by some parts of the book, especially the parts about translation of swearing in movies and swearing among animals. Psychology research was also rather interesting at times.I listened to the audiobook and I liked the narration. However, some parts were a bit hard for me to follow when I was listening while doing other things. That's probably just my own limitation. Dagnabbit!"
54,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5863803-amy,4,"This book gives a great deal of insight into the world of swearing. It was quite interesting, and informative. The introduction includes the most swearing for swearing's sake, but it appears to be simply for impact and humor, and in my opinion is not over done. The rest of the book gives you a truly unique look at swearing from what part of the brain it appears to come from, how it affects the body's ability to handle situations like pain, stress, and even deal with social interactions. It also looks at how swearing seems to be a natural part of communication, even though it differs from culture to culture. If you enjoy learning/hearing about the ways such a normal part of society and language has been studied through out the years this is the book for you. If you just enjoy swearing this is also the book for you. "
55,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34502206-sarina,3,"This book holds an illuminating look into swearing: why we do it, how it benefits us, how it's used by chimpanzees, how it's used by people of different genders, etc. I come from a family who uses a swear jar. It doesn't really prevent any of us from swearing at home, however. Maybe with the help of this book, we will finally be able to accept what comes naturally to us, from my younger sister swearing while playing Super Mario Bros to my Mom swearing sparingly to add intensity to what she is saying.My only concern with this book is a statement given towards the beginning of the book along the lines that the difference in swearing between British and American cultures is due to genetic drift. I need more information and research to back up this claim. The copy I own is an ARC I won, so perhaps Byrne elaborates further in the final copy. "
56,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54657-christine,1,"So, this book does not deliver on the title. You will not learn why swearing is good for you or how it could improve your life except maybe a dribble of information here or there—and you will need to make the connections yourself.For an academic trade book, it does flow well and isn’t overly long. However, the topics seem poorly thought out—a friend even noticed that the author said there was a chapter where it even said that the information really wasn’t germane to the book—and the author included those 25 pages anyhow (excellent find, Janet!).The one takeaway that I think would be helpful to modern society is this: let’s educate the public on how strikes can change people, including their language. If you had the choice to hear a loved one cuss, or to never hear their voice again, ever, you can guess what I would pick. "
57,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1961193-tim-atkinson,4,"Well, well, who would've thought it? When you hit your thumb with a hammer and say 'fuck' or something similar, that four-letter word isn't just letting off steam or expressing your frustration... it's defeating your pain. That's pretty much the fucking bottom line of this fascinating book. Because the science it explains entertainingly and amusingly boils down to the fact that the emotive power of swear words seems to trigger a physical response deep in our brains that chemically reduces pain. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! It's fucking brilliant! But, a word of fucking caution. Little and often is the key. The words have to pack an emotional punch (which is why swearing in your native language for is most effective) and the pain-killing effects can wear off if you swear too much. You have been fucking warned!"
58,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46807078-karen,3,"2.5 starsThis was OK. I love the premise (and I generally love popular science books about everyday things), but I think the execution fell flat.The author has assembled an interesting selection of case studies and anecdotes but I don't think her overarching argument was very compelling. I've found the book surprisingly difficult to get through, compared to other books on popular science (perhaps because she is, first and foremost, a scientist rather than a writer; I may be a bit unfair comparing her to someone like Mary Roach, still my gold standard).I found it telling that for me, the most interesting part of the book was about research into how chimpanzees acquire human language (which was not really about swearing at all). In fact, I then went and bought a copy of Next of Kin by Roger Fouts, to find out more about that story."
59,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20142720-patrick-walsh,4,"Some months ago I borrowed a copy of a contemporary novel from the local library. The story had been made into a movie, but by the time I decided it might be worth seeing it had already ended its run in the theaters. I decided to read the book. I couldn’t get past the first page. I didn’t really make it past the first sentence. It contained a word that is still censored in broadcast media and print news sources but that is common in social media. So I closed the book and returned it to the library.I could have gotten past the profanity, and in hindsight it might have been a good book to read in spite of that feature. I have recently read many other things that are laced with profanity, including The Hate U Give. The next book up in my to-read list is The Catcher in the Rye.About the same time as I decided not to read the novel mentioned in the first paragraph, I became aware of Emma Byrne’s Swearing Is Good for You. It is quite readable and enjoyable. I have no grounds on which to question the validity of the research cited therein and I won’t attempt to do so, but I have concerns and Byrne gets to them early on.On page 5 she writes, “Is this book simply an attempt to justify rudeness and aggression? Not at all. I certainly wouldn’t want profanity to become commonplace; swearing needs to maintain its emotional impact in order to be effective.” Profanity is already commonplace in social media, in subscription-based entertainment, and in everyday conversation in some circles. That ship has sailed, and in some respects this book shovels coal into the boiler.Dr. Byrne makes the point that swearing can act as a pressure-release valve, helping the user avoid violence in circumstances where anger and frustration have created the urge to act out. That is a worthy goal for any ethically sound behavior, but I wonder if swearing is still up to the task given how freely it is used. Efforts to restore civility to public speech and private conversation might be just as effective in this age of extreme polarization and aggression.Dr. Byrne also argues that swearing can help new employees fit in, especially where in situations where they might struggle for acceptance by their coworkers because of gender bias. I can’t argue with this. In my industry gender equality is well established; no new employee should ever struggle for acceptance because of gender bias. My industry may be exceptional in that regard.Neither can I argue against Dr. Byrne’s point that swearing can help alleviate physical or emotional pain. More on this in a bit.With regard to gender and swearing, Dr. Byrne confronts efforts by one James V. O’Connor, a writer and motivational speaker who went on a crusade to rid the workplace of foul language. Mr. O’Connor observed this about women entering the workforce in greater numbers in the 1950s and 1960s: “[T]hey had to be one of the guys; they had to act like men, dress like men, wear suits and everything else, and try to talk tough, and they thought this had to include swearing.” (p. 100) Dr. Byrne responds with this question: “Is this what the fight against swearing comes down to? A nostalgia for a simpler, happier time? There are so many questions that I want to ask him about the points he’s just made, but his courteous certainty makes me lose my nerve. I thank him, wish him all the best, and scurry back to the twenty-first century, where language might be casual but at least I get to wear trousers if I want to.” That’s an interesting notion, and it’s not difficult to find people who yearn for simpler, happier times. But it’s not necessarily what an objection to swearing is about.I question the need for swearing on the merits. Why do we need to swear? Why can’t we control the urge to swear as we would control the urge to hit other people when we are angry, or the urge to get in a car when we’re drunk and our reasoning faculties are compromised? We control the urge to steal from others, to cheat on our taxes, and to cheat on our spouses. Can’t we exercise some restraint in our speech as well, even when swearing might relieve momentary pain or anger?Consider, also, what great resources we have to use in the place of foul language. The English language is so rich in vocabulary, borrowed from many other languages. Metaphors for expressing anger, frustration, sorrow, and pain have filled our literature for centuries. Surely we can find and make use of them with a little effort.I challenge readers to think, too, of the countless hours of thoughtful broadcast-medium programming that are filled with content that cannot, because of government regulations, include certain words. We’ve created mechanisms for keeping swearing out of that environment. Even sports broadcasting must be free from foul language. Why must it be a large and growing part of everyday speech in other environments, especially social media, where it seems to be a means of establishing or maintaining credibility with certain audiences? I would submit that it does not need to be.This is not an argument for greater censorship of speech, except perhaps for self-censorship. Free speech is a pillar of a free society. Nor is this an attempt to denigrate Dr. Byrne or run down her thoughtful, well-researched book. It is an attempt to say that we for whom English is a first language have adopted swearing as a normal and even normative part of our communication. To our harm. We can do better than simply accepting that."
60,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5093580-psb,4,"I knew it!Years ago an immigrant friend of mine confided that her favorite thing about English was its swear words. No one in polite society in Eastern Europe would swear. There, swearing was limited to animal body parts and your mother. It was foul. But in the United States, cuss words were flexible and disposable, if not exactly non-sensical. Tossed about as punctuation and imminently useful, they expand our ability to express ourselves. And not in a bad way. In the 21st century English has replaced French (which replaced Latin which replaced Greek) as the universal language. The subtext of this book could be that using English swear words also opens up universal emoting, perhaps another reason for the cultural backlash against the Americanization of the world. "
61,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870014-kaija,2,"While the content of this book is really interesting, I had a hard time getting through it. If it had been a little less . . . second year psychology textbook it might have been great. I also found it funny that the author didn't write some swear words, especially in the first half of the book. She would allude to them, but not write them out. Later in the book, she'd write them down, but I find out odd that in a book about swearing, even she found a few times not to swear.I loved reading the differences regarding swearing and where people are from. I might have been willing to read a whole book on that! Also, learning that chipamzee's will create their own swear words (and usually have it to do with shit) was really interesting. "
62,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57791161-susan-roberts,2,"Meh. This book promises more than it actually delivers. I appreciate her humor, and there are some fascinating bits about neuroscience and linguistics - I could read about poor ol Phineas Gage all day, and how primates swear, and how different it is to swear in a language other than your mother tongue. But I found most of the book lacked cohesiveness and I had a hard time keeping my mind from wandering. The chapter about Tourette’s was unbearably long for a chapter that wasn’t even supposed to be in the book. As a nice southern girl who uses only the occasional mild profanity, seeing so many “bad” words in print was pretty jarring. Many of them were used for humor, but most of them were gratuitous. I guess I expected the text to be a bit more scholarly. "
63,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12380195-carl,4,"an impassioned funny, at times sarcastic, scientifically rigorous defense of swearing. Not as a means of rudeness and aggression but as a necessary release valve for the pressures of life as well as a means of acceptance and team building.Bynre here uses scientific studies on the efficacy of swearing as well the ever changing breakdown of gender usage of ""bad"" language ( not just boy's fun anymore) as starting point for an irreverent and exuberant discussion as to why swearing makes us more civilized and less aggressive both as individuals and as a species.Well worth your fucking time!"
64,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9144468-wendy,3,"I was curious about the book... the title certainly caught my interest. Like many people I admit to having the belief that ""sometimes, you just have to swear"". Byrne covers the research she has found and gives evidence that swearing has been part of many oral traditions and cultures forever! It seems that there are definite benefits to swearing... but I think in moderation.While it might be acceptable in some moments I do find it upsetting to be in public and hearing cursing and swearing every second word in some people's conversations. Byrne challenges the reader's comfort with swearing... through a text that was quick to get through.It satisfied my curiosity about the subject."
65,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136066-casey,4,"This book falls somewhere within the 3.5 star range for me. I really (fucking) liked the subject matter and the range of topics she covered about swearing, from the differences in languages and gender usage to swearing's association with emotion and pain. However, as some have noted, there are passages that get a bit dry, and I think Byrne did herself a disservice dedicating an entire chapter to Tourette's and arguing why the chapter didn't belong in the book. Don't make a critic's job easier! Still, I found Byrne to be a charming writer with a good sense of humor and personality, and I'd like to read more from her."

Several considerations are very interesting - about the differences between swearing in different languages, about swearing vs individual's vocabulary's breadth, whether animals swear at all, swearing in the context of the gender. There's also a chapter about Tourette's Syndrome, which dives deeper into neuro-anatomic details, but I didn't find it very interesting.To summarize: nice read, but wasn't really revealing. 3.5-4 stars. I was leaning towards the higher boundary because I haven't seen any good (& approchable) books on the topic."

There's a strong focus on native language vs secondary or ""step mother languages"" and how the speaker feels swearing in that tongue. Also there's a bunch of gender comparisons with swearing. The parts I found the most interesting was when Byrne would go into details about the different experiments that researchers would do in relation to swearing as well as when she had some of her volunteers give their background. It's not dry, but given the subject, I honestly expected it to be a bit more entertaining. "

Surprisingly his fans love this kind of low/ no class sex jokes.I feel very shocked to see nowadays the young people think talking only about nonsense and mocking about sex ability became mainstream. I even took time to listen longer or checked what he posted.If swearing is the only thing a person could show, that is no wonder we human beings are the failed species. "

The mother-son book discussion however was fantastic--in having us think about a number of things and learn some new words and their context. Bugger that. But also I appreciated that Colin's choice of this book was to give him some ""leverage"" for his communication choices, but he didn't find the type of support he was hoping for, yet we had some F...ing good dialogue:)"
70,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354383-angela,3,"The title is a bit of a misnomer; though all chapters are tangentially related to swearing, only a tiny portion of the book addresses whether swearing is, in fact, ""good for you."" Byrne takes a closer look at brain function and language, the science of Tourette's Syndrome, swearing in chimpanzees, and multiple studies on swearing in the workplace, swearing across genders, and swearing one's native tongue versus a language acquired later in life. She does an admirable job of translating the most technical bits for the layperson, and does her best to insert humor into the work, but it does occasionally suffer from repetition of ideas and studies so similar as to blur together."

But when I moved to New Zealand, women particularly, would physically jump back when I spoke, unaccustomed to all the shits and fucks being thrown at them. I began to get a complex. Reading Dr. Byrne’s funny but serious research on swearing points out that swearing is a sign of intelligence, so there! “I can assure you that swearing can be intelligent and powerful, that swearing is socially and emotionally essential.” You’re the shit Dr. Byrne!"

She breaks her extensive research into easily digestible parts and stories to make it easier to understand and follow along. That's what I like about it.

There was more humor and linguistic knowledge than I expected which is why it read so well. What I also did not anticipate, and I should have, is how much insight this has given me, as a sign language Interpreter. I found the research of chimps being taught sign language fascinating. The last chapter was a wonderful way to wrap up the book because it really made me think about cursing in sign and interpreting swearing in a much more informed way. Gonna recommend this to all my interpreting friends!"

She breaks it down into the “big four” types of swears: religious, copulatory, excretory, and slur-based. There’s a lot of research and experiments to back up her theory that Swearing is Good for You. It was a little too scientific for me, but I did find it interesting that there was enough information for 201 pages about swearing and how our brains work. "
79,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5269788-aarica,3,"Overall I enjoyed the book. It was lighthearted and had a lot of science to back up many of the points.

Overall I enjoyed it, but wouldn't read again. I would give it a 3.5 if half starts were available. Emma is funny in her writing, I hear the audiobook is also really good.

She is an excellent tour guide on this jaunt, casually dropping a swear word or two here and there to make her point as she relates the information and her viewpoints as if the reader were an old friend. I thoroughly enjoyed this narrative approach. "

Unfortunately, the episode (no. 74: Take a Swear Pill) was so much more dynamic and delightful than this book. I enjoyed the information, but I found the writing to be lackluster.

I found the content disjointed and at times straying too far from the subject matter: breadth without depth. Some chapters are better than others, but overall, too much cataloging of studies without overarching analysis of what they mean. And it's surprisingly dry, despite the author's throwing in swears and jokes here and there—that's not enough to make the writing engrossing.

286,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41606662-helen,4,"A fascinating look into the psychology of swearing. There's a lot of material and research here - I felt like you'd need to read this a couple of times to allow everything to sink in. Who knew that signing chimpanzees could instinctively learn how to swear, and the neuroscience research into the link between Tourette's and socially unacceptable swear words?"
287,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76104368-hubert,3,Quite holistic exploration of the benefits of cursing. Interesting arguments and lots of relevant facts. At moments seems to be a bit biased. Definitely an engaging read. Especially the cited differences between genders and geographies.
288,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54623815-maggie-pinnick,4,"This book was well done and the audio was very entertaining. My favorite part, and what I wished they talked more about, were how monkeys and apes were internalizing some of our taboos when learning to sign. "
289,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17020246-lisa-bricker,4,"YAY!!! I laughed out loud repeatedly, but what I really loved was her science. She cited studies and explained methodologies and limitations. She explained so well exactly what was being studied and I couldn't resist reading about it! And laughing. FUCK YEAH!"
290,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15651124-stephanie,3,"This type of thinking is one of my favorite soap boxes. While it does take a while to get over the sophomoric giggle response at every little language bomb, the work as a whole is tasteful and well thought out. "
291,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86317810-matthew-hurst,4,This is a must read for anyone who thinks swearing damages your argument an absolute stunner of a book that touches on the science of swearing and keeps you hooked throughout the pages.When used for impact swearing is emotionally right.
292,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23186126-sarah,4,Author has great sarcastic sense of humour. Content and examples very accessible (not always easy when discussing brain function or large studies). Nice light read. I learned a lot about myself and my potty mouth. 
293,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60233766-kathleen-lamorelle,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It’s pretty fascinating, especially if you like Social Science and language. The author spends just the right amount of time on each topic and mixes in good humor. Give it a read already, for *uck’s sake!"
294,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10270710-sarah,5,"Fascinating popular-level survey of the existing scientific research on swearing; why we do it, it's effects on pain, it's interaction with emotions, it's social implications, etc. Worth the time to read."
295,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3179672-marzena,4,"Oh that was fun! I only regret not reading it in English as I might have missed some nuances in used swearwods. Def worth reading for the last chapters dealing with gender and cultural/linguistic diference in swearing.Also, such a thorough research! ♥ "
296,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3437808-melissa,3,Very interesting insights into some of the recent evolution of swearing.
297,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3089566-clacie,3,Got a little slow in places but other than that it was fucking great!
298,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22984028-theresa-hildebrand,2,"Interesting, but no great shakes. I enjoyed the chapter about the chimpanzees learning sign language & eventually learning to swear. "
299,0393356655,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1350635-marina,3,"Interesting enough. I wouldn't go so far as to say that the science was ""amazing"" but it was I found it engaging. "
