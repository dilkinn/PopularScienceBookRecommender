Not because it is a bad book, boring or not well-written, but because it turns out that my appetite for evolutionary biology does not extend as far as embryology. I just cannot summon up the interest to concentrate and have to keep rereading and looking (again and again) at the illustrations. Maybe this is one for the future?Notes on reading Not getting on with this, I'm not really fascinated that fingers might have once been 8 digits with different functions and this is how they might have looked (line drawing of bones) but now we have five with similar functions. Maybe I've just fallen in love with Carl Zimmer's writing and can't adjust to a drier more academic style.I seem to be stuck in an evolutionary biology phase. Great title, great cover, I hope the writing lives up to it."
1,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating book about developments in genetics and evolution in the past twenty years. Sean Carroll is a leading researcher in the field; his lucid writing style and lively approach make this book a ""must-read"" for anybody interested in the subject. Plenty of illustrations and drawings help to bring the subject to life.There are several big mysteries in genetics; humans and primates share 99% of their genes, so why is their development so different? The answer lies in ""genetic switches"" that are encoded in DNA. But these switches have not yet been decoded; they are like the ""dark matter"" in galaxies--we know that it exists, but its nature is not yet been unraveled.The first half of the book focuses on how animals develop body parts. Every cell in one's body contains the identical DNA, so how does an embryo ""know"" which jcells are to develop into a heart, an arm, a finger, a brain, and on and on. Earlier books on evolution that I have read, simply left this as a mystery; hypotheses were described, but none articulated as a real answer. But, this book presents a very persuasive theory, and makes it quite understandable to the layman.In the second half of the book, Carroll conveys his sense of excitement, as molecular biologists began recently to talk with paleontologists. Remarkable progress in the past decade has shown fossils in a brand new light. Basically, evolution for the most part is not the development of new, mutated genes; evolution is the way in which old genes learn ""new tricks"". Embryology is shown to play a key role in understanding evolutionary development. For anyone interested in evolution or genetics, this is the book to read."
2,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110812-kinga,3,"You've heard the stories how we share 98% of genes with chimpanzees and something like 30% with daffodils. This seems confusing because we don’t look like we’re one third daffodils. Sean B Carroll’s book tries to explain this conundrum to the general reader by introducing us to the new, exciting field of Evo Devo (Evolutionary Developmental Biology) and giving me another weapon to fight against the creationists (though I don’t think they are particularly interested in having a fact-based debate from what I've noticed). This also explains why all embryos look so much alike, which also used to baffle me. More than 95% of our DNA is non-coding, it’s, as Carroll calls it, ‘dark matter’ and when embryology, genetics and evolutionary biology finally came together they managed to discover what some of this DNA ‘junk’ does. It appears it plays a crucial role in ‘teaching old genes new tricks’. Scientists studying a humble fruit fly discovered a set of genes that, while not coding anything themselves, serve as switches for other genes and thus control the general layout of the fly and the growth of the correct appendages in correct places. If you dick around with those 'switch' genes, you’re going to make flies grow legs on their heads (and best believe those scientists did). What’s more fascinating it seems all kinds of animals have Hox genes and they do the same thing – control the layout and the growth of legs, arms, paws, wings. Is your mind blown yet? It is a mystery to me why anyone would want to believe in the mind-numbingly boring creationist theory when the actual science is so amazingly, breathtakingly beautiful. Carroll calls this kind of genes ‘toolkit genes’ and he is now announcing revolution. His hypothesis is that all evolution relies mostly on those genes which switch the coding genes on and off and thus produce all the ‘endless forms most beautiful’.It’s a tempting and bold claim and you can hardly fault Carroll for being insanely passionate about the field he’s devoted himself to and hoping it would mean nothing would ever be the same again. However, despite Evo Devo producing major breakthroughs and explaining how a very rapid diversification of multicellular organisms is possible, it’s probably not going to produce a paradigm shift that would justify using the word 'revolution'. It is most likely going to add another piece to the puzzle (ok, maybe 10 pieces) of our understanding how evolutionary changes occur. But then again, it’s hard to assess these things until a few decades later anyway. I highly recommend this book if you have already read all the usual evolutionary primers by Dawkins and co. What’s refreshing here, is that Carroll doesn’t speak to creationists at all. This is not a book to win you over for the science cause. You already must be on the science side of this debate. The downside is that, unfortunately, Carroll is a great scientist but not the greatest writer. And I say it in the nicest way possible. He is enthusiastic and tries to convey this enthusiasm with bombastic opening paragraphs and cheesy metaphors that lull you into a false sense of security that this is going to be an easy read before hitting you with hard, hard science right in the face. Because of that the book feels unbalanced but it’s extremely informative, and it being pretty much the only “pop” book about evo devo (correct me if I’m wrong), you really can’t be too picky. "
3,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4339777-mark,4,"I don't know how many articles I've read in the last 10+ years that have tried to explain some of the discoveries about how a cell ""knows"" it should become a liver cell or a skin cell and why we don't end up with shoulder blades in our kidneys. These articles got my level of understanding from ""I bet it's complicated"" to ""It's complicated and has something to do with HOX genes.""Reading this book is the first time I feel I ""got it""*, at least somewhat, but based on my own reading history I won't pretend I can explain in a couple sentences (or without embarrassing myself in some way or another with various factual errors--it's still complicated.) I will say it's amazing that scientists have figured out so much of how nature's evolutionary toolkit, used to fiddle with morphology over the eons. Those HOX genes are indeed at the center of it, and the discovery that humans and fruit flies share almost exactly identical core sequences is like discovering that the Egyptian hieroglyphics describing how to use an Ikea wrench to build the pyramids.*Mutants, which I read last year, helped a bit too. A lot of the same science with a different approach."
4,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"This is staggeringly rivetting science and lovely science writing. I have been looking for a work on embryology and evolution to clarify some questions about how to design evolutionary algorithms and this was it. At the same time, it opens up a breathtaking vista of how evolution actually happens and how it is constrained. This is one of the few cases where I can honestly say that I feel I understand a whole new set of principles and perspectives after reading that I did not before. It's also an engaging and thoroughly enjoyable read. Carroll is a professional in this most demanding field while at the same time being a great popular science writer. I can only hope he does not holster his pen after doing this.The central realisation is shockingly simple, even if the scientific work to acquire it was bogglingly demanding: Animal body plans do not do anything new, and haven't done since the pre-Cambrian. That's a brutal oversimplification which I will have to embellish a little: All animal body plans are developed in an embryology regulated by the same, dozen or so, highly-conserved genes which are common to all extant animals and remarkably well conserved. That is the unmistakeable signature of something that is so important that it kills you if it varies, evolutionarily-speaking. Variations in the homeobox genes mean you leave no surviving offspring, and probably never even have a surviving self. So how can body forms vary at all? By turning on and off switches. It's a concept that was almost made to be ripped off and used in software.Very early on in embryology, a set of dimensions asserts itself - a ""geography"". There is an East-West ordinate (anterior to posterior); there is a North-South ordinate (dorsal to ventral); there is an in-out ordinate (proximal to distal). These begin to be defined at the very first cell division based on arbitrary distribution of signalling molecules, and once established they are inscribed on the molecule by diffusion gradients. Each regulatory protein describes a gradient across the embryo or its local part of the embryo, and each engages switches that turn other genes on and off. Thus do the cells know whether they are at the head end or the anus end, the back or the belly, the shoulder or the fingers.The clever bit is that the switches can be multiple, of arbitrary complexity, and work in cascades without having to change the crucial regulatory third-rail genes. Touch 'em and you die. Touch their switches, on the other hand, and you have a set of coordinates precise enough to divide the zones of gene expression up hundreds-fold. The Hox genes, tellingly, are arranged on the genome in the same order as they are expressed along the body. And therein lies the second huge and simple realisation - virtually all animal forms you will have seen, from yourself, O Vertebrate, to worms and butterflies, are built out of a series of segments arranged from anterior to posterior. This is a simple and forceful truth of evolution: The same segmented body plan is seen in most of what you see in animals. Evolution proceeds from the duplication of general-purpose segments to their increasing divergence and specialisation.I have conveyed sufficient of the content, as this is meant to be a review and not a précis. Carroll has had his 15 minutes of fame, as he describes in the book, according to the capricious mandate of the media agenda of the day. It's time for a further 15 hours, properly planned, for this is magnificent science writing and contains an understanding so profound that it is no exaggeration to say it deserves to be required reading for courses in biology for non-professionals. Perhaps even for professionals, but that's a question for them. At any rate, if you want to discuss evolution you need to have read the material in this endlessly beautiful book.Comment"
5,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1175951-matt,3,"First of all, I should clarify that I'm no scientist. But I do have an egghead mentality, and I've read plenty on evolution. What I hadn't read was much about developmental biology, and for me, that's where the main benefit of the book came. Although sometimes I wished Carroll would have boiled some of his 30-page chapters down to two or three.Those are my disclaimers. But I think I gained a lot of insight anyway.The book's excitement comes in the form of summarizing the ""evo devo"" movement, the movement in biology whereby seeing how genes express themselves in a growing embryo enables us to see into the life histories of how these genes have changed over millions of years of evolution. The primary insight thereafter is that natural selection hasn't forged eyes and teeth and legs and antennae completely from scratch each time, but rather that there is a common genetic ingredient to making each eye type, as well as to the many types of appendages, hearts, etc. And these common genetic ingredients must date back deep in time. And furthermore, genetic advancements and advancements in developmental biology enable us to see those changes in action.It was fun to read about how arthropod gills can stay as gills, or they become wings or lungs or other appendages. And my favorite new insight might be Williston's law: ""The parts in an organism tend toward reduction in number, with the fewer parts greatly specialized in function."" In other words, ""primitive"" forms are those with greater numbers of serial homologs (body parts), each of which performs the same function. And it's not so much that ""genes"" are changing as it is that ""switches"" (which, frankly, are still genes) are turning them on and off or adapting them in some other way."
6,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""The New Science of Evo Devo"". This cracked up my wife to no end. It's 'branding' for a new movement in biological science, about as hip-sounding as ""Extreme Programming"". But let's not judge a book by its cover. The author claims that this movement is ""Revolution #3"", on par with the Darwinian discovery of evolution by natural selection, and Mendel's discovery of genetics. Is it hype? Yes. Is it justified? Maybe...One thing's for sure: if you like seeing pictures of a lamb born with only one eye (in the center of its forehead), flies with legs where there should be antennae, and x-rays of seven-toed baby humans, this is your book.The problem with proclaiming revolutions' significance while they are happening, is that by the nature of revolutions they are unpredictable in outcome (see ""The Black Swan""). It wasn't obvious to an observer in 1789, or 1848, which one would overthrow a monarchy and which one would fail to. It probably wasn't obvious to peers of Darwin that his ideas would catch on, and Gregor Mendel's peers didn't even really notice his work until after he was dead.'Evo Devo' stands for 'evolutionary developmental biology'. It's about how genetics makes evolution happen, by changing the way we develop from conception to birth. It's taken as given that evolution by natural selection will reward creatures born with an advantage (not much here for the creationist reader, not even someone to argue with). The question is, how does the mutation process work, exactly?The question arises because, in the last twenty years, we've found out that a lot of our genes code for multiple things. The same gene which codes for our arms can code for wings in fruit flies, for example. How can one gene do that? Equally complicated is that the same gene does multiple things in the same species. But if one gene is used in limb development and, say, rib development, how can a mutation ever be beneficial? Even if it is useful in one case (longer legs, for instance), if it also causes other body parts to be out of whack, it's almost certain to be a net loss. How can natural selection work?The answer seems to be that our genes are turned on and off in different parts of the body, and at different times in our development, by switches. These switches (which are coded for in our DNA, of course) can mutate, and only affect one feature. This allows human and chimpanzee to share over 98% of our DNA, while still being quite different. More impressively, we share over 50% of our DNA with mice, who most of us do not resemble nearly so much. If most of this DNA can be use to different purposes by switching it on and off at different times in our development, these numbers are easier to understand.Also, by monkeying around with the very early embryos of fruit flies, we can get some truly B-horror-movie-worthy pictures. When nature does the same sort of thing, we can get a picture of a lamb head that will take a while to get out of your memory.Evo Devo, besides being a silly name, makes for a good read. For too long, popular science books on biology have been stuck on the ""here's why creationists are wrong"" level. I enjoyed being given a layman's view of the mechanisms that evolution can use to actually tinker around with things, from an author who respected my intelligence enough not to waste his breath on trying to convince me of evolution in the first place. He hops from how science actually happens (who discovered what, when, and why it turned out differently than they expected), to how evolution happens, to salient examples from the natural world (e.g. how zebras stripes form). This is the first book from Sean Carroll that I have read, but I hope it will not be the last."
7,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467151-elizabeth-k,4,"Well, this was very informative. I had to really buckle in to focus on everything. My favorite part was how Dr. Carroll would start off an explanation with ""it's quite simple, actually ..."" and then HA HA HA. I am making this sound like a chore, and it wasn't at all. But it was definitely not light reading. The diagrams weren't even light reading. Usually I read sciencey books like this, and try to hang on to a few important takeaways. So let's see, what did I learn here (other than that I'm just around the right age for all of the huge leaps in DNA research to have happened fairly quickly after I was in school, so that pretty much everything I was taught ended up being wrong)? Primarily, it was a really good grounding in why it's not particularly unusual that living creatures share a great percentage of genes, but that the more complicated process is in the assembly instructions, so to speak, and the sequencing of those instructions. And then that this process is evidenced both in the large sense of how species evolve, and at the micro level of how individual embryos grow into their ultimate form (directly or indirectly, I'm looking at you, JELLYFISH). For some reason I had gotten the impression that the relationship between those two concepts was more of an observational metaphor (literally I would be the worst scientist ever, every time something unexpected happened, I'd cheerfully be all ""well, I'm just going to go with a good metaphor for this!"") but it turns out (spoiler alert) it is one biological process writ large. I would recommend for people who are interested in evolution and have already gotten comfortable with the broad strokes and would like a deeper dive into processes. Interestingly enough (TO ME), this book also imparted a much clearer understanding of how to understand cladograms ... and I had even read a BOOK about cladograms and had still been confused."
8,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8811289-correen,5,"""i am not so naive to believe that science can solve all the world's problems, but ignorance of science, or denial of it's facts, is courting doom.""I have promised myself that I would read this book since I heard of it not long after it was published. Finally, it is finished and I am sorry to have taken so long. It is a wonderful set of examples of evo-devo that explain the role of tool-kit genes and the switches they contain. The elegance of this evolutionary process is magnificent. He tops off his examples of insects, especially butterflies, with mammal examples including the human brain. I was intrigued by the similarity in color switches across the animal kingdom. "
9,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73768036-lark-benobi,2,"The writing was much too breathless, in a ""gee, look at this butterfly wing!"" sort of way. The science got buried in metaphorical cliche'. Writing for a lay audience is always going to be tricky and I think in this case Carroll aimed too low and ended up using too many words that don't say much. For those interested in another way to approach learning about current evolution theory I strongly recommend checking out the Yale open course available for free online, ""Principles of Evolution, Ecology, and Behavior,"" taught by Stephen C. Stearns, who is as eloquent a storyteller as Sean B. Carroll but also illuminates this field in a more thorough way than Carroll's writing can, link here:http://oyc.yale.edu/ecology-and-evolu..."
10,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Biological diversity is apparent throughout the world. Time and again, we can be presented with examples of this. From the lowly worm to the towering oak, life comes in all shapes and sizes.There is a paradox with this fact, however, and this comes from the knowledge we now have in Biology. We have known about DNA since 1953 from the work of James Watson, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin. Once we developed computers with enough power, we found that life has a fundamental tool-kit of genes that it uses for multiple lifeforms. The main problem is this; how is life so diverse if the blueprint it utilizes is so similar?Sean B Carroll attempts to rectify this problem in Endless Forms Most Beautiful. In the book, he discusses the relatively new field of Evolutionary Developmental Biology or Evo-Devo for short. It explores the ideas that led to Evo-Devo and demonstrates its power. For example, looking at the fossil record, it would seem that you would have to develop genes for every creature that existed to achieve diversity. This was a popular viewpoint back in the 1980s. Even though DNA seems complex, it is well-understood. Only 1.5 percent of DNA does the coding for proteins; twice that amount is devoted to regulating those genes. After revealing the master tool-kit, Dr. Carroll spends the rest of the book demonstrating how these ideas come to fruition.The book is fascinating. Although it gets technical with its descriptions, it is still engaging enough to be enjoyable."
11,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34019657-jorge,5,"4.5/5.This book proved to be both one of the most interesting scientific readings I've ever found, and one of the hardest. It is compelling, well-written, engaging and, overall, the best aproach possible to a frankly not-so-simple reading.And I expected that. The first time I heard about the book, or Evo-devo itself, was when I heard a ""Despacito"" parody made by Acapellascience where this book was the main source: I knew I would find something equally challenging and interesting. Sean B. Carroll manages to bring evolutionary developmental biology close to the public, but a good degree of previous biology knowledge (more in the developmental and genetic fields than in evolutionary theory) is still needed, and I had a hard time sometimes keeping up with it. But the fact that I finished, despite not quite grasping everything I was reading, not even close to it, proves its value.No, I would not recommend it to everybody, but yes, I would encourage anyone with an interest in evolution and its driving mechanisms to give it an opportunity. Here I've discovered amazing things: from the fact that insect wings, horseshoe crab book gills and book lungs, tracheae and spinnerets in spiders have all evolved from gill branches present in ancestral arthropods; to the fascinating picture of melanism in many animals. The awesome facts Carroll brings to you are as cool as unexpected: how convergent evolution didn't create the same kind of wings in pterosaurs, bats and birds (but indeed based the structure in fingers, hands and arms); how the 99.8% gene similarity paradox can be explained; how butterflies evolved their wing spots; or even the way you can make flies see from their... well, their behinds. But the book isn't just a collection of cool stories; rather than that, is a well documented and argued explanation of the why to those stories, with a final insight on the importance of evo-devo in education, public debate, and the preservation of Nature.When you finish it, I guarantee that you will see the endless forms most beautiful that surround us in a very different way. Promise.P.S: for anyone who's left with the desire to read more about these topics, Carroll devotes a last few pages to dissect the many different sources of every last chapter and core ideas of the book, putting it aside, and not in the middle of the text, to get it out of the way of the narrative.EDIT: this is one of the few cases where I wouldn't recommend the mass paperback pocket edition of the book. Images displayed in color in the original get confusing and less meaningful in their black and white version here. Mostly, the experience just losses a bit of beauty, but in some cases the clarity of explanations diminishes as well."

13,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274923-dianne,5,"Here's why this book blew my mind. I remember almost everything I learned in high school biology (more than 20 years ago), and there were some things that no one could then explain. What, for instance, triggers some cells to become liver cells while others become skin cells? And, why, once a cell has become a liver cell, can it not produce skin cells? Why do all vertebrates follow roughly the same sequence of embryonic and fetal development?Those things were a mystery in the 80s, and they were often (and are often still) cited by opponents of the twin theories of evolution and genetics as evidence for the existence of some divine being - since we had not yet discovered a simple material cause, these mysteries must have been the work of a divine intelligence.""Endless Forms Most Beautiful"" blew my mind because it proposes scientifically sound, empirically supported answers to those questions. The Wow Factor was twofold. I admired the carefully choreographed ballet of embryonic development where causes flowed simply and surely from the effects of prior causes, no intelligent designer required. At the same time, I marvelled at the intricacy and ingenuity of the human minds that managed to figure all this out.As I read the book, I'd remark to my husband, who had read it right before I did, ""So, he's now explained the mystery of x, that we didn't know about when I was in HS. But I'm still wondering about y."" Then the next day, I'd say, ""He's explained y now, but what about z?"" Then the next day, ""He got z, too ...""""Endless Forms"" was the first book I read last year, and it was the most memorable and satisfying book of the entire year."

Building on Darwin's famous last sentence (""endless forms most beautiful"") in the Origin of Species, Carroll gives a wonderful history and account of the science of Evolutionary Developmental Biology (Evo Devo). The story encompasses two broad categories: embryology - how animals develop their forms from embryo to adult, and evolution - how species have developed over the eons through natural selection. Evo devo exploded in the last decade as geneticists have begun to unlock the secrets of how our forms came to be. Why is it that birds got their feathers from dinosaurs which needed them to stay warm? Did you know that butterfly wings and centipede legs developed from fish gills? Neither did I.

It is easy to follow and even entertaining for anybody with an unbiased curiosity about nature. It's an attractive volume with some amazing color plates illustrating some of the experiments that have shown scientists how DNA works in insect larvae.

A very important book for all biology teachers, college students, school board members and home schoolers, it is easy enough for me to understand and I was not not a bio major.

From the formation of butterflies' complex wing patterns to the camouflaging utility of zebra stripes (and a look at the question: is a zebra black with white stripes or white with black stripes), this book held my interest and attempted to educate me far above my level of effectiveness.

As an interactive breather, he often paused before a big brainy ah-ha moment and stated, “...that’s right, you’ve probably already guessed the answer to this one....” Well, I never did... not once! To state the obvious, Endless Forms was endlessly over my head. I love the mere topic of evolution, so with an open slack jaw, I numbly chugged through it.

21,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6157820-matthew,4,"Every so often a book comes along that completely blows you away. This is one such book. I first heard about this book from Tim Blais’ A Cappella Science video, which is in itself a superlative work of art. I bought this book to better understand the concepts presented in that video.When I first learned about the details of DNA in school I was enraptured by how simple but incredibly powerful DNA replication is. This book rekindled that feeling of awe as it explained the beauty of evolution and the fundamentally simple mechanisms that make it all possible: genetic switches, tool-kit genes and Hox proteins that govern the development of embryonic form.The book is replete with interesting case studies and examples of evolution, such as the fact that gills were repurposed in ingenious ways to form everything from insect wings to spider spinnerets, the independent evolution of wings in insects, pterodactyls, birds and bats, and the way animal coat colourings spread outward from the neural crest along the spine, often causing lighter colours underneath on the belly and providing a clue for how the zebra got its stripes. There is so much more in the book and I’m sure I would benefit from repeat readings. Carroll’s writing is well-pitched, being both challenging and accessible. He does a great job bringing the beauty and wonder of evolution to the fore.That said, I am only giving it four out of five stars because of the omission of colour plates in the soft-cover book. In a book about beauty and diversity, where the image captions repeatedly draw attention to the “exquisite” colors and varying shades in detailed close-up photographs, the greyscale photos are a significant editorial flaw. The fact that the “colour” illustrations are central to the points being made in the text makes it even more maddening when it is impossible to distinguish between greens and blues and reds. I tweeted the publisher and the author about it but got no reply.The book requires some effort to grasp the details of the ideas presented and it is challenging to a degree. This is perhaps a hindrance in getting the evolutionary worldview accepted by those who actively oppose it, particularly in America, as short answers are rarely possible and a firm scientific foundation is needed. The book finishes off with a fairly reasonable assessment of the challenges faced by the scientific community and science educators to spread the discoveries of Evo Devo to society at large. The author suggests that, like all major scientific paradigm shifts, these new ideas will be accepted slowly through generational displacement. So for those already convinced of these advances and frustrated with society’s intransigence we can be sure that truth and beauty will ultimately carry the day.Overall I highly recommend this book, but I would caution against the soft-cover edition."
22,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781908-steve,3,"This book explains some of the mechanisms by which evolution works and provides clear examples from genetics that provide hard evidence for it. I really enjoyed a lot of 'aha' moments as I read this, particularly in the first few sections where he could back up all his claims with clear results from research. (I especially liked: 1) learning how nature uses data compression and combinatorics to efficiently reuse individual chunks of DNA in very different ways throughout the body; 2) learning about specific cases of speciation and clear evolution occurring within human history; 3) learning how identical cells throughout an embryo know to specialize into what they later grow into; 4) learning that multiple genetic switches send out waves of proteins that intersect at precise points in the embryo's 3D structure; 5) learning why bilateral symmetry is so common; 6) learning how redundancy in DNA and body structure leads to evolution of limb specialization; etc.).Later, as he got into speculations about human development and evolution, it became more wishy washy, but for good reason: we don't allow scientists to create mutant babies on purpose by tinkering with embryos, which is how a lot of discoveries were made in other species. I didn't give it give it four stars because it read too much like a research paper in some sections to be appealing to a general audience. It's a real shame because there are some great ideas in there."
23,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74503219-valerio,2,"I have to say I'm disappointed, the contents of the book could be condensed down to a handful of pages without much loss, so much did the author insist on repeating the same concept over and over again. I expected more technical details, more mechanisms unveiled, and more vaired insights into the way living things are built from their genes, instead I got few hundred pages of reminders that yes, this universal mechanism we introduced in chapter three as the basis of embryo development indeed is at work here too, and here, and there it is again: and don't mistake, it's also behind this too, and look at how it is always the same!I wouldn't say it's a bad book, but if you have passing familiarity with evolution and the workings of DNA you might find it no more interesting than the song ""Evo Devo"" by ACapellaScience (find it on youtube) which has the added bonus of making the melody of Despacito (of which it's a cover) a pleasant reminder instead of a grating summer hit.

One thing that Sean Carroll does well is explaining the multiple proteins that go in to the formation of all creatures, from butterflies to humans and how those proteins are links to physical expression. One thing that I was hoping to find in this book was more information on the development of brain matter and spinal columns which was lacking for the most part. But this book helped to provide a scientific background to the saying: ""We are all connected!"" Must read. "
25,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"Ok, this book attempts to address two different problems. The first problem is how an egg is turned into an adult animal. Everyone can appreciate that this is quite an amazing process, but ever thought of its details? As the original single cell stars splitting, how does each cell – all carrying the exact same copy of the DNA – know whether it’s a heart cell or brain cell or liver cell? How does the embryo – nothing more than a tiny collection of cells at this point – know where to put each organ? How does it know where each arm and leg goes, and where the heart should go? How does it know how many of each organ it should make and what size they should be? Who tells it that we have five fingers on each hand and the middle finger is not twice the length of the other fingers? How does it produce a perfectly symmetric body instead of a skewed one?The second problem is evolution. After all the dust from the human genome sequencing project was settled, the results were a bit surprising. We’re not much different from a mouse in the number and organization of our genes. Even a lowly worm is not too far behind us. If we’re built by our genes and only genes are the units over which evolution operates, how are we then so different from a mouse? The key to solving both problems, Carroll says, is that body form is governed by the “switches” in our DNA. A gene is defined as a section of the DNA that codes for a specific protein. Most of our DNA doesn’t contain any genes. Most of this non-coding DNA is just junk; the rest is switches that, while not genes themselves, regulate the effect of the genes. The genes are just tool kits that are mostly common to all animals. The switches put these tool kits to specific use and build specific body forms. A great deal of evolution has gone into these regulatory switches. The book is an introduction to Evo Devo (Evolutionary Development) and contains a lot of interesting information. You can skip some of the more technical parts and it’s still interesting. Carroll is a fine scientist, but not the best writer.If you ever wondered whether a zebra is a white animal with black stripes or a black animal with white stripes you should read this book. I won’t spoil it for you. "
26,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49850369-son-tung,4,"I've been exposed again and again to the idea of similarity in genome between human and chimps, they often point to the resemblance in violent, empathic behaviors of us and our closest cousins. This book carries the ideas of genetic divergence further to explain evolution, a new light was shred for me to look at evolution. While other works that i've read often describe evolution in ""The strongest survives"" style, but Carroll offers a glimse into this natural process with genetic lens by introducing a recently developed branch of biology: Evolutionary Developmental Biology. We are putting DNA to work, to aid the Evolution theory. Human, mouse and other mammals shared a common ancestor approximately 80 million years ago. On average, the protein-coding regions of the mouse and human genomes are 85 percent identical; some genes are 99 percent identical while others are only 60 percent identical. These regions are evolutionarily conserved because they are required for function. In contrast, the non-coding regions are much less similar (only 50 percent or less). Therefore, when one compares the same DNA region from human and mouse, the functional elements clearly stand out because of their greater similarity. (https://www.genome.gov/10001345/impor...)Here is a quote to portray what it feels like reading Carroll's explanation and see evolution in embryonic development point of view: ""There are several aspects to lobster construction that reflect the general themes of modularity and serial homology. First, the body is organized into a head (with the eyes and mouthparts), a thorax (with walking legs), and a long tail (yum!). Second, different sections of the body possess numbers of specific appendages (antennae, claws, walking legs, swimmerets). And third, each jointed appendage is itself segmented, and different kinds of appendages have different numbers of segments overall (compare a claw with a walking leg). If you were feeling adventuresome and dissected an insect or a crab, you’d see some general similarities in body organization, segmentation, and appendages but, again, differences in the number and kind of serially homologous structures."""
27,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Reviewed for The Bibliophibian.At this point, I must admit I’m a bad judge of pop-science when it covers biology. To me this is a very easy read now, covering simple topics, but I know I wouldn’t have felt that way a couple of years ago. If you’re interested in evolutionary biology, though, this is a very good primer on the science of Evo Devo: understanding evolutionary relationships through understanding the development of embryos, how certain genes work in causing large morphological differences even though almost the same gene can be found in a wildly different species.I think if you have a reasonable understanding of genetics and how proteins are made, you should be okay here: it’s not requiring expertise, though it may take concentration to follow some of the reasoning if you’re not already familiar. If you are, it illustrates the principles nicely, and I imagine a full colour copy of the book (if it exists) would be rather physically gorgeous as well. There’s a lot of black-and-white images of butterfly wings, for instance, in my particular edition. The points could probably have been more clearly demonstrated with colour images where the differences are easier to highlight…All the same, a fascinating book, whether you’re an expert or not (I think). Evo Devo is a bit of a buzzword for some biologists lately, and this book is worth the read for learning about that. I wish I’d read it before the module I did that included some of this stuff: it would have definitely made the learning part come easier!"

This book was written and published in 2005 and referred to advances and discoveries in biology over the preceding 20 years that more firmly supported the idea that forms of insect, fish, mammals, and other animals changed over the hundreds of millions of years of its' existence of this planet. A PERIOD DURING WHICH I MISSED OUT ON SOME OF THOSE ADVANCES!!Over the past decade or so I have made an attempt to remedy that shortcoming. (Your Inner Fish by Neil Shubin, and The Third Chimpanzee by Jared Diamond are notable)Dr. Carroll's book reads on a level that makes it accessible to more than those who have studied within the biological sciences, and has a straight-forward approach to the delivery of concepts that have been ascertained over the decades of study by many, may researchers.The text lays out references to strong evidence for the biological changes in development and form of animals, past and present, include our own genus and species.I was pleased that Dr. Carroll ended with a slight critique and condemnation (although gentle) of Creationism and its bastard offspring Intelligent Design. (other good reads: The Devil in Dover by Lauri Lebo, and The Battle Over the Meaning of Everything by Gordy Slack)The section for Further Readings has offered prospectives for me for follow-ups and leads to increase my knowledge and understanding of EvoDevo (Evolutionary Development)."
30,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35733902-ipsita,5,"This book is a brilliant introductory book on the topic of the new and fast emerging field of evo-devo by an eminent scientist of the same. One of the major tenets of this field is the evidence pointing out the fact that all the living organisms share the genetic toolkit necessary for all the processes involved in embryological development such as development of limbs, eyes (hox, pax genes) etc. The ‘dark matter’ of the genome aka the so-called junk DNA plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the genetic switches as well as progress of complexity at the molecular level as the phylogenesis moves forward in nature. Evo-devo also explains the diversity evident at the developmental stage for natural selection, defensive mechanisms such as molecular mimicry and the ever-intriguing human evolution. A must read for enthusiasts of both embryology and evolutionary biology. Anyone not interested in the technical details could just read the last chapter where Sean B. Carroll puts a striking argument in favour of evolution and the role of developmental biology in it.
For more than a century, biologists had assumed that different types of animals were genetically constructed in completely different ways. The greater the disparity in animal form, the less (if anything) the development of two animals would have in common at the level of their genes. One of the architects of the Modern Synthesis, Ernst Mayr, had written that “the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives.” But contrary to the expectations of any biologist, most of the genes first identified as governing major aspects of fruit fly body organization were found to have exact counterparts that did the same thing in most animals, including ourselves. This discovery was followed by the revelation that the development of various body parts such as eyes, limbs, and hearts, vastly different in structure among animals and long thought to have evolved in entirely different ways, was also governed by the same genes in different animals. The comparison of developmental genes between species became a new discipline at the interface of embryology and evolutionary biology—evolutionary developmental biology, or “Evo Devo” for short.By revealing the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying change, Evo Devo allows us to compare and contrast the evolutionary paths of different groups. Long-standing mysteries such as Batesian mimicry in butterflies, melanism in moths, and even the evolution of finch beak size and shape now lie within our grasp. We shall soon have detailed pictures of many of the classic examples of natural selection and understand in depth how variation arises and is selected for.

31,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42261661-lucas-g,4,"If you've ever wondered how a developing organism knows where to grow an arm or where the eyeballs are supposed to go, then this book is for you. In this book Carroll provides a glimpse into the science of evolutionary developmental biology (commonly referred to as Evo-Devo). At a high level, Evo-Devo studies how biological lifeforms develop from a single cell into a full-grown organism with a multitude of different physical characteristics. This requires tracking the expression of various genes throughout the developmental stages of different organisms. The first half of the book describes this process in detail, explaining how researchers are able to identify what genes are being activated at different physical locations at different times during development in order to produce a fully-developed organism. The impression that I walked away with is that Evo-Devo works much like a series of integrated control systems circuits. There are base programs (Hox genes) that, when activated, initiate the development of different features (arms, legs, wings, eyes, etc.) Then there are genetic switches that activate and deactivate these Hox genes at various physical locations at different times throughout development stages. Differences in the logic of these genetic switches ultimately produce the different physical features of different organisms. This is because different genetic switch logic activates the Hox genes at different locations and times during development. The second half of the book outlines specific applications of Evo-Devo. This includes discussions of butterfly wings, zebra stripes, and even the human brain. Admittedly, I did not find these discussions to be as interesting as those describing how Evo-Devo works in the first half of the book, but it was still fairly interesting. At least until the last chapter. For some reason Carroll chose to end the book with an exclamation that Evo-Devo can save science education in the United States from its current abysmal state. Right or wrong, the entire chapter seems out of place and distracts from the overall fascination of Evo-Devo created by the preceding chapters. Overall, this is an enjoyable and intriguing read. Carroll is an excellent writer, and his personality shows through his writing on even the most technical of topics."
32,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6924174-rodzilla,5,"Perhaps a difficult read for somebody without a strong background in evolution and the fundamentals of molecular biology. But this book ties together decades of developmental genetics and evolution to lead us to a much deeper understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of evolution. They key is the evolution of the arthropod body plans and transcription factors controlling spatial identity of tissues. None of this is new as of its 2005 publication, but what it offers is synthesis. Carroll brings together a very complicated picture with excellent teaching skills. An intelligent reader should come away with an understanding of how remarkably diverse body plans can evolve with relatively minor changes in regulatory gene sequences. As noted, the case is exceptionally strong with arthropods, with Drosophila leading the way. But vertebrate development is also strongly represented, though perhaps not so deeply. After all, it is much more difficult, expensive and slow to research vertebrates, not to mention the ethical barriers of researching human development. Yet, taken together, this book provides a slam dunk not for whether evolution happens - because it does. But rather what teh actual mechanisms are. An aside: this would be a great candidate for an updated edition that brings the state of the art to 2018 or 2019 rather than 2005. But even though over a decade out of date, this book is a must for anybody who wants to understand development or evolution. Truly the successor to the tradition of Stephen Jay Gould, who never had the chance to incorporate molecular and developmental genetics into his musings on the diversity of life.Minor nit pick: no mention of nematodes? Granted, homeotic genes have significantly less profound effects on the nematode body plan. And yet they still fit the theme of spatial identity and variation. Perhaps just too nuanced for what is meant for lay readers...."
33,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,5,"Superb. If you've have the general high-school version of evolution, with Darwin's natural selection and Mendel's dominant and recessive genes, then you've been exposed to the Modern Synthesis--the theory of evolution hammered out in the early twentieth century. Since roughly the eighties or nineties, evolutionary theory has been moving into the ""Extended Modern Synthesis"", and a key component of this is Evo Devo.In Endless Forms Most Beautiful, Carroll gently takes you by the hand and walks you through the main points of Evo Devo. There are two major thrusts here. First, that all of my cells have the same DNA, and most animals have roughly similar DNA, and that the major differences between species isn't what genes they do or don't have, but rather if, when, and where those genes get turned on. (This is largely driven by the establishment of a chemical-gradient based coordinate system in the embryo--Carroll explains it much more clearly than I can). The second is that a major component of evolution then becomes changes in the activation of those switches, rather than changes in the genes themselves.I guess the analogy I came up with (and please correct me if this is way off) is this. In the Modern Synthesis, the keratin that my toenails are made of is slightly different than the keratin that a rhino's toenails are made of. And over time, for various reasons, including selection pressure, the keratin in our respective toenails will diverge more and more until they are radically different. Evo devo argues that, sure, the keratin is different, but the main change is that the ""make keratin"" switch that exists in every cell in my body, but is only turned on in my toenails and other places, can be turned on by some mutation in my face, and cause me to grow a rhinoceros horn. Make sense? Not the ""what"" being made, but the if, when, and where."
34,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15625567-dmitry-zinenko,4,"The themes covered by this book are without doubt very important, and some of the chapters are very revealing.The author does a good job of being accessible to a wide range of readers with or without biological background. He covers a topic that has been fascinating me for a long time - how the complex morphology and physiology of even the simplest animal can develop out of a single cell without external intervention. Most of the time he does that in just the right amount of detail to demonstrate the general principles, which turned out to be simpler than I thought. It also discusses the important interconnection between that and the evolution, in particular evolutionary development of new species. On the negative side, the content of most chapters of the second part felt bland and repetitive to me. They closely follow the same pattern of describing an experiment, usually done in the author's lab, and explaining how it reinforces the few (however important) principles reiterated throughout this book. Personally, I was convinced already after the first introduction of those, and having to read about more examples that confirm the same thing was tedious to me. If you get the same feeling, you can skip the final third of the book and won't miss much. On the one hand, as I struggled to find some novelty in the latter chapters, I was treated again and again to the same arguments about the importance and prominence of evo devo. On the other, IMO the author missed the opportunity to examine and discuss some other implications of those revelations on, e.g., taxonomy, psychology, and ethics.Nevertheless, I definitely recommend getting acquainted with this book or at least with the topics covered by it."
35,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10726611-chunyang-ding,5,"I was directed to read this book from A Capella Science, who created a really wonderful video explaining evo-devo biology. Yet it seemed to make an incredibly bold claim - that the primary cause of evolution was not in gene mutations, but through activating and changing certain signalling genes. This blew my mind - it wasn't covered in any of my bio courses in high school, nor did any of my college friends have any direct information on it. Thus, diving into the source!Sean Carroll is a wonderful science writer, especially since he has such an academic background. Endless Forms Most Beautiful reads very differently from standard popular-science books, as it is much more concerned about cutting-edge research. Carroll writes like an academic - the book not only creates a narrative around the world of evolutionary-developmental biology, it also reads like a researcher's lecture slides in the way he organizes his information. Frequent citations to prominent researchers in the field, as well as the many figures used in the text, provide more of a ""hard science"" feel than your regular book. Despite having read Your Inner Fish by Shubin a number of years ago, Endless Forms Most Beautiful seemed to impart a stronger sense of wonder. Perhaps that's due to Carroll's writing style, both rigorous yet whimsical, or perhaps that's just due to passion Carroll has for his subject. I found especially intriguing his aside on how to raise the American conscience regarding the subject of evolution. I do hope as the years go on, more and more people will become curious about such facts of life and choose to look for themselves at these fascinating facts. "

This book takes a refreshing turn from both fields; it is written in a straightforward, engaging, impassioned, and yes, sometimes cheesy style that lets its audience follow right along. More experienced readers might imagine the mechanisms of transcription factors and the formation of protein channels when they are mentioned; but the “interested layperson” will be able to read the brief overview of the cast of roles involved, and continue on their merry way.I recommend this book. I recommend it to minds curious about genetics or evolution; I recommend it to minds seeking to learn about the scientific process; I recommend it to minds thirsty to understand what it means to discover, and to know the challenges and successes of research.I left science behind after years of memorizing gene codes and neural loci. This book reminded me of what it means to feel inspired by and curious about the fabric that underpins our world.Bravo, Carroll. P.S. I was inspired to read this by ASAPScience’s accapella cover ‘Evo Devo’, which is a heartfelt piece in its own right "
37,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118682994-andrew-buist,5,"A fantastic book on the developing science of Evo Devo. Carroll manages to correct the course of thought away from the incorrect assumption that evolution is primarily driven by the accumulation of totally random, proteinaceous mutations, amongst which a handful are beneficial. One change in one protein is infrequently the cause of such fervent radiation and speciation. Instead, the random accumulation of mutations of so called ""switches"" in the non-coding DNA of an organism provide upstream, much broader-stroked changes to the development and functioning of an organism. The focus of the book seems to teeter toward the start of ""Act II"", as well as a deal of exhaustive repetition in the conclusion (though I suppose the point of a conclusion is to be wholly conclusive). The continued appearance of certain ""superstar"" Hox genes (here's looking at you, Distal-less) was a pleasure to read - showing up in at-first unexpected locations across taxa. In summary, this is a fantastic introductory read, that eventually blossoms out to encompass multiple fields of ecology, anthropology and palaeontology in much narrower, academic scope - however the early chapters acts as sufficient preparation to soften the blow of certain genetic formulae and more complex Hox gene diagrams that follow. Thoroughly enjoyable, thoroughly recommend."
38,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21912688-ian,5,"Lucid and thoughtful scientific writing by an author who is clearly enthusiastic about the subject. My first read by the ""other Sean Carroll"" (depending on who you ask), and it did not disappoint. Carroll lays out why the science of evolutionary development is key to the Modern Synthesis describing how species evolve and adapt to their environments. The exposition is well-structured, unpacking the genetic mechanisms that underlie embryonic development and then exploring how genetic switches--the source of biochemical patterns of activation and inactivation--allow for an incredible variation in the number, type, and function of body parts that develop in an organism. Carroll argues that these switches and incremental modification of existing parts are the main drivers of evolution, rather than major mutational leaps which give rise to entirely novel functionality. (Incidentally, this argument has me rethinking the entire premise of X-Men.)To sum up, Carroll has written a very approachable introduction to a fascinating topic. Worth reading for anyone interested in genetics, evolution, or the craft of popular scientific writing itself."

The book takes you on a journey through the past and current diverse richness of the animal kingdom. The entire concept and working of genetic toolkits and genetic switches could be bottled in a few pages, but it was delightful to get into the applications. The book was beautifully furnished with illustrations and I personally loved the philosophical tone at the end of the book that explored active ignorance and the need for evolution of theology.Sean B Carroll maintains his tone of over-enthusiasm throughout the book which sometimes hindered my objective evaluation of how much fascination certain concepts really entail.

I think that my problem was that it promised new, new, new, but then really didn't tell me anything much that I did not already know about evolution and developmental biology. The stuff about the hox genes and the way that switches turn them on and off to form major body parts is fascinating, as is the information about how many inportant genes we share with vastly different types of organisms with whom our common ancestors go back hundreds of millions of years. And the explanation of how evolution works to change genes over time is important knowledge that everyone should understand. All of this important information is delivered in a breezy, easy to understand style. So what's not to like? I don't know. I guess I wanted more. It just overpromised and underdelivered."

He spends too long describing aspects that seemed straightforward and glosses over parts that I would have liked to know more about. Also, his language for qualitatively describing gene regulation is confusing and hard to keep straight, not least because it fails to properly acknowledge that many transcription factors regulate other transcription factors. I'm fact, his language doesn't use the words ""transcription factors"" at all, as if he is worked that sort of terminology will intimidate the lay reader. I think if you know very little about biology, this writing may work for you. However, if you are familiar with other biological and genetic topics but are new to ""Evo Devo,"" then this writing may leave you unsatisfied about this fascinating topic."

60,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35733902-ipsita,5,"This book is a brilliant introductory book on the topic of the new and fast emerging field of evo-devo by an eminent scientist of the same. One of the major tenets of this field is the evidence pointing out the fact that all the living organisms share the genetic toolkit necessary for all the processes involved in embryological development such as development of limbs, eyes (hox, pax genes) etc. The ‘dark matter’ of the genome aka the so-called junk DNA plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the genetic switches as well as progress of complexity at the molecular level as the phylogenesis moves forward in nature. Evo-devo also explains the diversity evident at the developmental stage for natural selection, defensive mechanisms such as molecular mimicry and the ever-intriguing human evolution. A must read for enthusiasts of both embryology and evolutionary biology. Anyone not interested in the technical details could just read the last chapter where Sean B. Carroll puts a striking argument in favour of evolution and the role of developmental biology in it.
For more than a century, biologists had assumed that different types of animals were genetically constructed in completely different ways. The greater the disparity in animal form, the less (if anything) the development of two animals would have in common at the level of their genes. One of the architects of the Modern Synthesis, Ernst Mayr, had written that “the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives.” But contrary to the expectations of any biologist, most of the genes first identified as governing major aspects of fruit fly body organization were found to have exact counterparts that did the same thing in most animals, including ourselves. This discovery was followed by the revelation that the development of various body parts such as eyes, limbs, and hearts, vastly different in structure among animals and long thought to have evolved in entirely different ways, was also governed by the same genes in different animals. The comparison of developmental genes between species became a new discipline at the interface of embryology and evolutionary biology—evolutionary developmental biology, or “Evo Devo” for short.By revealing the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying change, Evo Devo allows us to compare and contrast the evolutionary paths of different groups. Long-standing mysteries such as Batesian mimicry in butterflies, melanism in moths, and even the evolution of finch beak size and shape now lie within our grasp. We shall soon have detailed pictures of many of the classic examples of natural selection and understand in depth how variation arises and is selected for.

61,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42261661-lucas-g,4,"If you've ever wondered how a developing organism knows where to grow an arm or where the eyeballs are supposed to go, then this book is for you. In this book Carroll provides a glimpse into the science of evolutionary developmental biology (commonly referred to as Evo-Devo). At a high level, Evo-Devo studies how biological lifeforms develop from a single cell into a full-grown organism with a multitude of different physical characteristics. This requires tracking the expression of various genes throughout the developmental stages of different organisms. The first half of the book describes this process in detail, explaining how researchers are able to identify what genes are being activated at different physical locations at different times during development in order to produce a fully-developed organism. The impression that I walked away with is that Evo-Devo works much like a series of integrated control systems circuits. There are base programs (Hox genes) that, when activated, initiate the development of different features (arms, legs, wings, eyes, etc.) Then there are genetic switches that activate and deactivate these Hox genes at various physical locations at different times throughout development stages. Differences in the logic of these genetic switches ultimately produce the different physical features of different organisms. This is because different genetic switch logic activates the Hox genes at different locations and times during development. The second half of the book outlines specific applications of Evo-Devo. This includes discussions of butterfly wings, zebra stripes, and even the human brain. Admittedly, I did not find these discussions to be as interesting as those describing how Evo-Devo works in the first half of the book, but it was still fairly interesting. At least until the last chapter. For some reason Carroll chose to end the book with an exclamation that Evo-Devo can save science education in the United States from its current abysmal state. Right or wrong, the entire chapter seems out of place and distracts from the overall fascination of Evo-Devo created by the preceding chapters. Overall, this is an enjoyable and intriguing read. Carroll is an excellent writer, and his personality shows through his writing on even the most technical of topics."
62,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6924174-rodzilla,5,"Perhaps a difficult read for somebody without a strong background in evolution and the fundamentals of molecular biology. But this book ties together decades of developmental genetics and evolution to lead us to a much deeper understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of evolution. They key is the evolution of the arthropod body plans and transcription factors controlling spatial identity of tissues. None of this is new as of its 2005 publication, but what it offers is synthesis. Carroll brings together a very complicated picture with excellent teaching skills. An intelligent reader should come away with an understanding of how remarkably diverse body plans can evolve with relatively minor changes in regulatory gene sequences. As noted, the case is exceptionally strong with arthropods, with Drosophila leading the way. But vertebrate development is also strongly represented, though perhaps not so deeply. After all, it is much more difficult, expensive and slow to research vertebrates, not to mention the ethical barriers of researching human development. Yet, taken together, this book provides a slam dunk not for whether evolution happens - because it does. But rather what teh actual mechanisms are. An aside: this would be a great candidate for an updated edition that brings the state of the art to 2018 or 2019 rather than 2005. But even though over a decade out of date, this book is a must for anybody who wants to understand development or evolution. Truly the successor to the tradition of Stephen Jay Gould, who never had the chance to incorporate molecular and developmental genetics into his musings on the diversity of life.Minor nit pick: no mention of nematodes? Granted, homeotic genes have significantly less profound effects on the nematode body plan. And yet they still fit the theme of spatial identity and variation. Perhaps just too nuanced for what is meant for lay readers...."
63,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,5,"Superb. If you've have the general high-school version of evolution, with Darwin's natural selection and Mendel's dominant and recessive genes, then you've been exposed to the Modern Synthesis--the theory of evolution hammered out in the early twentieth century. Since roughly the eighties or nineties, evolutionary theory has been moving into the ""Extended Modern Synthesis"", and a key component of this is Evo Devo.In Endless Forms Most Beautiful, Carroll gently takes you by the hand and walks you through the main points of Evo Devo. There are two major thrusts here. First, that all of my cells have the same DNA, and most animals have roughly similar DNA, and that the major differences between species isn't what genes they do or don't have, but rather if, when, and where those genes get turned on. (This is largely driven by the establishment of a chemical-gradient based coordinate system in the embryo--Carroll explains it much more clearly than I can). The second is that a major component of evolution then becomes changes in the activation of those switches, rather than changes in the genes themselves.I guess the analogy I came up with (and please correct me if this is way off) is this. In the Modern Synthesis, the keratin that my toenails are made of is slightly different than the keratin that a rhino's toenails are made of. And over time, for various reasons, including selection pressure, the keratin in our respective toenails will diverge more and more until they are radically different. Evo devo argues that, sure, the keratin is different, but the main change is that the ""make keratin"" switch that exists in every cell in my body, but is only turned on in my toenails and other places, can be turned on by some mutation in my face, and cause me to grow a rhinoceros horn. Make sense? Not the ""what"" being made, but the if, when, and where."
64,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15625567-dmitry-zinenko,4,"The themes covered by this book are without doubt very important, and some of the chapters are very revealing.The author does a good job of being accessible to a wide range of readers with or without biological background. He covers a topic that has been fascinating me for a long time - how the complex morphology and physiology of even the simplest animal can develop out of a single cell without external intervention. Most of the time he does that in just the right amount of detail to demonstrate the general principles, which turned out to be simpler than I thought. It also discusses the important interconnection between that and the evolution, in particular evolutionary development of new species. On the negative side, the content of most chapters of the second part felt bland and repetitive to me. They closely follow the same pattern of describing an experiment, usually done in the author's lab, and explaining how it reinforces the few (however important) principles reiterated throughout this book. Personally, I was convinced already after the first introduction of those, and having to read about more examples that confirm the same thing was tedious to me. If you get the same feeling, you can skip the final third of the book and won't miss much. On the one hand, as I struggled to find some novelty in the latter chapters, I was treated again and again to the same arguments about the importance and prominence of evo devo. On the other, IMO the author missed the opportunity to examine and discuss some other implications of those revelations on, e.g., taxonomy, psychology, and ethics.Nevertheless, I definitely recommend getting acquainted with this book or at least with the topics covered by it."
65,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10726611-chunyang-ding,5,"I was directed to read this book from A Capella Science, who created a really wonderful video explaining evo-devo biology. Yet it seemed to make an incredibly bold claim - that the primary cause of evolution was not in gene mutations, but through activating and changing certain signalling genes. This blew my mind - it wasn't covered in any of my bio courses in high school, nor did any of my college friends have any direct information on it. Thus, diving into the source!Sean Carroll is a wonderful science writer, especially since he has such an academic background. Endless Forms Most Beautiful reads very differently from standard popular-science books, as it is much more concerned about cutting-edge research. Carroll writes like an academic - the book not only creates a narrative around the world of evolutionary-developmental biology, it also reads like a researcher's lecture slides in the way he organizes his information. Frequent citations to prominent researchers in the field, as well as the many figures used in the text, provide more of a ""hard science"" feel than your regular book. Despite having read Your Inner Fish by Shubin a number of years ago, Endless Forms Most Beautiful seemed to impart a stronger sense of wonder. Perhaps that's due to Carroll's writing style, both rigorous yet whimsical, or perhaps that's just due to passion Carroll has for his subject. I found especially intriguing his aside on how to raise the American conscience regarding the subject of evolution. I do hope as the years go on, more and more people will become curious about such facts of life and choose to look for themselves at these fascinating facts. "
66,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30392293-diazina,5,"This is a gorgeous book.Just before the reading session in which I finished this book, a friend and I were lamenting the lack of scientific literature that addresses the “interested layperson”; most writing is either dryly academic, or simplified to the point of inanity. This book takes a refreshing turn from both fields; it is written in a straightforward, engaging, impassioned, and yes, sometimes cheesy style that lets its audience follow right along. More experienced readers might imagine the mechanisms of transcription factors and the formation of protein channels when they are mentioned; but the “interested layperson” will be able to read the brief overview of the cast of roles involved, and continue on their merry way.I recommend this book. I recommend it to minds curious about genetics or evolution; I recommend it to minds seeking to learn about the scientific process; I recommend it to minds thirsty to understand what it means to discover, and to know the challenges and successes of research.I left science behind after years of memorizing gene codes and neural loci. This book reminded me of what it means to feel inspired by and curious about the fabric that underpins our world.Bravo, Carroll. P.S. I was inspired to read this by ASAPScience’s accapella cover ‘Evo Devo’, which is a heartfelt piece in its own right "
67,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118682994-andrew-buist,5,"A fantastic book on the developing science of Evo Devo. Carroll manages to correct the course of thought away from the incorrect assumption that evolution is primarily driven by the accumulation of totally random, proteinaceous mutations, amongst which a handful are beneficial. One change in one protein is infrequently the cause of such fervent radiation and speciation. Instead, the random accumulation of mutations of so called ""switches"" in the non-coding DNA of an organism provide upstream, much broader-stroked changes to the development and functioning of an organism. The focus of the book seems to teeter toward the start of ""Act II"", as well as a deal of exhaustive repetition in the conclusion (though I suppose the point of a conclusion is to be wholly conclusive). The continued appearance of certain ""superstar"" Hox genes (here's looking at you, Distal-less) was a pleasure to read - showing up in at-first unexpected locations across taxa. In summary, this is a fantastic introductory read, that eventually blossoms out to encompass multiple fields of ecology, anthropology and palaeontology in much narrower, academic scope - however the early chapters acts as sufficient preparation to soften the blow of certain genetic formulae and more complex Hox gene diagrams that follow. Thoroughly enjoyable, thoroughly recommend."
68,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21912688-ian,5,"Lucid and thoughtful scientific writing by an author who is clearly enthusiastic about the subject. My first read by the ""other Sean Carroll"" (depending on who you ask), and it did not disappoint. Carroll lays out why the science of evolutionary development is key to the Modern Synthesis describing how species evolve and adapt to their environments. The exposition is well-structured, unpacking the genetic mechanisms that underlie embryonic development and then exploring how genetic switches--the source of biochemical patterns of activation and inactivation--allow for an incredible variation in the number, type, and function of body parts that develop in an organism. Carroll argues that these switches and incremental modification of existing parts are the main drivers of evolution, rather than major mutational leaps which give rise to entirely novel functionality. (Incidentally, this argument has me rethinking the entire premise of X-Men.)To sum up, Carroll has written a very approachable introduction to a fascinating topic. Worth reading for anyone interested in genetics, evolution, or the craft of popular scientific writing itself."
69,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,4,"Introduced to the Evo Devo concept that ties evolution and development to unravel genetic mysteries, I was taken aback by how easy it was to understand a scholastic book that dealt with daunting terms and processes. The book takes you on a journey through the past and current diverse richness of the animal kingdom. The entire concept and working of genetic toolkits and genetic switches could be bottled in a few pages, but it was delightful to get into the applications. The book was beautifully furnished with illustrations and I personally loved the philosophical tone at the end of the book that explored active ignorance and the need for evolution of theology.Sean B Carroll maintains his tone of over-enthusiasm throughout the book which sometimes hindered my objective evaluation of how much fascination certain concepts really entail.

I think that my problem was that it promised new, new, new, but then really didn't tell me anything much that I did not already know about evolution and developmental biology. The stuff about the hox genes and the way that switches turn them on and off to form major body parts is fascinating, as is the information about how many inportant genes we share with vastly different types of organisms with whom our common ancestors go back hundreds of millions of years. And the explanation of how evolution works to change genes over time is important knowledge that everyone should understand. All of this important information is delivered in a breezy, easy to understand style. So what's not to like? I don't know. I guess I wanted more. It just overpromised and underdelivered."

He spends too long describing aspects that seemed straightforward and glosses over parts that I would have liked to know more about. Also, his language for qualitatively describing gene regulation is confusing and hard to keep straight, not least because it fails to properly acknowledge that many transcription factors regulate other transcription factors. I'm fact, his language doesn't use the words ""transcription factors"" at all, as if he is worked that sort of terminology will intimidate the lay reader. I think if you know very little about biology, this writing may work for you. However, if you are familiar with other biological and genetic topics but are new to ""Evo Devo,"" then this writing may leave you unsatisfied about this fascinating topic."

90,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35733902-ipsita,5,"This book is a brilliant introductory book on the topic of the new and fast emerging field of evo-devo by an eminent scientist of the same. One of the major tenets of this field is the evidence pointing out the fact that all the living organisms share the genetic toolkit necessary for all the processes involved in embryological development such as development of limbs, eyes (hox, pax genes) etc. The ‘dark matter’ of the genome aka the so-called junk DNA plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the genetic switches as well as progress of complexity at the molecular level as the phylogenesis moves forward in nature. Evo-devo also explains the diversity evident at the developmental stage for natural selection, defensive mechanisms such as molecular mimicry and the ever-intriguing human evolution. A must read for enthusiasts of both embryology and evolutionary biology. Anyone not interested in the technical details could just read the last chapter where Sean B. Carroll puts a striking argument in favour of evolution and the role of developmental biology in it.
For more than a century, biologists had assumed that different types of animals were genetically constructed in completely different ways. The greater the disparity in animal form, the less (if anything) the development of two animals would have in common at the level of their genes. One of the architects of the Modern Synthesis, Ernst Mayr, had written that “the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives.” But contrary to the expectations of any biologist, most of the genes first identified as governing major aspects of fruit fly body organization were found to have exact counterparts that did the same thing in most animals, including ourselves. This discovery was followed by the revelation that the development of various body parts such as eyes, limbs, and hearts, vastly different in structure among animals and long thought to have evolved in entirely different ways, was also governed by the same genes in different animals. The comparison of developmental genes between species became a new discipline at the interface of embryology and evolutionary biology—evolutionary developmental biology, or “Evo Devo” for short.By revealing the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying change, Evo Devo allows us to compare and contrast the evolutionary paths of different groups. Long-standing mysteries such as Batesian mimicry in butterflies, melanism in moths, and even the evolution of finch beak size and shape now lie within our grasp. We shall soon have detailed pictures of many of the classic examples of natural selection and understand in depth how variation arises and is selected for.

91,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42261661-lucas-g,4,"If you've ever wondered how a developing organism knows where to grow an arm or where the eyeballs are supposed to go, then this book is for you. In this book Carroll provides a glimpse into the science of evolutionary developmental biology (commonly referred to as Evo-Devo). At a high level, Evo-Devo studies how biological lifeforms develop from a single cell into a full-grown organism with a multitude of different physical characteristics. This requires tracking the expression of various genes throughout the developmental stages of different organisms. The first half of the book describes this process in detail, explaining how researchers are able to identify what genes are being activated at different physical locations at different times during development in order to produce a fully-developed organism. The impression that I walked away with is that Evo-Devo works much like a series of integrated control systems circuits. There are base programs (Hox genes) that, when activated, initiate the development of different features (arms, legs, wings, eyes, etc.) Then there are genetic switches that activate and deactivate these Hox genes at various physical locations at different times throughout development stages. Differences in the logic of these genetic switches ultimately produce the different physical features of different organisms. This is because different genetic switch logic activates the Hox genes at different locations and times during development. The second half of the book outlines specific applications of Evo-Devo. This includes discussions of butterfly wings, zebra stripes, and even the human brain. Admittedly, I did not find these discussions to be as interesting as those describing how Evo-Devo works in the first half of the book, but it was still fairly interesting. At least until the last chapter. For some reason Carroll chose to end the book with an exclamation that Evo-Devo can save science education in the United States from its current abysmal state. Right or wrong, the entire chapter seems out of place and distracts from the overall fascination of Evo-Devo created by the preceding chapters. Overall, this is an enjoyable and intriguing read. Carroll is an excellent writer, and his personality shows through his writing on even the most technical of topics."
92,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6924174-rodzilla,5,"Perhaps a difficult read for somebody without a strong background in evolution and the fundamentals of molecular biology. But this book ties together decades of developmental genetics and evolution to lead us to a much deeper understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of evolution. They key is the evolution of the arthropod body plans and transcription factors controlling spatial identity of tissues. None of this is new as of its 2005 publication, but what it offers is synthesis. Carroll brings together a very complicated picture with excellent teaching skills. An intelligent reader should come away with an understanding of how remarkably diverse body plans can evolve with relatively minor changes in regulatory gene sequences. As noted, the case is exceptionally strong with arthropods, with Drosophila leading the way. But vertebrate development is also strongly represented, though perhaps not so deeply. After all, it is much more difficult, expensive and slow to research vertebrates, not to mention the ethical barriers of researching human development. Yet, taken together, this book provides a slam dunk not for whether evolution happens - because it does. But rather what teh actual mechanisms are. An aside: this would be a great candidate for an updated edition that brings the state of the art to 2018 or 2019 rather than 2005. But even though over a decade out of date, this book is a must for anybody who wants to understand development or evolution. Truly the successor to the tradition of Stephen Jay Gould, who never had the chance to incorporate molecular and developmental genetics into his musings on the diversity of life.Minor nit pick: no mention of nematodes? Granted, homeotic genes have significantly less profound effects on the nematode body plan. And yet they still fit the theme of spatial identity and variation. Perhaps just too nuanced for what is meant for lay readers...."
93,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,5,"Superb. If you've have the general high-school version of evolution, with Darwin's natural selection and Mendel's dominant and recessive genes, then you've been exposed to the Modern Synthesis--the theory of evolution hammered out in the early twentieth century. Since roughly the eighties or nineties, evolutionary theory has been moving into the ""Extended Modern Synthesis"", and a key component of this is Evo Devo.In Endless Forms Most Beautiful, Carroll gently takes you by the hand and walks you through the main points of Evo Devo. There are two major thrusts here. First, that all of my cells have the same DNA, and most animals have roughly similar DNA, and that the major differences between species isn't what genes they do or don't have, but rather if, when, and where those genes get turned on. (This is largely driven by the establishment of a chemical-gradient based coordinate system in the embryo--Carroll explains it much more clearly than I can). The second is that a major component of evolution then becomes changes in the activation of those switches, rather than changes in the genes themselves.I guess the analogy I came up with (and please correct me if this is way off) is this. In the Modern Synthesis, the keratin that my toenails are made of is slightly different than the keratin that a rhino's toenails are made of. And over time, for various reasons, including selection pressure, the keratin in our respective toenails will diverge more and more until they are radically different. Evo devo argues that, sure, the keratin is different, but the main change is that the ""make keratin"" switch that exists in every cell in my body, but is only turned on in my toenails and other places, can be turned on by some mutation in my face, and cause me to grow a rhinoceros horn. Make sense? Not the ""what"" being made, but the if, when, and where."
94,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15625567-dmitry-zinenko,4,"The themes covered by this book are without doubt very important, and some of the chapters are very revealing.The author does a good job of being accessible to a wide range of readers with or without biological background. He covers a topic that has been fascinating me for a long time - how the complex morphology and physiology of even the simplest animal can develop out of a single cell without external intervention. Most of the time he does that in just the right amount of detail to demonstrate the general principles, which turned out to be simpler than I thought. It also discusses the important interconnection between that and the evolution, in particular evolutionary development of new species. On the negative side, the content of most chapters of the second part felt bland and repetitive to me. They closely follow the same pattern of describing an experiment, usually done in the author's lab, and explaining how it reinforces the few (however important) principles reiterated throughout this book. Personally, I was convinced already after the first introduction of those, and having to read about more examples that confirm the same thing was tedious to me. If you get the same feeling, you can skip the final third of the book and won't miss much. On the one hand, as I struggled to find some novelty in the latter chapters, I was treated again and again to the same arguments about the importance and prominence of evo devo. On the other, IMO the author missed the opportunity to examine and discuss some other implications of those revelations on, e.g., taxonomy, psychology, and ethics.Nevertheless, I definitely recommend getting acquainted with this book or at least with the topics covered by it."
95,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10726611-chunyang-ding,5,"I was directed to read this book from A Capella Science, who created a really wonderful video explaining evo-devo biology. Yet it seemed to make an incredibly bold claim - that the primary cause of evolution was not in gene mutations, but through activating and changing certain signalling genes. This blew my mind - it wasn't covered in any of my bio courses in high school, nor did any of my college friends have any direct information on it. Thus, diving into the source!Sean Carroll is a wonderful science writer, especially since he has such an academic background. Endless Forms Most Beautiful reads very differently from standard popular-science books, as it is much more concerned about cutting-edge research. Carroll writes like an academic - the book not only creates a narrative around the world of evolutionary-developmental biology, it also reads like a researcher's lecture slides in the way he organizes his information. Frequent citations to prominent researchers in the field, as well as the many figures used in the text, provide more of a ""hard science"" feel than your regular book. Despite having read Your Inner Fish by Shubin a number of years ago, Endless Forms Most Beautiful seemed to impart a stronger sense of wonder. Perhaps that's due to Carroll's writing style, both rigorous yet whimsical, or perhaps that's just due to passion Carroll has for his subject. I found especially intriguing his aside on how to raise the American conscience regarding the subject of evolution. I do hope as the years go on, more and more people will become curious about such facts of life and choose to look for themselves at these fascinating facts. "
96,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30392293-diazina,5,"This is a gorgeous book.Just before the reading session in which I finished this book, a friend and I were lamenting the lack of scientific literature that addresses the “interested layperson”; most writing is either dryly academic, or simplified to the point of inanity. This book takes a refreshing turn from both fields; it is written in a straightforward, engaging, impassioned, and yes, sometimes cheesy style that lets its audience follow right along. More experienced readers might imagine the mechanisms of transcription factors and the formation of protein channels when they are mentioned; but the “interested layperson” will be able to read the brief overview of the cast of roles involved, and continue on their merry way.I recommend this book. I recommend it to minds curious about genetics or evolution; I recommend it to minds seeking to learn about the scientific process; I recommend it to minds thirsty to understand what it means to discover, and to know the challenges and successes of research.I left science behind after years of memorizing gene codes and neural loci. This book reminded me of what it means to feel inspired by and curious about the fabric that underpins our world.Bravo, Carroll. P.S. I was inspired to read this by ASAPScience’s accapella cover ‘Evo Devo’, which is a heartfelt piece in its own right "
97,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118682994-andrew-buist,5,"A fantastic book on the developing science of Evo Devo. Carroll manages to correct the course of thought away from the incorrect assumption that evolution is primarily driven by the accumulation of totally random, proteinaceous mutations, amongst which a handful are beneficial. One change in one protein is infrequently the cause of such fervent radiation and speciation. Instead, the random accumulation of mutations of so called ""switches"" in the non-coding DNA of an organism provide upstream, much broader-stroked changes to the development and functioning of an organism. The focus of the book seems to teeter toward the start of ""Act II"", as well as a deal of exhaustive repetition in the conclusion (though I suppose the point of a conclusion is to be wholly conclusive). The continued appearance of certain ""superstar"" Hox genes (here's looking at you, Distal-less) was a pleasure to read - showing up in at-first unexpected locations across taxa. In summary, this is a fantastic introductory read, that eventually blossoms out to encompass multiple fields of ecology, anthropology and palaeontology in much narrower, academic scope - however the early chapters acts as sufficient preparation to soften the blow of certain genetic formulae and more complex Hox gene diagrams that follow. Thoroughly enjoyable, thoroughly recommend."
98,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21912688-ian,5,"Lucid and thoughtful scientific writing by an author who is clearly enthusiastic about the subject. My first read by the ""other Sean Carroll"" (depending on who you ask), and it did not disappoint. Carroll lays out why the science of evolutionary development is key to the Modern Synthesis describing how species evolve and adapt to their environments. The exposition is well-structured, unpacking the genetic mechanisms that underlie embryonic development and then exploring how genetic switches--the source of biochemical patterns of activation and inactivation--allow for an incredible variation in the number, type, and function of body parts that develop in an organism. Carroll argues that these switches and incremental modification of existing parts are the main drivers of evolution, rather than major mutational leaps which give rise to entirely novel functionality. (Incidentally, this argument has me rethinking the entire premise of X-Men.)To sum up, Carroll has written a very approachable introduction to a fascinating topic. Worth reading for anyone interested in genetics, evolution, or the craft of popular scientific writing itself."
99,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,4,"Introduced to the Evo Devo concept that ties evolution and development to unravel genetic mysteries, I was taken aback by how easy it was to understand a scholastic book that dealt with daunting terms and processes. The book takes you on a journey through the past and current diverse richness of the animal kingdom. The entire concept and working of genetic toolkits and genetic switches could be bottled in a few pages, but it was delightful to get into the applications. The book was beautifully furnished with illustrations and I personally loved the philosophical tone at the end of the book that explored active ignorance and the need for evolution of theology.Sean B Carroll maintains his tone of over-enthusiasm throughout the book which sometimes hindered my objective evaluation of how much fascination certain concepts really entail. Nonetheless, the book was well-organized, articulate, and didn't lose my attention - which is something I cannot say for most science non-fictional reads."

I think that my problem was that it promised new, new, new, but then really didn't tell me anything much that I did not already know about evolution and developmental biology. The stuff about the hox genes and the way that switches turn them on and off to form major body parts is fascinating, as is the information about how many inportant genes we share with vastly different types of organisms with whom our common ancestors go back hundreds of millions of years. And the explanation of how evolution works to change genes over time is important knowledge that everyone should understand. All of this important information is delivered in a breezy, easy to understand style. So what's not to like? I don't know. I guess I wanted more. It just overpromised and underdelivered."

He spends too long describing aspects that seemed straightforward and glosses over parts that I would have liked to know more about. Also, his language for qualitatively describing gene regulation is confusing and hard to keep straight, not least because it fails to properly acknowledge that many transcription factors regulate other transcription factors. I'm fact, his language doesn't use the words ""transcription factors"" at all, as if he is worked that sort of terminology will intimidate the lay reader. I think if you know very little about biology, this writing may work for you. However, if you are familiar with other biological and genetic topics but are new to ""Evo Devo,"" then this writing may leave you unsatisfied about this fascinating topic."

The first half of the book describes this process in detail, explaining how researchers are able to identify what genes are being activated at different physical locations at different times during development in order to produce a fully-developed organism. The impression that I walked away with is that Evo-Devo works much like a series of integrated control systems circuits. There are base programs (Hox genes) that, when activated, initiate the development of different features (arms, legs, wings, eyes, etc.) Then there are genetic switches that activate and deactivate these Hox genes at various physical locations at different times throughout development stages. Differences in the logic of these genetic switches ultimately produce the different physical features of different organisms. This is because different genetic switch logic activates the Hox genes at different locations and times during development. The second half of the book outlines specific applications of Evo-Devo. This includes discussions of butterfly wings, zebra stripes, and even the human brain. Admittedly, I did not find these discussions to be as interesting as those describing how Evo-Devo works in the first half of the book, but it was still fairly interesting. At least until the last chapter. For some reason Carroll chose to end the book with an exclamation that Evo-Devo can save science education in the United States from its current abysmal state. Right or wrong, the entire chapter seems out of place and distracts from the overall fascination of Evo-Devo created by the preceding chapters. Overall, this is an enjoyable and intriguing read. Carroll is an excellent writer, and his personality shows through his writing on even the most technical of topics."

None of this is new as of its 2005 publication, but what it offers is synthesis. Carroll brings together a very complicated picture with excellent teaching skills.

123,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,5,"Superb. If you've have the general high-school version of evolution, with Darwin's natural selection and Mendel's dominant and recessive genes, then you've been exposed to the Modern Synthesis--the theory of evolution hammered out in the early twentieth century. Since roughly the eighties or nineties, evolutionary theory has been moving into the ""Extended Modern Synthesis"", and a key component of this is Evo Devo.In Endless Forms Most Beautiful, Carroll gently takes you by the hand and walks you through the main points of Evo Devo. There are two major thrusts here. First, that all of my cells have the same DNA, and most animals have roughly similar DNA, and that the major differences between species isn't what genes they do or don't have, but rather if, when, and where those genes get turned on. (This is largely driven by the establishment of a chemical-gradient based coordinate system in the embryo--Carroll explains it much more clearly than I can). The second is that a major component of evolution then becomes changes in the activation of those switches, rather than changes in the genes themselves.I guess the analogy I came up with (and please correct me if this is way off) is this. In the Modern Synthesis, the keratin that my toenails are made of is slightly different than the keratin that a rhino's toenails are made of. And over time, for various reasons, including selection pressure, the keratin in our respective toenails will diverge more and more until they are radically different. Evo devo argues that, sure, the keratin is different, but the main change is that the ""make keratin"" switch that exists in every cell in my body, but is only turned on in my toenails and other places, can be turned on by some mutation in my face, and cause me to grow a rhinoceros horn. Make sense? Not the ""what"" being made, but the if, when, and where."
124,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15625567-dmitry-zinenko,4,"The themes covered by this book are without doubt very important, and some of the chapters are very revealing.The author does a good job of being accessible to a wide range of readers with or without biological background. He covers a topic that has been fascinating me for a long time - how the complex morphology and physiology of even the simplest animal can develop out of a single cell without external intervention. Most of the time he does that in just the right amount of detail to demonstrate the general principles, which turned out to be simpler than I thought. It also discusses the important interconnection between that and the evolution, in particular evolutionary development of new species. On the negative side, the content of most chapters of the second part felt bland and repetitive to me. They closely follow the same pattern of describing an experiment, usually done in the author's lab, and explaining how it reinforces the few (however important) principles reiterated throughout this book. Personally, I was convinced already after the first introduction of those, and having to read about more examples that confirm the same thing was tedious to me. If you get the same feeling, you can skip the final third of the book and won't miss much. On the one hand, as I struggled to find some novelty in the latter chapters, I was treated again and again to the same arguments about the importance and prominence of evo devo. On the other, IMO the author missed the opportunity to examine and discuss some other implications of those revelations on, e.g., taxonomy, psychology, and ethics.Nevertheless, I definitely recommend getting acquainted with this book or at least with the topics covered by it."
125,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10726611-chunyang-ding,5,"I was directed to read this book from A Capella Science, who created a really wonderful video explaining evo-devo biology. Yet it seemed to make an incredibly bold claim - that the primary cause of evolution was not in gene mutations, but through activating and changing certain signalling genes. This blew my mind - it wasn't covered in any of my bio courses in high school, nor did any of my college friends have any direct information on it. Thus, diving into the source!Sean Carroll is a wonderful science writer, especially since he has such an academic background. Endless Forms Most Beautiful reads very differently from standard popular-science books, as it is much more concerned about cutting-edge research. Carroll writes like an academic - the book not only creates a narrative around the world of evolutionary-developmental biology, it also reads like a researcher's lecture slides in the way he organizes his information. Frequent citations to prominent researchers in the field, as well as the many figures used in the text, provide more of a ""hard science"" feel than your regular book. Despite having read Your Inner Fish by Shubin a number of years ago, Endless Forms Most Beautiful seemed to impart a stronger sense of wonder. Perhaps that's due to Carroll's writing style, both rigorous yet whimsical, or perhaps that's just due to passion Carroll has for his subject. I found especially intriguing his aside on how to raise the American conscience regarding the subject of evolution. I do hope as the years go on, more and more people will become curious about such facts of life and choose to look for themselves at these fascinating facts. "
126,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30392293-diazina,5,"This is a gorgeous book.Just before the reading session in which I finished this book, a friend and I were lamenting the lack of scientific literature that addresses the “interested layperson”; most writing is either dryly academic, or simplified to the point of inanity. This book takes a refreshing turn from both fields; it is written in a straightforward, engaging, impassioned, and yes, sometimes cheesy style that lets its audience follow right along. More experienced readers might imagine the mechanisms of transcription factors and the formation of protein channels when they are mentioned; but the “interested layperson” will be able to read the brief overview of the cast of roles involved, and continue on their merry way.I recommend this book. I recommend it to minds curious about genetics or evolution; I recommend it to minds seeking to learn about the scientific process; I recommend it to minds thirsty to understand what it means to discover, and to know the challenges and successes of research.I left science behind after years of memorizing gene codes and neural loci. This book reminded me of what it means to feel inspired by and curious about the fabric that underpins our world.Bravo, Carroll. P.S. I was inspired to read this by ASAPScience’s accapella cover ‘Evo Devo’, which is a heartfelt piece in its own right "
127,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118682994-andrew-buist,5,"A fantastic book on the developing science of Evo Devo. Carroll manages to correct the course of thought away from the incorrect assumption that evolution is primarily driven by the accumulation of totally random, proteinaceous mutations, amongst which a handful are beneficial. One change in one protein is infrequently the cause of such fervent radiation and speciation. Instead, the random accumulation of mutations of so called ""switches"" in the non-coding DNA of an organism provide upstream, much broader-stroked changes to the development and functioning of an organism. The focus of the book seems to teeter toward the start of ""Act II"", as well as a deal of exhaustive repetition in the conclusion (though I suppose the point of a conclusion is to be wholly conclusive). The continued appearance of certain ""superstar"" Hox genes (here's looking at you, Distal-less) was a pleasure to read - showing up in at-first unexpected locations across taxa. In summary, this is a fantastic introductory read, that eventually blossoms out to encompass multiple fields of ecology, anthropology and palaeontology in much narrower, academic scope - however the early chapters acts as sufficient preparation to soften the blow of certain genetic formulae and more complex Hox gene diagrams that follow. Thoroughly enjoyable, thoroughly recommend."
128,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21912688-ian,5,"Lucid and thoughtful scientific writing by an author who is clearly enthusiastic about the subject. My first read by the ""other Sean Carroll"" (depending on who you ask), and it did not disappoint. Carroll lays out why the science of evolutionary development is key to the Modern Synthesis describing how species evolve and adapt to their environments. The exposition is well-structured, unpacking the genetic mechanisms that underlie embryonic development and then exploring how genetic switches--the source of biochemical patterns of activation and inactivation--allow for an incredible variation in the number, type, and function of body parts that develop in an organism. Carroll argues that these switches and incremental modification of existing parts are the main drivers of evolution, rather than major mutational leaps which give rise to entirely novel functionality. (Incidentally, this argument has me rethinking the entire premise of X-Men.)To sum up, Carroll has written a very approachable introduction to a fascinating topic. Worth reading for anyone interested in genetics, evolution, or the craft of popular scientific writing itself."
129,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,4,"Introduced to the Evo Devo concept that ties evolution and development to unravel genetic mysteries, I was taken aback by how easy it was to understand a scholastic book that dealt with daunting terms and processes. The book takes you on a journey through the past and current diverse richness of the animal kingdom. The entire concept and working of genetic toolkits and genetic switches could be bottled in a few pages, but it was delightful to get into the applications. The book was beautifully furnished with illustrations and I personally loved the philosophical tone at the end of the book that explored active ignorance and the need for evolution of theology.Sean B Carroll maintains his tone of over-enthusiasm throughout the book which sometimes hindered my objective evaluation of how much fascination certain concepts really entail. Nonetheless, the book was well-organized, articulate, and didn't lose my attention - which is something I cannot say for most science non-fictional reads."
130,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,3,"I have a non-specific sense of disappointment about this book. I'm not sure why. There was nothing really wrong with it. I think that my problem was that it promised new, new, new, but then really didn't tell me anything much that I did not already know about evolution and developmental biology. The stuff about the hox genes and the way that switches turn them on and off to form major body parts is fascinating, as is the information about how many inportant genes we share with vastly different types of organisms with whom our common ancestors go back hundreds of millions of years. And the explanation of how evolution works to change genes over time is important knowledge that everyone should understand. All of this important information is delivered in a breezy, easy to understand style. So what's not to like? I don't know. I guess I wanted more. It just overpromised and underdelivered."

He spends too long describing aspects that seemed straightforward and glosses over parts that I would have liked to know more about. Also, his language for qualitatively describing gene regulation is confusing and hard to keep straight, not least because it fails to properly acknowledge that many transcription factors regulate other transcription factors. I'm fact, his language doesn't use the words ""transcription factors"" at all, as if he is worked that sort of terminology will intimidate the lay reader. I think if you know very little about biology, this writing may work for you. However, if you are familiar with other biological and genetic topics but are new to ""Evo Devo,"" then this writing may leave you unsatisfied about this fascinating topic."

Carroll manages to explain such complex biology in ways that a novice can easily understand (which is super hard!). His witty, yet hilarious at times, writing style makes this non-fiction book really entertaining.

150,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35733902-ipsita,5,"This book is a brilliant introductory book on the topic of the new and fast emerging field of evo-devo by an eminent scientist of the same. One of the major tenets of this field is the evidence pointing out the fact that all the living organisms share the genetic toolkit necessary for all the processes involved in embryological development such as development of limbs, eyes (hox, pax genes) etc. The ‘dark matter’ of the genome aka the so-called junk DNA plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the genetic switches as well as progress of complexity at the molecular level as the phylogenesis moves forward in nature. Evo-devo also explains the diversity evident at the developmental stage for natural selection, defensive mechanisms such as molecular mimicry and the ever-intriguing human evolution. A must read for enthusiasts of both embryology and evolutionary biology. Anyone not interested in the technical details could just read the last chapter where Sean B. Carroll puts a striking argument in favour of evolution and the role of developmental biology in it.
For more than a century, biologists had assumed that different types of animals were genetically constructed in completely different ways. The greater the disparity in animal form, the less (if anything) the development of two animals would have in common at the level of their genes. One of the architects of the Modern Synthesis, Ernst Mayr, had written that “the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives.” But contrary to the expectations of any biologist, most of the genes first identified as governing major aspects of fruit fly body organization were found to have exact counterparts that did the same thing in most animals, including ourselves. This discovery was followed by the revelation that the development of various body parts such as eyes, limbs, and hearts, vastly different in structure among animals and long thought to have evolved in entirely different ways, was also governed by the same genes in different animals. The comparison of developmental genes between species became a new discipline at the interface of embryology and evolutionary biology—evolutionary developmental biology, or “Evo Devo” for short.By revealing the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying change, Evo Devo allows us to compare and contrast the evolutionary paths of different groups. Long-standing mysteries such as Batesian mimicry in butterflies, melanism in moths, and even the evolution of finch beak size and shape now lie within our grasp. We shall soon have detailed pictures of many of the classic examples of natural selection and understand in depth how variation arises and is selected for.

Most of the time he does that in just the right amount of detail to demonstrate the general principles, which turned out to be simpler than I thought. It also discusses the important interconnection between that and the evolution, in particular evolutionary development of new species. On the negative side, the content of most chapters of the second part felt bland and repetitive to me.

Carroll manages to correct the course of thought away from the incorrect assumption that evolution is primarily driven by the accumulation of totally random, proteinaceous mutations, amongst which a handful are beneficial. One change in one protein is infrequently the cause of such fervent radiation and speciation. Instead, the random accumulation of mutations of so called ""switches"" in the non-coding DNA of an organism provide upstream, much broader-stroked changes to the development and functioning of an organism. The focus of the book seems to teeter toward the start of ""Act II"", as well as a deal of exhaustive repetition in the conclusion (though I suppose the point of a conclusion is to be wholly conclusive). The continued appearance of certain ""superstar"" Hox genes (here's looking at you, Distal-less) was a pleasure to read - showing up in at-first unexpected locations across taxa. In summary, this is a fantastic introductory read, that eventually blossoms out to encompass multiple fields of ecology, anthropology and palaeontology in much narrower, academic scope - however the early chapters acts as sufficient preparation to soften the blow of certain genetic formulae and more complex Hox gene diagrams that follow. Thoroughly enjoyable, thoroughly recommend."

My first read by the ""other Sean Carroll"" (depending on who you ask), and it did not disappoint. Carroll lays out why the science of evolutionary development is key to the Modern Synthesis describing how species evolve and adapt to their environments. The exposition is well-structured, unpacking the genetic mechanisms that underlie embryonic development and then exploring how genetic switches--the source of biochemical patterns of activation and inactivation--allow for an incredible variation in the number, type, and function of body parts that develop in an organism. Carroll argues that these switches and incremental modification of existing parts are the main drivers of evolution, rather than major mutational leaps which give rise to entirely novel functionality. (Incidentally, this argument has me rethinking the entire premise of X-Men.)To sum up, Carroll has written a very approachable introduction to a fascinating topic. Worth reading for anyone interested in genetics, evolution, or the craft of popular scientific writing itself."

The book takes you on a journey through the past and current diverse richness of the animal kingdom. The entire concept and working of genetic toolkits and genetic switches could be bottled in a few pages, but it was delightful to get into the applications. The book was beautifully furnished with illustrations and I personally loved the philosophical tone at the end of the book that explored active ignorance and the need for evolution of theology.Sean B Carroll maintains his tone of over-enthusiasm throughout the book which sometimes hindered my objective evaluation of how much fascination certain concepts really entail. Nonetheless, the book was well-organized, articulate, and didn't lose my attention - which is something I cannot say for most science non-fictional reads."

I think that my problem was that it promised new, new, new, but then really didn't tell me anything much that I did not already know about evolution and developmental biology. The stuff about the hox genes and the way that switches turn them on and off to form major body parts is fascinating, as is the information about how many inportant genes we share with vastly different types of organisms with whom our common ancestors go back hundreds of millions of years. And the explanation of how evolution works to change genes over time is important knowledge that everyone should understand. All of this important information is delivered in a breezy, easy to understand style. So what's not to like? I don't know. I guess I wanted more. It just overpromised and underdelivered."

He spends too long describing aspects that seemed straightforward and glosses over parts that I would have liked to know more about. Also, his language for qualitatively describing gene regulation is confusing and hard to keep straight, not least because it fails to properly acknowledge that many transcription factors regulate other transcription factors. I'm fact, his language doesn't use the words ""transcription factors"" at all, as if he is worked that sort of terminology will intimidate the lay reader. I think if you know very little about biology, this writing may work for you. However, if you are familiar with other biological and genetic topics but are new to ""Evo Devo,"" then this writing may leave you unsatisfied about this fascinating topic."

180,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35733902-ipsita,5,"This book is a brilliant introductory book on the topic of the new and fast emerging field of evo-devo by an eminent scientist of the same. One of the major tenets of this field is the evidence pointing out the fact that all the living organisms share the genetic toolkit necessary for all the processes involved in embryological development such as development of limbs, eyes (hox, pax genes) etc. The ‘dark matter’ of the genome aka the so-called junk DNA plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the genetic switches as well as progress of complexity at the molecular level as the phylogenesis moves forward in nature. Evo-devo also explains the diversity evident at the developmental stage for natural selection, defensive mechanisms such as molecular mimicry and the ever-intriguing human evolution. A must read for enthusiasts of both embryology and evolutionary biology. Anyone not interested in the technical details could just read the last chapter where Sean B. Carroll puts a striking argument in favour of evolution and the role of developmental biology in it.
For more than a century, biologists had assumed that different types of animals were genetically constructed in completely different ways. The greater the disparity in animal form, the less (if anything) the development of two animals would have in common at the level of their genes. One of the architects of the Modern Synthesis, Ernst Mayr, had written that “the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives.” But contrary to the expectations of any biologist, most of the genes first identified as governing major aspects of fruit fly body organization were found to have exact counterparts that did the same thing in most animals, including ourselves. This discovery was followed by the revelation that the development of various body parts such as eyes, limbs, and hearts, vastly different in structure among animals and long thought to have evolved in entirely different ways, was also governed by the same genes in different animals. The comparison of developmental genes between species became a new discipline at the interface of embryology and evolutionary biology—evolutionary developmental biology, or “Evo Devo” for short.By revealing the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying change, Evo Devo allows us to compare and contrast the evolutionary paths of different groups. Long-standing mysteries such as Batesian mimicry in butterflies, melanism in moths, and even the evolution of finch beak size and shape now lie within our grasp. We shall soon have detailed pictures of many of the classic examples of natural selection and understand in depth how variation arises and is selected for.

181,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42261661-lucas-g,4,"If you've ever wondered how a developing organism knows where to grow an arm or where the eyeballs are supposed to go, then this book is for you. In this book Carroll provides a glimpse into the science of evolutionary developmental biology (commonly referred to as Evo-Devo). At a high level, Evo-Devo studies how biological lifeforms develop from a single cell into a full-grown organism with a multitude of different physical characteristics. This requires tracking the expression of various genes throughout the developmental stages of different organisms. The first half of the book describes this process in detail, explaining how researchers are able to identify what genes are being activated at different physical locations at different times during development in order to produce a fully-developed organism. The impression that I walked away with is that Evo-Devo works much like a series of integrated control systems circuits. There are base programs (Hox genes) that, when activated, initiate the development of different features (arms, legs, wings, eyes, etc.) Then there are genetic switches that activate and deactivate these Hox genes at various physical locations at different times throughout development stages. Differences in the logic of these genetic switches ultimately produce the different physical features of different organisms. This is because different genetic switch logic activates the Hox genes at different locations and times during development. The second half of the book outlines specific applications of Evo-Devo. This includes discussions of butterfly wings, zebra stripes, and even the human brain. Admittedly, I did not find these discussions to be as interesting as those describing how Evo-Devo works in the first half of the book, but it was still fairly interesting. At least until the last chapter. For some reason Carroll chose to end the book with an exclamation that Evo-Devo can save science education in the United States from its current abysmal state. Right or wrong, the entire chapter seems out of place and distracts from the overall fascination of Evo-Devo created by the preceding chapters. Overall, this is an enjoyable and intriguing read. Carroll is an excellent writer, and his personality shows through his writing on even the most technical of topics."
182,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6924174-rodzilla,5,"Perhaps a difficult read for somebody without a strong background in evolution and the fundamentals of molecular biology. But this book ties together decades of developmental genetics and evolution to lead us to a much deeper understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of evolution. They key is the evolution of the arthropod body plans and transcription factors controlling spatial identity of tissues. None of this is new as of its 2005 publication, but what it offers is synthesis. Carroll brings together a very complicated picture with excellent teaching skills. An intelligent reader should come away with an understanding of how remarkably diverse body plans can evolve with relatively minor changes in regulatory gene sequences. As noted, the case is exceptionally strong with arthropods, with Drosophila leading the way. But vertebrate development is also strongly represented, though perhaps not so deeply. After all, it is much more difficult, expensive and slow to research vertebrates, not to mention the ethical barriers of researching human development. Yet, taken together, this book provides a slam dunk not for whether evolution happens - because it does. But rather what teh actual mechanisms are. An aside: this would be a great candidate for an updated edition that brings the state of the art to 2018 or 2019 rather than 2005. But even though over a decade out of date, this book is a must for anybody who wants to understand development or evolution. Truly the successor to the tradition of Stephen Jay Gould, who never had the chance to incorporate molecular and developmental genetics into his musings on the diversity of life.Minor nit pick: no mention of nematodes? Granted, homeotic genes have significantly less profound effects on the nematode body plan. And yet they still fit the theme of spatial identity and variation. Perhaps just too nuanced for what is meant for lay readers...."
183,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,5,"Superb. If you've have the general high-school version of evolution, with Darwin's natural selection and Mendel's dominant and recessive genes, then you've been exposed to the Modern Synthesis--the theory of evolution hammered out in the early twentieth century. Since roughly the eighties or nineties, evolutionary theory has been moving into the ""Extended Modern Synthesis"", and a key component of this is Evo Devo.In Endless Forms Most Beautiful, Carroll gently takes you by the hand and walks you through the main points of Evo Devo. There are two major thrusts here. First, that all of my cells have the same DNA, and most animals have roughly similar DNA, and that the major differences between species isn't what genes they do or don't have, but rather if, when, and where those genes get turned on. (This is largely driven by the establishment of a chemical-gradient based coordinate system in the embryo--Carroll explains it much more clearly than I can). The second is that a major component of evolution then becomes changes in the activation of those switches, rather than changes in the genes themselves.I guess the analogy I came up with (and please correct me if this is way off) is this. In the Modern Synthesis, the keratin that my toenails are made of is slightly different than the keratin that a rhino's toenails are made of. And over time, for various reasons, including selection pressure, the keratin in our respective toenails will diverge more and more until they are radically different. Evo devo argues that, sure, the keratin is different, but the main change is that the ""make keratin"" switch that exists in every cell in my body, but is only turned on in my toenails and other places, can be turned on by some mutation in my face, and cause me to grow a rhinoceros horn. Make sense? Not the ""what"" being made, but the if, when, and where."

The focus of the book seems to teeter toward the start of ""Act II"", as well as a deal of exhaustive repetition in the conclusion (though I suppose the point of a conclusion is to be wholly conclusive). The continued appearance of certain ""superstar"" Hox genes (here's looking at you, Distal-less) was a pleasure to read - showing up in at-first unexpected locations across taxa. In summary, this is a fantastic introductory read, that eventually blossoms out to encompass multiple fields of ecology, anthropology and palaeontology in much narrower, academic scope - however the early chapters acts as sufficient preparation to soften the blow of certain genetic formulae and more complex Hox gene diagrams that follow. Thoroughly enjoyable, thoroughly recommend."

The exposition is well-structured, unpacking the genetic mechanisms that underlie embryonic development and then exploring how genetic switches--the source of biochemical patterns of activation and inactivation--allow for an incredible variation in the number, type, and function of body parts that develop in an organism. Carroll argues that these switches and incremental modification of existing parts are the main drivers of evolution, rather than major mutational leaps which give rise to entirely novel functionality.

210,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35733902-ipsita,5,"This book is a brilliant introductory book on the topic of the new and fast emerging field of evo-devo by an eminent scientist of the same. One of the major tenets of this field is the evidence pointing out the fact that all the living organisms share the genetic toolkit necessary for all the processes involved in embryological development such as development of limbs, eyes (hox, pax genes) etc. The ‘dark matter’ of the genome aka the so-called junk DNA plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the genetic switches as well as progress of complexity at the molecular level as the phylogenesis moves forward in nature. Evo-devo also explains the diversity evident at the developmental stage for natural selection, defensive mechanisms such as molecular mimicry and the ever-intriguing human evolution. A must read for enthusiasts of both embryology and evolutionary biology. Anyone not interested in the technical details could just read the last chapter where Sean B. Carroll puts a striking argument in favour of evolution and the role of developmental biology in it.
For more than a century, biologists had assumed that different types of animals were genetically constructed in completely different ways. The greater the disparity in animal form, the less (if anything) the development of two animals would have in common at the level of their genes. One of the architects of the Modern Synthesis, Ernst Mayr, had written that “the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives.” But contrary to the expectations of any biologist, most of the genes first identified as governing major aspects of fruit fly body organization were found to have exact counterparts that did the same thing in most animals, including ourselves. This discovery was followed by the revelation that the development of various body parts such as eyes, limbs, and hearts, vastly different in structure among animals and long thought to have evolved in entirely different ways, was also governed by the same genes in different animals. The comparison of developmental genes between species became a new discipline at the interface of embryology and evolutionary biology—evolutionary developmental biology, or “Evo Devo” for short.By revealing the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying change, Evo Devo allows us to compare and contrast the evolutionary paths of different groups. Long-standing mysteries such as Batesian mimicry in butterflies, melanism in moths, and even the evolution of finch beak size and shape now lie within our grasp. We shall soon have detailed pictures of many of the classic examples of natural selection and understand in depth how variation arises and is selected for.

211,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42261661-lucas-g,4,"If you've ever wondered how a developing organism knows where to grow an arm or where the eyeballs are supposed to go, then this book is for you. In this book Carroll provides a glimpse into the science of evolutionary developmental biology (commonly referred to as Evo-Devo). At a high level, Evo-Devo studies how biological lifeforms develop from a single cell into a full-grown organism with a multitude of different physical characteristics. This requires tracking the expression of various genes throughout the developmental stages of different organisms. The first half of the book describes this process in detail, explaining how researchers are able to identify what genes are being activated at different physical locations at different times during development in order to produce a fully-developed organism. The impression that I walked away with is that Evo-Devo works much like a series of integrated control systems circuits. There are base programs (Hox genes) that, when activated, initiate the development of different features (arms, legs, wings, eyes, etc.) Then there are genetic switches that activate and deactivate these Hox genes at various physical locations at different times throughout development stages. Differences in the logic of these genetic switches ultimately produce the different physical features of different organisms. This is because different genetic switch logic activates the Hox genes at different locations and times during development. The second half of the book outlines specific applications of Evo-Devo. This includes discussions of butterfly wings, zebra stripes, and even the human brain. Admittedly, I did not find these discussions to be as interesting as those describing how Evo-Devo works in the first half of the book, but it was still fairly interesting. At least until the last chapter. For some reason Carroll chose to end the book with an exclamation that Evo-Devo can save science education in the United States from its current abysmal state. Right or wrong, the entire chapter seems out of place and distracts from the overall fascination of Evo-Devo created by the preceding chapters. Overall, this is an enjoyable and intriguing read. Carroll is an excellent writer, and his personality shows through his writing on even the most technical of topics."
212,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6924174-rodzilla,5,"Perhaps a difficult read for somebody without a strong background in evolution and the fundamentals of molecular biology. But this book ties together decades of developmental genetics and evolution to lead us to a much deeper understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of evolution. They key is the evolution of the arthropod body plans and transcription factors controlling spatial identity of tissues. None of this is new as of its 2005 publication, but what it offers is synthesis. Carroll brings together a very complicated picture with excellent teaching skills. An intelligent reader should come away with an understanding of how remarkably diverse body plans can evolve with relatively minor changes in regulatory gene sequences. As noted, the case is exceptionally strong with arthropods, with Drosophila leading the way. But vertebrate development is also strongly represented, though perhaps not so deeply. After all, it is much more difficult, expensive and slow to research vertebrates, not to mention the ethical barriers of researching human development. Yet, taken together, this book provides a slam dunk not for whether evolution happens - because it does. But rather what teh actual mechanisms are. An aside: this would be a great candidate for an updated edition that brings the state of the art to 2018 or 2019 rather than 2005. But even though over a decade out of date, this book is a must for anybody who wants to understand development or evolution. Truly the successor to the tradition of Stephen Jay Gould, who never had the chance to incorporate molecular and developmental genetics into his musings on the diversity of life.Minor nit pick: no mention of nematodes? Granted, homeotic genes have significantly less profound effects on the nematode body plan. And yet they still fit the theme of spatial identity and variation. Perhaps just too nuanced for what is meant for lay readers...."
213,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,5,"Superb. If you've have the general high-school version of evolution, with Darwin's natural selection and Mendel's dominant and recessive genes, then you've been exposed to the Modern Synthesis--the theory of evolution hammered out in the early twentieth century. Since roughly the eighties or nineties, evolutionary theory has been moving into the ""Extended Modern Synthesis"", and a key component of this is Evo Devo.In Endless Forms Most Beautiful, Carroll gently takes you by the hand and walks you through the main points of Evo Devo. There are two major thrusts here. First, that all of my cells have the same DNA, and most animals have roughly similar DNA, and that the major differences between species isn't what genes they do or don't have, but rather if, when, and where those genes get turned on. (This is largely driven by the establishment of a chemical-gradient based coordinate system in the embryo--Carroll explains it much more clearly than I can). The second is that a major component of evolution then becomes changes in the activation of those switches, rather than changes in the genes themselves.I guess the analogy I came up with (and please correct me if this is way off) is this. In the Modern Synthesis, the keratin that my toenails are made of is slightly different than the keratin that a rhino's toenails are made of. And over time, for various reasons, including selection pressure, the keratin in our respective toenails will diverge more and more until they are radically different. Evo devo argues that, sure, the keratin is different, but the main change is that the ""make keratin"" switch that exists in every cell in my body, but is only turned on in my toenails and other places, can be turned on by some mutation in my face, and cause me to grow a rhinoceros horn. Make sense? Not the ""what"" being made, but the if, when, and where."

He covers a topic that has been fascinating me for a long time - how the complex morphology and physiology of even the simplest animal can develop out of a single cell without external intervention. Most of the time he does that in just the right amount of detail to demonstrate the general principles, which turned out to be simpler than I thought. It also discusses the important interconnection between that and the evolution, in particular evolutionary development of new species. On the negative side, the content of most chapters of the second part felt bland and repetitive to me. They closely follow the same pattern of describing an experiment, usually done in the author's lab, and explaining how it reinforces the few (however important) principles reiterated throughout this book. Personally, I was convinced already after the first introduction of those, and having to read about more examples that confirm the same thing was tedious to me. If you get the same feeling, you can skip the final third of the book and won't miss much. On the one hand, as I struggled to find some novelty in the latter chapters, I was treated again and again to the same arguments about the importance and prominence of evo devo. On the other, IMO the author missed the opportunity to examine and discuss some other implications of those revelations on, e.g., taxonomy, psychology, and ethics.Nevertheless, I definitely recommend getting acquainted with this book or at least with the topics covered by it."

Yet it seemed to make an incredibly bold claim - that the primary cause of evolution was not in gene mutations, but through activating and changing certain signalling genes. This blew my mind - it wasn't covered in any of my bio courses in high school, nor did any of my college friends have any direct information on it. Thus, diving into the source!Sean Carroll is a wonderful science writer, especially since he has such an academic background. Endless Forms Most Beautiful reads very differently from standard popular-science books, as it is much more concerned about cutting-edge research. Carroll writes like an academic - the book not only creates a narrative around the world of evolutionary-developmental biology, it also reads like a researcher's lecture slides in the way he organizes his information. Frequent citations to prominent researchers in the field, as well as the many figures used in the text, provide more of a ""hard science"" feel than your regular book. Despite having read Your Inner Fish by Shubin a number of years ago, Endless Forms Most Beautiful seemed to impart a stronger sense of wonder. Perhaps that's due to Carroll's writing style, both rigorous yet whimsical, or perhaps that's just due to passion Carroll has for his subject. I found especially intriguing his aside on how to raise the American conscience regarding the subject of evolution. I do hope as the years go on, more and more people will become curious about such facts of life and choose to look for themselves at these fascinating facts. "

I recommend it to minds curious about genetics or evolution; I recommend it to minds seeking to learn about the scientific process; I recommend it to minds thirsty to understand what it means to discover, and to know the challenges and successes of research.I left science behind after years of memorizing gene codes and neural loci.

240,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35733902-ipsita,5,"This book is a brilliant introductory book on the topic of the new and fast emerging field of evo-devo by an eminent scientist of the same. One of the major tenets of this field is the evidence pointing out the fact that all the living organisms share the genetic toolkit necessary for all the processes involved in embryological development such as development of limbs, eyes (hox, pax genes) etc. The ‘dark matter’ of the genome aka the so-called junk DNA plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the genetic switches as well as progress of complexity at the molecular level as the phylogenesis moves forward in nature. Evo-devo also explains the diversity evident at the developmental stage for natural selection, defensive mechanisms such as molecular mimicry and the ever-intriguing human evolution. A must read for enthusiasts of both embryology and evolutionary biology. Anyone not interested in the technical details could just read the last chapter where Sean B. Carroll puts a striking argument in favour of evolution and the role of developmental biology in it.
For more than a century, biologists had assumed that different types of animals were genetically constructed in completely different ways. The greater the disparity in animal form, the less (if anything) the development of two animals would have in common at the level of their genes. One of the architects of the Modern Synthesis, Ernst Mayr, had written that “the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives.” But contrary to the expectations of any biologist, most of the genes first identified as governing major aspects of fruit fly body organization were found to have exact counterparts that did the same thing in most animals, including ourselves. This discovery was followed by the revelation that the development of various body parts such as eyes, limbs, and hearts, vastly different in structure among animals and long thought to have evolved in entirely different ways, was also governed by the same genes in different animals. The comparison of developmental genes between species became a new discipline at the interface of embryology and evolutionary biology—evolutionary developmental biology, or “Evo Devo” for short.By revealing the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying change, Evo Devo allows us to compare and contrast the evolutionary paths of different groups. Long-standing mysteries such as Batesian mimicry in butterflies, melanism in moths, and even the evolution of finch beak size and shape now lie within our grasp. We shall soon have detailed pictures of many of the classic examples of natural selection and understand in depth how variation arises and is selected for.

241,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42261661-lucas-g,4,"If you've ever wondered how a developing organism knows where to grow an arm or where the eyeballs are supposed to go, then this book is for you. In this book Carroll provides a glimpse into the science of evolutionary developmental biology (commonly referred to as Evo-Devo). At a high level, Evo-Devo studies how biological lifeforms develop from a single cell into a full-grown organism with a multitude of different physical characteristics. This requires tracking the expression of various genes throughout the developmental stages of different organisms. The first half of the book describes this process in detail, explaining how researchers are able to identify what genes are being activated at different physical locations at different times during development in order to produce a fully-developed organism. The impression that I walked away with is that Evo-Devo works much like a series of integrated control systems circuits. There are base programs (Hox genes) that, when activated, initiate the development of different features (arms, legs, wings, eyes, etc.) Then there are genetic switches that activate and deactivate these Hox genes at various physical locations at different times throughout development stages. Differences in the logic of these genetic switches ultimately produce the different physical features of different organisms. This is because different genetic switch logic activates the Hox genes at different locations and times during development. The second half of the book outlines specific applications of Evo-Devo. This includes discussions of butterfly wings, zebra stripes, and even the human brain. Admittedly, I did not find these discussions to be as interesting as those describing how Evo-Devo works in the first half of the book, but it was still fairly interesting. At least until the last chapter. For some reason Carroll chose to end the book with an exclamation that Evo-Devo can save science education in the United States from its current abysmal state. Right or wrong, the entire chapter seems out of place and distracts from the overall fascination of Evo-Devo created by the preceding chapters. Overall, this is an enjoyable and intriguing read. Carroll is an excellent writer, and his personality shows through his writing on even the most technical of topics."
242,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6924174-rodzilla,5,"Perhaps a difficult read for somebody without a strong background in evolution and the fundamentals of molecular biology. But this book ties together decades of developmental genetics and evolution to lead us to a much deeper understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of evolution. They key is the evolution of the arthropod body plans and transcription factors controlling spatial identity of tissues. None of this is new as of its 2005 publication, but what it offers is synthesis. Carroll brings together a very complicated picture with excellent teaching skills. An intelligent reader should come away with an understanding of how remarkably diverse body plans can evolve with relatively minor changes in regulatory gene sequences. As noted, the case is exceptionally strong with arthropods, with Drosophila leading the way. But vertebrate development is also strongly represented, though perhaps not so deeply. After all, it is much more difficult, expensive and slow to research vertebrates, not to mention the ethical barriers of researching human development. Yet, taken together, this book provides a slam dunk not for whether evolution happens - because it does. But rather what teh actual mechanisms are. An aside: this would be a great candidate for an updated edition that brings the state of the art to 2018 or 2019 rather than 2005. But even though over a decade out of date, this book is a must for anybody who wants to understand development or evolution. Truly the successor to the tradition of Stephen Jay Gould, who never had the chance to incorporate molecular and developmental genetics into his musings on the diversity of life.Minor nit pick: no mention of nematodes? Granted, homeotic genes have significantly less profound effects on the nematode body plan. And yet they still fit the theme of spatial identity and variation. Perhaps just too nuanced for what is meant for lay readers...."
243,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,5,"Superb. If you've have the general high-school version of evolution, with Darwin's natural selection and Mendel's dominant and recessive genes, then you've been exposed to the Modern Synthesis--the theory of evolution hammered out in the early twentieth century. Since roughly the eighties or nineties, evolutionary theory has been moving into the ""Extended Modern Synthesis"", and a key component of this is Evo Devo.In Endless Forms Most Beautiful, Carroll gently takes you by the hand and walks you through the main points of Evo Devo. There are two major thrusts here. First, that all of my cells have the same DNA, and most animals have roughly similar DNA, and that the major differences between species isn't what genes they do or don't have, but rather if, when, and where those genes get turned on. (This is largely driven by the establishment of a chemical-gradient based coordinate system in the embryo--Carroll explains it much more clearly than I can). The second is that a major component of evolution then becomes changes in the activation of those switches, rather than changes in the genes themselves.I guess the analogy I came up with (and please correct me if this is way off) is this. In the Modern Synthesis, the keratin that my toenails are made of is slightly different than the keratin that a rhino's toenails are made of. And over time, for various reasons, including selection pressure, the keratin in our respective toenails will diverge more and more until they are radically different. Evo devo argues that, sure, the keratin is different, but the main change is that the ""make keratin"" switch that exists in every cell in my body, but is only turned on in my toenails and other places, can be turned on by some mutation in my face, and cause me to grow a rhinoceros horn. Make sense? Not the ""what"" being made, but the if, when, and where."
244,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15625567-dmitry-zinenko,4,"The themes covered by this book are without doubt very important, and some of the chapters are very revealing.The author does a good job of being accessible to a wide range of readers with or without biological background. He covers a topic that has been fascinating me for a long time - how the complex morphology and physiology of even the simplest animal can develop out of a single cell without external intervention. Most of the time he does that in just the right amount of detail to demonstrate the general principles, which turned out to be simpler than I thought. It also discusses the important interconnection between that and the evolution, in particular evolutionary development of new species. On the negative side, the content of most chapters of the second part felt bland and repetitive to me. They closely follow the same pattern of describing an experiment, usually done in the author's lab, and explaining how it reinforces the few (however important) principles reiterated throughout this book. Personally, I was convinced already after the first introduction of those, and having to read about more examples that confirm the same thing was tedious to me. If you get the same feeling, you can skip the final third of the book and won't miss much. On the one hand, as I struggled to find some novelty in the latter chapters, I was treated again and again to the same arguments about the importance and prominence of evo devo. On the other, IMO the author missed the opportunity to examine and discuss some other implications of those revelations on, e.g., taxonomy, psychology, and ethics.Nevertheless, I definitely recommend getting acquainted with this book or at least with the topics covered by it."
245,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10726611-chunyang-ding,5,"I was directed to read this book from A Capella Science, who created a really wonderful video explaining evo-devo biology. Yet it seemed to make an incredibly bold claim - that the primary cause of evolution was not in gene mutations, but through activating and changing certain signalling genes. This blew my mind - it wasn't covered in any of my bio courses in high school, nor did any of my college friends have any direct information on it. Thus, diving into the source!Sean Carroll is a wonderful science writer, especially since he has such an academic background. Endless Forms Most Beautiful reads very differently from standard popular-science books, as it is much more concerned about cutting-edge research. Carroll writes like an academic - the book not only creates a narrative around the world of evolutionary-developmental biology, it also reads like a researcher's lecture slides in the way he organizes his information. Frequent citations to prominent researchers in the field, as well as the many figures used in the text, provide more of a ""hard science"" feel than your regular book. Despite having read Your Inner Fish by Shubin a number of years ago, Endless Forms Most Beautiful seemed to impart a stronger sense of wonder. Perhaps that's due to Carroll's writing style, both rigorous yet whimsical, or perhaps that's just due to passion Carroll has for his subject. I found especially intriguing his aside on how to raise the American conscience regarding the subject of evolution. I do hope as the years go on, more and more people will become curious about such facts of life and choose to look for themselves at these fascinating facts. "
246,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30392293-diazina,5,"This is a gorgeous book.Just before the reading session in which I finished this book, a friend and I were lamenting the lack of scientific literature that addresses the “interested layperson”; most writing is either dryly academic, or simplified to the point of inanity. This book takes a refreshing turn from both fields; it is written in a straightforward, engaging, impassioned, and yes, sometimes cheesy style that lets its audience follow right along. More experienced readers might imagine the mechanisms of transcription factors and the formation of protein channels when they are mentioned; but the “interested layperson” will be able to read the brief overview of the cast of roles involved, and continue on their merry way.I recommend this book. I recommend it to minds curious about genetics or evolution; I recommend it to minds seeking to learn about the scientific process; I recommend it to minds thirsty to understand what it means to discover, and to know the challenges and successes of research.I left science behind after years of memorizing gene codes and neural loci. This book reminded me of what it means to feel inspired by and curious about the fabric that underpins our world.Bravo, Carroll. P.S. I was inspired to read this by ASAPScience’s accapella cover ‘Evo Devo’, which is a heartfelt piece in its own right "
247,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118682994-andrew-buist,5,"A fantastic book on the developing science of Evo Devo. Carroll manages to correct the course of thought away from the incorrect assumption that evolution is primarily driven by the accumulation of totally random, proteinaceous mutations, amongst which a handful are beneficial. One change in one protein is infrequently the cause of such fervent radiation and speciation. Instead, the random accumulation of mutations of so called ""switches"" in the non-coding DNA of an organism provide upstream, much broader-stroked changes to the development and functioning of an organism. The focus of the book seems to teeter toward the start of ""Act II"", as well as a deal of exhaustive repetition in the conclusion (though I suppose the point of a conclusion is to be wholly conclusive). The continued appearance of certain ""superstar"" Hox genes (here's looking at you, Distal-less) was a pleasure to read - showing up in at-first unexpected locations across taxa. In summary, this is a fantastic introductory read, that eventually blossoms out to encompass multiple fields of ecology, anthropology and palaeontology in much narrower, academic scope - however the early chapters acts as sufficient preparation to soften the blow of certain genetic formulae and more complex Hox gene diagrams that follow. Thoroughly enjoyable, thoroughly recommend."
248,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21912688-ian,5,"Lucid and thoughtful scientific writing by an author who is clearly enthusiastic about the subject. My first read by the ""other Sean Carroll"" (depending on who you ask), and it did not disappoint. Carroll lays out why the science of evolutionary development is key to the Modern Synthesis describing how species evolve and adapt to their environments. The exposition is well-structured, unpacking the genetic mechanisms that underlie embryonic development and then exploring how genetic switches--the source of biochemical patterns of activation and inactivation--allow for an incredible variation in the number, type, and function of body parts that develop in an organism. Carroll argues that these switches and incremental modification of existing parts are the main drivers of evolution, rather than major mutational leaps which give rise to entirely novel functionality. (Incidentally, this argument has me rethinking the entire premise of X-Men.)To sum up, Carroll has written a very approachable introduction to a fascinating topic. Worth reading for anyone interested in genetics, evolution, or the craft of popular scientific writing itself."
249,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,4,"Introduced to the Evo Devo concept that ties evolution and development to unravel genetic mysteries, I was taken aback by how easy it was to understand a scholastic book that dealt with daunting terms and processes. The book takes you on a journey through the past and current diverse richness of the animal kingdom. The entire concept and working of genetic toolkits and genetic switches could be bottled in a few pages, but it was delightful to get into the applications. The book was beautifully furnished with illustrations and I personally loved the philosophical tone at the end of the book that explored active ignorance and the need for evolution of theology.Sean B Carroll maintains his tone of over-enthusiasm throughout the book which sometimes hindered my objective evaluation of how much fascination certain concepts really entail.

I think that my problem was that it promised new, new, new, but then really didn't tell me anything much that I did not already know about evolution and developmental biology. The stuff about the hox genes and the way that switches turn them on and off to form major body parts is fascinating, as is the information about how many inportant genes we share with vastly different types of organisms with whom our common ancestors go back hundreds of millions of years. And the explanation of how evolution works to change genes over time is important knowledge that everyone should understand. All of this important information is delivered in a breezy, easy to understand style. So what's not to like? I don't know. I guess I wanted more. It just overpromised and underdelivered."

He spends too long describing aspects that seemed straightforward and glosses over parts that I would have liked to know more about. Also, his language for qualitatively describing gene regulation is confusing and hard to keep straight, not least because it fails to properly acknowledge that many transcription factors regulate other transcription factors. I'm fact, his language doesn't use the words ""transcription factors"" at all, as if he is worked that sort of terminology will intimidate the lay reader. I think if you know very little about biology, this writing may work for you. However, if you are familiar with other biological and genetic topics but are new to ""Evo Devo,"" then this writing may leave you unsatisfied about this fascinating topic."

270,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35733902-ipsita,5,"This book is a brilliant introductory book on the topic of the new and fast emerging field of evo-devo by an eminent scientist of the same. One of the major tenets of this field is the evidence pointing out the fact that all the living organisms share the genetic toolkit necessary for all the processes involved in embryological development such as development of limbs, eyes (hox, pax genes) etc. The ‘dark matter’ of the genome aka the so-called junk DNA plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the genetic switches as well as progress of complexity at the molecular level as the phylogenesis moves forward in nature. Evo-devo also explains the diversity evident at the developmental stage for natural selection, defensive mechanisms such as molecular mimicry and the ever-intriguing human evolution. A must read for enthusiasts of both embryology and evolutionary biology. Anyone not interested in the technical details could just read the last chapter where Sean B. Carroll puts a striking argument in favour of evolution and the role of developmental biology in it.
For more than a century, biologists had assumed that different types of animals were genetically constructed in completely different ways. The greater the disparity in animal form, the less (if anything) the development of two animals would have in common at the level of their genes. One of the architects of the Modern Synthesis, Ernst Mayr, had written that “the search for homologous genes is quite futile except in very close relatives.” But contrary to the expectations of any biologist, most of the genes first identified as governing major aspects of fruit fly body organization were found to have exact counterparts that did the same thing in most animals, including ourselves. This discovery was followed by the revelation that the development of various body parts such as eyes, limbs, and hearts, vastly different in structure among animals and long thought to have evolved in entirely different ways, was also governed by the same genes in different animals. The comparison of developmental genes between species became a new discipline at the interface of embryology and evolutionary biology—evolutionary developmental biology, or “Evo Devo” for short.By revealing the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying change, Evo Devo allows us to compare and contrast the evolutionary paths of different groups. Long-standing mysteries such as Batesian mimicry in butterflies, melanism in moths, and even the evolution of finch beak size and shape now lie within our grasp. We shall soon have detailed pictures of many of the classic examples of natural selection and understand in depth how variation arises and is selected for.

271,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42261661-lucas-g,4,"If you've ever wondered how a developing organism knows where to grow an arm or where the eyeballs are supposed to go, then this book is for you. In this book Carroll provides a glimpse into the science of evolutionary developmental biology (commonly referred to as Evo-Devo). At a high level, Evo-Devo studies how biological lifeforms develop from a single cell into a full-grown organism with a multitude of different physical characteristics. This requires tracking the expression of various genes throughout the developmental stages of different organisms. The first half of the book describes this process in detail, explaining how researchers are able to identify what genes are being activated at different physical locations at different times during development in order to produce a fully-developed organism. The impression that I walked away with is that Evo-Devo works much like a series of integrated control systems circuits. There are base programs (Hox genes) that, when activated, initiate the development of different features (arms, legs, wings, eyes, etc.) Then there are genetic switches that activate and deactivate these Hox genes at various physical locations at different times throughout development stages. Differences in the logic of these genetic switches ultimately produce the different physical features of different organisms. This is because different genetic switch logic activates the Hox genes at different locations and times during development. The second half of the book outlines specific applications of Evo-Devo. This includes discussions of butterfly wings, zebra stripes, and even the human brain. Admittedly, I did not find these discussions to be as interesting as those describing how Evo-Devo works in the first half of the book, but it was still fairly interesting. At least until the last chapter. For some reason Carroll chose to end the book with an exclamation that Evo-Devo can save science education in the United States from its current abysmal state. Right or wrong, the entire chapter seems out of place and distracts from the overall fascination of Evo-Devo created by the preceding chapters. Overall, this is an enjoyable and intriguing read. Carroll is an excellent writer, and his personality shows through his writing on even the most technical of topics."
272,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6924174-rodzilla,5,"Perhaps a difficult read for somebody without a strong background in evolution and the fundamentals of molecular biology. But this book ties together decades of developmental genetics and evolution to lead us to a much deeper understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of evolution. They key is the evolution of the arthropod body plans and transcription factors controlling spatial identity of tissues. None of this is new as of its 2005 publication, but what it offers is synthesis. Carroll brings together a very complicated picture with excellent teaching skills. An intelligent reader should come away with an understanding of how remarkably diverse body plans can evolve with relatively minor changes in regulatory gene sequences. As noted, the case is exceptionally strong with arthropods, with Drosophila leading the way. But vertebrate development is also strongly represented, though perhaps not so deeply. After all, it is much more difficult, expensive and slow to research vertebrates, not to mention the ethical barriers of researching human development. Yet, taken together, this book provides a slam dunk not for whether evolution happens - because it does. But rather what teh actual mechanisms are. An aside: this would be a great candidate for an updated edition that brings the state of the art to 2018 or 2019 rather than 2005. But even though over a decade out of date, this book is a must for anybody who wants to understand development or evolution. Truly the successor to the tradition of Stephen Jay Gould, who never had the chance to incorporate molecular and developmental genetics into his musings on the diversity of life.Minor nit pick: no mention of nematodes? Granted, homeotic genes have significantly less profound effects on the nematode body plan. And yet they still fit the theme of spatial identity and variation. Perhaps just too nuanced for what is meant for lay readers...."
273,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,5,"Superb. If you've have the general high-school version of evolution, with Darwin's natural selection and Mendel's dominant and recessive genes, then you've been exposed to the Modern Synthesis--the theory of evolution hammered out in the early twentieth century. Since roughly the eighties or nineties, evolutionary theory has been moving into the ""Extended Modern Synthesis"", and a key component of this is Evo Devo.In Endless Forms Most Beautiful, Carroll gently takes you by the hand and walks you through the main points of Evo Devo. There are two major thrusts here. First, that all of my cells have the same DNA, and most animals have roughly similar DNA, and that the major differences between species isn't what genes they do or don't have, but rather if, when, and where those genes get turned on. (This is largely driven by the establishment of a chemical-gradient based coordinate system in the embryo--Carroll explains it much more clearly than I can). The second is that a major component of evolution then becomes changes in the activation of those switches, rather than changes in the genes themselves.I guess the analogy I came up with (and please correct me if this is way off) is this. In the Modern Synthesis, the keratin that my toenails are made of is slightly different than the keratin that a rhino's toenails are made of. And over time, for various reasons, including selection pressure, the keratin in our respective toenails will diverge more and more until they are radically different. Evo devo argues that, sure, the keratin is different, but the main change is that the ""make keratin"" switch that exists in every cell in my body, but is only turned on in my toenails and other places, can be turned on by some mutation in my face, and cause me to grow a rhinoceros horn. Make sense? Not the ""what"" being made, but the if, when, and where."
274,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15625567-dmitry-zinenko,4,"The themes covered by this book are without doubt very important, and some of the chapters are very revealing.The author does a good job of being accessible to a wide range of readers with or without biological background. He covers a topic that has been fascinating me for a long time - how the complex morphology and physiology of even the simplest animal can develop out of a single cell without external intervention. Most of the time he does that in just the right amount of detail to demonstrate the general principles, which turned out to be simpler than I thought. It also discusses the important interconnection between that and the evolution, in particular evolutionary development of new species. On the negative side, the content of most chapters of the second part felt bland and repetitive to me. They closely follow the same pattern of describing an experiment, usually done in the author's lab, and explaining how it reinforces the few (however important) principles reiterated throughout this book. Personally, I was convinced already after the first introduction of those, and having to read about more examples that confirm the same thing was tedious to me. If you get the same feeling, you can skip the final third of the book and won't miss much. On the one hand, as I struggled to find some novelty in the latter chapters, I was treated again and again to the same arguments about the importance and prominence of evo devo. On the other, IMO the author missed the opportunity to examine and discuss some other implications of those revelations on, e.g., taxonomy, psychology, and ethics.Nevertheless, I definitely recommend getting acquainted with this book or at least with the topics covered by it."
275,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10726611-chunyang-ding,5,"I was directed to read this book from A Capella Science, who created a really wonderful video explaining evo-devo biology. Yet it seemed to make an incredibly bold claim - that the primary cause of evolution was not in gene mutations, but through activating and changing certain signalling genes. This blew my mind - it wasn't covered in any of my bio courses in high school, nor did any of my college friends have any direct information on it. Thus, diving into the source!Sean Carroll is a wonderful science writer, especially since he has such an academic background. Endless Forms Most Beautiful reads very differently from standard popular-science books, as it is much more concerned about cutting-edge research. Carroll writes like an academic - the book not only creates a narrative around the world of evolutionary-developmental biology, it also reads like a researcher's lecture slides in the way he organizes his information. Frequent citations to prominent researchers in the field, as well as the many figures used in the text, provide more of a ""hard science"" feel than your regular book. Despite having read Your Inner Fish by Shubin a number of years ago, Endless Forms Most Beautiful seemed to impart a stronger sense of wonder. Perhaps that's due to Carroll's writing style, both rigorous yet whimsical, or perhaps that's just due to passion Carroll has for his subject. I found especially intriguing his aside on how to raise the American conscience regarding the subject of evolution. I do hope as the years go on, more and more people will become curious about such facts of life and choose to look for themselves at these fascinating facts. "
276,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30392293-diazina,5,"This is a gorgeous book.Just before the reading session in which I finished this book, a friend and I were lamenting the lack of scientific literature that addresses the “interested layperson”; most writing is either dryly academic, or simplified to the point of inanity. This book takes a refreshing turn from both fields; it is written in a straightforward, engaging, impassioned, and yes, sometimes cheesy style that lets its audience follow right along. More experienced readers might imagine the mechanisms of transcription factors and the formation of protein channels when they are mentioned; but the “interested layperson” will be able to read the brief overview of the cast of roles involved, and continue on their merry way.I recommend this book. I recommend it to minds curious about genetics or evolution; I recommend it to minds seeking to learn about the scientific process; I recommend it to minds thirsty to understand what it means to discover, and to know the challenges and successes of research.I left science behind after years of memorizing gene codes and neural loci. This book reminded me of what it means to feel inspired by and curious about the fabric that underpins our world.Bravo, Carroll. P.S. I was inspired to read this by ASAPScience’s accapella cover ‘Evo Devo’, which is a heartfelt piece in its own right "
277,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118682994-andrew-buist,5,"A fantastic book on the developing science of Evo Devo. Carroll manages to correct the course of thought away from the incorrect assumption that evolution is primarily driven by the accumulation of totally random, proteinaceous mutations, amongst which a handful are beneficial. One change in one protein is infrequently the cause of such fervent radiation and speciation. Instead, the random accumulation of mutations of so called ""switches"" in the non-coding DNA of an organism provide upstream, much broader-stroked changes to the development and functioning of an organism. The focus of the book seems to teeter toward the start of ""Act II"", as well as a deal of exhaustive repetition in the conclusion (though I suppose the point of a conclusion is to be wholly conclusive). The continued appearance of certain ""superstar"" Hox genes (here's looking at you, Distal-less) was a pleasure to read - showing up in at-first unexpected locations across taxa. In summary, this is a fantastic introductory read, that eventually blossoms out to encompass multiple fields of ecology, anthropology and palaeontology in much narrower, academic scope - however the early chapters acts as sufficient preparation to soften the blow of certain genetic formulae and more complex Hox gene diagrams that follow. Thoroughly enjoyable, thoroughly recommend."
278,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21912688-ian,5,"Lucid and thoughtful scientific writing by an author who is clearly enthusiastic about the subject. My first read by the ""other Sean Carroll"" (depending on who you ask), and it did not disappoint. Carroll lays out why the science of evolutionary development is key to the Modern Synthesis describing how species evolve and adapt to their environments. The exposition is well-structured, unpacking the genetic mechanisms that underlie embryonic development and then exploring how genetic switches--the source of biochemical patterns of activation and inactivation--allow for an incredible variation in the number, type, and function of body parts that develop in an organism. Carroll argues that these switches and incremental modification of existing parts are the main drivers of evolution, rather than major mutational leaps which give rise to entirely novel functionality. (Incidentally, this argument has me rethinking the entire premise of X-Men.)To sum up, Carroll has written a very approachable introduction to a fascinating topic. Worth reading for anyone interested in genetics, evolution, or the craft of popular scientific writing itself."
279,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29509433-amirtha-shri,4,"Introduced to the Evo Devo concept that ties evolution and development to unravel genetic mysteries, I was taken aback by how easy it was to understand a scholastic book that dealt with daunting terms and processes. The book takes you on a journey through the past and current diverse richness of the animal kingdom. The entire concept and working of genetic toolkits and genetic switches could be bottled in a few pages, but it was delightful to get into the applications. The book was beautifully furnished with illustrations and I personally loved the philosophical tone at the end of the book that explored active ignorance and the need for evolution of theology.Sean B Carroll maintains his tone of over-enthusiasm throughout the book which sometimes hindered my objective evaluation of how much fascination certain concepts really entail. Nonetheless, the book was well-organized, articulate, and didn't lose my attention - which is something I cannot say for most science non-fictional reads."

I think that my problem was that it promised new, new, new, but then really didn't tell me anything much that I did not already know about evolution and developmental biology. The stuff about the hox genes and the way that switches turn them on and off to form major body parts is fascinating, as is the information about how many inportant genes we share with vastly different types of organisms with whom our common ancestors go back hundreds of millions of years. And the explanation of how evolution works to change genes over time is important knowledge that everyone should understand. All of this important information is delivered in a breezy, easy to understand style. So what's not to like? I don't know. I guess I wanted more. It just overpromised and underdelivered."
281,0393327795,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19672057-cade,3,"This is a very interesting subject which I haven't previously read much about. However, the writing itself frustrated me at times. He spends too long describing aspects that seemed straightforward and glosses over parts that I would have liked to know more about. Also, his language for qualitatively describing gene regulation is confusing and hard to keep straight, not least because it fails to properly acknowledge that many transcription factors regulate other transcription factors. I'm fact, his language doesn't use the words ""transcription factors"" at all, as if he is worked that sort of terminology will intimidate the lay reader. I think if you know very little about biology, this writing may work for you. However, if you are familiar with other biological and genetic topics but are new to ""Evo Devo,"" then this writing may leave you unsatisfied about this fascinating topic."
