0,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15797955-leah,3,"I'm going to preface this review by stating that I have no idea if the science or the facts in this graphic novel are right. I'm assuming they are, and if it's all accurate, I could see NEUROCOMIC being added to the curriculum as a possible visual learning aid.There's a lot of science, history, facts, etc. given in very few pages, and I really enjoyed reading about all the brainy goodness this book had to offer. The art is simple, but it kept me in the story. There was quite a bit of information, that it was nice to have visuals to go along with it. The writing was very factual, and although there was some fun personality to the characters, the science and facts overshadowed that constantly.The ending was awesome and a bit mind-blowing to me. I appreciated how Hana Ros chose to end this, and I thought it worked very well for the book and for the subject matter. NEUROCOMIC isn't going to be for everyone. It has it faults, namely the one real woman being an object for the Protagonist to chase. When the book gets to the mental disorders of the brain, it makes sense and works, but even still, it was a bit frustrating that the only woman of the story wasn't really a part of the story. Looking past that though, I thought the subject was fascinating, and I'd be willing to try out other work by both of these doctors. OK honestly, only if they do something creative with the subject matter like they did here.Also, a giant squid attacks!"

I didn't love the art (except for the cephalopods. They were all marvelous.) Really didn't like the gender depictions. Yes, I'm a feminist pedant. You're either going to be with me on this, or think I'm a nutcase.Text on lower image reads:""Oh, my lady! So you were not a hallucination . . . are you the queen of this place?""No, I'm not. I'm a prisoner just like you.""""Well, fear not, my dear! I'll find the master of this cruel game and take you away with me.""Adding image of squid because awesome."
2,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma,3,"A kind of YA level or science course companion on the workings of the brain, by neuroscientist turned comics writer Hana Ros. I'm not a science guy, I'm in English, but since I have a kid with autism I have read what I can of laymen's accounts of neuroscience, one of the last frontiers. The art in my introduction to Ros's work I didn't initially find all that great, but in places it was imaginative and inspired, and useful as a kind of creative introduction. We are introduced to the basics, and some history of the science, and to some of the greats in the history of brain research, and to the idea that we are sort of left with metaphors to try to bridge the gaps in what we know, with invention, with a faith (sometimes misplaced) in our own perceptions of things. Feels like they are saying it is the scientists' hope that we will be able to explain and understand the brain almost exclusively in biological terms, which to a poet or artist or person of faith must seem limiting. But as the father of a kid with severe autism, I encourage my scientific researcher brothers and sisters to keep on exploring the frontier! Always hoping for a cure, of course."

The facts seem to be on point and the story is hectic in its own way. It was fun to see how a comic could be used as a great tool for learning; the future lies in Neurocomic. There's nothing too stunning in the artwork, but there's a lot of clever elements in it. It also plays well on the words, but sometimes I felt like the transition was a little too sharp. Like a 100 meter truck trying to do a 90-degree turn on a narrow street. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would love to learn more about neuroscience before jumping into the discipline!P.S.

4,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,3,"Fun, but a little on the short side. This is a look at the physiology of the brain in comics form. A young man is taken on a grand tour, guided by the various scientists responsible for discovering the various aspects of how the brain works. It's a playful concept, if a bit contrived. I'd describe the artwork as ""simplified realism."" It reminds me a bit of Phoebe Gloeckner, though with a bit less detail. The ending gets a bit meta, but it's lots of fun. I really liked this book. It's a great concept, executed well, maybe a touch too impressed with its own cleverness ... It's just really, really short. I would have been happier with more detail. This feels like merely an opening chapter to a much longer book--after learning of the brain's physiology we then segue into some comics adaptations of neurological or psychological case histories or something. This is an excellent appetizer, but not much of a main course."
5,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,2,"The idea of this book interested me, but I just couldn't get into it. I don't know if that's me, that I just won't be interested in neuroscience no matter how it's presented. Or maybe I could be, and this just wasn't the book to do it. I wasn't thrilled with the art, which mostly felt bland and lacking in detail. And I didn't like that the only female in the entire book was an objective, a destination, and not an actual person. As far as I know, the science presented was accurate, and easy enough to understand. It just didn't appeal to me, on a number of levels."
6,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2122397-laura-bang,2,"It's an Alice in Wonderland-esque tour of your brain! With brain forests and science and random squids!Science-wise, Neurocomic does a decent job of explaining the inner workings of your brain (as far as I, not a neuroscientist, can tell). The art is okay. It's not great, but it works to convey the ideas.Where I really lost enthusiasm was the portrayal of women, which is actually noted early on in the text when protagonist dude finds himself inside a brain forest, looks around for the woman he was just about to hit on, and is then informed by an old white guy that ""I'm afraid you won't find many girls around here, boy."" This is because he meets a bunch of pioneers in the field of neuroscience who are, of course, all white men. Which, okay, that's life, women didn't get to do science (or get credit for it if they did) for much of history. But then the only woman in this story is the woman that protagonist dude is trying to hit on, so she's a goal/plot instigator, not an actual character. (The only other humanoid females presented are a bunch of sexed-up neurotransmitters and a topless mermaid....)So, sure, the history of neuroscience may be made of white men, but Neurocomic certainly does nothing to change that. This is not something I imagine would encourage women interested in STEM fields."
7,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1647977-cate,2,"Did there really need to be a tiny plot about a man chasing and ""saving"" a woman in a book about explaining the brain? And where are all the lady scientists? They literally mention Aplysia right in the book but neglect to mention Angélique Arvanitaki who studied electrical activity in the nervous system of that very creature? And the book has a whole chapter about pharmacology and include neurotransmitters but also leave out Marthe Vogt, who is such an important contributor to what we now know about neurotransmitters? But even regardless of all of those things, the fact that they show and explain Pavlov ringing a bell bothered me as well because in research done on the topic, Pavlov probably never even rang a bell, he used a variety of different stimuli including a buzzer and metronome (I know it's an inconsequential detail in the long run but it still bothered me that they never addressed that). Despite all of that I still appreciate all that the author was trying to do, which was just get more people interested in the brain and try to simplify things for people who are interested but may be a bit confused. "
8,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204576-joel-bass,3,"As a huge fan of neuroscience and graphic novels, I was pretty excited about this. But... wouldn't you imagine that a book that combines the two would feature either kick-ass art or mind-blowing science facts (or hopefully both)? Sadly, this was fairly mediocre on both counts. While some of the art was dreamy and evocative, a lot of it looked like a high school kid's doodle of their teacher. 90% of the panels featured a wrinkly, constipated-looking dude on a nearly-blank background. And the neuroscience was mildly interesting, at times, but I'm not sure who it was for - it seemed to vacillate between very basic and suddenly jargon-filled. AND, though the authors introduced us to a lot of individual scientists who contributed to our understanding of the brain, I was a bit surprised to learn that apparently, no women scientists have ever contributed anything to neuroscience. Really? In 2014, they couldn't think of one woman to include? Sigh. I still think there's tremendous potential for a really incredible graphic novel that explores brain science. This ain't it."
9,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5660833-everlaine-bookcaptain,3,"This book gives a small insight to how your brain works. It beautifully published and some of the artwork is great, but some is pretty horrible. And I found that it seemed to focus more on the names of the doctor or scientist who'd made an important discovery than the actual discovery. I'm a med student and from what we've read so far I believe the book to be accurate but unfortunately a little too simplistic. And, as more reviewers have also mentioned, the way women are portrayed is pretty disturbing. Oversexualized and used as plot devices without substance. If you're interested in neuroscience I'd still recommend picking it up from the library as it's a quick read and easy enough to read. "
10,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355264-monica,2,"This book seems to have a few contradictions. I am not able to tell if it were a written for an adult or child audience. oOr an audience that knows nothing about neurology or with some grasp of it. The book is in cartoon format but the language and flow of the logic is not quite simple and the book is hard bound and looks very serious. Even though I have some basic knowledge of how the brain works, I still find some info baffling. A strange book. Written by scientists to as an introductory educational book. But they should have gotten a proper writer to translate it into something the target audience can relate to. I will not recommend it as an introductory book on neurology."
11,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1823662-sonic,4,"This is awesome! Written buy a Dr. and illustrated by a Dr. (superbly I must add!)My only criticism is that when they got to speaking about consciousness, which they only barely mentioned near the end, they just had to bring out the old ego-driven mechanistic view of biology, ...which is to say instead of admitting how little they know about consciousness, they act like someday it will all be explained away as a simple brain function.I find this perspective to be limited and limiting. Still, I plan on re-reading this someday, ... :) "
12,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4501430-libby,4,"I'm going to preface this by saying I study neuroscience. I enjoyed it. The explanations are a little simple and teleological, but it's a good introduction to neuroscience concepts. The art is fun, and I like the concept of describing the brain graphically. I would recommend it for people interested in an introduction to basic neuroscience. It provides a good base for learning more about the complexities of the topics it covers by giving relevant vocabulary and some big names in the field."
13,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10258323-cleo,5,"Incredible. I was going to give it 4 stars for being a wonderfully informative, well-drawn graphic novel. But then the last few pages caused me to have a mini existential crisis, and the 5th star had to be awarded!"

Explain about de inner works of the brain in a easy way to people that aren't involved with science, especially for children. The negative point is the unique woman in the book was the man is sexually interested, while there are many scientists (ok, the science is not feminist, and the book doesn't contribute to a better image for this).

I'm a big science gal, specially when it comes to things related to the brain. If it wasn't because of a few things I'm not committed to when it came to becoming a Doctor, I'd be a neurologist.This book deals with that awesome information, the wonders of something so delicate and complex as the brain, in a matter of drawings explaining these occurrences with a minor story line to keep it interesting. There's a man who is going to flirt and talk with a woman, but some kind of force sucks him out of the picture and into a strange forest, But it's not just a simple forest, it's a forest full of all kinds of neurons found in our brain! That story continues throughout the book as various scientists who dedicated their lives to the neuroscience explain what happens inside the brain and how some things work. The story was a bit weird in my opinion, but it managed to take the whole purpose of the book to where it had to go: to explain in a simple way to grasp neuroscience in a way to capture the reader.







There used to be a few things that I didn't understand well, and didn't even know, from the brain, such as how neurons aren't really connected to each other. Then how do they send information from one through the other? Also, why and how does the brain send messages through itself and the body via chemical and electrical processes? How does the brain manage its memories, the analytic ones vs the more emotional ones? This stuff you might read it from a normal book or a magazine and be even more confused sometimes (I know I did). And what I liked of this book, with it's weird method and drawings, it got to explain it well and thoroughly.This is a book I strongly recommend to anyone interested in all things neuroscience and those who have struggled at some point in their lives to understand what, hopefully, they have inside those skulls. You'll be amazed by some things that you'll be proud of having a fully functional brain that can save your life in fight or flight situations that you barely give a thought about!PS. I'm such a nerd <3Rating: 4.5 Stars"
20,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9563913-despina-inwhirlofinspiration,5,"You can find more pictures and the whole book review, here. It's no secret around these lands that I am through my ""thesis writing"" era lately. As an undergraduate neuroscientist I deal with neurons all the time, the one and only unit that controls everything, from the things that you feel, remember or dream. Everything starts and stops with our brain's neurons. Neurocomic is an introduction to this chaotic field and its approach is far more pleasant than the papers' that I read lately.So, from British indie press Nobrow - comes the Neurocomic, a graphic novel about the inner workings of that amazing organ; the brain. It is the collaboration result between Dr. Hana Roš and neuroscience-turned-illustrator Dr. Matteo Farinella and it -delightfully- illustrates in black-and-white everything from neurons morphology to the electricity that runs our whole brain, the difference between the mind and the brain and lastly -in a great finale- the real secret of the human's brain. So we take a walk from the forests of neurons, to the pharmacology labs of synapses and then a quick dive to the electrical oceans to be washed up by the waves to the caves of memory and to, finally, explore the haunted castle of consciousness. Along the way, we meet famous neuroscientists that explain us their brilliant studies. An irrational voyage in the totally logical world of Neuroland."
21,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43954454-alegria-garcia4,4,"I gotta say, this book is awesome! The concepts were so easy to follow with the creative analogies. I liked how the whole story reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. The main character trying to find a way out of the brain, and everyone he encountered seemed to be mad! And like Alice in Wonderland, the ending was creepy, and strangely sad to me. A must-read for anyone, not just fans of neuroscience!"
22,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3132060-andrea-james,2,"In a way it's difficult to rate this book because I would perhaps give it more stars as a neuroscience guidebook for kids. I was expecting a graphic novel for grown-ups and so I was a little disappointed to find that the style of story-telling seemed to be aimed at a much younger audience. It is written with an overall tone of ""Did you know...?"", and even includes cameos by the more well-known neuroscientists introducing parts of the brain that they worked with or various related concepts.Like many of the other reviewers, I was excited by the idea of a comic on neuroscience but sadly this felt more like a textbook-turned-into-an-approximate-narrative rather than something that is either a captivating story in its own right or a science lesson given with an engaging sense of humour. I was hoping for a dry or tongue-in-cheek tone if it were in a story or explanation format or just a journey through the brain (without an underlying story) with a series of beautiful pictures. However, in terms of clarity of explanation to laypeople/children, this book is a decent introduction to the subject. "
23,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1682713-nicola-mansfield,4,"I'm really not sure how to describe this book because as it says near the end ""...because nothing really happened if not inside [your brain]"" The topic as a whole covers what happens inside the brain and the history of neuroscience. This is presented with a character who appears to be trapped inside a brain and is trying to find a way out, by the end he wants out of the brain and the discussion enters the realm of what can happen when one goes out of their brain/mind. Mind vs brain is explored and the end leaves us waxing philosophically. This is a deep subject and this amusing beginners intro shows the powerful format the graphic (or comic) presentation can be for educational purposes. As always from Nobrow, a high quality book as well. "
24,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715371-oliver-ho,4,"I liked this brief and fun, weird book about the brain. It takes the form of a surreal short story, and even though I would have liked it to go on longer, especially in the last two chapters, it still packs in a lot of information. The art is also a lot of tentacly, trippy fun. I'm sure I'll re-read this to refresh my memory about the subject."
25,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15456665-nouf-almasoud,4,"Great book, liked its way of simplification as a comic, which is totally my thing!As the huge subject it implies (Neuroscience) I expected to get more information though. Liked the ending and the page of recommended books which I will obviously check."
26,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38773069-liz-yerby,5,"Like all nobrow books the book design here is gorgeous. I thought the information was really interesting/important stuff to know.

31,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78765696-joseph,2,"2.5 stars. I have mixed feelings about this neurology-based graphic novel.The book follows our protagonist through the brain, meeting different scientists who made significant discoveries about its structure and function along the way. I do think that the artwork was great. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but it was a bit surrealist at times and very stylistic which was impressive combined with its effectiveness at illustration different neurological processes. The front cover artwork was particularly beautiful. As a visual guide to scientific processes, it worked quite well...for a few. I got the feeling it aimed to be accessible to those unfamiliar with neurology and interesting to those who are. Somehow though, it managed to oversimplify AND overcomplicate things. I think the main problem was that Neurocomic aimed to reduce complicated processes and theories into simplified illustrations and explanations. The problem with this is that a lot of neurology isn't simple and so it just hints at complex matters before moving on very fast, which ends up being more confusing. It often ended up not defining terms properly (I'm assuming because it would have been too long) and summarising things like neural plasticity in a couple of paragraphs. Some things that could have been really interesting are mentioned (like psychopathology) but then never explored at all. The result is a book that ends up being a bit inaccessible to people unfamiliar with the subject and too reductionist for those who are.I did, however, find the visual guides to things such as synapses and action potential really helpful. I imagine it would help me a lot to visualise it if I needed to academically. I'll definitely keep it around for this reason. Overall a disappointing read that could have, and SHOULD have been potentially really interesting. "
32,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84041361-manakissi,2,"I like the idea and the drawing style. Unfortunately there are several downsides that really had a negative impact on my enjoyment of the comic. First of all there's this compulsion to present all the elements in the brain as gendered, either male or female. My absolute favorite characters are an exception to this though: I love the wonderful Kraken and Aplysia the sea slug!The second downside is extensive name dropping. It would be so much more engaging if there was a separate list, like a ""cast of characters"" that explained which scientists did what and provided a recap on the importance of these scientific studies to present-day understanding of the brain. A third unpleasant aspect was the caricature illustration of the brain hemispheres as two nude humanoid figures, with traditional male and female markers (which to my eyes is a direct reference to a hopelessly outdated and conservative concept of the ""female vs male"" traits that are appointed to the right vs left hemisphere), with distinctly African features to boot (which, combined with nudity, is a racist visual stereotype of ""primitivity""). I also would have loved an index of concepts (especially since my other favorite, Aplysia, was not explained) since this comic is written by neuroscientists and promises to ""unravel the mysteries of the human brain"". 2,5/5"

I was drawn to the silver foiled blue cover out of a stack of books a friend took out on hold - she had the same crow-eyed reaction, finding the graphic novel first in a neurologist's office. The illustration style took some time to get used to, the cartoonish faces too detailed to be childish, though the neurons and synapses played beautifully in biological and abstract landscapes. It took me back to a class I took in college to fulfill a biology requirement - Drugs Galore - filled with classmates who likely knew more about the subject than our sweet, Catholic professor whose most shocking brush with the illicit was her sister's friend stashing peach schnapps in the school locker. Sad to say, the more technical explanations on the neuron mechanisms could have been clearer, with less text and more illustration - multiple times I found myself lost, thinking a diagrammatic depiction would have been easier to follow. The metacognition and scaling of the fourth wall seemed well paired - I only wish there was an acknowledgement of the dark unknowns of the brain and the shortcomings of the history of research presented. Overall, an enjoyable trip through the brain that does not feel textbook."
35,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12287466-brittany,1,"This was...a lot. The adventure story itself - a man trying to get back to a woman - is laden with history and science, and the occasional breaking of the fourth wall to specify the characters' location in a fictional world. There are strange forays out of the biographical/scientific bits into the surreal. For instance: a giant squid is mentioned in the context of how Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley used giant squid axons to study neuronal signals, but then the aforementioned squid appears and attacks the ship Hodgkin, Huxley, and our protagonist are on. In the context of the story, anything appearing for real in the tale would need to correspond to something that's actually inside a person's brain, and the squid doesn't, so it's just a strange insertion into the story for the plot's sake. It seems poorly thought out. Things like that, that don't align with the assumptions we're asked to make about what's happening, quickly become too much. The premise is good, and the artwork is okay, but it's a quick, broad overview of a very complex topic that has some definite flaws and doesn't actually teach as well as is intended."

BUT I liked the idea of ​​neurotransmitters ""opening"" the receptor, and the drugs being bugs because when this ""bug"" appeared, we knew exactly what the drug was.

I mean, it's literally a didactical comic book about neuroscience. They can't try to explain any easier than this. And it's pretty interesting. But it also made me feel dumber. Like, I seriously read every line twice so I could understand what it was saying. And I laughed out loud a couple times of how it didn't made any sense to me. I'm still confused about some parts. Knowledge of biology, chemistry, and physics just don't stay at my mind for much longer, it's just really hard for me to keep this kind of information. Historical dates and facts?

61,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78765696-joseph,2,"2.5 stars. I have mixed feelings about this neurology-based graphic novel.The book follows our protagonist through the brain, meeting different scientists who made significant discoveries about its structure and function along the way. I do think that the artwork was great. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but it was a bit surrealist at times and very stylistic which was impressive combined with its effectiveness at illustration different neurological processes. The front cover artwork was particularly beautiful. As a visual guide to scientific processes, it worked quite well...for a few. I got the feeling it aimed to be accessible to those unfamiliar with neurology and interesting to those who are. Somehow though, it managed to oversimplify AND overcomplicate things. I think the main problem was that Neurocomic aimed to reduce complicated processes and theories into simplified illustrations and explanations. The problem with this is that a lot of neurology isn't simple and so it just hints at complex matters before moving on very fast, which ends up being more confusing. It often ended up not defining terms properly (I'm assuming because it would have been too long) and summarising things like neural plasticity in a couple of paragraphs. Some things that could have been really interesting are mentioned (like psychopathology) but then never explored at all. The result is a book that ends up being a bit inaccessible to people unfamiliar with the subject and too reductionist for those who are.I did, however, find the visual guides to things such as synapses and action potential really helpful. I imagine it would help me a lot to visualise it if I needed to academically. I'll definitely keep it around for this reason. Overall a disappointing read that could have, and SHOULD have been potentially really interesting. "
62,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84041361-manakissi,2,"I like the idea and the drawing style. Unfortunately there are several downsides that really had a negative impact on my enjoyment of the comic. First of all there's this compulsion to present all the elements in the brain as gendered, either male or female. My absolute favorite characters are an exception to this though: I love the wonderful Kraken and Aplysia the sea slug!The second downside is extensive name dropping. It would be so much more engaging if there was a separate list, like a ""cast of characters"" that explained which scientists did what and provided a recap on the importance of these scientific studies to present-day understanding of the brain. A third unpleasant aspect was the caricature illustration of the brain hemispheres as two nude humanoid figures, with traditional male and female markers (which to my eyes is a direct reference to a hopelessly outdated and conservative concept of the ""female vs male"" traits that are appointed to the right vs left hemisphere), with distinctly African features to boot (which, combined with nudity, is a racist visual stereotype of ""primitivity""). I also would have loved an index of concepts (especially since my other favorite, Aplysia, was not explained) since this comic is written by neuroscientists and promises to ""unravel the mysteries of the human brain"". 2,5/5"

64,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93146887-bonnie-fan,4,"Enjoyed this Alice-in-wonderland exploration of the brain. I was drawn to the silver foiled blue cover out of a stack of books a friend took out on hold - she had the same crow-eyed reaction, finding the graphic novel first in a neurologist's office. The illustration style took some time to get used to, the cartoonish faces too detailed to be childish, though the neurons and synapses played beautifully in biological and abstract landscapes. It took me back to a class I took in college to fulfill a biology requirement - Drugs Galore - filled with classmates who likely knew more about the subject than our sweet, Catholic professor whose most shocking brush with the illicit was her sister's friend stashing peach schnapps in the school locker. Sad to say, the more technical explanations on the neuron mechanisms could have been clearer, with less text and more illustration - multiple times I found myself lost, thinking a diagrammatic depiction would have been easier to follow. The metacognition and scaling of the fourth wall seemed well paired - I only wish there was an acknowledgement of the dark unknowns of the brain and the shortcomings of the history of research presented. Overall, an enjoyable trip through the brain that does not feel textbook."
65,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12287466-brittany,1,"This was...a lot. The adventure story itself - a man trying to get back to a woman - is laden with history and science, and the occasional breaking of the fourth wall to specify the characters' location in a fictional world. There are strange forays out of the biographical/scientific bits into the surreal. For instance: a giant squid is mentioned in the context of how Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley used giant squid axons to study neuronal signals, but then the aforementioned squid appears and attacks the ship Hodgkin, Huxley, and our protagonist are on. In the context of the story, anything appearing for real in the tale would need to correspond to something that's actually inside a person's brain, and the squid doesn't, so it's just a strange insertion into the story for the plot's sake. It seems poorly thought out. Things like that, that don't align with the assumptions we're asked to make about what's happening, quickly become too much. The premise is good, and the artwork is okay, but it's a quick, broad overview of a very complex topic that has some definite flaws and doesn't actually teach as well as is intended."

I think the main problem was that Neurocomic aimed to reduce complicated processes and theories into simplified illustrations and explanations. The problem with this is that a lot of neurology isn't simple and so it just hints at complex matters before moving on very fast, which ends up being more confusing. It often ended up not defining terms properly (I'm assuming because it would have been too long) and summarising things like neural plasticity in a couple of paragraphs. Some things that could have been really interesting are mentioned (like psychopathology) but then never explored at all. The result is a book that ends up being a bit inaccessible to people unfamiliar with the subject and too reductionist for those who are.I did, however, find the visual guides to things such as synapses and action potential really helpful.

Maybe it would've served the book better for the MC to be excited about the journey he was on, rather than spending the entire book being a jerk to the scientists, completely unimpressed by the things going on around him (in his brain!), desperate to escape to get back to some random woman he saw for all of three seconds but was utterly convinced was the love (probably more like the lust) of his life."

The book is not exhaustive; it includes a psychedelic mix of characters and symbols that may only convey to people that work in the field; the drawings are black and white with strong lines that some might find stark; the words and dialogue are essential.

I have mixed feelings about this neurology-based graphic novel.The book follows our protagonist through the brain, meeting different scientists who made significant discoveries about its structure and function along the way. I do think that the artwork was great. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but it was a bit surrealist at times and very stylistic which was impressive combined with its effectiveness at illustration different neurological processes. The front cover artwork was particularly beautiful. As a visual guide to scientific processes, it worked quite well...for a few. I got the feeling it aimed to be accessible to those unfamiliar with neurology and interesting to those who are. Somehow though, it managed to oversimplify AND overcomplicate things. I think the main problem was that Neurocomic aimed to reduce complicated processes and theories into simplified illustrations and explanations. The problem with this is that a lot of neurology isn't simple and so it just hints at complex matters before moving on very fast, which ends up being more confusing. It often ended up not defining terms properly (I'm assuming because it would have been too long) and summarising things like neural plasticity in a couple of paragraphs. Some things that could have been really interesting are mentioned (like psychopathology) but then never explored at all. The result is a book that ends up being a bit inaccessible to people unfamiliar with the subject and too reductionist for those who are.I did, however, find the visual guides to things such as synapses and action potential really helpful. I imagine it would help me a lot to visualise it if I needed to academically. I'll definitely keep it around for this reason. Overall a disappointing read that could have, and SHOULD have been potentially really interesting. "
152,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84041361-manakissi,2,"I like the idea and the drawing style. Unfortunately there are several downsides that really had a negative impact on my enjoyment of the comic. First of all there's this compulsion to present all the elements in the brain as gendered, either male or female. My absolute favorite characters are an exception to this though: I love the wonderful Kraken and Aplysia the sea slug!The second downside is extensive name dropping. It would be so much more engaging if there was a separate list, like a ""cast of characters"" that explained which scientists did what and provided a recap on the importance of these scientific studies to present-day understanding of the brain. A third unpleasant aspect was the caricature illustration of the brain hemispheres as two nude humanoid figures, with traditional male and female markers (which to my eyes is a direct reference to a hopelessly outdated and conservative concept of the ""female vs male"" traits that are appointed to the right vs left hemisphere), with distinctly African features to boot (which, combined with nudity, is a racist visual stereotype of ""primitivity""). I also would have loved an index of concepts (especially since my other favorite, Aplysia, was not explained) since this comic is written by neuroscientists and promises to ""unravel the mysteries of the human brain"". 2,5/5"

154,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93146887-bonnie-fan,4,"Enjoyed this Alice-in-wonderland exploration of the brain. I was drawn to the silver foiled blue cover out of a stack of books a friend took out on hold - she had the same crow-eyed reaction, finding the graphic novel first in a neurologist's office. The illustration style took some time to get used to, the cartoonish faces too detailed to be childish, though the neurons and synapses played beautifully in biological and abstract landscapes. It took me back to a class I took in college to fulfill a biology requirement - Drugs Galore - filled with classmates who likely knew more about the subject than our sweet, Catholic professor whose most shocking brush with the illicit was her sister's friend stashing peach schnapps in the school locker. Sad to say, the more technical explanations on the neuron mechanisms could have been clearer, with less text and more illustration - multiple times I found myself lost, thinking a diagrammatic depiction would have been easier to follow. The metacognition and scaling of the fourth wall seemed well paired - I only wish there was an acknowledgement of the dark unknowns of the brain and the shortcomings of the history of research presented. Overall, an enjoyable trip through the brain that does not feel textbook."
155,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12287466-brittany,1,"This was...a lot. The adventure story itself - a man trying to get back to a woman - is laden with history and science, and the occasional breaking of the fourth wall to specify the characters' location in a fictional world. There are strange forays out of the biographical/scientific bits into the surreal. For instance: a giant squid is mentioned in the context of how Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley used giant squid axons to study neuronal signals, but then the aforementioned squid appears and attacks the ship Hodgkin, Huxley, and our protagonist are on. In the context of the story, anything appearing for real in the tale would need to correspond to something that's actually inside a person's brain, and the squid doesn't, so it's just a strange insertion into the story for the plot's sake. It seems poorly thought out. Things like that, that don't align with the assumptions we're asked to make about what's happening, quickly become too much. The premise is good, and the artwork is okay, but it's a quick, broad overview of a very complex topic that has some definite flaws and doesn't actually teach as well as is intended."

I mean, it's literally a didactical comic book about neuroscience. They can't try to explain any easier than this. And it's pretty interesting. But it also made me feel dumber. Like, I seriously read every line twice so I could understand what it was saying. And I laughed out loud a couple times of how it didn't made any sense to me. I'm still confused about some parts. Knowledge of biology, chemistry, and physics just don't stay at my mind for much longer, it's just really hard for me to keep this kind of information. Historical dates and facts? A large number of fictional characters and plots? Sure. This? Nah. But still, I liked. It was fast, direct, and well illustrated. And I did learn stuff (which I hope I'll still remember tomorrow), especially about the memory and the neurotransmitters. Now, I wish the protagonist was a woman since the one that appears in the story is not only someone that the main guy runs after but also a hallucination. And you can't change the sex of the real scientists, so I'd have liked it better to see a girl in the spotlight here. I also didn't understand the squid, but whatever."

The book is not exhaustive; it includes a psychedelic mix of characters and symbols that may only convey to people that work in the field; the drawings are black and white with strong lines that some might find stark; the words and dialogue are essential.

I have mixed feelings about this neurology-based graphic novel.The book follows our protagonist through the brain, meeting different scientists who made significant discoveries about its structure and function along the way. I do think that the artwork was great. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but it was a bit surrealist at times and very stylistic which was impressive combined with its effectiveness at illustration different neurological processes. The front cover artwork was particularly beautiful. As a visual guide to scientific processes, it worked quite well...for a few. I got the feeling it aimed to be accessible to those unfamiliar with neurology and interesting to those who are. Somehow though, it managed to oversimplify AND overcomplicate things. I think the main problem was that Neurocomic aimed to reduce complicated processes and theories into simplified illustrations and explanations. The problem with this is that a lot of neurology isn't simple and so it just hints at complex matters before moving on very fast, which ends up being more confusing. It often ended up not defining terms properly (I'm assuming because it would have been too long) and summarising things like neural plasticity in a couple of paragraphs. Some things that could have been really interesting are mentioned (like psychopathology) but then never explored at all.

I have mixed feelings about this neurology-based graphic novel.The book follows our protagonist through the brain, meeting different scientists who made significant discoveries about its structure and function along the way. I do think that the artwork was great. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but it was a bit surrealist at times and very stylistic which was impressive combined with its effectiveness at illustration different neurological processes. The front cover artwork was particularly beautiful. As a visual guide to scientific processes, it worked quite well...for a few. I got the feeling it aimed to be accessible to those unfamiliar with neurology and interesting to those who are. Somehow though, it managed to oversimplify AND overcomplicate things. I think the main problem was that Neurocomic aimed to reduce complicated processes and theories into simplified illustrations and explanations. The problem with this is that a lot of neurology isn't simple and so it just hints at complex matters before moving on very fast, which ends up being more confusing. It often ended up not defining terms properly (I'm assuming because it would have been too long) and summarising things like neural plasticity in a couple of paragraphs. Some things that could have been really interesting are mentioned (like psychopathology) but then never explored at all. The result is a book that ends up being a bit inaccessible to people unfamiliar with the subject and too reductionist for those who are.I did, however, find the visual guides to things such as synapses and action potential really helpful. I imagine it would help me a lot to visualise it if I needed to academically. I'll definitely keep it around for this reason.

244,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93146887-bonnie-fan,4,"Enjoyed this Alice-in-wonderland exploration of the brain. I was drawn to the silver foiled blue cover out of a stack of books a friend took out on hold - she had the same crow-eyed reaction, finding the graphic novel first in a neurologist's office. The illustration style took some time to get used to, the cartoonish faces too detailed to be childish, though the neurons and synapses played beautifully in biological and abstract landscapes. It took me back to a class I took in college to fulfill a biology requirement - Drugs Galore - filled with classmates who likely knew more about the subject than our sweet, Catholic professor whose most shocking brush with the illicit was her sister's friend stashing peach schnapps in the school locker. Sad to say, the more technical explanations on the neuron mechanisms could have been clearer, with less text and more illustration - multiple times I found myself lost, thinking a diagrammatic depiction would have been easier to follow. The metacognition and scaling of the fourth wall seemed well paired - I only wish there was an acknowledgement of the dark unknowns of the brain and the shortcomings of the history of research presented. Overall, an enjoyable trip through the brain that does not feel textbook."
245,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12287466-brittany,1,"This was...a lot. The adventure story itself - a man trying to get back to a woman - is laden with history and science, and the occasional breaking of the fourth wall to specify the characters' location in a fictional world. There are strange forays out of the biographical/scientific bits into the surreal. For instance: a giant squid is mentioned in the context of how Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley used giant squid axons to study neuronal signals, but then the aforementioned squid appears and attacks the ship Hodgkin, Huxley, and our protagonist are on. In the context of the story, anything appearing for real in the tale would need to correspond to something that's actually inside a person's brain, and the squid doesn't, so it's just a strange insertion into the story for the plot's sake. It seems poorly thought out. Things like that, that don't align with the assumptions we're asked to make about what's happening, quickly become too much. The premise is good, and the artwork is okay, but it's a quick, broad overview of a very complex topic that has some definite flaws and doesn't actually teach as well as is intended."

BUT I liked the idea of ​​neurotransmitters ""opening"" the receptor, and the drugs being bugs because when this ""bug"" appeared, we knew exactly what the drug was.

I mean, it's literally a didactical comic book about neuroscience. They can't try to explain any easier than this. And it's pretty interesting. But it also made me feel dumber. Like, I seriously read every line twice so I could understand what it was saying. And I laughed out loud a couple times of how it didn't made any sense to me. I'm still confused about some parts. Knowledge of biology, chemistry, and physics just don't stay at my mind for much longer, it's just really hard for me to keep this kind of information. Historical dates and facts? A large number of fictional characters and plots? Sure. This? Nah. But still, I liked. It was fast, direct, and well illustrated. And I did learn stuff (which I hope I'll still remember tomorrow), especially about the memory and the neurotransmitters. Now, I wish the protagonist was a woman since the one that appears in the story is not only someone that the main guy runs after but also a hallucination. And you can't change the sex of the real scientists, so I'd have liked it better to see a girl in the spotlight here. I also didn't understand the squid, but whatever."

I study and have worked in neuroscience for 5 years, and didn’t realize how introductory this would be. I liked the Alice in Wonderland surrealism, and am torn between liking the illustrations and feeling they were too simplistic. The cover implies a little more detail in the illustrations. Also, agreeing with many other reviews, for being written in 2013, the representation of women was pretty atrocious. The primary woman was an object to be chased and then rescued... a few were representing neurotransmitters, but of course primarily the ones associated with pleasure... and not a single female scientist was featured. There are plenty to discuss that have also discovered very fundamental concepts in neuroscience (which this book focuses on, if that’s its excuse). I’m glad I got it from the library since it’s expensive and I was thinking I should own a nice copy, as it is my field, but I will not be getting one."

I expected it to be a bit more... scientific I guess. It is more juvenile than I expected (it was shelved with the adult graphic novels at the library) and is mostly a run down of various men (the only woman in the book serves as a plot point and a damsel in supposed distress) who have contributed to the field of neuroscience. The art feels heavily inspired by Underground Comix and is both simple and surreal. It kept me more interested than the subject or the writing. I'd recommend this for a younger audience (tweens perhaps?) but there are far better introductions to neuroscience out there for adults. "

The humanoid characters really existed in the uncanny valley, which I'm not sure was entirely intentional.I get that it was mostly old white dudes who have made neuroscience discoveries up until this point, but the attempt to include non-male characters was a total flop. Spoiler alert: none of them were humans, and they fulfilled female stereotypes/were mildly to totally objectified. I was hoping they would muse more on current research in neuroscience, but alas.

274,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93146887-bonnie-fan,4,"Enjoyed this Alice-in-wonderland exploration of the brain. I was drawn to the silver foiled blue cover out of a stack of books a friend took out on hold - she had the same crow-eyed reaction, finding the graphic novel first in a neurologist's office. The illustration style took some time to get used to, the cartoonish faces too detailed to be childish, though the neurons and synapses played beautifully in biological and abstract landscapes. It took me back to a class I took in college to fulfill a biology requirement - Drugs Galore - filled with classmates who likely knew more about the subject than our sweet, Catholic professor whose most shocking brush with the illicit was her sister's friend stashing peach schnapps in the school locker. Sad to say, the more technical explanations on the neuron mechanisms could have been clearer, with less text and more illustration - multiple times I found myself lost, thinking a diagrammatic depiction would have been easier to follow. The metacognition and scaling of the fourth wall seemed well paired - I only wish there was an acknowledgement of the dark unknowns of the brain and the shortcomings of the history of research presented. Overall, an enjoyable trip through the brain that does not feel textbook."
275,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12287466-brittany,1,"This was...a lot. The adventure story itself - a man trying to get back to a woman - is laden with history and science, and the occasional breaking of the fourth wall to specify the characters' location in a fictional world. There are strange forays out of the biographical/scientific bits into the surreal. For instance: a giant squid is mentioned in the context of how Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley used giant squid axons to study neuronal signals, but then the aforementioned squid appears and attacks the ship Hodgkin, Huxley, and our protagonist are on. In the context of the story, anything appearing for real in the tale would need to correspond to something that's actually inside a person's brain, and the squid doesn't, so it's just a strange insertion into the story for the plot's sake. It seems poorly thought out. Things like that, that don't align with the assumptions we're asked to make about what's happening, quickly become too much. The premise is good, and the artwork is okay, but it's a quick, broad overview of a very complex topic that has some definite flaws and doesn't actually teach as well as is intended."

The authors chose to depict an adventure inside a brain (we initially don't know whose brain it is), at the same time showing the scientific discoveries of how the brain works, mixing the adventure with a lecture about the brain itself! The drawings are great, and add up to the dream-like feeling the graphic-novel intends to convey.[PORTUGUESE-BR]Uma simples e boa história dentro de um cérebro, o personagem principal está preso dentro dele e deverá visitar todas suas partes a fim de encontrar uma forma de sair.

BUT I liked the idea of ​​neurotransmitters ""opening"" the receptor, and the drugs being bugs because when this ""bug"" appeared, we knew exactly what the drug was. And FINALLY: it is a reasonably good book but it could have been better if the author had watched hataraku know."
278,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15751210-clara,3,"3.5I think this is one of those books that's supposed to make you feel smarter. I mean, it's literally a didactical comic book about neuroscience. They can't try to explain any easier than this. And it's pretty interesting. But it also made me feel dumber. Like, I seriously read every line twice so I could understand what it was saying. And I laughed out loud a couple times of how it didn't made any sense to me. I'm still confused about some parts. Knowledge of biology, chemistry, and physics just don't stay at my mind for much longer, it's just really hard for me to keep this kind of information. Historical dates and facts? A large number of fictional characters and plots? Sure. This? Nah. But still, I liked. It was fast, direct, and well illustrated. And I did learn stuff (which I hope I'll still remember tomorrow), especially about the memory and the neurotransmitters. Now, I wish the protagonist was a woman since the one that appears in the story is not only someone that the main guy runs after but also a hallucination. And you can't change the sex of the real scientists, so I'd have liked it better to see a girl in the spotlight here. I also didn't understand the squid, but whatever."
279,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14202818-natalie-carey,3,"I was expecting more from this. I study and have worked in neuroscience for 5 years, and didn’t realize how introductory this would be. I liked the Alice in Wonderland surrealism, and am torn between liking the illustrations and feeling they were too simplistic. The cover implies a little more detail in the illustrations. Also, agreeing with many other reviews, for being written in 2013, the representation of women was pretty atrocious. The primary woman was an object to be chased and then rescued... a few were representing neurotransmitters, but of course primarily the ones associated with pleasure... and not a single female scientist was featured. There are plenty to discuss that have also discovered very fundamental concepts in neuroscience (which this book focuses on, if that’s its excuse). I’m glad I got it from the library since it’s expensive and I was thinking I should own a nice copy, as it is my field, but I will not be getting one."
280,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6535385-page,3,"Hmm. I chose this for the Read Harder challenge as a comic not published by DC, Marvel or Imagine (it was published by Nobrow Press). I expected it to be a bit more... scientific I guess. It is more juvenile than I expected (it was shelved with the adult graphic novels at the library) and is mostly a run down of various men (the only woman in the book serves as a plot point and a damsel in supposed distress) who have contributed to the field of neuroscience. The art feels heavily inspired by Underground Comix and is both simple and surreal. It kept me more interested than the subject or the writing. I'd recommend this for a younger audience (tweens perhaps?) but there are far better introductions to neuroscience out there for adults. "
281,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800923-andreana,3,"Educational but with its flaws. As many have said before, the illustrator clearly doesn't do comics often, as the paneling was quite simplistic. Still, I loved how trippy a lot of the art felt. The humanoid characters really existed in the uncanny valley, which I'm not sure was entirely intentional.I get that it was mostly old white dudes who have made neuroscience discoveries up until this point, but the attempt to include non-male characters was a total flop. Spoiler alert: none of them were humans, and they fulfilled female stereotypes/were mildly to totally objectified. I was hoping they would muse more on current research in neuroscience, but alas. Decent intro illustrated text for someone wanting to get exposed to neurosci."
282,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63012-eli,3,"Liked the science; not a big fan of the art style or the frame story. Was the MC in his early 30s or late 50s? Inconsistency in the way he was drawn made it difficult to tell. Also, the dude was inside his own brain. In a comic about brains. Maybe it would've served the book better for the MC to be excited about the journey he was on, rather than spending the entire book being a jerk to the scientists, completely unimpressed by the things going on around him (in his brain!), desperate to escape to get back to some random woman he saw for all of three seconds but was utterly convinced was the love (probably more like the lust) of his life."
283,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42328525-rachel-baryak,4,"A very short, hyper generalized comic explaining the absolute fundamentals of neuro science with very brief definitions of those components. It walks through dendrites all the way into action potential, then memory, and the philosophy of why we have a mind/soul as product of the brain. The downside wasn't about the lack of women, specifically, it shows how WHITE men dominated and are accredited with all of the discoveries around these topics in neuroscience which was actually disheartening overall as you get introduced to the accredited scientists through the novel."
284,1907704701,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5167216-sherri,3,"I too have some mixed feelings about this book. I love the artwork detailing functioning of the brain and lots of other things, but it is very male focused. I feel like the ""story"" could have been told without making it about a man chasing a woman through the whole thing. I also felt the portrayal of the ""good"" vs. ""bad"" chemicals to be very heavy handed (antidepressants good, cannabis bad. Okay kids)."

These are the kinds of books we need more of, that take a subject matter that is challenging and only known to experts and translate it in a compact way for a broader demanding audience while retaining an echo of the depth of complexity of the subject matter.An illustrated journey into the study of brain and what we know about it, from the bird's eye view of a scientist. The book is not exhaustive; it includes a psychedelic mix of characters and symbols that may only convey to people that work in the field; the drawings are black and white with strong lines that some might find stark; the words and dialogue are essential. But what matters is that the creative work offers depth and a thread to the beginning of the story of how our brain works in a format I have not found anywhere, and does so with mastery and love."
