0,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3984582-sara-forsberg,5,"The BBC series with the same name has become a little bit of a phenomenon, and rightly so. This companion book is filled with the same ingredients that made the TV series so popular - in-depth, exciting information, wonderful graphics and a lyrical, almost poetic language that is used to describe some of the most fantastic discoveries of mankind. It's entertaining, interesting and important - I wish this book was mandatory for all teenagers, because it balances known fact with a sense of excitement and brings a much-needed perspective of adventure to a subject that for some reason has lost traction with young people today. Science is one the most important undertakings there is, and with the TV series and this book Brian Cox has proved that he has the ability to reawaken the fascination and interest that it rightly deserves. Wonderful!"
1,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89324589-ming-wei,5,"Well written, well presented throughout, very interesting, very educational, so much information within the book, it is the type of book that never gets dull. No editorial errors, No negatives at all, was very impressed with the book, which relates to the TV show. The book is just a sensational gathering of the wonder of the solar system, cannot fault the book, the book cover is attractive. Excellent!!!!! for anybody interested in space, the universe etc, this book will be perfect for you. One of the best I have ever read regarding the Solar System."
2,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2761880-tom,3,"Brian Cox gives a visually stunning whistlestop tour of the solar system. The writing is engaging, if somewhat hyperbolic at times, and reflects the passion that the author holds for his subject area and the related sciences. Unfortunately the first edition has a number of typos that could confuse the casual reader, I hope that these are corrected in future editions."
3,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"I really enjoyed this tour of the most interesting spots in the Solar System. This book is apparently the tie-in for some BBC television show that I'd never seen, but it stands very well on it's own merits. Cox's passion for his subject is infectious and I enjoyed the way he compared and contrasted the extreme environments to be found on the planets and moons around us to places on Earth itself. Also, this book contains a number of fantastic photos of our Solar System that I hadn't seen before.One complaint: I bought the Kindle version of this book and read most of it on my iPad. The text seems to have been shoved from the printed version violently into the Kindle format without any thought at all. Things are very messed up."
4,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85302381-countess-de-winter,5,"Professor Brian Cox, is not only an accomplished scientist, but a person gifted with a way of words. He is a gifted writer as well. This book about the wonders of the solar system is nothing but a poetic tribute to the vastness of our universe and the beauty within it. I have always loved space science and solar system and books like these are just love! If you are an astro-geek this book is a must-read for you. Professor Brian Cox adds fuel to your interest about the universe. Being a book about space and all that, one must think that this book will be boring and include highly complex concepts but it is the exact opposite. A perfect companion to the BBC documentary, Prof Cox beautifully explains each and every concepts from planets to the solar and lunar eclipse with vivid detail, but in a way that everyone understands it. I saw the documentary when I was very young, about 12 years old and there was not a concept I could not graspwell as Einstein said: if you truly understand something, you should be able to explain it to a 6-year-old. Prof Cox is extremely good at his workHis documentary is stellar and his book reaches the stars!"
5,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27383450-katerina,5,Fucking spectacular in every way.
6,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55739851-sean,5,"As someone who knows very little about astronomy/space, I really appreciated this book. It wasn't hard to follow at all and I feel like I learned a lot from it.I do regret buying the Kindle version though as it made some of the diagrams difficult to read, and the lack of color was relevant in many places."
7,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12215616-koen,4,"I have the Dutch version of Wonders of the Solar System: ISBN 978 90 5956 404 6, published by Fonteine Uitgevers. (Couldn’t find this version on Goodreads ☺, so I used the English version).First of all: Wait for the next Dutch publication of this book. I found some irritating unnecessary faults in the Dutch version of the book. Page 184 describes that the there must be a photograph of the PanSTARRS 1-Telescoop at Hawaii. The photograph however indicates the British Electric (RAF) Lightning XS 451, which is described in the chapter ""The Thin Blue Line” on pages 116 and 117.Page 195 describes that there must be a photograph of the Afar plains in Ethiopia. De photograph however indicates the meteorite, which entered the atmosphere at the 20 st November 2008 in West-Canada, which is described in the chapter ""The first Defence Line” on pages 130 and 131.I’ve contacted Fonteine Uitgevers several times and of course the fault was discovered the same day I send the email with my discovery. How convenient! I’ve got a promise from Fonteine that they will contact me when they known how this could happen. That was on the 5th of January 2012. Currently it is the 16th of September and the editor still has to send me an answer. My advice is that if you don’t want to wait for the next publication of this book, you buy the original in the English language.The book itself: I really do like the way Brian Cox writes and explains our own solar system accompanied with very good illustrations and beautiful photographs. (As long as they are on the right pages!) Brian Cox explains all the questions concerning our solar system in an easy way, understandable and at the same time Brian is not shy of using mathematics if necessary."
8,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1077434-elaine,4,"I have not seen the television series that goes along with this, but now I'd like to. I now want to read all of the other books in the series as well. This was highly readable and illuminating. Very good for casual observers like myself who like to know about things but have trouble wrapping their heads around the big concepts of what it means to life in an infinite universe."
9,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33362779-gareth,4,"I enjoyed reading this book and it had some brilliant sections in it, however I felt it was a bit fragmented. It didn't seem to flow as good as human universe or forces of nature and it felt like it was more of a collection of small articles that had been collected into a book. Don't get me wrong it is still very interesting and the sections themselves are very well written and researched but as a whole it didn't flow as well as his other books. That aside though, the content is really interesting and Brian Cox does a very good job of first identifying places on Earth that are peculiar and then showing you somewhere in the universe that matches this peculiarity and how scientists have used this to explore the solar system through photos and light. There is a heavy emphasis on finding life on other planets which is linked very well to places on Earth such as our caves and I've caps and how we've seen things in these which we are now seeing on other planets and moons such as Mars and Europa.Still a very good read and definitely worth picking up if you're into the solar system or just Brian Cox books in general. Lots of photos of power stances too...."
10,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"I’m familiar with Cox from his many appearances in Symphony of Science videos (a YouTube series in which clips from scientists are remixed with music on various themes, like “An Ode to the Brain”, or “The Poetry of Reality”), but have never read any of his work. This volume is the book version of a televised series, I believe, rather like Cosmos or Civilisation’s book versions. Although most books on the Solar System take a predictable approach (The Sun > the planets in sequence > outer reaches including the Oort cloud and such), Cox’s tack does away with that. He begins with the Sun and connects the formation of the early solar system to the present behavior of Jupiter and Saturn and their many moons. Next, Cox shifts to planetary science, examining common processes and features of Earth and other planets. One subsection of this is very similar to Cosmos’ episode “Heaven and Hell” as Cox compares Mars, Venus, and Earth and the role of climate on each of their history. The last section involves life on Earth. Because this is adapted from a television series, photography features heavily, and Cox often uses pictures to compare features on Earth with those found on other planets. The television show must have been exciting to watch, because some of the photographs include Cox’s flight in a jet, taking him nearly out of the atmosphere, and visiting various desolate places on Earth that invite comparison to Mercury, Titan, etc. This is definitely an enjoyable volume."
11,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58643485-john-tompkins,2,"Layout spoiled it totallyThe basic content was awesome, without doubt worth 5 stars, BUT there were so many layout issues that it became impossible to read. In the end couldn't get to the list of cross references fast enough. The only way to find a cross reference was to do a search for it manually. WTH. We have had WYSIWYG text editors for decades now. All in all very disappointing. "
12,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15083337-lucy,5,"This is such a lush book, its so informative and its shown in such a great way, I can hardly not love it. Its obviously had a lot of time invested in it and the diagrams and photos really help it to be less of an information block and it becomes super interesting and easy to learn from."
13,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541568-raymond,4,This was an excellent book on the Solar System and the Universe in general. Again Cox and Cohen provide excellent facts about our little patch of the Milky Way in a way that can be read by anyone. The mathematic formulae are plainly shown and the reader is encouraged to test the formulas themselves. Fascinating reading.
14,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41019684-ryan-finlayson,5,Very informative. Very good diagrams and explanations of the fascinating events which occur throughout the solar system. 
15,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18110981-julie,5,An overview of our current knowledge of the Solar System conveyed with text and beautiful photos. It made me want to see the BBC series it is based on.

17,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4259551-austin,5,"Simple metaphors for complex, yet important science."
18,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80176951-waris,4,"Doesn't dive much deeper into the depths of the cosmos; mostly basic stuff. Great book for newbie enthusiasts in cosmology. It stays within the solar system and on the large scale. Given the fact that it was written quite a whole ago, it needs to update the fact that Opportunity, the Mars rover, is dead.It mostly sticks to planetary stuff and not something I'd call an interesting book unless it was the first book that I read about space."
19,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9633121-david-stoney,5,"Although it's been an interesting read so far, unfortunately it uses the same device as the TV series to explain various concepts. Whilst this may be useful on occasion, unfortunately I found the TV version images to be more like a travelogue and the images were too distracting from the concepts being explained.It seems that Prof. Cox allowed some arty producer/director to use the images to dumb it all down - as so often happens when people who've only done media studies and social studies get involved with proper science. It's almost as if they don't trust us to be able to understand the concepts being explained (for further proof just look what they did to anything with maths, or chemistry) and poor old Prof. Jim Al-Kalili (sorry if I spelt his name wrong), but each time the programmes end up like an episode of ""Wish You Were Here"".Other than that the books by Prof. Cox are a fascinating read...."
20,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10755513-siobh-n-bayertz,5,"Not only do I love science but I also love Brian Cox. I watched the series before reading the book and I knew as soon as I heard of it's release that I'd want to own it! I was more than happy then when my sister got it for my birthday a few years ago XDReading the books feels like you're actually just having a conversation with the man himself about our solar system. Everything is explained clearly and often with illustrations which help a great deal when trying to grasp some of the more difficult concepts. It's a truly fascinating read that seems to bring you on a journey of what is around is and of what is so far away that it's almost hard to comprehend.What I also love about this book is the obvious, almost childlike wonderment that Brian Cox portrays in this book. You really can't go wrong with this book!"
21,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5966790-xanthi,4,"I watched the series before reading the book and found that worked well for me. The book is not super technical but for someone like me whose knowledge about astrophysics is pretty limited, I found the 'show me' aspect of the DVD easier to follow than the 'tell me' of the book. The book is full of large, colourful illustrations and photographs. The text is interesting and informative and not at all dry or overly complicated. I certainly learnt much about our own planet and others, and about astronomy in general, from reading this book. If you read this book but haven't seen the series, I can highly recommend that you seek it out and watch it. Brian Cox is a very cool physicist and presenter, and obviously has a passion for science. "
22,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27493200-joel-murray,5,"Brian Cox does a great job of taking the facts and discoveries, and then highlighting the wonder in it. It's a fantastic blend between scientific and poetic.I probably enjoyed the Wonders of the Universe more, because the subject matter is so much bigger. However, this book shows that between our planet and the entire universe there's a whole lot of excitement there to discover in our own ""backyard"". Our solar system is so much more than a bunch of rocks and gas revolving around a star.It helps that the photos are so amazing. This images in this series of books really are quite beautiful. It highlights that the solar system is an amazing place and I'm sure we've only barely scratched the surface."
23,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31697339-chris,4,"I got this book a couple of years back as a gift from my parents and never really bothered to read it until, how cliche, my interest for space was sparked again by the movie Interstellar.This is a wonderfulful book about all the weird and stunning things our solar system has to offer. The text is halfway between scientific descriptions of what is going on and beautiful prose. At times I wished the explanation would be a bit more physical and mathematical, but I know that would have compromised the accessibility of the book for a lot of people. The real beauty of this book is the curiosity for all things around us that really shines through the pages and that is what makes it so nice to read. Also, lot of pretty pictures :P"
24,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4597982-huda,5,"One of the greatest books I have ever read. The sheer magnificence of the wonders of our solar system fills my heart with humility and fascination. The universe is a cold and a barren place, yet, from the nothing we became and flourished. We overcame impossible odds and survived. Life, overpowered the hostile conditions of our universe and evolved. The authors simple way of explanation captivates the readers, transporting them millions of kilometers away from home and into other worlds of stunning wonders then back to our own astonishing planet. The book has left a great impact on the way I view my home planet and my place in it, and moreover, the universe and it's infinite wonders. I Can't recommend reading it enough."
25,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128567-thomas-wysocki,4,"I could easily give the book itself the full five stars. The content is as engaging as it is informative... and its quite informative. Andew Cohen takes you on a journey exploring the solar system making you want to learn more. I've taken away one star due to the limitations of the basic kindle reading device and some little formatting quirks. For starters, while I'm a big fan of the kindle, this book is one of those where you really wish you had a vibrant color screen to enjoy the photos with. In terms of formatting, there are the occasional captions or excerpts which seem to appear in the middle of the normal text. "
26,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6874323-thomas-ray,2,"On the whole a bit low on content, high on words. Good photos. One good thing: points to this fascinating study by Pablo Mauashttp://www.iafe.uba.ar/u/pablo/Papers...""Long-term solar activity influences on South American rivers."" The graph on page 5 of the pdf shows that the sun's energy output fluctuates with a roughly 30-year cycle that tracks with streamflow in major rivers. This is /not/ the sunspot cycle.

27,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,5,This book (it was intended to accompany the BBC TV series) are fascinating windows on to a subject which although is very visible and accessible is still bewildering and in some cases a little intimidating. The book takes you on a tour of a number of subjects showing lavish images from the latest (at the time of going to press at least) developments and discoveries. If there was ever a book to fire the imagination and get someone interesting in the science and wonder of the solar system this is certainly as good a point to start as any. 
28,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776938-paul,5,Brian Cox's Wonders of the Solar System has been one of the most enjoyable series in recent years. The joy in his work comes across in this book but it doesn't quite compare with the schoolboy-on-xmas-day like joy you see in the TV series when he explains a new topic. The series and this book present space exploration in a wonderfully accessible way for everyone which I believe makes Brian the Carl Sagan of our generation.
29,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6068530-jim-whitefield,5,"I just loved this book. I had watched the TV series and the book adds extra dimensions - and has stunning photographs throughout. The origin, journey, and ultimate destiny, of our solar system are well explained and made extremely interesting. Brian Cox's enthusiasm for his subject matter is contagious. Along with 'Wonders of the Universe' and 'Wonders of life', the three volumes make a great set. My advice - get all three series and read all the books. You won't be disappointed."
30,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42211910-meg-meiss,5,Great book! I am definitely going to read another by him as soon as possible. I randomly saw him on QI when an episode popped up on Hulu and decided to give a book of his a try finding him funny but also found his way of viewing things outside of the box very interesting.I've been a fan of Astronomy since I was young and it definitely filled in a few holes to my knowledge and gave me several new questions to have answered. Can not wait to read another by him. Definitely recommended!
31,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36964682-mark-bright,4,"Excellent book, just not suited to a e-ink type e-reader. No colour pictures, many pictures are too small to see properly, and the staggered nature of different blocks of text make it annoying to read on the likes of my Kindle Paperwhite. I feel this is something that Amazon should look at, these books are often more expensive than the paper alternative due to VAT, and really ought to be reworked to make them more readable."
32,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4982407-marcus,5,"A great accompaniment to the series of the same name, this essentially follows on from Sagan's Cosmos, exploring the solar system and all the complexity that encompasses, but keeping the ideas and theories completely accessible. This book will make you want to explore and find out more on the subject, and in that it does its job wonderfully."
33,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6734371-joanna-gawn,5,"An inspiring, mind-opening book with some truly astounding images. As always, Prof. Cox's style of narration is clear, with his own inimitable enthusiasm, making hard science accessible and enjoyable. This takes me back to the days of wonder and awe when I studied Astronomy with the Open University.This book is a treasure trove of astronomical delights."
34,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46788274-travis-williams,5,Love the Wonders series. The books and TV series are equally fantastic. Sir David Attenborough said he would pass the torch to Brian Cox. I think he is carrying on Sagan's work as well. I really appreciate all of the subtle references to Sagan throughout the series. There is obviously a respect there that I appreciate. Looking forward to his new series in 2016!!
35,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4780358-chris,4,"Another awesome book from Professor Brian Cox. Full of fascinating facts and profusely illustrated with diagrams and photos, this book examines our Solar System. For anyone with the slightest interest in what may be out there!"
36,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982358-derek-bridge,4,This is a lovely book to pick up and dip into on an occasional basis. It is beautifully illustrated and written in lyrical prose that avoids obfuscation while conveying the sense of wonder that is promised in the book's title.
37,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27271517-onoskal,5,"This book offers itself as a perfect companion for those who have watched the serial, especially for those who were too busy being awed by beautiful scenery and animations, therefore missing some splendid explanations of the astronomical phenomenons.This book is good."
38,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10056226-rohan,5,Brian has explained the mysteries and awe inspiring beauty of our solar system in a way making the complex theories and laws relevant to all readers. You don't have to be astro nerd to love this book. Must read if you are a stargazer :-)
39,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6720386-reija,3,"I read this along side watching tv show, that's why only three stars rating, the book didn't add anything new. I wonder if it would work better reading alone and of course if you are rehearsing. Good pictures and diagrams."
40,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1530995-ted,2,"I would love to have given this book more stars, it is well written and full of beautiful illustrations, but the numerous misspelled and mistranscribed words, coupled with mislabeled and poorly explained diagrams made reading it a chore at times."
41,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3451606-nikki,5,A truly wonderful book that goes into even more detail than the tv series. Brian Cox is inspiring as he takes you through the solar system. I will read this again and again!!
42,0007386907,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5462693-paraskevi,5,"This is a very good book on the Solar System, and for anyone needing either a refresher or an introduction to our Solar System."
