0,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,3,"This book should be titled ""The Book of Eels: A Childhood Spent Fishing with My Dad"". Actually, maybe we could just take off the first part, and make it ""Fishing with My Dad: A Memoir"". That would better reflect the book's contents. But that's not what it's called and when I saw this book I went, Oh goody! A book about eels! I don't know anything about eels! I must read this book!(Not sure if all those exclamation marks were in my thoughts, but probably. I get excited at the prospect of learning something new.)Now, had I bothered to read the book's blurb, I would have learned that it's not really so much about eels. But did I bother to read the blurb? Nope! I was too excited to see a book about something I know zero about and quickly placed a hold on it.The first chapter was thrilling. I learned some fascinating things about eels. I learned that they:•Have four growth stages, beginning with the larvae which has ""a body like a willow leaf, flat and virtually transparent, only a few millimeters long"".•The other stages are glass, yellow, and silver.•All eels, no matter the species or where they end up in the world, begin life in the Sargasso Sea•They then migrate thousands of miles to their adult home•Once there, they normally stay within a radius of just a few hundred yards•Eels are believed to travel back to the Sargasso Sea (where the smallest larvae are always found) to reproduce, but no one has ever seen an adult eel in the Sargasso Sea despite searching for them for a century.•An eel can live up to fifty years in one place though they are believed to die after reproducing.I learned all that and more in just the first chapter. Imagine my excitement, thinking the entire book was going to be full of facts!But chapter 2 came and my balloon burst.I quickly discovered that the book was not going to be much about eels, but about the author's time spent fishing for eels with his dad. Just about every other chapter of the book is about that.As a vegan who finds fishing horrifying (imagine having a huge hook stuck through your lips), I had to skip those chapters. I just couldn't do it. I couldn't read about catching them and I couldn't read about gutting them and cooking them and consuming them. Most of the other chapters are about people who have studied eels, their lives and what they thought them. There were interesting people such as Aristotle, Rachel Carson, and Sigmund Freud (you won't be surprised to learn his studies of them centered around finding the male's testicles).However, I really did not want to learn about these people or their thoughts about eels. Nor did I want to learn about the eel in literature. I wanted to learn about eels!Unfortunately, not a whole lot is known about them and so the author fills the book with details of people instead. Did I mention my balloon of excitement had deflated?I found it mildly interesting to learn that the pilgrims who arrived in Massachusetts on the Mayflower survived in large part to their consumption of eels, which a Native American gave to them. And yet the eel is not part of any American symbolization or mythology. Instead, on Thanksgiving people eat turkey... or tofurkey for those like me. At one point the author makes the assertion that ""in order to understand the eel, we have to have an interest in it, and to have an interest in it, we have to continue to hunt, kill, and eat it"".What??? Really?? Maybe it isn't convincing to say I find it interesting without wanting to hunt, kill, and eat it but what about dogs? People in Western countries understand and have an interest in dogs but I don't know anyone who thinks they have to hunt, kill, and eat them in order to do so!Really, Mr. Svensson, that is some messed up stuff.In the last decade, a European team attached electronic transmitters to seven hundred silver eels to study their migration back to the Sargasso Sea. Though only eighty-seven reached their destination, researchers learned that eels ""can swim without stopping for at least six months using nothing but its fat reserves as fuel"". They swim both day and night at an average of up to thirty-one miles a day. Pretty impressive, eh? I couldn't swim even a quarter of a mile, at least not without stopping several times to catch my breath.Sadly, eels, which have swam Earth's waters for at least forty million years, are now considered critically endangered. The author discusses this and the possible reasons for their dwindling numbers, from climate change to a herpes virus specific to eels, first seen in eels in captivity in Japan and  which spread to about half of all eels in the world. One thing is clear: We humans are most likely responsible for the demise of the eel, along with countless other species.  The eel may perish from the earth before we ever really understand it. Such a devastating idea.I wouldn't recommend this book to those solely wanting to learn about eels. I'd say it's a book for people who love fishing. That's not me. 5 stars for the quality of writing. 2 for my enjoyment of it. 1 star deducted for the batshit crazy idea that one has to enjoy killing eels if they're interested in them.2.5 stars but I'll round it up to 3 because, you know, I'm such a nice person."

2,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"I never thought I would read a book about eels. It’s not a creature that has captured my curiosity. The one time I tried to eat one I found it abhorrent and never tried again.I had no idea all European eels are hatched in the Sargasso Sea, that they travel across twice. That no grown eel, alive or dead, has ever been found there. That eels metamorphose several times. Fascinating! Interspersed between the historical eel and biological facts are chapter about the author and his father fishing for eels. It’s an odd coming of age tale.I found this book philosophical and endearing, covering a lot more than I had expected. Definitely recommended if you want something different and lightly educational. "
3,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8443751-marcus,4,"Maybe it’s serendipity that I picked up this book at the same time as I lost my father. Just like this fish he was born in the Caribbean, found his way all the way up to the Scandinavian coast, stayed here for 30 years and then returned triumphantly to his origins before dying. Both the author and I have been preoccupied with understanding and recollecting a father/son relationship and how your father can at once be something deeply familiar and still remain a mystery, just like the eel. "
4,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19133785-brandon-forsyth,4,"I’m fEELing it!I’ve never read H Is For Hawk, but it’s the comparison my mind kept making as I read this. This book manages to be a combination of wonderful nature writing, a scientific history, a memoir about a father and son, and a rumination on origins and endings all at the same time. I learned things and marvelled at life; my creativity was sparked; and I was moved by the simple stories of a father and son fishing together. I’ve been obsessed by how little is known about eels ever since I read Lucy Cooke’s THE TRUTH ABOUT ANIMALS, and this book builds on that interest in a nuanced way. I’m officially an eel-head! An eelthusiast? We’ll workshop this."
5,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,4,"Remarkably little is known about the European eel, Anguilla Anguilla. So little, in fact, that scientists and philosophers have, for centuries, been obsessed with what has become known as the ""eel question"" Where do eels come from? What are they? Are they fish or some other kind of creature altogether? Even today, in an age of advanced science, no one has ever seen eels mating or giving birth, and we still don't understand what drives them, after living for decades in freshwater, to swim great distances back to the ocean at the end of their lives. They remain a mystery.Drawing on a breadth of research about eels in literature, history, and modern marine biology, as well as his own experience fishing for eels with his father, Patrik Svensson crafts a mesmerizing portrait of an unusual, utterly misunderstood, and completely captivating animal. In The Book of Eels, we meet renowned historical thinkers, from Aristotle to Sigmund Freud to Rachel Carson, for whom the eel was a singular obsession. And we meet the scientists who spearheaded the search for the eel's point of origin, including Danish marine biologist Johannes Schmidt, who led research efforts in the early twentieth century, catching thousands upon thousands of eels, in the hopes of proving their birthing grounds in the Sargasso Sea.This is a quirky part memoir, part natural history and part meditation on the human condition, and although you may be asking why you need a whole book dedicated to the elusive eel, well, it is a book that asks what it means to live in an uncertain world full of questions that cannot seemingly be answered and not exclusively about the enigmatic creature. Svensson then draws parallels between the mysteries surrounding the lives of eels and those surrounding human existence with many other fascinating forays into the topic of philosophy throughout the book. Not only does it explore philosophical questions from a unique perspective but it also looks at religion, science, marine biology, psychology and literature which are all wrapped up in the shape of a memoir about the seemingly strained relationship between Svensson and his father. A truly original and absorbing read. Many thanks to Picador for an ARC."

7,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19667916-bjorn,4,"There's something Melvillian to Svensson's hunt for the small yellow eel; through history, mythology, zoology, gastronomy, philosophy, paleontology, oceanology, biology, ecology, literature and his own memories of eel-fishing with his father, he tries to if not uncover, then at least map out the mysteries surrounding the common eel; a fish everyone has always known about, but nobody really understands. Maybe his writing occasionally gets a little too fond of itself, but the sheer totality of the project is so personal and so appealing."
8,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12555370-jason,5,"This was a fascinating book, I never would have believed that such a well known animal would not be very well know at all. The European Eel is a slimy ugly creature that lurks in dark streams and lakes....well that is what I thought before starting this book. In fact right from it's mysterious birth in the Sargasso Sea life is tough for this creature, many predators finding it to be a tasty snack and a very long swim to the shoreline of Europe, things ain't over yet as there is still the journey up rivers and even across land to find that perfect spot to call home until it is time to head back to breed.The eel has moved way up my list of favourite animals for it's way of keeping scientists at bay for so many years, it is mind blowing that nobody has found the breeding ground or even an adult in the vicinity. I also loved that the eel has managed to prove the bible wrong, a bit was added to blatantly stop the poor eating eels by saying that you can only eat creatures with fins and scales....turns out the eels have both, very small fins and scales but they are there, which is brilliant.Svensson's writing is very good, he draws the reader in with a bunch of interesting facts that makes you realise you are reading about something special. His personal history with eel fishing with his Dad is very moving, reading about their bond over fishing being developed and lasting a whole lifetime was a joy to read. I reckon his Dad would have been proud of this book.This was wonderful, well worth reading about this mighty little animal.Blog boy: https://felcherman.wordpress.com/2020..."
9,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"Fair warning: I won a free ARC of this book in a Goodreads giveaway. I think that the only way you're likely to learn MORE about eels is from an actual textbook instead of a popular science text.But this book delivers so much more than just the basic facts. Svensson gives us not only the science, but also a look at the eel in literature, myth, and legend. Chapters about eels alternate with chapters about Svensson’s childhood fishing for eels with his father.The book is fascinating. If you're anything like me, your initial reaction to learning of this book was something like, “Eels? Really?” [raised eyebrow] But it's much more engaging than you think. It reads well, and I even found myself staying up late once or twice because I just couldn't resist reading another chapter. Or two. Or three.Books this good are what keep me reading nonfiction. Highly recommended! "
10,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60839319-keeloca,4,"I love eels, so I wasn't surprised to enjoy the parts detailing what (little) we know about them - but I was mildly astonished to realize that the autobiographical bits worked for me too. At least towards the end, when the eel served as a metaphor for our search for a home and meaning, as well as our need for that which cannot be readily explained. "

12,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115626-nadine-jones,5,"What a lovely book this was!!! I read this for the 2020 Popsugar reading challenge category of “subject you know nothing about,” and it certainly fit the category! Prior to this book, all I knew about eels was that I’d eaten one, grilled, once at a backyard party in Rhode Island, and I was surprised that I liked it. This book focuses on the European eel, Anguilla Anguilla, but it also mentions the American eel, and - very briefly - Asian eels. The first chapter basically runs through a summary of what we know about the eel’s life cycle. The rest of the book is a memoir of the author’s youth, fishing for eels with his father (and a love letter to his father), alternating with chapters about the various scientists who have studied - or attempted to study - the eel. Svensson starts with Aristotle and gradually moves forward in time, touching on naturalists such as Johannes Schmidt, who devoted his life to study of the eel (and was funded by Carlsberg brewery), as well as more famous people, including Freud (who got his start trying - unsuccessfully - to find an eel’s testicles) and Rachel Carson. At times Svensson goes a bit far afield off-topic, but it’s always interesting (well, okay, I did start to lose interest in the Freud section), and the writing is exquisitely beautiful. I would quote some here, but I read an uncorrected proof, and perhaps quoting from those is frowned on.Maybe just a few sentences:
I can’t recall us ever talking about anything other than eels and how to best catch them, down there by the stream. I can’t remember us speaking at all.Maybe because we never did. Because we were in a place where the need for talking was limited, a place whose nature was best enjoyed in silence. The reflected moonlight, the hissing grass, the shadows of the trees, the monotonous rushing of the stream, and the bats like hovering asterisks above it all. You had to be quiet to make yourself part of the whole.It could, of course, also be because I remember everything wrong. 
I received a free copy of this English translation from Goodreads First Reads."
13,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68759627-emma,2,"I don't really know what I expected going into this book, I knew it was going to be about Eel's, but I just didn't find the majority of this book interesting for me, especially the parts about the authors own life. It had moments where it was interesting, but this book just wasn't for me. If you find eels interesting, you will probably love it. "
14,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75306788-shirley,5,"What a beautiful book, it has everything!!I picked up this book because I’ve been fascinated with eels since I listened to the Silky Love episode on RadioLab. Eels are such an enigma, so much we want to know but also want the mysteries to remain unknown. This book is the combination of my three favorite genres: nerdy fact-packed nonfiction, memoir, and literature. History and factoid to satisfy my nerdy curiosity, memoir to connect with the author, and beautiful philosophical reflection of human being’s relationship with the animal world. This is not just about eels... it’s about reflection of the symmetry of our human condition and experience with the eel, and by extension, the natural world. And how we are, quite literally, the only specie that’s causing the 6th mass extinction on our planet and ruining everything 😑That bit about the Brantevik eel and its unfulfilled life journey really got me in the tear duct. Sigh, why can’t we just be respectful and leave nature alone 😢"
15,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36160400-marion,5,"A fascinating, melancholic, important book. The book is a testament of our day and the live mysteries we already have, and are about to extinguish without ever understanding them. Eels have existed many millions of years, - long before humanity arrived here. The last four decades, and the coming years may, however, prove to be the end of their saga. Why? Do read. This book is quickly being translated into many languages wich is fascinating, well deserved and good news. I hope it will find readers everywhere. Beautifully written. Enlightening. Engaging. Speaking to existential questions, this book will linger in my mind and eels (!) will linger in my heart."
16,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196771-nick-jones,5,"Excellent combination of personal history, natural history, and thinking about life and death. Scintillating prose (written in English, I think, by a Swede!) and the perfect length, about the length of an eel and about as lively, too. "
17,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"We know an awful lot about the planets in our solar system and the stars that surround us but if you were to look out to sea we have only explored around 5% of the oceans. There are things down there that we can barely imagine and creatures that we do know of we know so little about.One of those creatures is the eel. It is one of the strangest creatures that has existed and even though they have been studied for hundreds of years, very little is known about it. The few things we do know about them are mere snapshots of their lives, even now it is thought that they spawn in the Sargasso Sea, it is not actually known that they actually do that. Attempting to get them to breed in captivity has met with abject failure every time.Now their numbers are plummeting, there has been a 95% drop in the number of elvers in our streams and rivers and no one knows what to do about it or where to start looking for answers. Yet they have been a part of our culture since time immemorial. Thousands have been caught and cooked and eaten all over Europe in this time too.One of those people who fished for this elusive creature is Patrick Svensson. It was kind of a hobby, but for his father, it was a borderline obsession. He would try the latest methods or new baits and traps in his drive to catch these creatures. But there was more to it than that, it was a welcome respite from his job as a road paver. He could come home from that hot smelly job have a short nap and then carry on for the rest of the day, but he always smelled of tar.It began for his father in childhood, he always liked being down by the stream. It was a short distance from his home and was a slightly overgrown habitat that had its own magic. At the time it was the outer limit of his world and he fished and swam in it, skated over it in the winter, caught mice and listened to the soothing noise of flowing water when helping out on the farm. He was fond of the taste of eel too, loving the greasy gamey flavour, unlike his son. Fishing for eels became a thing that they did together and even though Svensson recalls it being the only thing that they talked of, but also remembers not talking that much at all when fishing.Svensson is not the only one who has had a fascination with this enigmatic creature, it has been written about since Aristotle’s time and he explores what some of these people learnt and wrote about it.It is a wide-ranging looking at some of the natural history, historical, culture and folklore behind eels but at its heart, this is a family memoir about the time Svensson spent fishing for eels with his father. He has a straightforward and matter of fact way of writing and I did like it, but the multi-faceted genres meant it lost a little bit of focus for me."
18,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/514234-stephanie-griffin,4,"This is a fascinating look at what we know of the history of eels and also their present day situation. Chapters go back and forth between what we know about eels and the author’s experiences of catching eels in Sweden as a child with his dad. There are descriptions of different ways they’re caught and eaten.The lives of eels is one of the least known things about the ocean. How does the European or American eel know where to swim on a 5,000 mile journey from their birth place in the Saragossa Sea to a fresh water creek? Living there for decades, how do they know when to make the one return trip to spawn and die? How DO they procreate? (1) No human has ever seen two eels mate.(2) No one has ever seen a mature eel in the Sargasso Sea.Many people have tried to figure out the mysteries of the eels. Even Sigmund Freud tried and failed. Eels won’t breed in captivity which makes it harder to study them.One of the weirdest facts I learned in this book is this:...apparently the eel is capable of suspending its own aging, no matter how long it lives for.Eels can live for 80 or 100 years! The author includes several stories of accidental longevity in eels.One part of the book didn’t seem to fit in for me and that was when the author spent a short time talking about Christianity. I didn’t really see how that has anything to do with eels.Unfortunately, there has been a huge reduction of eels over the past 40 years. The number of returning mature eels is down by 50%. The author asks how can we save them if we don’t know what makes them tick? I like eating eel sushi and I will miss having it, but I have to say, I see them in a whole new light now. These are nearly magical creatures who have all kinds of spooky tricks! Between that and all the parasites that most of them carry nowadays, I may not ever eat one again!The Book of Eels certainly increased my knowledge and for that I recommend it to everyone."
19,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8826745-richard-propes,5,"""The Book of Eels: Our Enduring Fascination with the Most Mysterious Creature in the Natural World"" shouldn't work. It just shouldn't. Be honest. The title makes you laugh. The concept seems downright weird. Truthfully? I can't imagine there will be a book that will surprise me more than did Swedish journalist Patrik Svensson's debut that he himself has called ""strange and nerdy."" ""The Book of Eels"" is, indeed, strange and nerdy. It's also sublime. It's also lyrical. It's also mesmerizing. ""The Book of Eels"" is hypnotic and immersive, informative and engaging. It's one of 2020's most pleasant surprises, an almost unimaginable weaving together of natural history meets memoir. ""The Book of Eels"" is about eels, that's definitely true, but it's also about life and love and how our existence defines us and how our existence can never define us. It has faith in science, yet offers glimpses of being tempted like a mysterious lover by the mystique of faith and the soothing security many find in trusting the unknowing. Already winner of Sweden's top literary prize, the August Prize, ""The Book of Eels"" entered my life almost as a dare. A friend who fears eels became aware of the book and expressed a temptation to read it. My curiosity got the best of me and on the eve of its U.S. release by Ecco, a HarperCollins Publishers imprint, I almost timidly requested the opportunity to review it. Within hours, my request was granted. ""What have I gotten myself into?,"" I asked myself. ""Why am I reviewing a book about eels?"" ""Am I insane?""""No. No, I'm not insane. I'm strange. I'm strange and nerdy,"" I chuckled to myself. I started reading, Svensson's poetic lyricism quickly immersing in alternating chapters serving up natural history and Svensson's own childhood memories of nighttime eel fishing with his father under a thin moonlight and amidst the shallow waters not far from their nearby home. Svensson wrote ""The Book of Eels,"" or gave himself permission to write ""The Book of Eels,"" after his father's death by cancer. It was a death that added mystery to a man who'd always been a bit of a mystery, a mystery not far removed from that of Anguilla anguilla, the European Eel. They are notoriously elusive creatures that have refused to reveal their secrets over the years. It is believed that they are all, quite literally all, born in the sea without borders, Sargasso Sea. They will eventually return - to mate and to die, though to date years upon years of research has been unable to determine why. They simply do. They all do. Svensson could never quite figure out why his father so completely loved eel fishing. As near as Svensson could tell, he never learned it from his father or the man he would come to know as father. He simply did and he surrendered himself to it. Aristotle researched the eel, developing both well-founded and remarkably outrageous theories. A younger Sigmund Freud spent an entire postgraduate research project searching for, quite seriously, the eel's testes. He failed to find them. Yet, they reproduce. Danish marine biologist Johannes Schmidt spent 20 years exploring the eels' connection to the Sargasso Sea, while Rachel Carson spent her entire professional life obsessed with the eel. The eel's truths have remained elusive; it's secrets remain well hidden. As I began reading ""The Book of Eels,"" it became a mesmerizing story I dared not put down. It's not that so much happens. It doesn't. It's that I became enchanted by Svensson's worlds, both that of the eels and that of a father and a life whose secrets remain ever elusive. Svensson, who describes himself as not believing in God, is clearly intrigued by the metaphysical world that he brings so vividly to life here. He believes in science, yet he cannot deny that science has been unable to answer the mystery of the eel. Likewise, despite all that he knows about his life and his father there remains ancestral secrets and unanswered questions that will likely never be answered. Svensson rather magnificently brings science to life here, yet he does so embracing the cosmic hilarity of eels that can even seemingly transcend their own realities at times. At times, you can practically hear Svensson's chuckling amidst his words. The long history of eel fishing is waning, the number of eels inexplicably waning and their numbers now protected as they are identified as endangered. He embraces this, never having loved eel fishing quite as much as his father did yet writing about it with such warmth and reverence that you simply know it somehow altered his DNA. There is little denying that ""The Book of Eels"" will not resonate with everyone, perhaps its cinematic equivalent being a European-tinged Malick effort that patiently, intimately reflects upon life, faith, science, death, and what this all actually means. While not all will engage with its unique, almost fairytale like rhythm, for those who surrender ""The Book of Eels"" has much to offer and will prove to be one of 2020's most unique, engaging, and inspired literary experiences. ""The Book of Eels: Our Enduring Fascination with the Most Mysterious Creature in the Natural World"" was released on May 26th by Ecco. "

21,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10159773-lexi,2,"This book could not make up its mind what it was. The first part was science book plus memoir about the authors father and eel fishing. The second part had less science and a whole lot more musing on philosophy and religion. This could have worked but mostly ended up a mess. I went in expecting more science of eels and got a meandering history of eels in popular imagination and literature and memories of fishing with my dad more than science. It also took me 3 months to read this, which is never a good sign.Finally, and this is my soap box, this would be a three star book had it used footnotes. It had a list of main sources by chapter but not enough for all the eel facts cited and if they were all, then a few chapters relied on a very few number of sources and readers should know that. Second, especially, when discussing research that people have spent most of their lives on this work, it needs to be cited. This is the second time I have written this in a review today, but it is unethical to do otherwise. I will continue to hold this belief on all popular science books that without footnotes, there is no ability to judge the quality of the sources and it fails to give credit to the hard work that went into the research that is being used for the book. "
22,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26584756-isabelle-bradbury,3,"This book was not what I expected it to be, and I’m having trouble deciding whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing. On one hand, I enjoyed learning about Aristotle’s theories about the origins of eels, Freud’s quest for eel testicles (no one should be surprised by this), and its influence on modern psychoanalysis. On the other hand, half of the chapters were flashbacks of the author fishing as a child, which seemed unnecessary and boring from my perspective. It was fascinating to learn what we did about eels, but a large focus of this book was on the people studying them, rather than the eels themselves. That being said- I do know a lot more about eels than I did before I picked this book up. "
23,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2495113-dylan-clark-moore,3,"An interesting way of drawing as much philosophy , metaphor, and personal reflection as possible out of a single species. "
24,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77536251-modern-major-general,4,"Firstly, I wouldn't really label this as a ""hard science"" book. There is some interesting scientific information and it is presented very well, but if you are looking for a detailed morphology, evolutionary history, deep dive into its habits and lifestyle, this isn't really the book for you. Hell, I didn't even know there were Asian Eels until near the very end of the book, after the author had gone on at length about European Eels, and somewhat about American Eels.However, if you are interested in the lives of those who have researched eels (Sigmund Freud? Really!? Wow!), or if you are interested in learning a lot about the author of this book and how he came to be interested in the subject, or if you are interested in how Eels have influenced Humanity throughout our history, then this this book is definitely right up your alley!For myself, I found this book quite enlightening. I was not aware that the mystery of the Eel was something plaguing Humanity, let alone plaguing us for thousands of years. It's quite amazing that many contemporary scientists, and the author himself, have been pondering many of the same questions that the most famous of ancient philosophers and sages have also pondered.I'm equally amazed by the lengths life is willing to go to not just to simply exist, but also to propagate itself into perpetuity. Much the opposite of Salmon, the Eel lives in freshwater and returns to the ocean to spawn. And, as near as we've been able to discover, both the American Eel and the European Eel seem to return to the region around the Sargasso Sea to spawn, whilst Asian Eels return to a region near the Marianas Trench. However, as is stated in the book, in some of its reviews, and confirmed by my own amateur research, spawning in the wild has never been witnessed. Also, unlike Salmon, as far as we can tell, the next generation of Eels do not return to the same place their parents set out from. Eels seem to be far more capricious, ending up wherever the currents take them...with the exception that American Eels always return to America and European Eels to Europe.I would most definitely recommend this book, as I believe it's science is easily within the reach of the average reader and the author's anecdotes make him easy to relate to by most."

The book goes into quite a bit of detail about what we know and some of what we don't know. However, the real interesting aspect of this book is the fact that the author writes every other chapter about either the history of eels or his personal relationship with his father and eel fishing. "
26,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866236-patrik-hallberg,4,"An almost perfect little book, you might think how can a book about eels be interesting? If somebody would have said to me that I would read a book about eels I would probably have laughed, but it's in the unknown and the unexpected that often the biggest joy in life lies. And the eel is truly still in many ways an unknown creature and this is now hurting its existence. Because the eel is dying and this paradox has become its enemy. Its mysterious ways and unknown nature is making it very hard for us to help it. We don't know why it's dying, but we know that it's probably due to us. It's very hard to get an eel to reproduce in captivity, in fact, it has never been done for the European eel only with the Japanese. This fact, of course, makes it harder for us to increase the ever-fading habitat of eels. I have learned so much about the eel that I had no idea about before. It's truly a very special character, with its metamorphoses, how it only grows reproduction organs when it needs it, that it can almost live forever, that it somehow finds its way back to the Sargasso ocean (where we think it reproduces), but never have seen it, only its offspring. It's also a book about the author and his father and how they used to fish eel and that that was when they felt a bound between them, later they grew apart and when his father dies, he returns to their summer house and the lake where they never caught an eel, but knew it must be there and as by magic he gets an eel, but it gets stuck and he has to cut the line just like his father did when he was younger. The eel comes to meet him and he sees him before he returns to the unknown, just like his father return to the eternity when he died."

That's why I thought that maybe I am not ready for this, but I was. Seemed very effortless, yet very tight and informational. Something between non-fiction and autobiography. The eel was a wonderful element. A MacGuffin and a main character at the same time. Combining the story of the eel and the story of the father was something very clever and beautiful. It was a deep, yet not cryptic, symbol. An eternal mystery, intriguing, still very clear and simple. The essence of life maybe.Also: I had a phrase from Lil Wayne's A Milli playing in my head while reading this: ""motherf**er I'm eeeeeel!"""

30,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,4,"I think the literature on personal experiences with animals is greatly underrated as a source of entertainment, insight, and wonder. It chronicles the efforts of people to work with an learn from the fauna around them without trying to impose will and with a respect for the dignity of the natural. The clear comparison for this book is “H is for Hawk” and it is appropriate although with some differences, especially that I do not see how one could ever form a partnership or a working relationship with a predator such as happens with the hawk. Eels are a bit different. Apart from that, a memoir of life encounters focusing on the Eel makes good sense.This is a personal memoir of the author’s experiences of growing up and learning about the Eel, both generally and through fishing for them with his father. In the process, of course, the author comes to reflect upon himself and his father and this animates this very intriguing book. Regarding the particularities of the Eel, it life cycle, reproduction, migrations, and the like, who knew? This is a highly unusual animal and I had no idea of the mysteries that have surrounded it. “Strange” only begins to cover the details. I won’t say anything else ... Then there is the fishing. I have consumed Eels, I will admit, but not frequently and I had never thought much about them. I had also been unaware of the role of Eels in history and literature.The attraction of the book comes from how experiences with Eels help motivate broader ideas of personal growth and knowledge and especially of Mr. Svensson coming to know his father. It highlights to me that a part of identity is not just what we have in common with others but also what we have in our experiences that is different and unusual, as long as we share it with somebody.I will not look at Eels the same way again, and I greatly enjoyed the book."
31,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870323-monica,4,"Eels are amazingly private creatures. People have tried to figure them out for millennia. Are they fish or snakes? How do they reproduce? Egg layers or viviparous? What and where are their sex organs? Aristotle studied them and had no answers. Freud dissected thousands of them about two thousand years later and got no answers either. They go through a series of total transformations over the course of their long lives, from translucent floating things that look like willow leaves, to glass tiny eels to much larger, more solid creatures. Some of the things we do not learn about eels in this wonderful little book: How and where they reproduce, what triggers their 3,000 mile migration from the Sargasso Sea to the rivers of Northern Europe, from salt to fresh water, how do they navigate the trip and the return journey? What triggers their return after 5 to 50 years, to the Sargasso Sea to breed and die? It was not till 2015 that anyone had ever seen an adult eel in the Sargasso Sea, and there is still much that is not known about them. And now their numbers are declining at an alarming rate due to climate change and other threats to habitat.The wonderful little book is at once a natural history, a scientific history, a memoir – of Svensson’s night fishing trips with his father - and an elegy for a disappearing creature and a way of life."

The author weaves so many fascinating facts about eels, all within the context of his family, his own culture, and by the end of the book you will know so much about the elusive creature that has been part of our civilization from ancient times. You will also be touched by the author's beautiful meditations about life and even religion. You will learn why the eel is so elusive and has fascinated scientists from the earliest times. For one thing, no one, even in current times has ever seen this eel mate. They do not reproduce in captivity. In fact, until the 1900's no one even knew where these eels originated from. People knew they arrived from the sea to enter fresh water streams and rivers of Europe, but no one knew where they originated from, until a Danish scientist took to the sea to study them. It took him 20 years to determine their origin - the Sargasso Sea. But even with that discovery, no one has ever figured out exactly where they mate. I highly recommend this unusual book about a topic you might not think you care about until you pick it up. You won't be disappointed."

After all, the review said it was a little bit H for Hawk...which I had read and it was OK...and a little bit Soul of an Octopus...which I had read and loved...what could go wrong. Nothing as it turns out. This was an interesting review of a creature that I know little about other than the fact that it looks like a snake and I hope never to meet one in the wild. Eels are basically shy creatures and those that attempt to seek them out to study their nature and habits are hard pressed to discover anything. I loved the family connection that Mr. Svensson and his father had during their eel fishing expeditions and the various ways that they attempted to catch the eels and the additional more fact based parts of the book that talk about climate change and the possible extinction of the eels (along with many other species) was both fascinating and scary.

Originally published in Sweden, it reached way back into eels' primordial evolution, then its place in Greek philosophy, 18th, 19th, 20th century eco science paired with Svensson’s simple stories of fishing with their father, as well as fishermen who work or fish recreationally off the coast of Sweden.

It is meandering with occasional flashes of intrigue but far more often filled with anecdotes that are, at best, loosely related to the subject. If you want to learn about eels (they are CRAZY), read the first chapter (it’s free) and then head to Google. If you want to read about everybody who has ever studied the eel or hear Svensson’s stories about fishing for eels with his father, buy this book. "
38,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,5,"I truly enjoyed this book about eels. A wonderful first book for this author. It is a story of two tales: the eels themselves and the remembrance of fishing for eels with his father. I thought it was brilliant how the author used that personal experience to relate to the mysteriousness of the eel. Astute parallels and symbolic meaning help to create a deeper meaning to the book than just an academic look at eels. If you don't know a lot about eels, don't worry! Neither do scientists and naturalists around the world. That is what makes the eel mysterious and noble, much like the relationship the author had with his father. Sadly, we may never know the true nature of the eel as we continue to see the environmental world collapse around us and the eel with it."

The book is a sinuous weave of biography, history and natural history. Svensson recounts the many people who over centuries have tried to address ""Question of the Eel"" interspersed with his childhood memories eel-fishing with his Father. If I'm honest I had no idea the European eel had inspired such efforts - from Sigmund Freud spending his early years in Trieste and failing to find how eels reproduce, to Johannes Schmidt who sailed around the Atlantic for years early in the 20th Century, slowly gathering data that identified the Sargasso Sea as the eel's only breeding ground, this book covers the evolution of our scientific understanding of the eel - such as it is. No human has ever seen an eel breeding. But it's the snapshots of his life in Sweden, and particularly his evolving relationship with his Father, that are the real joy of this book."

He never found any.And so it continues. The eel is indeed a mysterious creature, and has fascinated people through the centuries. Still, the marine biologists don’t know all its secrets.The book of eels alternate between hard eel-facts and very personal memories from the author’s own youth, when he was catching eels with his father.Surprisingly enough, the book also brought back some eel-related memories from my childhood that I’d totally forgotten: How I and my buddies on some rare occation managed to catch a small eel with a bucket. The even rarer occations (eel was very expensive) when my family ate smoked eel with scrambled eggs on rye bread. Fifty years later, I can still remember the weird fatty taste.This is a remarkable book about a remarkable fish. Interesting, educational, and also a little bitter-sweet story about the relation between a son and his father."

I am not Maori or of Maori descent, I am an immigrant in this beautiful land. Whilst driving almost anywhere in NZ when one comes across new roads with cuttings and embankments, any concrete is often adorned with relief work of eels.A while back I lived in a remote/weird settlement in an area surrounded by lakes, rivers and what are referred to as drainage ditches. In every lake or waterway in NZ there are eels. That particular place was an eel migration point from the local lake. The eels would gather round the seaward side of the lake until we had a huge southerly storm when the shingle bank would be wet, then the eels would slither out of the lake and over the shingle into the sea then off to who knew where to breed and die.For a while I used to catch a few eels for food. I did that until I found out that the eels were anywhere from upwards of 45 years old. At that point I stopped because I felt that having lived so long who was I to take their life when I could easily get food anywhere, this was not a life or death struggle. I have seen eels here that were between 80 and 100 years old. People I have met who climb mountais tell me that wherever you find running water, no matter how high up there will be eels there.In the Northern Hemisphere, the fantasy is that the eels migrate to the Sargasso Sea to breed and die. Even though the Sargasso Sea has no borders apart from 4 ocean currents and is a ""sea within a sea"", a gyre if you will, and not one single human being has ever seen a single eel in the Sargasso Sea. The simple truth is that we know nothing of these creatures. I have seen that most people have a visceral reaction to them if seen up close. I also know that eel blood is a neurotoxin to humans. They seem to occupy a place nearer to our subconscious than our conscious selves.Personally, they remind me that we are just trouble and if the virus were to kill every single one of us the eels would just carry on as before, they would shed no tears over us and sometimes I wonder if they even know we are here.I loved this book because it takes us to their territory, which is really a very undefined place, and not them to us.Throughout human history they have been an enigma, it's as if on a ""need to know"" basis we are not on the list of those that need to know."

Structured in alternating parts of natural history of eel, history of the science of eels, and memories of the author's relationship with eel fishing and his father, The Book of Eels was an unexpected summer read favorite of mine. Its beautiful prose captivated my attention and focused it on an animal that I'd barely considered before. It's definitely not for everyone; I've been boring my partner and friends with unsolicited eel facts (Hint: Sigmund Freud makes an appearance!). However, this book is much more than ""fun facts."" Quiet and contemplative, this highly personal story of the mysteries of eels also grapples with the enduring mysteries of life.

It is a personal visit into his childhood sewn together with the grander scheme of how scientists throughout the ages have tried to figure the eel out. Just like I sometimes can wish myself into the world of the fiction novels I mostly read, this one made me wish I had more eel in my life. Just to eat eel may soon actually be fiction, but then again - eating it will not help it survive longer.

Astute parallels and symbolic meaning help to create a deeper meaning to the book than just an academic look at eels. If you don't know a lot about eels, don't worry! Neither do scientists and naturalists around the world. That is what makes the eel mysterious and noble, much like the relationship the author had with his father.

Whilst driving almost anywhere in NZ when one comes across new roads with cuttings and embankments, any concrete is often adorned with relief work of eels.A while back I lived in a remote/weird settlement in an area surrounded by lakes, rivers and what are referred to as drainage ditches. In every lake or waterway in NZ there are eels. That particular place was an eel migration point from the local lake. The eels would gather round the seaward side of the lake until we had a huge southerly storm when the shingle bank would be wet, then the eels would slither out of the lake and over the shingle into the sea then off to who knew where to breed and die.For a while I used to catch a few eels for food. I did that until I found out that the eels were anywhere from upwards of 45 years old. At that point I stopped because I felt that having lived so long who was I to take their life when I could easily get food anywhere, this was not a life or death struggle. I have seen eels here that were between 80 and 100 years old.

Structured in alternating parts of natural history of eel, history of the science of eels, and memories of the author's relationship with eel fishing and his father, The Book of Eels was an unexpected summer read favorite of mine. Its beautiful prose captivated my attention and focused it on an animal that I'd barely considered before. It's definitely not for everyone; I've been boring my partner and friends with unsolicited eel facts (Hint: Sigmund Freud makes an appearance!). However, this book is much more than ""fun facts."" Quiet and contemplative, this highly personal story of the mysteries of eels also grapples with the enduring mysteries of life.

When asked what I wanted for Christmas that year, I realized I wanted to read that book about eels...The eel is a mystery and it's no secret - it is in fact the selling attractions of the book and something you can read in the fist few pages.The author share his story where he with his father caught eels down by the creek. It is a personal visit into his childhood sewn together with the grander scheme of how scientists throughout the ages have tried to figure the eel out. Just like I sometimes can wish myself into the world of the fiction novels I mostly read, this one made me wish I had more eel in my life. Just to eat eel may soon actually be fiction, but then again - eating it will not help it survive longer. If I get the opportunity though, it will be consumed with a new perspective of this inscrutable creature. I'm very happy I read it."

90,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,4,"I think the literature on personal experiences with animals is greatly underrated as a source of entertainment, insight, and wonder. It chronicles the efforts of people to work with an learn from the fauna around them without trying to impose will and with a respect for the dignity of the natural. The clear comparison for this book is “H is for Hawk” and it is appropriate although with some differences, especially that I do not see how one could ever form a partnership or a working relationship with a predator such as happens with the hawk. Eels are a bit different. Apart from that, a memoir of life encounters focusing on the Eel makes good sense.This is a personal memoir of the author’s experiences of growing up and learning about the Eel, both generally and through fishing for them with his father. In the process, of course, the author comes to reflect upon himself and his father and this animates this very intriguing book. Regarding the particularities of the Eel, it life cycle, reproduction, migrations, and the like, who knew? This is a highly unusual animal and I had no idea of the mysteries that have surrounded it. “Strange” only begins to cover the details. I won’t say anything else ... Then there is the fishing. I have consumed Eels, I will admit, but not frequently and I had never thought much about them. I had also been unaware of the role of Eels in history and literature.The attraction of the book comes from how experiences with Eels help motivate broader ideas of personal growth and knowledge and especially of Mr. Svensson coming to know his father. It highlights to me that a part of identity is not just what we have in common with others but also what we have in our experiences that is different and unusual, as long as we share it with somebody.I will not look at Eels the same way again, and I greatly enjoyed the book."
91,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870323-monica,4,"Eels are amazingly private creatures. People have tried to figure them out for millennia. Are they fish or snakes? How do they reproduce? Egg layers or viviparous? What and where are their sex organs? Aristotle studied them and had no answers. Freud dissected thousands of them about two thousand years later and got no answers either. They go through a series of total transformations over the course of their long lives, from translucent floating things that look like willow leaves, to glass tiny eels to much larger, more solid creatures. Some of the things we do not learn about eels in this wonderful little book: How and where they reproduce, what triggers their 3,000 mile migration from the Sargasso Sea to the rivers of Northern Europe, from salt to fresh water, how do they navigate the trip and the return journey? What triggers their return after 5 to 50 years, to the Sargasso Sea to breed and die? It was not till 2015 that anyone had ever seen an adult eel in the Sargasso Sea, and there is still much that is not known about them. And now their numbers are declining at an alarming rate due to climate change and other threats to habitat.The wonderful little book is at once a natural history, a scientific history, a memoir – of Svensson’s night fishing trips with his father - and an elegy for a disappearing creature and a way of life."
92,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55548864-pam-coon,5,"You might find yourself questioning why you would want to read a nonfiction book about eels, but this is such a good read and is so well written that you will want to read it through to the last page.This is the story of the European eel, told by the author, from Sweden, who spent his childhood hunting eels with his father along the reed filled banks of the local stream that bordered his farm. The author weaves so many fascinating facts about eels, all within the context of his family, his own culture, and by the end of the book you will know so much about the elusive creature that has been part of our civilization from ancient times. You will also be touched by the author's beautiful meditations about life and even religion. You will learn why the eel is so elusive and has fascinated scientists from the earliest times. For one thing, no one, even in current times has ever seen this eel mate. They do not reproduce in captivity. In fact, until the 1900's no one even knew where these eels originated from. People knew they arrived from the sea to enter fresh water streams and rivers of Europe, but no one knew where they originated from, until a Danish scientist took to the sea to study them. It took him 20 years to determine their origin - the Sargasso Sea. But even with that discovery, no one has ever figured out exactly where they mate. I highly recommend this unusual book about a topic you might not think you care about until you pick it up. You won't be disappointed."

After all, the review said it was a little bit H for Hawk...which I had read and it was OK...and a little bit Soul of an Octopus...which I had read and loved...what could go wrong. Nothing as it turns out. This was an interesting review of a creature that I know little about other than the fact that it looks like a snake and I hope never to meet one in the wild. Eels are basically shy creatures and those that attempt to seek them out to study their nature and habits are hard pressed to discover anything. I loved the family connection that Mr. Svensson and his father had during their eel fishing expeditions and the various ways that they attempted to catch the eels and the additional more fact based parts of the book that talk about climate change and the possible extinction of the eels (along with many other species) was both fascinating and scary.

Originally published in Sweden, it reached way back into eels' primordial evolution, then its place in Greek philosophy, 18th, 19th, 20th century eco science paired with Svensson’s simple stories of fishing with their father, as well as fishermen who work or fish recreationally off the coast of Sweden.

The author weaves so many fascinating facts about eels, all within the context of his family, his own culture, and by the end of the book you will know so much about the elusive creature that has been part of our civilization from ancient times.

People knew they arrived from the sea to enter fresh water streams and rivers of Europe, but no one knew where they originated from, until a Danish scientist took to the sea to study them. It took him 20 years to determine their origin - the Sargasso Sea. But even with that discovery, no one has ever figured out exactly where they mate.

It is a story of two tales: the eels themselves and the remembrance of fishing for eels with his father. I thought it was brilliant how the author used that personal experience to relate to the mysteriousness of the eel. Astute parallels and symbolic meaning help to create a deeper meaning to the book than just an academic look at eels. If you don't know a lot about eels, don't worry! Neither do scientists and naturalists around the world. That is what makes the eel mysterious and noble, much like the relationship the author had with his father. Sadly, we may never know the true nature of the eel as we continue to see the environmental world collapse around us and the eel with it."

The book is a sinuous weave of biography, history and natural history. Svensson recounts the many people who over centuries have tried to address ""Question of the Eel"" interspersed with his childhood memories eel-fishing with his Father. If I'm honest I had no idea the European eel had inspired such efforts - from Sigmund Freud spending his early years in Trieste and failing to find how eels reproduce, to Johannes Schmidt who sailed around the Atlantic for years early in the 20th Century, slowly gathering data that identified the Sargasso Sea as the eel's only breeding ground, this book covers the evolution of our scientific understanding of the eel - such as it is. No human has ever seen an eel breeding. But it's the snapshots of his life in Sweden, and particularly his evolving relationship with his Father, that are the real joy of this book."

He never found any.And so it continues. The eel is indeed a mysterious creature, and has fascinated people through the centuries. Still, the marine biologists don’t know all its secrets.The book of eels alternate between hard eel-facts and very personal memories from the author’s own youth, when he was catching eels with his father.Surprisingly enough, the book also brought back some eel-related memories from my childhood that I’d totally forgotten: How I and my buddies on some rare occation managed to catch a small eel with a bucket. The even rarer occations (eel was very expensive) when my family ate smoked eel with scrambled eggs on rye bread. Fifty years later, I can still remember the weird fatty taste.This is a remarkable book about a remarkable fish. Interesting, educational, and also a little bitter-sweet story about the relation between a son and his father."
143,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43521213-dead-john-williams,5,"I live in New Zealand where eels hold a special place in Maori culture. I am not Maori or of Maori descent, I am an immigrant in this beautiful land. Whilst driving almost anywhere in NZ when one comes across new roads with cuttings and embankments, any concrete is often adorned with relief work of eels.A while back I lived in a remote/weird settlement in an area surrounded by lakes, rivers and what are referred to as drainage ditches. In every lake or waterway in NZ there are eels. That particular place was an eel migration point from the local lake. The eels would gather round the seaward side of the lake until we had a huge southerly storm when the shingle bank would be wet, then the eels would slither out of the lake and over the shingle into the sea then off to who knew where to breed and die.For a while I used to catch a few eels for food. I did that until I found out that the eels were anywhere from upwards of 45 years old. At that point I stopped because I felt that having lived so long who was I to take their life when I could easily get food anywhere, this was not a life or death struggle. I have seen eels here that were between 80 and 100 years old. People I have met who climb mountais tell me that wherever you find running water, no matter how high up there will be eels there.In the Northern Hemisphere, the fantasy is that the eels migrate to the Sargasso Sea to breed and die. Even though the Sargasso Sea has no borders apart from 4 ocean currents and is a ""sea within a sea"", a gyre if you will, and not one single human being has ever seen a single eel in the Sargasso Sea. The simple truth is that we know nothing of these creatures. I have seen that most people have a visceral reaction to them if seen up close. I also know that eel blood is a neurotoxin to humans. They seem to occupy a place nearer to our subconscious than our conscious selves.Personally, they remind me that we are just trouble and if the virus were to kill every single one of us the eels would just carry on as before, they would shed no tears over us and sometimes I wonder if they even know we are here.I loved this book because it takes us to their territory, which is really a very undefined place, and not them to us.Throughout human history they have been an enigma, it's as if on a ""need to know"" basis we are not on the list of those that need to know."

When asked what I wanted for Christmas that year, I realized I wanted to read that book about eels...The eel is a mystery and it's no secret - it is in fact the selling attractions of the book and something you can read in the fist few pages.The author share his story where he with his father caught eels down by the creek. It is a personal visit into his childhood sewn together with the grander scheme of how scientists throughout the ages have tried to figure the eel out. Just like I sometimes can wish myself into the world of the fiction novels I mostly read, this one made me wish I had more eel in my life. Just to eat eel may soon actually be fiction, but then again - eating it will not help it survive longer. If I get the opportunity though, it will be consumed with a new perspective of this inscrutable creature. I'm very happy I read it."

180,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,4,"I think the literature on personal experiences with animals is greatly underrated as a source of entertainment, insight, and wonder. It chronicles the efforts of people to work with an learn from the fauna around them without trying to impose will and with a respect for the dignity of the natural. The clear comparison for this book is “H is for Hawk” and it is appropriate although with some differences, especially that I do not see how one could ever form a partnership or a working relationship with a predator such as happens with the hawk. Eels are a bit different. Apart from that, a memoir of life encounters focusing on the Eel makes good sense.This is a personal memoir of the author’s experiences of growing up and learning about the Eel, both generally and through fishing for them with his father. In the process, of course, the author comes to reflect upon himself and his father and this animates this very intriguing book. Regarding the particularities of the Eel, it life cycle, reproduction, migrations, and the like, who knew? This is a highly unusual animal and I had no idea of the mysteries that have surrounded it. “Strange” only begins to cover the details. I won’t say anything else ... Then there is the fishing. I have consumed Eels, I will admit, but not frequently and I had never thought much about them. I had also been unaware of the role of Eels in history and literature.The attraction of the book comes from how experiences with Eels help motivate broader ideas of personal growth and knowledge and especially of Mr. Svensson coming to know his father. It highlights to me that a part of identity is not just what we have in common with others but also what we have in our experiences that is different and unusual, as long as we share it with somebody.I will not look at Eels the same way again, and I greatly enjoyed the book."
181,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870323-monica,4,"Eels are amazingly private creatures. People have tried to figure them out for millennia. Are they fish or snakes? How do they reproduce? Egg layers or viviparous? What and where are their sex organs? Aristotle studied them and had no answers. Freud dissected thousands of them about two thousand years later and got no answers either. They go through a series of total transformations over the course of their long lives, from translucent floating things that look like willow leaves, to glass tiny eels to much larger, more solid creatures. Some of the things we do not learn about eels in this wonderful little book: How and where they reproduce, what triggers their 3,000 mile migration from the Sargasso Sea to the rivers of Northern Europe, from salt to fresh water, how do they navigate the trip and the return journey? What triggers their return after 5 to 50 years, to the Sargasso Sea to breed and die? It was not till 2015 that anyone had ever seen an adult eel in the Sargasso Sea, and there is still much that is not known about them. And now their numbers are declining at an alarming rate due to climate change and other threats to habitat.The wonderful little book is at once a natural history, a scientific history, a memoir – of Svensson’s night fishing trips with his father - and an elegy for a disappearing creature and a way of life."
182,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55548864-pam-coon,5,"You might find yourself questioning why you would want to read a nonfiction book about eels, but this is such a good read and is so well written that you will want to read it through to the last page.This is the story of the European eel, told by the author, from Sweden, who spent his childhood hunting eels with his father along the reed filled banks of the local stream that bordered his farm. The author weaves so many fascinating facts about eels, all within the context of his family, his own culture, and by the end of the book you will know so much about the elusive creature that has been part of our civilization from ancient times. You will also be touched by the author's beautiful meditations about life and even religion. You will learn why the eel is so elusive and has fascinated scientists from the earliest times. For one thing, no one, even in current times has ever seen this eel mate. They do not reproduce in captivity. In fact, until the 1900's no one even knew where these eels originated from. People knew they arrived from the sea to enter fresh water streams and rivers of Europe, but no one knew where they originated from, until a Danish scientist took to the sea to study them. It took him 20 years to determine their origin - the Sargasso Sea. But even with that discovery, no one has ever figured out exactly where they mate. I highly recommend this unusual book about a topic you might not think you care about until you pick it up. You won't be disappointed."

After all, the review said it was a little bit H for Hawk...which I had read and it was OK...and a little bit Soul of an Octopus...which I had read and loved...what could go wrong. Nothing as it turns out. This was an interesting review of a creature that I know little about other than the fact that it looks like a snake and I hope never to meet one in the wild. Eels are basically shy creatures and those that attempt to seek them out to study their nature and habits are hard pressed to discover anything. I loved the family connection that Mr. Svensson and his father had during their eel fishing expeditions and the various ways that they attempted to catch the eels and the additional more fact based parts of the book that talk about climate change and the possible extinction of the eels (along with many other species) was both fascinating and scary.

Originally published in Sweden, it reached way back into eels' primordial evolution, then its place in Greek philosophy, 18th, 19th, 20th century eco science paired with Svensson’s simple stories of fishing with their father, as well as fishermen who work or fish recreationally off the coast of Sweden. It also goes into cultural interpretation, anthropomorphic theory, and the threat of water pollution, overfishing, and global warming."

It is a personal visit into his childhood sewn together with the grander scheme of how scientists throughout the ages have tried to figure the eel out. Just like I sometimes can wish myself into the world of the fiction novels I mostly read, this one made me wish I had more eel in my life.

The author weaves so many fascinating facts about eels, all within the context of his family, his own culture, and by the end of the book you will know so much about the elusive creature that has been part of our civilization from ancient times. You will also be touched by the author's beautiful meditations about life and even religion. You will learn why the eel is so elusive and has fascinated scientists from the earliest times. For one thing, no one, even in current times has ever seen this eel mate. They do not reproduce in captivity. In fact, until the 1900's no one even knew where these eels originated from. People knew they arrived from the sea to enter fresh water streams and rivers of Europe, but no one knew where they originated from, until a Danish scientist took to the sea to study them. It took him 20 years to determine their origin - the Sargasso Sea. But even with that discovery, no one has ever figured out exactly where they mate. I highly recommend this unusual book about a topic you might not think you care about until you pick it up. You won't be disappointed."

Nothing as it turns out. This was an interesting review of a creature that I know little about other than the fact that it looks like a snake and I hope never to meet one in the wild.

The book is a sinuous weave of biography, history and natural history. Svensson recounts the many people who over centuries have tried to address ""Question of the Eel"" interspersed with his childhood memories eel-fishing with his Father. If I'm honest I had no idea the European eel had inspired such efforts - from Sigmund Freud spending his early years in Trieste and failing to find how eels reproduce, to Johannes Schmidt who sailed around the Atlantic for years early in the 20th Century, slowly gathering data that identified the Sargasso Sea as the eel's only breeding ground, this book covers the evolution of our scientific understanding of the eel - such as it is. No human has ever seen an eel breeding. But it's the snapshots of his life in Sweden, and particularly his evolving relationship with his Father, that are the real joy of this book."

He never found any.And so it continues. The eel is indeed a mysterious creature, and has fascinated people through the centuries. Still, the marine biologists don’t know all its secrets.The book of eels alternate between hard eel-facts and very personal memories from the author’s own youth, when he was catching eels with his father.Surprisingly enough, the book also brought back some eel-related memories from my childhood that I’d totally forgotten: How I and my buddies on some rare occation managed to catch a small eel with a bucket. The even rarer occations (eel was very expensive) when my family ate smoked eel with scrambled eggs on rye bread. Fifty years later, I can still remember the weird fatty taste.This is a remarkable book about a remarkable fish. Interesting, educational, and also a little bitter-sweet story about the relation between a son and his father."
233,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43521213-dead-john-williams,5,"I live in New Zealand where eels hold a special place in Maori culture. I am not Maori or of Maori descent, I am an immigrant in this beautiful land. Whilst driving almost anywhere in NZ when one comes across new roads with cuttings and embankments, any concrete is often adorned with relief work of eels.A while back I lived in a remote/weird settlement in an area surrounded by lakes, rivers and what are referred to as drainage ditches. In every lake or waterway in NZ there are eels. That particular place was an eel migration point from the local lake. The eels would gather round the seaward side of the lake until we had a huge southerly storm when the shingle bank would be wet, then the eels would slither out of the lake and over the shingle into the sea then off to who knew where to breed and die.For a while I used to catch a few eels for food. I did that until I found out that the eels were anywhere from upwards of 45 years old. At that point I stopped because I felt that having lived so long who was I to take their life when I could easily get food anywhere, this was not a life or death struggle. I have seen eels here that were between 80 and 100 years old. People I have met who climb mountais tell me that wherever you find running water, no matter how high up there will be eels there.In the Northern Hemisphere, the fantasy is that the eels migrate to the Sargasso Sea to breed and die. Even though the Sargasso Sea has no borders apart from 4 ocean currents and is a ""sea within a sea"", a gyre if you will, and not one single human being has ever seen a single eel in the Sargasso Sea. The simple truth is that we know nothing of these creatures. I have seen that most people have a visceral reaction to them if seen up close. I also know that eel blood is a neurotoxin to humans. They seem to occupy a place nearer to our subconscious than our conscious selves.Personally, they remind me that we are just trouble and if the virus were to kill every single one of us the eels would just carry on as before, they would shed no tears over us and sometimes I wonder if they even know we are here.I loved this book because it takes us to their territory, which is really a very undefined place, and not them to us.Throughout human history they have been an enigma, it's as if on a ""need to know"" basis we are not on the list of those that need to know."

270,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,4,"I think the literature on personal experiences with animals is greatly underrated as a source of entertainment, insight, and wonder. It chronicles the efforts of people to work with an learn from the fauna around them without trying to impose will and with a respect for the dignity of the natural. The clear comparison for this book is “H is for Hawk” and it is appropriate although with some differences, especially that I do not see how one could ever form a partnership or a working relationship with a predator such as happens with the hawk. Eels are a bit different. Apart from that, a memoir of life encounters focusing on the Eel makes good sense.This is a personal memoir of the author’s experiences of growing up and learning about the Eel, both generally and through fishing for them with his father. In the process, of course, the author comes to reflect upon himself and his father and this animates this very intriguing book. Regarding the particularities of the Eel, it life cycle, reproduction, migrations, and the like, who knew? This is a highly unusual animal and I had no idea of the mysteries that have surrounded it. “Strange” only begins to cover the details. I won’t say anything else ... Then there is the fishing. I have consumed Eels, I will admit, but not frequently and I had never thought much about them. I had also been unaware of the role of Eels in history and literature.The attraction of the book comes from how experiences with Eels help motivate broader ideas of personal growth and knowledge and especially of Mr. Svensson coming to know his father. It highlights to me that a part of identity is not just what we have in common with others but also what we have in our experiences that is different and unusual, as long as we share it with somebody.I will not look at Eels the same way again, and I greatly enjoyed the book."
271,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870323-monica,4,"Eels are amazingly private creatures. People have tried to figure them out for millennia. Are they fish or snakes? How do they reproduce? Egg layers or viviparous? What and where are their sex organs? Aristotle studied them and had no answers. Freud dissected thousands of them about two thousand years later and got no answers either. They go through a series of total transformations over the course of their long lives, from translucent floating things that look like willow leaves, to glass tiny eels to much larger, more solid creatures. Some of the things we do not learn about eels in this wonderful little book: How and where they reproduce, what triggers their 3,000 mile migration from the Sargasso Sea to the rivers of Northern Europe, from salt to fresh water, how do they navigate the trip and the return journey? What triggers their return after 5 to 50 years, to the Sargasso Sea to breed and die? It was not till 2015 that anyone had ever seen an adult eel in the Sargasso Sea, and there is still much that is not known about them. And now their numbers are declining at an alarming rate due to climate change and other threats to habitat.The wonderful little book is at once a natural history, a scientific history, a memoir – of Svensson’s night fishing trips with his father - and an elegy for a disappearing creature and a way of life."
272,0062968815,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55548864-pam-coon,5,"You might find yourself questioning why you would want to read a nonfiction book about eels, but this is such a good read and is so well written that you will want to read it through to the last page.This is the story of the European eel, told by the author, from Sweden, who spent his childhood hunting eels with his father along the reed filled banks of the local stream that bordered his farm. The author weaves so many fascinating facts about eels, all within the context of his family, his own culture, and by the end of the book you will know so much about the elusive creature that has been part of our civilization from ancient times. You will also be touched by the author's beautiful meditations about life and even religion. You will learn why the eel is so elusive and has fascinated scientists from the earliest times. For one thing, no one, even in current times has ever seen this eel mate. They do not reproduce in captivity. In fact, until the 1900's no one even knew where these eels originated from. People knew they arrived from the sea to enter fresh water streams and rivers of Europe, but no one knew where they originated from, until a Danish scientist took to the sea to study them. It took him 20 years to determine their origin - the Sargasso Sea. But even with that discovery, no one has ever figured out exactly where they mate. I highly recommend this unusual book about a topic you might not think you care about until you pick it up. You won't be disappointed."

After all, the review said it was a little bit H for Hawk...which I had read and it was OK...and a little bit Soul of an Octopus...which I had read and loved...what could go wrong. Nothing as it turns out. This was an interesting review of a creature that I know little about other than the fact that it looks like a snake and I hope never to meet one in the wild. Eels are basically shy creatures and those that attempt to seek them out to study their nature and habits are hard pressed to discover anything. I loved the family connection that Mr. Svensson and his father had during their eel fishing expeditions and the various ways that they attempted to catch the eels and the additional more fact based parts of the book that talk about climate change and the possible extinction of the eels (along with many other species) was both fascinating and scary.

Originally published in Sweden, it reached way back into eels' primordial evolution, then its place in Greek philosophy, 18th, 19th, 20th century eco science paired with Svensson’s simple stories of fishing with their father, as well as fishermen who work or fish recreationally off the coast of Sweden. It also goes into cultural interpretation, anthropomorphic theory, and the threat of water pollution, overfishing, and global warming."

The last 50 pages otoh are not so exciting - I definitely had an idea that we're causing their extinction, as with like all the other species ever. But altogether it's an interesting little book.

It is a story of two tales: the eels themselves and the remembrance of fishing for eels with his father. I thought it was brilliant how the author used that personal experience to relate to the mysteriousness of the eel. Astute parallels and symbolic meaning help to create a deeper meaning to the book than just an academic look at eels. If you don't know a lot about eels, don't worry! Neither do scientists and naturalists around the world. That is what makes the eel mysterious and noble, much like the relationship the author had with his father.

It is a personal visit into his childhood sewn together with the grander scheme of how scientists throughout the ages have tried to figure the eel out. Just like I sometimes can wish myself into the world of the fiction novels I mostly read, this one made me wish I had more eel in my life. Just to eat eel may soon actually be fiction, but then again - eating it will not help it survive longer. If I get the opportunity though, it will be consumed with a new perspective of this inscrutable creature. I'm very happy I read it."
