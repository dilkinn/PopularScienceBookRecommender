0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,3,"This book should be titled ""The Book of Eels: A Childhood Spent Fishing with My Dad"". Actually, maybe we could just take off the first part, and make it ""Fishing with My Dad: A Memoir"". That would better reflect the book's contents. But that's not what it's called and when I saw this book I went, Oh goody! A book about eels! I don't know anything about eels! I must read this book!(Not sure if all those exclamation marks were in my thoughts, but probably. I get excited at the prospect of learning something new.)Now, had I bothered to read the book's blurb, I would have learned that it's not really so much about eels. But did I bother to read the blurb? Nope! I was too excited to see a book about something I know zero about and quickly placed a hold on it.The first chapter was thrilling. I learned some fascinating things about eels. I learned that they:•Have four growth stages, beginning with the larvae which has ""a body like a willow leaf, flat and virtually transparent, only a few millimeters long"".•The other stages are glass, yellow, and silver.•All eels, no matter the species or where they end up in the world, begin life in the Sargasso Sea•They then migrate thousands of miles to their adult home•Once there, they normally stay within a radius of just a few hundred yards•Eels are believed to travel back to the Sargasso Sea (where the smallest larvae are always found) to reproduce, but no one has ever seen an adult eel in the Sargasso Sea despite searching for them for a century.•An eel can live up to fifty years in one place though they are believed to die after reproducing.I learned all that and more in just the first chapter. Imagine my excitement, thinking the entire book was going to be full of facts!But chapter 2 came and my balloon burst.I quickly discovered that the book was not going to be much about eels, but about the author's time spent fishing for eels with his dad. Just about every other chapter of the book is about that.As a vegan who finds fishing horrifying (imagine having a huge hook stuck through your lips), I had to skip those chapters. I just couldn't do it. I couldn't read about catching them and I couldn't read about gutting them and cooking them and consuming them. Most of the other chapters are about people who have studied eels, their lives and what they thought them. There were interesting people such as Aristotle, Rachel Carson, and Sigmund Freud (you won't be surprised to learn his studies of them centered around finding the male's testicles).However, I really did not want to learn about these people or their thoughts about eels. Nor did I want to learn about the eel in literature. I wanted to learn about eels!Unfortunately, not a whole lot is known about them and so the author fills the book with details of people instead. Did I mention my balloon of excitement had deflated?I found it mildly interesting to learn that the pilgrims who arrived in Massachusetts on the Mayflower survived in large part to their consumption of eels, which a Native American gave to them. And yet the eel is not part of any American symbolization or mythology. Instead, on Thanksgiving people eat turkey... or tofurkey for those like me. At one point the author makes the assertion that ""in order to understand the eel, we have to have an interest in it, and to have an interest in it, we have to continue to hunt, kill, and eat it"".What??? Really?? Maybe it isn't convincing to say I find it interesting without wanting to hunt, kill, and eat it but what about dogs? People in Western countries understand and have an interest in dogs but I don't know anyone who thinks they have to hunt, kill, and eat them in order to do so!Really, Mr. Svensson, that is some messed up stuff.In the last decade, a European team attached electronic transmitters to seven hundred silver eels to study their migration back to the Sargasso Sea. Though only eighty-seven reached their destination, researchers learned that eels ""can swim without stopping for at least six months using nothing but its fat reserves as fuel"". They swim both day and night at an average of up to thirty-one miles a day. Pretty impressive, eh? I couldn't swim even a quarter of a mile, at least not without stopping several times to catch my breath.Sadly, eels, which have swam Earth's waters for at least forty million years, are now considered critically endangered. The author discusses this and the possible reasons for their dwindling numbers, from climate change to a herpes virus specific to eels, first seen in eels in captivity in Japan and  which spread to about half of all eels in the world. One thing is clear: We humans are most likely responsible for the demise of the eel, along with countless other species.  The eel may perish from the earth before we ever really understand it. Such a devastating idea.I wouldn't recommend this book to those solely wanting to learn about eels. I'd say it's a book for people who love fishing. That's not me. 5 stars for the quality of writing. 2 for my enjoyment of it. 1 star deducted for the batshit crazy idea that one has to enjoy killing eels if they're interested in them.2.5 stars but I'll round it up to 3 because, you know, I'm such a nice person."

2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"I never thought I would read a book about eels. It’s not a creature that has captured my curiosity. The one time I tried to eat one I found it abhorrent and never tried again.I had no idea all European eels are hatched in the Sargasso Sea, that they travel across twice. That no grown eel, alive or dead, has ever been found there. That eels metamorphose several times. Fascinating! Interspersed between the historical eel and biological facts are chapter about the author and his father fishing for eels. It’s an odd coming of age tale.I found this book philosophical and endearing, covering a lot more than I had expected. Definitely recommended if you want something different and lightly educational. "

Just like this fish he was born in the Caribbean, found his way all the way up to the Scandinavian coast, stayed here for 30 years and then returned triumphantly to his origins before dying. Both the author and I have been preoccupied with understanding and recollecting a father/son relationship and how your father can at once be something deeply familiar and still remain a mystery, just like the eel.

This book manages to be a combination of wonderful nature writing, a scientific history, a memoir about a father and son, and a rumination on origins and endings all at the same time. I learned things and marvelled at life; my creativity was sparked; and I was moved by the simple stories of a father and son fishing together. I’ve been obsessed by how little is known about eels ever since I read Lucy Cooke’s THE TRUTH ABOUT ANIMALS, and this book builds on that interest in a nuanced way. I’m officially an eel-head! An eelthusiast? We’ll workshop this."
5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,4,"Remarkably little is known about the European eel, Anguilla Anguilla. So little, in fact, that scientists and philosophers have, for centuries, been obsessed with what has become known as the ""eel question"" Where do eels come from? What are they? Are they fish or some other kind of creature altogether? Even today, in an age of advanced science, no one has ever seen eels mating or giving birth, and we still don't understand what drives them, after living for decades in freshwater, to swim great distances back to the ocean at the end of their lives. They remain a mystery.Drawing on a breadth of research about eels in literature, history, and modern marine biology, as well as his own experience fishing for eels with his father, Patrik Svensson crafts a mesmerizing portrait of an unusual, utterly misunderstood, and completely captivating animal. In The Book of Eels, we meet renowned historical thinkers, from Aristotle to Sigmund Freud to Rachel Carson, for whom the eel was a singular obsession. And we meet the scientists who spearheaded the search for the eel's point of origin, including Danish marine biologist Johannes Schmidt, who led research efforts in the early twentieth century, catching thousands upon thousands of eels, in the hopes of proving their birthing grounds in the Sargasso Sea.This is a quirky part memoir, part natural history and part meditation on the human condition, and although you may be asking why you need a whole book dedicated to the elusive eel, well, it is a book that asks what it means to live in an uncertain world full of questions that cannot seemingly be answered and not exclusively about the enigmatic creature. Svensson then draws parallels between the mysteries surrounding the lives of eels and those surrounding human existence with many other fascinating forays into the topic of philosophy throughout the book. Not only does it explore philosophical questions from a unique perspective but it also looks at religion, science, marine biology, psychology and literature which are all wrapped up in the shape of a memoir about the seemingly strained relationship between Svensson and his father. A truly original and absorbing read. Many thanks to Picador for an ARC."

Maybe his writing occasionally gets a little too fond of itself, but the sheer totality of the project is so personal and so appealing."

The European Eel is a slimy ugly creature that lurks in dark streams and lakes....well that is what I thought before starting this book. In fact right from it's mysterious birth in the Sargasso Sea life is tough for this creature, many predators finding it to be a tasty snack and a very long swim to the shoreline of Europe, things ain't over yet as there is still the journey up rivers and even across land to find that perfect spot to call home until it is time to head back to breed.The eel has moved way up my list of favourite animals for it's way of keeping scientists at bay for so many years, it is mind blowing that nobody has found the breeding ground or even an adult in the vicinity. I also loved that the eel has managed to prove the bible wrong, a bit was added to blatantly stop the poor eating eels by saying that you can only eat creatures with fins and scales....turns out the eels have both, very small fins and scales but they are there, which is brilliant.Svensson's writing is very good, he draws the reader in with a bunch of interesting facts that makes you realise you are reading about something special. His personal history with eel fishing with his Dad is very moving, reading about their bond over fishing being developed and lasting a whole lifetime was a joy to read. I reckon his Dad would have been proud of this book.This was wonderful, well worth reading about this mighty little animal.Blog boy: https://felcherman.wordpress.com/2020..."

I think that the only way you're likely to learn MORE about eels is from an actual textbook instead of a popular science text.But this book delivers so much more than just the basic facts. Svensson gives us not only the science, but also a look at the eel in literature, myth, and legend. Chapters about eels alternate with chapters about Svensson’s childhood fishing for eels with his father.The book is fascinating. If you're anything like me, your initial reaction to learning of this book was something like, “Eels? Really?” [raised eyebrow] But it's much more engaging than you think. It reads well, and I even found myself staying up late once or twice because I just couldn't resist reading another chapter. Or two. Or three.Books this good are what keep me reading nonfiction. Highly recommended! "

At least towards the end, when the eel served as a metaphor for our search for a home and meaning, as well as our need for that which cannot be readily explained. "

I read this for the 2020 Popsugar reading challenge category of “subject you know nothing about,” and it certainly fit the category! Prior to this book, all I knew about eels was that I’d eaten one, grilled, once at a backyard party in Rhode Island, and I was surprised that I liked it. This book focuses on the European eel, Anguilla Anguilla, but it also mentions the American eel, and - very briefly - Asian eels. The first chapter basically runs through a summary of what we know about the eel’s life cycle. The rest of the book is a memoir of the author’s youth, fishing for eels with his father (and a love letter to his father), alternating with chapters about the various scientists who have studied - or attempted to study - the eel. Svensson starts with Aristotle and gradually moves forward in time, touching on naturalists such as Johannes Schmidt, who devoted his life to study of the eel (and was funded by Carlsberg brewery), as well as more famous people, including Freud (who got his start trying - unsuccessfully - to find an eel’s testicles) and Rachel Carson. At times Svensson goes a bit far afield off-topic, but it’s always interesting (well, okay, I did start to lose interest in the Freud section), and the writing is exquisitely beautiful. I would quote some here, but I read an uncorrected proof, and perhaps quoting from those is frowned on.Maybe just a few sentences:
I can’t recall us ever talking about anything other than eels and how to best catch them, down there by the stream. I can’t remember us speaking at all.Maybe because we never did. Because we were in a place where the need for talking was limited, a place whose nature was best enjoyed in silence. The reflected moonlight, the hissing grass, the shadows of the trees, the monotonous rushing of the stream, and the bats like hovering asterisks above it all. You had to be quiet to make yourself part of the whole.It could, of course, also be because I remember everything wrong. 
I received a free copy of this English translation from Goodreads First Reads."

It had moments where it was interesting, but this book just wasn't for me. If you find eels interesting, you will probably love it. "

Eels are such an enigma, so much we want to know but also want the mysteries to remain unknown. This book is the combination of my three favorite genres: nerdy fact-packed nonfiction, memoir, and literature. History and factoid to satisfy my nerdy curiosity, memoir to connect with the author, and beautiful philosophical reflection of human being’s relationship with the animal world. This is not just about eels... it’s about reflection of the symmetry of our human condition and experience with the eel, and by extension, the natural world. And how we are, quite literally, the only specie that’s causing the 6th mass extinction on our planet and ruining everything 😑That bit about the Brantevik eel and its unfulfilled life journey really got me in the tear duct. Sigh, why can’t we just be respectful and leave nature alone 😢"

The book is a testament of our day and the live mysteries we already have, and are about to extinguish without ever understanding them. Eels have existed many millions of years, - long before humanity arrived here. The last four decades, and the coming years may, however, prove to be the end of their saga. Why? Do read. This book is quickly being translated into many languages wich is fascinating, well deserved and good news. I hope it will find readers everywhere. Beautifully written. Enlightening. Engaging. Speaking to existential questions, this book will linger in my mind and eels (!) will linger in my heart."

17,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/514234-stephanie-griffin,4,"This is a fascinating look at what we know of the history of eels and also their present day situation. Chapters go back and forth between what we know about eels and the author’s experiences of catching eels in Sweden as a child with his dad. There are descriptions of different ways they’re caught and eaten.The lives of eels is one of the least known things about the ocean. How does the European or American eel know where to swim on a 5,000 mile journey from their birth place in the Saragossa Sea to a fresh water creek? Living there for decades, how do they know when to make the one return trip to spawn and die? How DO they procreate? (1) No human has ever seen two eels mate.(2) No one has ever seen a mature eel in the Sargasso Sea.Many people have tried to figure out the mysteries of the eels. Even Sigmund Freud tried and failed. Eels won’t breed in captivity which makes it harder to study them.One of the weirdest facts I learned in this book is this:...apparently the eel is capable of suspending its own aging, no matter how long it lives for.Eels can live for 80 or 100 years! The author includes several stories of accidental longevity in eels.One part of the book didn’t seem to fit in for me and that was when the author spent a short time talking about Christianity. I didn’t really see how that has anything to do with eels.Unfortunately, there has been a huge reduction of eels over the past 40 years. The number of returning mature eels is down by 50%. The author asks how can we save them if we don’t know what makes them tick? I like eating eel sushi and I will miss having it, but I have to say, I see them in a whole new light now. These are nearly magical creatures who have all kinds of spooky tricks! Between that and all the parasites that most of them carry nowadays, I may not ever eat one again!The Book of Eels certainly increased my knowledge and for that I recommend it to everyone."
18,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8826745-richard-propes,5,"""The Book of Eels: Our Enduring Fascination with the Most Mysterious Creature in the Natural World"" shouldn't work. It just shouldn't. Be honest. The title makes you laugh. The concept seems downright weird. Truthfully? I can't imagine there will be a book that will surprise me more than did Swedish journalist Patrik Svensson's debut that he himself has called ""strange and nerdy."" ""The Book of Eels"" is, indeed, strange and nerdy. It's also sublime. It's also lyrical. It's also mesmerizing. ""The Book of Eels"" is hypnotic and immersive, informative and engaging. It's one of 2020's most pleasant surprises, an almost unimaginable weaving together of natural history meets memoir. ""The Book of Eels"" is about eels, that's definitely true, but it's also about life and love and how our existence defines us and how our existence can never define us. It has faith in science, yet offers glimpses of being tempted like a mysterious lover by the mystique of faith and the soothing security many find in trusting the unknowing. Already winner of Sweden's top literary prize, the August Prize, ""The Book of Eels"" entered my life almost as a dare. A friend who fears eels became aware of the book and expressed a temptation to read it. My curiosity got the best of me and on the eve of its U.S. release by Ecco, a HarperCollins Publishers imprint, I almost timidly requested the opportunity to review it. Within hours, my request was granted. ""What have I gotten myself into?,"" I asked myself. ""Why am I reviewing a book about eels?"" ""Am I insane?""""No. No, I'm not insane. I'm strange. I'm strange and nerdy,"" I chuckled to myself. I started reading, Svensson's poetic lyricism quickly immersing in alternating chapters serving up natural history and Svensson's own childhood memories of nighttime eel fishing with his father under a thin moonlight and amidst the shallow waters not far from their nearby home. Svensson wrote ""The Book of Eels,"" or gave himself permission to write ""The Book of Eels,"" after his father's death by cancer. It was a death that added mystery to a man who'd always been a bit of a mystery, a mystery not far removed from that of Anguilla anguilla, the European Eel. They are notoriously elusive creatures that have refused to reveal their secrets over the years. It is believed that they are all, quite literally all, born in the sea without borders, Sargasso Sea. They will eventually return - to mate and to die, though to date years upon years of research has been unable to determine why. They simply do. They all do. Svensson could never quite figure out why his father so completely loved eel fishing. As near as Svensson could tell, he never learned it from his father or the man he would come to know as father. He simply did and he surrendered himself to it. Aristotle researched the eel, developing both well-founded and remarkably outrageous theories. A younger Sigmund Freud spent an entire postgraduate research project searching for, quite seriously, the eel's testes. He failed to find them. Yet, they reproduce. Danish marine biologist Johannes Schmidt spent 20 years exploring the eels' connection to the Sargasso Sea, while Rachel Carson spent her entire professional life obsessed with the eel. The eel's truths have remained elusive; it's secrets remain well hidden. As I began reading ""The Book of Eels,"" it became a mesmerizing story I dared not put down. It's not that so much happens. It doesn't. It's that I became enchanted by Svensson's worlds, both that of the eels and that of a father and a life whose secrets remain ever elusive. Svensson, who describes himself as not believing in God, is clearly intrigued by the metaphysical world that he brings so vividly to life here. He believes in science, yet he cannot deny that science has been unable to answer the mystery of the eel. Likewise, despite all that he knows about his life and his father there remains ancestral secrets and unanswered questions that will likely never be answered. Svensson rather magnificently brings science to life here, yet he does so embracing the cosmic hilarity of eels that can even seemingly transcend their own realities at times. At times, you can practically hear Svensson's chuckling amidst his words. The long history of eel fishing is waning, the number of eels inexplicably waning and their numbers now protected as they are identified as endangered. He embraces this, never having loved eel fishing quite as much as his father did yet writing about it with such warmth and reverence that you simply know it somehow altered his DNA. There is little denying that ""The Book of Eels"" will not resonate with everyone, perhaps its cinematic equivalent being a European-tinged Malick effort that patiently, intimately reflects upon life, faith, science, death, and what this all actually means. While not all will engage with its unique, almost fairytale like rhythm, for those who surrender ""The Book of Eels"" has much to offer and will prove to be one of 2020's most unique, engaging, and inspired literary experiences. ""The Book of Eels: Our Enduring Fascination with the Most Mysterious Creature in the Natural World"" was released on May 26th by Ecco. "

20,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10159773-lexi,2,"This book could not make up its mind what it was. The first part was science book plus memoir about the authors father and eel fishing. The second part had less science and a whole lot more musing on philosophy and religion. This could have worked but mostly ended up a mess. I went in expecting more science of eels and got a meandering history of eels in popular imagination and literature and memories of fishing with my dad more than science. It also took me 3 months to read this, which is never a good sign.Finally, and this is my soap box, this would be a three star book had it used footnotes. It had a list of main sources by chapter but not enough for all the eel facts cited and if they were all, then a few chapters relied on a very few number of sources and readers should know that. Second, especially, when discussing research that people have spent most of their lives on this work, it needs to be cited. This is the second time I have written this in a review today, but it is unethical to do otherwise. I will continue to hold this belief on all popular science books that without footnotes, there is no ability to judge the quality of the sources and it fails to give credit to the hard work that went into the research that is being used for the book.

On one hand, I enjoyed learning about Aristotle’s theories about the origins of eels, Freud’s quest for eel testicles (no one should be surprised by this), and its influence on modern psychoanalysis. On the other hand, half of the chapters were flashbacks of the author fishing as a child, which seemed unnecessary and boring from my perspective. It was fascinating to learn what we did about eels, but a large focus of this book was on the people studying them, rather than the eels themselves. That being said- I do know a lot more about eels than I did before I picked this book up. "

23,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77536251-modern-major-general,4,"Firstly, I wouldn't really label this as a ""hard science"" book. There is some interesting scientific information and it is presented very well, but if you are looking for a detailed morphology, evolutionary history, deep dive into its habits and lifestyle, this isn't really the book for you. Hell, I didn't even know there were Asian Eels until near the very end of the book, after the author had gone on at length about European Eels, and somewhat about American Eels.However, if you are interested in the lives of those who have researched eels (Sigmund Freud? Really!? Wow!), or if you are interested in learning a lot about the author of this book and how he came to be interested in the subject, or if you are interested in how Eels have influenced Humanity throughout our history, then this this book is definitely right up your alley!For myself, I found this book quite enlightening. I was not aware that the mystery of the Eel was something plaguing Humanity, let alone plaguing us for thousands of years. It's quite amazing that many contemporary scientists, and the author himself, have been pondering many of the same questions that the most famous of ancient philosophers and sages have also pondered.I'm equally amazed by the lengths life is willing to go to not just to simply exist, but also to propagate itself into perpetuity. Much the opposite of Salmon, the Eel lives in freshwater and returns to the ocean to spawn. And, as near as we've been able to discover, both the American Eel and the European Eel seem to return to the region around the Sargasso Sea to spawn, whilst Asian Eels return to a region near the Marianas Trench. However, as is stated in the book, in some of its reviews, and confirmed by my own amateur research, spawning in the wild has never been witnessed. Also, unlike Salmon, as far as we can tell, the next generation of Eels do not return to the same place their parents set out from. Eels seem to be far more capricious, ending up wherever the currents take them...with the exception that American Eels always return to America and European Eels to Europe.I would most definitely recommend this book, as I believe it's science is easily within the reach of the average reader and the author's anecdotes make him easy to relate to by most."

The book goes into quite a bit of detail about what we know and some of what we don't know.

25,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866236-patrik-hallberg,4,"An almost perfect little book, you might think how can a book about eels be interesting? If somebody would have said to me that I would read a book about eels I would probably have laughed, but it's in the unknown and the unexpected that often the biggest joy in life lies. And the eel is truly still in many ways an unknown creature and this is now hurting its existence. Because the eel is dying and this paradox has become its enemy. Its mysterious ways and unknown nature is making it very hard for us to help it. We don't know why it's dying, but we know that it's probably due to us. It's very hard to get an eel to reproduce in captivity, in fact, it has never been done for the European eel only with the Japanese. This fact, of course, makes it harder for us to increase the ever-fading habitat of eels. I have learned so much about the eel that I had no idea about before. It's truly a very special character, with its metamorphoses, how it only grows reproduction organs when it needs it, that it can almost live forever, that it somehow finds its way back to the Sargasso ocean (where we think it reproduces), but never have seen it, only its offspring. It's also a book about the author and his father and how they used to fish eel and that that was when they felt a bound between them, later they grew apart and when his father dies, he returns to their summer house and the lake where they never caught an eel, but knew it must be there and as by magic he gets an eel, but it gets stuck and he has to cut the line just like his father did when he was younger. The eel comes to meet him and he sees him before he returns to the unknown, just like his father return to the eternity when he died."

28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,4,"I think the literature on personal experiences with animals is greatly underrated as a source of entertainment, insight, and wonder. It chronicles the efforts of people to work with an learn from the fauna around them without trying to impose will and with a respect for the dignity of the natural. The clear comparison for this book is “H is for Hawk” and it is appropriate although with some differences, especially that I do not see how one could ever form a partnership or a working relationship with a predator such as happens with the hawk. Eels are a bit different. Apart from that, a memoir of life encounters focusing on the Eel makes good sense.This is a personal memoir of the author’s experiences of growing up and learning about the Eel, both generally and through fishing for them with his father. In the process, of course, the author comes to reflect upon himself and his father and this animates this very intriguing book. Regarding the particularities of the Eel, it life cycle, reproduction, migrations, and the like, who knew? This is a highly unusual animal and I had no idea of the mysteries that have surrounded it. “Strange” only begins to cover the details. I won’t say anything else ... Then there is the fishing. I have consumed Eels, I will admit, but not frequently and I had never thought much about them. I had also been unaware of the role of Eels in history and literature.The attraction of the book comes from how experiences with Eels help motivate broader ideas of personal growth and knowledge and especially of Mr. Svensson coming to know his father. It highlights to me that a part of identity is not just what we have in common with others but also what we have in our experiences that is different and unusual, as long as we share it with somebody.I will not look at Eels the same way again, and I greatly enjoyed the book."
29,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870323-monica,4,"Eels are amazingly private creatures. People have tried to figure them out for millennia. Are they fish or snakes? How do they reproduce? Egg layers or viviparous? What and where are their sex organs? Aristotle studied them and had no answers. Freud dissected thousands of them about two thousand years later and got no answers either. They go through a series of total transformations over the course of their long lives, from translucent floating things that look like willow leaves, to glass tiny eels to much larger, more solid creatures. Some of the things we do not learn about eels in this wonderful little book: How and where they reproduce, what triggers their 3,000 mile migration from the Sargasso Sea to the rivers of Northern Europe, from salt to fresh water, how do they navigate the trip and the return journey? What triggers their return after 5 to 50 years, to the Sargasso Sea to breed and die? It was not till 2015 that anyone had ever seen an adult eel in the Sargasso Sea, and there is still much that is not known about them. And now their numbers are declining at an alarming rate due to climate change and other threats to habitat.The wonderful little book is at once a natural history, a scientific history, a memoir – of Svensson’s night fishing trips with his father - and an elegy for a disappearing creature and a way of life."

The author weaves so many fascinating facts about eels, all within the context of his family, his own culture, and by the end of the book you will know so much about the elusive creature that has been part of our civilization from ancient times. You will also be touched by the author's beautiful meditations about life and even religion. You will learn why the eel is so elusive and has fascinated scientists from the earliest times. For one thing, no one, even in current times has ever seen this eel mate. They do not reproduce in captivity. In fact, until the 1900's no one even knew where these eels originated from. People knew they arrived from the sea to enter fresh water streams and rivers of Europe, but no one knew where they originated from, until a Danish scientist took to the sea to study them. It took him 20 years to determine their origin - the Sargasso Sea. But even with that discovery, no one has ever figured out exactly where they mate. I highly recommend this unusual book about a topic you might not think you care about until you pick it up. You won't be disappointed."

After all, the review said it was a little bit H for Hawk...which I had read and it was OK...and a little bit Soul of an Octopus...which I had read and loved...what could go wrong. Nothing as it turns out. This was an interesting review of a creature that I know little about other than the fact that it looks like a snake and I hope never to meet one in the wild. Eels are basically shy creatures and those that attempt to seek them out to study their nature and habits are hard pressed to discover anything. I loved the family connection that Mr. Svensson and his father had during their eel fishing expeditions and the various ways that they attempted to catch the eels and the additional more fact based parts of the book that talk about climate change and the possible extinction of the eels (along with many other species) was both fascinating and scary.

Originally published in Sweden, it reached way back into eels' primordial evolution, then its place in Greek philosophy, 18th, 19th, 20th century eco science paired with Svensson’s simple stories of fishing with their father, as well as fishermen who work or fish recreationally off the coast of Sweden.

It is a story of two tales: the eels themselves and the remembrance of fishing for eels with his father. I thought it was brilliant how the author used that personal experience to relate to the mysteriousness of the eel. Astute parallels and symbolic meaning help to create a deeper meaning to the book than just an academic look at eels. If you don't know a lot about eels, don't worry! Neither do scientists and naturalists around the world. That is what makes the eel mysterious and noble, much like the relationship the author had with his father. Sadly, we may never know the true nature of the eel as we continue to see the environmental world collapse around us and the eel with it."

The book is a sinuous weave of biography, history and natural history. Svensson recounts the many people who over centuries have tried to address ""Question of the Eel"" interspersed with his childhood memories eel-fishing with his Father. If I'm honest I had no idea the European eel had inspired such efforts - from Sigmund Freud spending his early years in Trieste and failing to find how eels reproduce, to Johannes Schmidt who sailed around the Atlantic for years early in the 20th Century, slowly gathering data that identified the Sargasso Sea as the eel's only breeding ground, this book covers the evolution of our scientific understanding of the eel - such as it is. No human has ever seen an eel breeding. But it's the snapshots of his life in Sweden, and particularly his evolving relationship with his Father, that are the real joy of this book."

I am not Maori or of Maori descent, I am an immigrant in this beautiful land. Whilst driving almost anywhere in NZ when one comes across new roads with cuttings and embankments, any concrete is often adorned with relief work of eels.A while back I lived in a remote/weird settlement in an area surrounded by lakes, rivers and what are referred to as drainage ditches. In every lake or waterway in NZ there are eels. That particular place was an eel migration point from the local lake. The eels would gather round the seaward side of the lake until we had a huge southerly storm when the shingle bank would be wet, then the eels would slither out of the lake and over the shingle into the sea then off to who knew where to breed and die.For a while I used to catch a few eels for food. I did that until I found out that the eels were anywhere from upwards of 45 years old. At that point I stopped because I felt that having lived so long who was I to take their life when I could easily get food anywhere, this was not a life or death struggle. I have seen eels here that were between 80 and 100 years old. People I have met who climb mountais tell me that wherever you find running water, no matter how high up there will be eels there.In the Northern Hemisphere, the fantasy is that the eels migrate to the Sargasso Sea to breed and die. Even though the Sargasso Sea has no borders apart from 4 ocean currents and is a ""sea within a sea"", a gyre if you will, and not one single human being has ever seen a single eel in the Sargasso Sea. The simple truth is that we know nothing of these creatures. I have seen that most people have a visceral reaction to them if seen up close. I also know that eel blood is a neurotoxin to humans. They seem to occupy a place nearer to our subconscious than our conscious selves.Personally, they remind me that we are just trouble and if the virus were to kill every single one of us the eels would just carry on as before, they would shed no tears over us and sometimes I wonder if they even know we are here.I loved this book because it takes us to their territory, which is really a very undefined place, and not them to us.Throughout human history they have been an enigma, it's as if on a ""need to know"" basis we are not on the list of those that need to know."

67,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6153287-gary,4,"I put a libby hold on this audibook not based on any particular interest in eels or knowledge about the book but purely because it was on a recommended list, so I really didn't know what to expect going in. I ended up really enjoying the book - more than I thought I would. I am usually pretty interested in animals in general, but eels are not a species that I have ever been drawn to. I don't eat eel, I don't stop to stare at them in the aquarium. I know they were Ursula's pets/sidekicks in Little Mermaid and that they are popular in some asian cuisine. So I think something that helped make the book enjoyable for me was a big complaint from people who didn't like the book. The top review on goodreads was from ""Jenna"", a apparently 'witty reviewer' who also happens to be a vegetarian. She WAS very interested in learning about eels. And so she was disappointed to find that the book is only partially a scientific look at the eel. It is also a memoir of the Swedish author's relationship with his father and their time spent eel-fishing. As a vegetarian she found this abhorrent, along with many of Svensson's statements about fishing for and eating eels, and she also was disappointed that there wasn't more information and science about eels. Many/most of the bad reviews i saw complained about this aspect and the author's straying from the science. I wasn't in this for the science so I actually enjoyed learning about the author's life and appreciated the way he intertwined the two. Also, many of these people were probably simply guilty of not reading the synopsis. They complained that the title ""The Book of Eels"" is terrible - as if the title of a book is always supposed to reveal its exact content. Strange. And I also wonder whether those readers understand the role that sea creatures and fishing play in a good portion of swedish/nordic culture. To excoriate the swedish author for bringing that into his book just seems a bit ignorant. There are undoubtedly textbooks available about eels. I think it was clear this was to a degree pop-science literature.Another aspect I did not expect, and enjoyed was learning about well-known historical figures who studied the eel, such as Aristotle and Sigmund Freud (Aristotle was convinced eels spontaneously generated, and Freud spent his time searching for the enigmatic eel's seemingly missing testicles. Naturally!)There were also some parts of the book about the eel in literature and popular imagination. I thought those were fun little interludes, although I do understand why some would find them out of place.I was fascinated to learn that almost all eels (exception seems to be asian eels) originate at, and return for breeding to the Sargasso Sea which is actually an area in the Atlantic ocean. But apparently even to this day we there is still a lot we don't know about the eel.The memoir parts of the book were touching - a little sad but also sweet. Svensson's relationship with his father was not a bad one but was painted honestly as one that waned as he grew, as was his immediate relationship with eels, which he eventually stopped fishing for as well, and so I thought the ending, looking at the death of his father, the meaning of life and death, and relating it to the lifecycle and many mysteries of the eel worked nicely.The book wasn't perfect - some parts were a bit too slow or meandering, and it might have been more of a 3.5 or 3.75 stars for me, but I was pleasantly surprised by this book full of eels."
68,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7028840-ron,4,"A very interesting read. The author does occasionally go off the track a bit but not enough to lose a star. One of the great natural world mysteries is the eel and the Sargasso Sea. It is widely accepted that they travel there to spawn, based on all the evidence of very tiny eels found there. The fascinating fact is that there has NEVER been a sighting of adult eels there, alive or dead. Tracking devices have been placed on adults leaving European waters but there has never been a complete tracking to the Sea. For some reason, the author never explains why the trackers eventually come off the eels.

So little, in fact, that scientists and philosophers have, for centuries, been obsessed with what has become known as the “eel question”: Where do eels come from? What are they? Are they fish or some other kind of creature altogether? Even today, in an age of advanced science, no one has ever seen eels mating or giving birth, and we still don’t understand what drives them, after living for decades in freshwater, to swim great distances back to the ocean at the end of their lives. They remain a mystery.Drawing on a breadth of research about eels in literature, history, and modern marine biology, as well as his own experience fishing for eels with his father, Patrik Svensson crafts a mesmerizing portrait of an unusual, utterly misunderstood, and completely captivating animal. In The Book of Eels, we meet renowned historical thinkers, from Aristotle to Sigmund Freud to Rachel Carson, for whom the eel was a singular obsession. And we meet the scientists who spearheaded the search for the eel’s point of origin, including Danish marine biologist Johannes Schmidt, who led research efforts in the early twentieth century, catching thousands upon thousands of eels, in the hopes of proving their birthing grounds in the Sargasso Sea.Blending memoir and nature writing at its best, Svensson’s journey to understand the eel becomes an exploration of the human condition that delves into overarching issues about our roots and destiny, both as humans and as animals, and, ultimately, how to handle the biggest question of all: death. The result is a gripping and slippery narrative that will surprise and enchant."

There are things down there that we can barely imagine and creatures that we do know of we know so little about.One of those creatures is the eel. It is one of the strangest creatures that has existed and even though they have been studied for hundreds of years, very little is known about it. The few things we do know about them are mere snapshots of their lives, even now it is thought that they spawn in the Sargasso Sea, it is not actually known that they actually do that. Attempting to get them to breed in captivity has met with abject failure every time.Now their numbers are plummeting, there has been a 95% drop in the number of elvers in our streams and rivers and no one knows what to do about it or where to start looking for answers. Yet they have been a part of our culture since time immemorial. Thousands have been caught and cooked and eaten all over Europe in this time too.One of those people who fished for this elusive creature is Patrick Svensson. It was kind of a hobby, but for his father, it was a borderline obsession. He would try the latest methods or new baits and traps in his drive to catch these creatures. But there was more to it than that, it was a welcome respite from his job as a road paver. He could come home from that hot smelly job have a short nap and then carry on for the rest of the day, but he always smelled of tar.It began for his father in childhood, he always liked being down by the stream. It was a short distance from his home and was a slightly overgrown habitat that had its own magic. At the time it was the outer limit of his world and he fished and swam in it, skated over it in the winter, caught mice and listened to the soothing noise of flowing water when helping out on the farm. He was fond of the taste of eel too, loving the greasy gamey flavour, unlike his son. Fishing for eels became a thing that they did together and even though Svensson recalls it being the only thing that they talked of, but also remembers not talking that much at all when fishing.Svensson is not the only one who has had a fascination with this enigmatic creature, it has been written about since Aristotle’s time and he explores what some of these people learnt and wrote about it.It is a wide-ranging looking at some of the natural history, historical, culture and folklore behind eels but at its heart, this is a family memoir about the time Svensson spent fishing for eels with his father. He has a straightforward and matter of fact way of writing and I did like it, but the multi-faceted genres meant it lost a little bit of focus for me."
70,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159982-lili,4,"The Publisher’s Lunch 2020 Spring/Summer Buzz Books volume contained the first two chapters of this book in their nonfiction section. The first chapter was a succinct natural history of the European eel; the second chapter was a bit of memoir about the author as a young child fishing for eel with his dad at the stream running near his house in Sweden. These two chapters were so well-written and lyrical that I could envision myself reading the entire book. The writing in the sample chapters reminded me of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek by Annie Dillard and Once Upon a River by Diane Setterfield, both of which are works of fiction the ebb and flow of life with respect to the ebb and flow of the river (or creek) at the center of the novel.The book itself followed the same rhythm as the sample chapters: alternating one chapter of nonfiction with one chapter of memoir. In each chapter of nonfiction, the author brings us closer to solving the mystery of the eel; in each chapter of memoir, the author tells a different anecdote about fishing for eels with his dad at increasingly older ages.The problem with the book is that, by the fourth nonfiction chapter, we reached the sum of knowledge presented in the first chapter. That was approximately one third of the way through the book. So as the memoir continued to follow a linear progression from childhood to old age, the remaining nonfiction chapters started to wander away from the core of the book. Later nonfiction chapters discussed such things as eel fishermen, the eel in religion and literature, the anthropomorphism of the eel, 21st century efforts to find the eel breeding ground, and the potential extinction of the eel. As the nonfiction narrative continued to wander, I started to count pages.Overall, I enjoyed the book. I felt that the memoir portion was heartfelt and very well paced, with the minor exception of condensing the time the author spent separated from his parents. However, I felt like the author started reaching for nonfiction topics to fill in the gaps between the memoir chapters. As a result, the later nonfiction chapters were of varying quality. But starting with such a lovely natural history set a very high bar for the following nonfiction chapters.I received this book as a digital advance reader copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."

In this case, fishing for eels with his dad as a kid. Also if you enjoyed Kurlansky's ""Cod"" (which I did - in fact I LOVE it!), you'll also enjoy this. Environmental issues and extinction, mankind's horrible effect on the eels. The ""science"" chapters include the cultural and culinary history of the European eel. But also a lot on how long it was before we knew much about them - and how little we still do. We know they breed in the Sargossa Sea, that the spawn drift thousands of miles over years to reach Europe (shorter for North America), and that sometime between 10 and 50 years old they swim thousands of miles back to breed. But we have never found live (or dead) adults there, or any eggs! I'd give this a 4 out of 5, but the last 2 chapters are a bit weak. The stories of the extinct (by man) dodo and sea cow are interesting, but feel more like filler. Sharing with us the passing of his father is appreciated, and emotional. But I'm not sure he needed to add his musing on faith (or lack thereof) or about recent studies on the moment of death - heart stopping vs brain waves, and studies on the increase of brain waves at the moments leading up to the final end.The ""Sources"" are mostly scientific - fine by me. I need to go reread Graham Swift's ""Waterland"", which he gives some attention to here, as it should be. Rachel Carson's ""Under the Sea-wind"" is inexpensive as a kindle title, so I'll probably read the less than 100 pp she wrote on the North American eel (different number of vertebrae than the European, but also bred in the Sargasso Sea - another mystery, how do the tiny, leaf-like eel spawn know to go to NA or Europe?). And I've been meaning to read Kolbert's ""The Sixth Extinction"" for some time now.....Missing info - I still don't know where Australian eels breed - with the Japanese, which he gives a few pages about late in the book? What was the device made from eel skin that was used to discipline children? The book could have used some illustrations. But over-all, interesting and informative. Science made understandable to the non-scientist. Well written and enjoyable. I'm looking forward to his next book already."

I often start them and then find myself bored despite being a fan of both genres. This eARC was more like my experience reading Eric Larsen's Devil in the White City, where I felt the HH Holmes storyline was an unnecessary piece -- I was much more interested in the history of the World's Fair than with that of the serial killer who happened to be active at the same time in the same city. They didn't need each other. Similarly, I had trouble jumping away from the fascinating history of the scientific study of eels into the alternating chapters about the author and his father's eel-trapping. I certainly don't mean to disparage his experiences. Those stories just didn't do as good a job, for me, of illustrating the almost metaphysical mysteries of the eel that Svensson neatly parallels with the greater unknowables of life and relationships. His father's eel-fishing fascination is an inheritance that he clings to despite its limited utility. Perhaps because Svensson drifts away from the hobby as he ages into college, and never really seems to connect with it, it doesn't feel like his passion; yet there's not enough emotional content about the relationship between father and son to explain what exactly the son is trying to get at about his dad and the two of them together, via the grand exposition on eels. I feel like maybe Svensson wasn't quite ready to tell his whole tale, and has just thrown us some simplistic shreds as the basis for making this a memoir, perhaps to capitalize on the trend or on the advice of an editor. The metaphors around our inability to actually witness or control eels (other than wiping them out, as we are in the process of doing with them and so many other genii) might actually be stronger without the oddly impersonal personal touch."

These scenes really through me off (I understand that any meat production is very graphic - but wasn't aware I was signing up for this). Additionally, every other chapter became memoirs to time the author spent bonding with his dad around fishing the eel and preparing it as food. I ended up skipping these chapters to return to the science and research efforts of the eel, because I didn't want to read a memoir, I wanted to learn about eels - and as terrible as it sounds, I was very bored by these chapters. I learned a great lot about eels in this book - so it accomplished what it set out to do. I really enjoyed the chapters that discussed the cultural and historical significance of the eel, including its presence in major world religions, the mythical first thanksgiving, and how communities were set up for eel fishing (my family's hometown in the Netherlands is translated to Eel Lake). I learned that the threat of overfishing eels has led them to become critically endangered, and with that comes the destruction of cultural practices surrounding the eel - but its complex because the cultural practices (fishing) is the very thing that threatens eels the most. All said, I learned a lot and would recommend readers to pick up this book about a topic they probably never considered, and learn about this mysterious, metamorphic fish. "

This book contains loads of references to Freud, Rachel Carson and so many others whose interest in eels drove their research. Eels are elusive creatures. Born in the Sargasso Sea and returning to it to spawn and then die. Some eels can live to be 80 years old. Most of how they get from the Sargasso Sea to the Atlantic is not understood. Many chapters are dedicated to their sex organs, how they reproduce, etc., how they find their way back to the Sargasso sea at the end of their lives. This book is an origin story not only of the eel but of the author's father and the author himself. The descriptions of the author as a young boy fishing for eels with his father are touching. One episode in particular will linger in my mind's eye forever. The boy reaches into the murky water to retrieve an eel and while holding its head experiences being hit in the face with the eel's slimy, wet and slightly smelly whipping body. The eel then wraps itself around the boy's arm. I have never been a big fan of eels, either as a food source or otherwise. This image can be the stuff of nightmares. The author describes how the slime from the eel is almost impossible to wash off. The book also tells us that the eel, like so many other creatures, has become an endangered species due to a herpes virus and pollution. The tragedy is that because so little is known about the habits of eels, there isn't much to be done to help them survive.So I now know lots of eel facts but I wanted something else. Some metaphysical link to something larger maybe. I plodded through this book despite the familiar structure. Alternating chapters of fishing for eel with Dad followed by chapters on the history of eels. "
75,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40758735-miguel,4,"After reading a pre-release article about this book, my expectations were set fairly high based on learning just a bit about eels and their lifecycle. Is it common knowledge that eels have 4 distinct phases of life, have an unknown and varying lifespan that could outstrip ours, have never been observed to mate in the wild, mate in two (or more) unknown spots in the large Atlantic and Pacific where they then are assumed to die (without any visible corpses), and travel thousands of miles to find freshwater living spaces? This was fairly mind-blowing even before reading the book, and though the book itself does an admirable job in detailing all this and a little bit more it never quite reached the height expectation setup from the preceding article. The author’s relationship to his father and the act of eel fishing which are intervening chapters are all well and good and give the topic a bit more of a personal depth, but quite frankly after recently reading “Entangled Life” I was hoping for something along this vein, meaning someone would have more thoroughly explored the topic in more scientific detail – it’s clear that Svensson doesn’t have a deep science background and is a journalist which is fine, but had he described eels in the same manner as Sheldrake did for fungi in Entangled Life it would have been just a bit more insightful.The Atlantic just did a great 15 min video on glass eel poaching in the US – after reading this book and viewing this video it’s clear that there are many more stringent rules needed to help preserve this species and cut down on Asia’s insatiable appetite for dwindling and endangered animals. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F13rF..."
76,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30131495-maureen-weiner,4,"I always enjoy reading about nature, but I was surprised by how little we humans know about eels. It appears eels do not fit neatly into any of the categories that human's create. They are not completely fish or amphibian.They do not reach sexual maturity until the last stage of their life and they do not even have sexual organs until that metamorphosis has occurred. No human knows for certain where eels breed because no human has ever witnessed them breeding. We find their larvae in the Sargasso Sea, but no adult eels have ever been found there, either alive or dead.Throughout history, many prominent scientist (including Aristotle and Sigmund Freud) have dissected eels by the 100,000's searching for answers to the eel question. Aristotle dissected eels for years searching for their sex organs. He never found any and he concluded that eels grow spontaneously from mud. It never occurred to him that eels sexuality could be so vastly different from all other species he had encountered. Freud spent years searching for the male sex organs of the eel. He also never found what he was looking for and look what happened to him; he became completely obsessed with sex. Penis Envy could be nothing more than the crazy idea spawned by years of futilely looking for something that isn't there.When I think of all those eels dissected for human curiosity, I wonder how well humans would fare if aliens came to earth and dissected us by the 100,000's in order to satisfy their curiosity."
77,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15971935-mark-stidham,4,"I picked up the book after hearing and then reading a NY Times interview with the author. Svensson is a journalist, but the book does not read like journalism. It is mostly a love letter to his father and a paen to mysteries and perhaps the limits of science and knowledge. I have not yet read how it evokes ""Moby Dick"" (its subtitle is ""The Whale""), but I see similarities. Chapters on the history of eel knowledge are interwoven with chapters about the author and his father. In interviews, Svensson claims surprise about the book's popularity, but he admits “We need enigmas,” he said. “We need questions that aren’t answered yet. Eels argue with our confidence that the world is explained.”I have no experience with eels except to have seen some in aquariums. I have read about eel pies found in England and eels as a delicacy in Japan. And recently there was a Radiolab podcast episode on eels that communicated the mysteries surrounding eel biology. But back to the book. The enjoyment is as much in the writing as what is written. There is a perceptible rhythm and a welcoming to the reader to join in the journey. I came away sharing an understanding of the author's fascination with the eel and with the appreciation of limitations in understanding. In a poetic analogy, Svensson links the mystery of his own personal origins and life's meaning with existential questions of life on the planet, extinction of species, and individual mortality. For anyone with a philosophical curiosity, it is a wonderful read."
78,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115785576-bianca,3,"I'll start with the basics. I began this book knowing little to nothing about eels. I had not previously had an interest in eels. I didn't know there were multiple types of eels: North American, European, Japanese. I didn't know they couldn't be bred in captivity. I knew nothing. I had seen an eel once or twice, at best. I ended up Googling a photo, just to ensure I was thinking of the correct fish. With that said, if you're looking for a hard-and-fast nonfiction book that will solely provide eel facts, this is not the book for you. The Book of Eels is a mixture of memoir, history textbook, and encyclopedia. Patrik Svensson alternates between eel information and his own life stories that involve eels. Ultimately, I think both were necessary for the story. His telling establishes the connection between eels and humanity, but helps the reader to understand the role eels have played. The background of the eel and the facts about eels were interesting. However, I gave this a 3/5 because some parts of the book seemed redundant - certain ideas or concepts were repeated one too many times. I did enjoy the way Svensson takes scientific mysteries and wraps them up in lived experiences. In sum, maybe the author won? Because I typically would not have read a book about eels (or had an interest), but it kept my attention and I learned a thing or two. "

In fact, I think that this is a very good book for somebody who is very interested in science, animals, and how exploration of animals is done.The reason why I'm rating this low is because it just wasn't a book for me. It didn't hold my attention the way I wanted it to, and for me it just wasn't very entertaining. However there were some parts that I very much enjoyed. I really enjoyed the biography parts of it. Hearing why the eel is so important to the author is one of the parts that I really felt a connection with and those were parts that I really really enjoyed. I can't really think of anything specific that I would say is wrong with the book. It's simply that it just wasn't a book that I am specifically entertained by. That saying, if you are interested in this type of thing, I would definitely recommend it. This book was wonderfully written and would probably really interest you."
80,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6968225-ben,4,"First: if you're looking for a book that is mostly facts about eels, this is not going to be your book.Second: we know a surprisingly small amount about how European eels work. We know they're born in the Sargasso Sea, and that after going through many life stages they return to the Sargasso Sea, but we also don't fully know how/exactly where they reproduce. So there might not be a book that's going to give you nothing but the Eel Facts you desire.I'd put this in the same category as Roxane Gay's Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body. There's an aspect of memoir to this book (the author and his father did a lot of eel fishing in Sweden) that's interleaved with what we know about eels, and how we've found that out. I didn't expect this book to have as much narrative as it did, but that was a surprising delight.In summary: Eels!"

I'm sure that some will compare it to ""H Is for Hawk"" by Helen Macdonald in its focus on a relationship between father and child but this has much more of a scholarly feel (not to diminish ""H Is for Hawk"" in any way).The structure of the book is set up in mostly alternating chapters between the natural history of the eel (of what is known) and the story of a young boy in Sweden who grew up casually fishing for eels with his father. This lends the book a more obvious personal touch, but the author also uses the eel as a looking glass to hold up to his own and others situations to see what one can divine about the nature of life and death. The eel itself is a very odd and secretive animal about which surprisingly little is known in terms of its reproductive process and death and therefore it is well suited to its use as a metaphor for human lives."

Mystery, even if it's ""just"" books, has made my life so much more interesting.And now it's here. This is the story of the most mysterious creature in the world. It's a story about science, about nature, about people. About a simple, small fish, that simply refuses to become scientifically understood. Oh, it warms my heart and soul to think about those eels, swimming in the depths of the ocean, laughing at our poor attempts to simplify their existence into a scientific theory.And it's a story so well constructed, it makes me smile just to think about it.

It is a very readable and relatable book. Notable figures like Aristotle, Pliny the Elder, Freud, and Rachel Carson all contributed to scientific knowledge of the eel. My own fascination with the eel began with a project I completed for the Western Reserve Historical Society. I researched recipes that people who traveled the Ohio and Erie Canal prepared. One of those recipes involved eel. I knew that eel was a common ingredient in Europe and supposed that if there were eels in Lake Erie, immigrants would know how to fish for and prepare them. It turns out that the digging of another canal, the Welland Canal in 1829, connected Lake Ontario to Lake Erie and brought eels into Lake Erie and from there down the Ohio and Erie Canal. The Ohio Fish Commission also release elvers into Ohio waterways from 1882-1892."

We do not know how they know to get there, we do not know how they know when to go, we do not know exactly how they appear to be able to extend their lifespan until they get there, we do not know why they only go there, and we have only the faintest idea of what they do once they *are* indeed there. This group of questions is known as the eel question -- like, a universally agreed stand-in for Things We Don't Know and May Not Ever -- meaning this entire book gets to be a wounded and beautiful meditation on death, not-knowing, the need to know, and the need to be okay with mystery, even when it comes to Svensson's father.

That is also what the title, subtitle, and preview information says this book is about. The rest of the book is really a memoir of the author mainly with regards to his relationship with his father and the two of them fishing for eels. Then there are memoir parts that have really nothing to do with eels. Those parts of the book seem disjointed from the eel parts. The first couple of chapters of his memory of fishing for eels with his father was almost historical in the sense of talking about the general relationship of people fishing for eels. However there were too many of these tangents, and some of the tangents really went to stories of his family that had nothing to do with eels.

I was also heartened to learn a ship named Dana played a big role in helping to solve some of the mysteries of the origin of the species. But the author alternated the chapters between his own personal experiences with eels and I struggled to connect with that part of the story.

His prose is best when he's detailing his eel fishing adventures with his father. But even there, he forgoes familial intimacy in favor of heavily detailed descriptions of fishing itself. Which I get. It was bonding time with his father. But, subjectively, there were moments that were too graphic for this vegetarian. If have preferred straight science and history without the pontificating. And the weirdly proselytizing moments mentioning Christianity that didn't fit, especially for an ostensibly irreligious writer.In short, I wanted more eel and less weird babble about Freud's weirdness about Italian women."

And even if I would give Cod a five-star rating, this one is marginally inferior to it, and the main difference is more cultural than anything. Svensson writes about the complex life of the eel, and about part of its history, in a more Scandinavian way, minus the humour and attention to history often find in English food-books. But he tells a good story about this fascinating animal, and what I liked most was how he involved the story of the relation with his father and the nightly fishing trips for eel. There is a part in the book about Faith that comes a bit as a surprise but that is very interesting. And I thank the author manyfold for the info about Rachel Carson, whose books i will soon read. "

The author is a good story teller and it was an engrossing and informative read.Recommended.Many thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for this ARC, all opinions are mine."

At first I had some trouble with the writing style, very formal and slow, but after a while I started to appreciate the calm way the weird story of the eel is told. Very interesting read that reminds us of our mysterious world and the role we humans play in it."
102,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16324571-africache-gastineau,4,I honestly would have not picked up this book had two friends not recommended it. I have never given much thought to eels except eels while I scuba dive. I wasn’t aware their cousins lived in rivers but also travelled in salt water. This book was a nice mix of natural history and a tribute to his father. It is not overly technical but I certainly learned something.

I also enjoyed the tone of the writing, it was easy to get into and flowed very well. There were a few spots that were repetitive, sometimes a phrase was word-by-word used a few times but it was still a very enjoyable read."

A surprising page-turner. I already know who's going to get a copy for Christmas. "
105,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30760737-james-hill,4,"Despite the title, I didn't know I had an enduring fascination with eels. Now I do. This reads more like a collection of essays. I enjoyed the ones that detail the life and research into eels more than than the sections about the author and his father's eel fishing. Still, though, it's a cohesive collection that sheds light on a a mysterious creature."
106,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/589844-pat-lampe,4,"I enjoyed this book about eels combined with the story of a boy and his dad fishing for eels. A combination of science and a coming-of-age story. Although I cringed through the life cycle of the eel, I liked the studies about it. And that discomfort was relieved by memories of his dad. A good book. . "
107,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92455418-rukesh-reddy,5,Very unique book. Half science half memoir. Mesmerizing but only if you are willing to go slow. I particularly liked the section about trying to imagine what an eel *feels*. And I learnt that Rachel Carson (silent spring) - most impactful conservationist of the 20th century - had an interest in eels too
108,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1634956-carolina,4,"Very interesting book about the life of eels, their habitat, reproduction, etc. .... and ultimate elusiveness.

113,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83900-shu,4,"Not really a science book about eels, but more of a collection of philosophical musings on all things human.

118,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12464402-roxanne,4,This is more of a memoir than a science book. One half of it is a memoir of the author and his father fishing for eels. The other half is a human history of eels and the scientists that spent their lives trying to understand the eel.While I enjoyed it I was hoping there would be more about the science side of the eel and less about people.
119,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34432933-cj-juntunen,4,"Told through both memoir and scientific data in alternating chapters, this book is an excellent example of engaging nonfiction. The more you learn about eels-and what we don't yet know about eels-the more you want to read."
120,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30525-chris-tervit,3,Nice nature stuff but not brilliant. Maybe something lost in the translation & the narrator. Rather a lot of non-fiction biology & not enough emotion in the memoir parts for me. I did learn a lot about eels. 
121,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98022360-gregg,5,Interesting and heartfelt bookThis book is as much autobiography as it is about eels. His life and his father's are intimately linked through the knowledge of fishing for them. An interesting and diFferent book

While I'm not sure whether or not to doubt much of the fiction cited (loosely used) in here, the memories and history of the eel strung by association were pretty interesting. If you like an enigma, then the eel will be a fitting muse and Patrik will not disappoint acquainting you with it."

155,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35561349-brit-griffin,5,"The Book of Eels – not at all like the Book of Kells – but compelling nonetheless. By Swedish writer Patrik Svensson, it is a natural history and meditation on the eel. They make for good subject matter, and the book covers a lot of ground: migration, killing, extinction, mystery. All the things about nature that both trouble and draw us in. And Svensson thinks in hard and interesting ways on the complex web between the eel and humans. And about the future of fishing folk and the eel, bound up with each other for generation upon generation. “An eel is never allowed to simply be an eel. It’s never allowed to just be. Thus, it has also become a symbol of our complex relationship with all other forms of life on this planet.”"
156,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30374742-bluereadsbooks,5,"Never in my life had I realized how much there is to know about eels, how their story intersects with so many parts of human history (you're going to learn about Aristotle! Freud! The Mayflower!). I found myself wanting to dive deeper into the science, to solve the eel problem myself. But Svensson gives not only that aspect, but also explores his personal connection to eels and writes lovingly about his childhood and, most importantly, his father. His prose is beautiful, and I love how he alternates between clear and rigorous science and emotion and faith. I absolutely loved The Book of Eels."
157,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54717607-littlesophie,3,"I loved Svensson's writing where it was directly concerned with eels, but his extrapolations from there to what it means to be human felt at times very forced and unsatisfactory. I felt that the eel could have been just as meaningful on its own, without wrestiling it into a sort of metaphor on the trials of being human. "
