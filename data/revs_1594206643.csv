0,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"There are 2 categories of people, conservative technophobes and neurologists, doctors, and brain scientists, who are ironically coming to a similar conclusion: having the very strong, over millions of years developed social reward and group dynamics systems condensed in a tiny machine for 24/7 use, is a dangerous and for many people life assimilating option, opening space for the ultimate misuse of a technology that could be used for education,work, and reading is instead turned in a hedonism booster.Psychologically, it´s more subtle than usual drugs with cold turkeys and the option to quit and never be confronted with it again, as social life seems to stay pretty attractive and living in a society of moderate users and junkies who obviously have no direct negative impact makes it difficult to argue and warns against it. It stigmatizes and isolates the Cassandras who will think twice before expressing doubts about the mature and intelligent use of social networks, opening themselves for the harsh criticism that just because they aren´t able to handle and control their online time, that doesn´t mean that the media itself is evil or that others have simply more willpower.People interested in staying in contact with familiy, friends, and peers face other problems, such as the duty to like back, bearing spammers and permanent posters, the permanent fight against the tempation to check social media, the loss of real-life time with humans, being a bad paragon for the own kids, being transparent for government and companies, the unclear long term effects of more and more emissions, and the question how useful the idealization and celebration of trivial and redundant small talk and superficiality may be. There would be so many social collaboration and working networks, wikis, specialized networks in general, Reddit, etc., that can help to learn new skills, specializing, and especially giving and getting knowledge and having productive communications instead of endless idiot trash talk drivel.TV was already pretty influential and lucrative, not to forget the addictive factor, but the new technology enabling everyone to tailer her/his own ultimate hobby entertainment fun feed, while pseudo actively participating and forming it and the ones of others, is just seemingly free and innocent fun. The companies don´t just sell products, but ideologies and political agendas in subtle ways, bringing new problems for democratic participation and opinion formation, using the consumer as their malleable product sold to advertisers and the dark entities in the background boo, conspiracy. Printed political ads and radio and TV campaign commercials were easy to identify, except for people hooked on getting indoctrinated and mind penetrated by bigoted demagogues, but the new league of disguised manipulation by posting fake news, documentaries and bot army troll opinions makes the electoral arms race impossible to control, especially when looking at states secretly influencing the elections in other countries. Not even mentioning the more sinister power balances and struggles inside countries shadow governments, think tanks, and camouflaged secret reptilian alien overlords. A nice bonus feature of turning human social interaction in an obsessive compulsive disorder with bipolar manic depressive disorder elements of highs for popularity and downs for feeling inferior in comparison to the splendid lives of all others, permanently happy people. I have the huge advantage of not socializing at all, but I imagine it very difficult to handle for people without strong preferences for introversion and happy self-isolation.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interne..."
1,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32532774-lisa,4,"I have to admit, the book was quite irresistible, once I got started.  I couldn't put it down. After finishing it, I had to ask myself why. There was nothing new in it. Nothing I didn't already know or experience every day with my young students. Social media and internet addiction are so widespread, they are almost normalised.What made me feel hooked to the book was rather that I recognised myself in so many of the behaviour addiction patterns. I am not addicted to Facebook or World of Warcraft, so I thought I was reading this as an ""onlooker"". But the symptoms are very similar to other compulsive behaviours, like exercise or eating disorders, or compulsive shopping. The major difference to ""traditional"" substance addiction lies in the therapy, not in the behaviour itself. One can treat drug addictions or alcoholism by encouraging abstinence, but most behaviour addictions need to be changed into controlled consumption rather than avoidance. We need technology to some extent, and learning how to control it must therefore be part of our education.This book offers an overview of some of the temptations that trigger addiction, including cliffhanger sequences, positive feedback loops and social interaction. Being knowledgeable about what happens in our brains when we engage in internet consumption is a crucial tool for prevention.I forced myself to put my smartphone in a bag for a whole Sunday without checking it while I was reading this text - and it was not as easy as I had thought. Nomophobia (no mobile phobia) therapy does not sound as outlandish to me anymore as it did before I tried living for a day without it myself. There is shock value in realising just how much time I spend staring into a small screen. For me, the most important lesson from reading Irresistible is to always question my urge to ""check the phone"" quickly to feed my need for positive feedback. Regulating oneself before the technology becomes overpowering and harmful - that is the way forwards for healthy technology/internet consumption.And it is amazing how much time it frees up to ignore the 24/7 flood of messages.Recommended to all of us, living between real and virtual worlds."
2,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,3,"Take it with a huge grain of salt. There are some fun cocktail-party facts and some reasonable suggestions for changing your own habits, which are fine as ""hey, why not try it, it might work for you.""It's just not much good as ""scientific evidence proves that...""[For example: Experimental group improved by a ""dramatic"" 40%, but control group improved by only a ""paltry"" 30%! ... which actually meant that group A improved by 5 points out of 50, and B by 3 points out of 50! ... which is probably a statistical fluke, and even if not, it's certainly not a scientifically interesting difference! Argh.]Also, it's kinda funny that most of the book warns against the dangers of overusing artificial metrics. Then, the last chapter suggests fixing our problems with gamification... i.e. artificial over-reliance on metrics.But again, good fodder for suggesting new approaches. I'd like to apply a couple of these ideas in my teaching, if I can figure out how.Fun facts:* Steve Jobs and other tech titans don't allow their kids to play with the same tech (iPads etc) that they push on everyone else.* Relief vs. reward: addictions involve positive reinforcement (a reward you'll enjoy if you do X), while obsessions and compulsions involve negative reinforcement (if you do X, you'll be relieved of the pressure to do it). Personally I think a lot of marketing etc. is more about relief than reward: it's not that you'll actually *enjoy* having this new product, but rather that you'll buy it to *stop feeling bad* that other people have it and you don't. Same with trying to ""get the complete set"" or rack up all the points in a game: it's not that *having* 100% completion is fun, but that *not having* it feels bad.* Check out the Internet Addiction Test. Many items seem harmless alone, but it's disconcerting once you see how many of them stack up.* ""Addiction"" originally meant becoming a slave to work off a debt you can't pay, back in ancient Rome. Only later did it mean other kinds of tough-to-break bonds.* Addictions are strongly tied to the setting/context/environment, not just the behavior itself. Scientists caused a caged monkey to get addicted to pressing a bar; it returned to behaving like a normal monkey when it ""detoxed"" outside the cage; but when put back it, it'd return to the frantic addictive behavior. So... put physical and psychological distance between yourself and the original setting when you try to break an addictive behavior.* Addictions could be thought of as a hijacking of brain systems meant for good purposes: we've evolved ways to persist in difficult-but-important things (like raising kids), but sometimes these mental systems end up helping us persist in bad things instead.* Adolescence and early adulthood are high-risk periods for addiction: young folks have many new responsibilities but haven't yet built up the coping skills, social support networks, and other healthy ways to deal with hardships. So, try to help your kids build resilience before and during the teen years.* Wanting vs liking (perhaps related to relief vs reward?): It's easy to disrupt ""liking"" an addictive behavior, but once the ""want"" is established it is MUCH harder to disrupt. You can crave something, even if you don't enjoy it when you have it.* ""Don't break the streak"" is a nice motivator---until you overdo it, like runners who try to keep up an unbroken streak of running every day for decades, even when they're sick or injured. The longer your streak, the more willing you are to go to extremes to keep it up. (I wonder: What if these runners didn't reward themselves for unbroken streaks longer than, say, a month? After a month, you start on the next 1-month streak, and just try to rack up many months, whether or not they are continuous. Then if you're sick, no worries, you can take a needed rest day, because it won't break your score by too much...) Also, games like FarmVille apparently use this streak-mentality to make money: if you miss a day, you can pay them (real money) to ""revert the damage"" to the crops you didn't water yesterday or whatever. So, they feed an unhealthy obsession *and* make money off of you: truly predatory!* The Dollar Auction Game: a brilliant little trick. Sounds like it'd be fun to expose my statistician colleagues to this and see what happens. Also apparently a good way to raise money for charity if you bid off something larger like $20 instead.* The Zone of Proximal Development: things you can't do at all are too hard; things you can do alone may be boring; but you learn a lot on the things you can just barely do with a little bit of help. Similar to the state of Flow, when your skill level is appropriate for the task's challenge level. (Right now, my PhD thesis is *not* in either of these states :P but I hope to get back in there soon!) One problem is that games, email, and other electronic distractions are designed to keep you in flow... so, one solution is to disrupt that flow artificially. Use old hardware which makes the experience slow and clunky. Don't keep your smartphone handy at all times. [Are there other suggestions out there?]* Near-wins can be more addictive than genuine wins. In a game of skill, near-wins do legitimately signal that you're almost there, you can nearly do it, just try a little harder next time! But games of luck hijack this too and suck us into spending more time on something useless or harmful (like casino games or lotteries designed to give results that look *almost* like a win. You think to yourself: I got 4 in a row and would have won if it'd just had that 5th one---let me try again!)* Sometimes the hard problem isn't knowing how to start, but how *not to stop.* When you want to build a new habit like regular exercise or healthier eating, it's easy enough to do it for one day, but what are your (unconscious) ""stopping rules"" that make you fall off the bandwagon? (No good answers here, sadly.)* The Zeigarnik Effect: people hate cliffhangers, and they'll better remember unresolved tasks than resolved ones. (See for example the vitriol around the waiting times between Game Of Thrones books...) I wonder: Could we use the Zeigarnik Effect in teaching/education somehow? Assign in-class problems near the end of lecture, and *don't* allow quite enough time to finish, with the hope that the students will mull over the problem outside of class?* Catherine Steiner-Adair's work on parenting: Don't be scary (rigid), crazy (overreacting), or clueless (about your kids' lives, modern tech, etc.)* Self-determination theory: focuses on 3 basic human needs, for autonomy (I'm in control of my own life), competence (I can overcome external challenges and experience mastery), and relatedness (bonds with family & friends). (Again, the process of getting a PhD really dampens down all 3 of these needs a lot of time :P ...)* Don't try to *drop* old bad habits, but *replace* them with better new ones. (So what are some good examples? Not many actual suggestions here.) Or, when resisting something, instead of saying you *can't* do it, say you *don't*: you're not playing the martyr who is forbidden by external forces, but the autonomous person of integrity who chose to take this stand.* Daimler's office emails are set to delete when the employee is on vacation, with an auto-reply message suggesting someone else who can help if the email is urgent. That sounds lovely, but also requires the whole company to buy-in; you'd probably just alienate everyone if you try this alone...* ""Don't Waste Your Money motivator"": set your goal and set aside money every week as you work towards it. If you fail, donate the money to someplace you don't support: an opposing political party or a frivolous cause. But if you succeed, take the money out and spend it ""relationally""---a meal with friends, a gift for family, etc.---as a double-benefit reward.* Planning fallacy: When wondering whether to take up a new activity, ask yourself if you can afford to do it *today*. We tend to overestimate how much time we can free up later, but we're better if we extrapolate from the amount of time we have today.* Just Press Play: gamified educational environment. Sounds like it's not just gamifying specific computerized tasks, like assigning points and badges for online math exercises... but rather, the offline experience is gamified too, and in particular there are collaborative aspects. There's a ""quest"" which promises a reward to the entire freshman class if over 90% of them pass a certain difficult required course... so they found students were motivated to help each other, even getting help from junior and senior students. Maybe it's worth trying to gamify useful study habits like this.Quotes:* p.3: ""According to Tristan Harris, a 'design ethicist,' the problem isn't that people lack willpower; it's that 'there are a thousand people on the other side of the screen whose job it is to break down the self-regulation you have.'""* p.40, 229, 232, 243: several takes on the idea that kids learn empathy, understanding, and other parts of human interaction by interacting face-to-face. It can be much harder to learn these things when you interact so much by texting, posting on Facebook, etc.---you don't immediately see the impact that your words have on another person.* p.106: ""...it's hard not to wonder whether major life goals are by their nature a major source of frustration. Either you endure the anti-climax of succeeding, or you endure the disappointment of failing."" Even people who reach incredible successes (like breaking a world record in sports) don't savor the success---they just want to move on to the next goal.* p.114: ""Counting steps and calories doesn't actually help us lose weight; it just makes us more compulsive. We become less intuitive about our physical activity and eating."" (quote from Leslie Sim)* p.117: ""When you approach life as a sequence of milestones to be achieved, you exist 'in a state of near-continuous failure.' Almost all the time, by definition, you're not at the place you've defined as embodying accomplishment or success. And should you get there, you'll find you've lost the very thing that gave you a sense of purpose---so you'll formulate a new goal and start again."" (quote by Oliver Burkeman, partly quoting Scott Adams) ... I worry this applies to tenure in academia. I know some folks who sacrificed a lot because they *felt driven* to reach tenure; but in the end, they don't actually *savor the accomplishment* of being tenured. When are those sacrifices worthwhile? Apparently Adams suggests replacing major goals (you get there or you don't) with ""systems,"" i.e. ""something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run."" For him it's creating something small on a daily basis, like a daily cartooning or writing session: ""a steadier stream of low-grade highs... guides to a fulfilling life, day by day..."" For me, this sounds like my project to read one of my grandpa's philosophy books each year---it's about the journey of *reading* itself, not about the destination of *having read* them all.* p.229: ""Remember: once your cucumber brain has become pickled, it can never go back to being a cucumber."" (quote from Hilarie Cash) ... Once you've been addicted and treated, you can't ""have just one more"" (smoke just one more cigarette, play just one more game of WoW) without massive risk of total relapse. Treatment doesn't erase the addiction and give you a fresh start, allowing moderation; it's most helpful if you avoid the bad thing completely."

Can you imagine the outcry if religious leaders refused to let their children practice religion? Many experts both within and beyond the world of tech have shared similar perspectives with me. Several video game designers told me they avoided the notoriously addictive game World of Warcraft; an exercise addiction psychologist called fitness watches dangerous—“the dumbest things in the world”—and swore she’d never buy one; and the founder of an Internet addiction clinic told me she avoids gadgets newer than three years old. She has never used her phone’s ringer, and deliberately “misplaces” her phone so she isn’t tempted to check her email. (I spent two months trying to reach her by email, and succeeded only when she happened to pick up her office landline.) Her favorite computer game is Myst, released in 1993 when computers were still too clunky to handle video graphics. The only reason she was willing to play Myst, she told me, was because her computer froze every half hour and took forever to reboot. (c)Q: Instagram, like so many other social media platforms, is bottomless. Facebook has an endless feed; Netflix automatically moves on to the next episode in a series; Tinder encourages users to keep swiping in search of a better option. Users benefit from these apps and websites, but also struggle to use them in moderation. According to Tristan Harris, a “design ethicist,” the problem isn’t that people lack willpower; it’s that “there are a thousand people on the other side of the screen whose job it is to break down the self-regulation you have.” (c)Q: In a 1990 editorial in the British Journal of Addiction, a psychiatrist named Isaac Marks claimed that, “Life is a series of addictions and without them we die. (c)Q: Addiction, to Peele, is “an extreme, dysfunctional attachment to an experience that is acutely harmful to a person, but that is an essential part of the person’s ecology and that the person cannot relinquish.” (c)Q: In 1984, Alexey Pajitnov was working at a computer lab at the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow. Many of the lab’s scientists worked on side projects, and Pajitnov began working on a video game. The game borrowed from tennis and a version of four-piece dominoes called tetrominoes, so Pajitnov combined those words to form the name Tetris. Pajitnov worked on Tetris for much longer than he planned because he couldn’t stop playing the game...One satisfying feature of the game is the sense that you’re building something—that your efforts produce a pleasing tower of colored bricks. “You have the chaos coming as random pieces, and your job is to put them in order,” Pajitnov said. “But just as you construct the perfect line, it disappears. All that remains is what you fail to complete.” Mikhail Kulagin, Pajitnov’s friend and a fellow programmer, remembers feeling a strong drive to fix his mistakes. “Tetris is a game with a very strong negative motivation. You never see what you have done very well, and your mistakes are seen on the screen. And you always want to correct them.” Pajitnov agreed. “What hits your eyes are your ugly mistakes. And that drives you to fix them all the time.” The game allows you the brief thrill of seeing your completed lines flash before they disappear, leaving only your mistakes. So you begin again, and try to complete another line as the game speeds up and your fingers are forced to dance across the controls more quickly.Pajitnov and Kulagin were driven by this sense of mastery, which turns out to be deeply motivating. (c)Q: Other studies have shown that we’re also driven to build more Legos when the completed products—the fruits of our Lego-building labor—are stacked up in front of us, rather than removed as soon as they’re completed.  The sense of creating something that requires labor and effort and expertise is a major force behind addictive acts that might otherwise lose their sheen over time. It also highlights an insidious difference between substance addiction and behavioral addiction: where substance addictions are nakedly destructive, many behavioral addictions are quietly destructive acts wrapped in cloaks of creation. The illusion of progress will sustain you as you achieve high scores or acquire more followers or spend more time at work, and so you’ll struggle ever harder to shake the need to continue. (c)Q: During the 1990s, psychologist Paco Underhill famously watched thousands of hours of retail store security camera footage. The cameras captured all sorts of shopping behavior, most of it mundane but some of it interesting and useful to the store owners who asked Underhill for help. One of Underhill’s most famous observations was the so-called butt-brush effect. In cluttered stores, where merchandise racks are placed only a few feet apart, customers are forced to squeeze past one another. Underhill’s footage captured hundreds of these unintentional butt-brushes, and he noticed an interesting pattern of behavior: as soon as women, and to a lesser extent men, were brushed, they tended to stop browsing and often left the store empty-handed. Butt-brushes were costing stores a lot of money, so he sent a team to investigate why. Were customers abandoning the store as an act of protest? Were they disgusted by the idea of touching a stranger? In fact, customers had absolutely no idea they were reacting to butt-brushes at all. They acknowledged leaving the store, but almost always said it had nothing to do with the presence of other shoppers. Sometimes they cobbled together good reasons for leaving—they were late for a meeting or needed to collect their kids from school—but the pattern was just too strong to deny. What Underhill had identified was a stopping rule—a cue that guided customers to stop shopping. The rule wasn’t something those customers could explain, but it was there, guiding their behavior all the same. (c)Q: Zeigarnik’s career took off eventually, but her academic life was just as turbulent as her personal life. She was forced to write three doctoral dissertations after the Soviet authorities refused to recognize her first dissertation, and her second was stolen. She had copies of the second dissertation, but was forced to destroy them when she feared that the thief might publish her work and accuse her of plagiarism. For almost thirty years, Zeigarnik wandered in academic purgatory before completing her third dissertation and joining Moscow State University as a psychology professor in 1965. She was elected chair of the department two years later, and held that position for the next two decades, until her death. With mountainous talent and dogged determination, Zeigarnik ensured that the cliffhanger ultimately resolved in her favor. (c)Q: “A few years ago, I hired a girl to slap me in the face every time I went on Facebook.” That worked well, for a while, ... (c)Q: When you set your emails to auto-delete or your office to disappear, you’re acknowledging that you’re a different person when you’re tempted to check your email or work late. You may be an adult now, but this future version of you is more like a child. The best way to wrest control from your childish future self is to act while you’re still an adult—to design a world that coaxes, cajoles, or even compels your future-self to do the right thing. An alarm clock called SnŪzNLŪz illustrates this idea beautifully. SnŪzNLŪz is wirelessly connected to your bank account. Every time you hit the snooze button, it automatically deducts a preset sum and donates it to a charity you abhor. Support the Democratic Party? Hit snooze and you’ll donate ten dollars to the G.O.P. Support the Republican Party, and you’ll donate to the Democratic Party. These donations are your present self’s way of keeping your future self in line. (c)Q: Behavioral architecture acknowledges that you can’t avoid temptation completely. Instead of abstinence and avoidance, many solutions come in the form of tools designed to blunt the psychological immediacy of addictive experiences. Benjamin Grosser, a web developer, devised one of these clever tools. Grosser explains on his website:The Facebook interface is filled with numbers. These numbers, or metrics, measure and present our social value and activity, enumerating friends, likes, comments, and more. Facebook Demetricator is a web browser add-on that hides these metrics. No longer is the focus on how many friends you have or on how much they like your status, but on who they are and what they said. Friend counts disappear. “16 people like this” becomes “people like this.” Through changes like these, Demetricator invites Facebook’s users to try the system without the numbers, to see how their experience is changed by their absence. With this work I aim to disrupt the prescribed sociality these metrics produce, enabling a network society that isn’t dependent on quantification. (c)Q: People flock when you turn a mundane experience into a game. (c)Q: There are two ways to approach behavioral addictions: eliminate them or harness them. Elimination was the subject of the first eleven chapters of Irresistible, but—just as DDB did in Stockholm—it’s possible to channel the forces that drive harmful behavioral addiction for the good. The human tendencies that enslave us to smartphones, tablets, and video games also prepare us to do good: to eat better, exercise more, work smarter, behave more generously, and save more money. To be sure, there’s a fine line between behavioral addictions and helpful habits, and it’s important to keep that line in mind. The same Fitbit that fuels exercise addiction and eating disorders in some people pushes others to leave the couch behind during an hour of exercise. Addictive levers work by boosting motivation, so if your motivation is already high there’s a good chance those levers will compromise your well-being. If you’re a couch potato who hates to exercise, a dose of motivation can only help. (c)"
4,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2103966-canadian-reader,2,"I read as far as the fifth chapter in Alter's book and learned a few interesting things along the way. However, based on what I did read, I found the book's subtitle inaccurate. Huge amounts of the first four chapters are dedicated to substance and behavioural addictions, in general, not ""addictive technology"" per se. There was interesting information about the importance of context or environment in addiction. Alter provides the example of veterans of the Vietnam war, many of whom used heroin while overseas but who did not return to the U.S. addicted, as they had now been removed from the context, conditions, and associations in which the drug use occurred. There was also some interesting material about behaviours (including repetitive actions known scientifically as ""stereotypies"") that accompany methamphetamine addictions and dopamine medications prescribed for Parkinson's disease. Some Parkinson's patients actually hoard their meds and even up their doses to ride on the wave of euphoria.Alter writes well enough, mercifully resisting the temptation to describe the appearance or some idiosyncratic tic of the researchers he alludes to or quotes (so common in science and social science writing for a lay audience). He also refrains from supplying the often unnecessary ""comic relief""used to jolly along nonfiction readers with short attention spans. In spite of the reasonably good writing, however, I just lost interest in the material. A fair bit of it I'd encountered before in other books or magazine feature articles, and when I got to a section about slot machines, my eyes were glazing over. I've never played the slots, so reading about them seemed like a very dull prospect.For me, the take away was that tech designers spend huge amounts of time and money to make users find devices irresistible. Many of these designers don't use the products they or their companies design or produce. They are well aware of the addictive potential in their creations. That being the case, they often set very strict limits on their children's use of technology."

6,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44176428-atjg,0,"This is a gutless book.Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked purports to be an examination of contemporary media and their addictive qualities, yet very few of these pages explore any such ground. Rather, Alter parades psychological experiment after psychological experiment after psychological experiment, one after another, again and again, mice pressing levers to receive the orgasm drug, pigeons pecking buttons for food pellets, kittens kept in dark rooms before being put in cylinders with stripy patterns, and so on. The reader it seems, is left to draw her own conclusions.Each time one of these laboratory escapades comes close to being compelling in the context of digital media, Alter swerves away, as if it was his mission to avoid saying anything the least bit original or interesting. The worst instance is with the (very brief) discussion of pornography. In 320 pages of text--about addictive tech, remember--pornography is allocated exactly two pages. And what's worse is these two pages serve only to prop up a half-baked rehash of Freudian theories of repression, in this case, about inhabitants of States of conservative persuasion being more inclined to open their browser for purposes of self-abuse than the good people of, say, Vermont. No mention whatsoever of the modern malaise resultant from constant and early exposure to literally anything you want. No mention of the ways addiction to pornography can compound addiction to digital technology. No mention of the tension between cerebral attempts at self-control and the reptilian brain stem and its unceasing demands. Instead, we merely get the banal (and predictable) observation that societal repression creates urgent needs for release.Any discussion of violence and its appeal is totally absent. Alter discusses video game addiction, but only Tetris and World of Warcraft, and in the latter case, the mechanism of addiction is left untouched in favor of a tedious gloss of one individual's tendency to draw the blinds, give up all efforts to maintain personal hygiene, and play WoW for months on end. One wonders why Alter didn't here turn again to Freud and explore video games as an outlet for aggression. Indeed, leaving both sex and violence as aspects in digital technology addiction unexplored is unforgivable.But, I have to concede, perhaps it's me who's the fool. I did, after all, go into this book looking for an intensive examination of where the hands have come to on the clock, and instead I got a pretty lousy pop-psychology book that offered little of value. I guess the blurb by Malcolm Gladwell on the cover should have given me a clue. But it's over now. /rant"

I would change the subtitle to “The Rise of Behavioral Addiction in the Digital Age,” which more accurately describes the book’s contents. It is not all about screens – the author discusses exercise addiction frequently – and it is in no way an exposé of the tech industry, as the actual subtitle might lead you to believe. Rather than focusing on how companies suck people into their products, the author is focused on the nature of behavioral addiction itself, how it affects people, and the aspects of technology that most readily create addiction.The book starts off by discussing behavioral addiction generally, whether it’s an addiction to email, social media, gaming, gambling, or exercise. Like chemical addiction, this is often something that fills a hole in a person’s life, and that the person comes to depend on to feel good (if the addiction is the only thing that causes the person’s brain to produce dopamine anymore) but that ultimately is detrimental to his or her life. The author then moves on to discuss elements that can make technology addictive:1)	Goals: Technology creates goals for us that we might not have formulated on our own, like walking a certain number of steps per day. This is especially true of exercise addictions. One dangerous idea is the Running Streak Association, which celebrates people who have run every day for a period of time (as in years or decades): people who didn’t want to lose their streak have gone so far as to run while the eye of a hurricane was passing over, or while injured or even in the hospital for a C-section.2)	Feedback: Games tell you how you’re doing and how close you are to your goals; when you post on social media or message boards, you can track how many people liked your post.3)	Progress: The author talks about the illusion of near wins and the fear of losing, but it seems to me that the illusion of actually accomplishing something is an especially addictive aspect to games and some social media, particularly for people who feel like they’re just spinning their wheels at work or otherwise.4)	Escalation: This is especially true of games; the game gets harder and you get better at it.5)	Cliffhangers: Discussed in the context of Netflix binges; people don’t like unfinished stories and loose ends. In fact, a story sticks out far more in our memories if we don’t hear the end.6)	Social interaction: Keeps people on social media, and playing social games like World of Warcraft.All good to be aware of, but the book’s message tends to get a little muddled. The author talks about “the addict in all of us” and how the average office email sits unread in the recipient’s inbox only 6 seconds, but then writes at length about a World of Warcraft addict who played 20 hours a day for 5 weeks straight before committing himself to a detox clinic. Detailing such extreme examples tends to make everyday overuse seem like not such a big deal, and repeatedly returning to the clinic and its methodology throughout the book isn’t especially useful for people whose technology dependence doesn't rise to the level of requiring a residential treatment program. Wearable fitness devices are criticized throughout the book for promoting addiction (an exercise addiction psychologist, who unsurprisingly sees the people who are damaged by them, is quoted as saying no one should use wearables ever). Then in the final pages the author acknowledges that a device meant to increase motivation to exercise is likely to be helpful for those who need motivation, though potentially dangerous to those who are already motivated. Given that according to his numbers that 61-67% of Americans, Brits, Germans, Australians and others are overweight, perhaps he shouldn’t have slammed the fitbits quite so hard.But suddenly in the last chapter gamification is presented as a solution to everything, when the entire preceding book was about why game addiction is bad. Sure, FreeRice promotes learning and donates ad revenue to feed the hungry, but it’s still a virtual game that creates artificial goals and uses progress and escalation to keep people hooked. Suddenly that’s okay if it’s for a good cause? I thought the point was that we were supposed to try to disconnect and focus on more meaningful things? What is the point, exactly? There isn’t a cohesive thesis here so much as a variety of interviews, studies and observations around a general theme.Still, that doesn’t necessarily make a bad book; it’s informative though lightweight and sometimes confused in its presentation. If nothing else, it will probably make you reflect on the role of technology in your life, which is a good thing to check in on every now and then."

I wanted to read this book because recently I have been trying to step away from my phone more and be off the internet more because I have found it to stress me out. I recently deleted Instagram, which is the only social media I had. It is a decision that I have not regretted for a moment. I thought this book may help me flesh out ideas of why being on the internet and being on social media was so stressful for me. This book did help with that by covering a broad range of topics under the umbrella of behavioral addiction. It focused a little more on gaming that I would have liked just because I don't play really any sort of video game. I wish there had been a bit more focus on social media behavior because that is what I have found most addiction when it comes to technology. I also really liked the section on raising children because its a topic I think about a lot when think about my childhood and how important offline play was for my growth and how different it might be growing up today. I do wish the author had acknowledged a bit more how hard it is socially to be disconnected for days at a time. It was brought up how ubiquitous technology is but people who took days to answer emails or phone calls were spoken of fondly without the author ever really acknowledging that not everyone's job allows them to disconnect like that. Many jobs have a requirement that emails are responded to within 24 hours so many people cannot afford to just turn off email notifications. I think it would have been good to acknowledge that unplugging like that can be the hardest for the people making the least amount of money and the people who can least afford to lose their job over a missed phone call or unanswered email. I think if this is a topic you're interested in, I would recommend this book. It isn't overly preachy about the dangerous of technology and it doesn't tell you never to use your phone. Not all the information was new to me but this book does help to flesh out how technology has been designed to become more and more addictive and how users are studied to make it a product as addictive as possible.Also! not about this book but I've now read 15 books in January! I'm particularly excited about this because last year I read 30 books the whole year and right now I'm already halfway to that in just one month. Even though I think this will slow down now that I'm back in school I'm hoping to read many more books this year and I hope I will enjoy a lot of them!"

Irresistible was so informative, providing a great context for the world we live in and the one we're on our way to living in. I so appreciate having the curtain pulled back on behavioral addiction, especially how it relates to social media, gaming, and virtual reality. I feel like I can make better decisions for myself and kids regarding technology, preparing them for the future, as well as instilling values in them that will help them navigate a world filled with people who are more and more disconnected from themselves and each other. Overall a worthwhile read. The question for me is: what do we do now that we know how the sausage is made?"
12,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2450538-louise,4,"This was a really great read from the library. The beginning was slow because it goes into the history of addiction from a psychology perspective, but it picked up a quarter of the way in. As someone who has a love/hate relationship with technology, I could relate to the addictiveness of devices and apps. I enjoyed the origin stories of some of the most addictive games and apps, as well as some of the experiments described.Even though I try to stay away from pop-psychology books and I thought this would be in the same vein, I was pleasantly surprised at how informative this one was. I couldn't help feeling paranoid about if the author employed any of the tactics he researched to make this book more addictive to read."

But this beauty really entertained me with some astounding data and a focussed extrapolation of what might become of us if we continue. 'Man's evolution has been hand-in-hand with it's desire to be lazy' - this is a depressing yet awakening fact that we need to realize. As much as people might misuse, abuse or overuse the term 'innovation', it is just a fancy word for us spending less energy to get something done. And our relentless attempt at it, might be the ruin of us.What this book helped me with - habits that has reduced my online time drastically. For example - 1. I have allotted thinking times during which my phone and laptop automatically switch off (IFTTT rocks). 2. I now sleep with my phone in the drawing room and instead take my kindle with me. 3. I have a porn blocker which i haven't disabled for over two weeks.4. I now have started reading less listicles and more essays.5. And the best of them all, I have developed a habit to run. Now all this are a result of my reflection on using products that were made to hook me. It raised the question of rethinking my own set of ethics when I design a product or feature of a product which is often the last thing startups think about - success metrics in companies are now ones like Minutes on Page, Conversion, Retention, etc, which, cumulatively, is just distracting the customer.So if you are someone who ever has, is or planning to make a product for consumers - do give this book a read.

15,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3465458-squibart,4,"Think about this: The people who create the devices do not let their children play them. The people who create the games we love get addicted to playing them. Our brains betray us everyday by allowing big businesses to use us like rats in a maze to get rich. If those ideas concern you, then read this book. This book was well written and interesting. I appreciated how the author added many interesting tidbits about games, the people who created them, and some history about how they were created. Often this type of book is only read by the people who live with someone that may need help for an addiction, but not the person with the issue themselves. After all, who wants to read a preachy book just pointing out all your faults that tells you to change? However, the way the author put this together I can see gamers actually liking this book especially if they enjoy Tetris, world of Warcraft, or Nintendo. Anyone who likes to read about psychology and behavioral tendencies will also enjoy this. The human mind is a trap in itself and it's fascinating to see how we are all really wired to respond in similar ways. I felt the ending of this book was weak as the author seemed unwilling to commit to any type of of true belief about gaming one way or another. After all the information that it provided, I found that disappointing because if I did have a gaming issue I now just got permission to take it less seriously. I do think this is another good read for parents as it gives good reasons for keeping devices out of little hands."

18,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9682437-kelly,4,"Note: the author is a friend and former colleague. 4.5 stars. Like Alter, I study the psychology of human decision making (I'm getting a PhD; I went to undergrad where and when Alter got his PhD, which is how we know each other). The further I get into my studies, the harder of a time I have reviewing popular treatments of the field, because so much of the research presented is often review for me. That's less the case here than with other popular psych books I've read recently, though, because I haven't studied addictions very much and am not very well versed in technology. So this was in some ways a refreshing change for me, a pop-psych book where I was learning right along with the lay audience. Alter makes a compelling and sobering case for the ubiquity of at least mild technology addiction, situating the conversation within the broader field of behavioral addiction. There's some nicely-presented, concise history of addictions both chemical and behavioral to set the scene. The technology-specific parts focus mostly on games (with which Alter candidly discusses his own past problems, as well as movingly portraying others' struggles), social media, and shopping. The science is solid and informative, but there's also a somewhat unusual (for a book by an academic, not for pop-psych writers generally) amount of practical advice. As someone with an admitted smartphone use problem (even with that admission, the statistics in this book were sobering and forced me to admit the problem was worse than I thought), I really appreciated the recommendations (the tracking app he mentions, Moment, has already helped me make some positive changes after just a week). I'm reevaluating the way I look at games and apps, and will keep my eyes open in future for ones that seem to foster addictive behavior. Though this and other subjects are heavy, Alter also takes care to include some light, amusing or positive examples. For example, while learning what might make games addictive, I also learned more detail about, and developed more appreciation for, what makes a game good and immersive. The section on gamification for positive purposes was also an antidote to some of the gloom in the book, but I think including some more examples of harnessing ""addiction "" for good throughout the book, rather than just at the end might have helped attenuate the flashes of overly dramatic tone that sometimes popped up (mostly I thought the tone was appropriate given the subject matter). In addition to the sometimes top-dramatic tone, my main problem with the book was organizational. Alter's first book, DRUNK TANK PINK, was great in terms of signposting things, asking one or two questions at the end of each chapter that would be answered in the next one, etc. This book is not quite as well or intuitively organized. This is probably because there are so many different topics, and historical information about each.Apart from these minor issues, I thought the book was great, both informative about the general issues of technology and behavioral addiction (and, to a lesser extent, addiction in general and technology in general) and full of great suggestions for dealing with technology, without coming across as too preachy or too much like a stereotypical self-help book. Even apart from knowing the author, I'm really glad to have read this book, because I learned a lot of interesting information and some really helpful things as well. Format note: I listened to the Audible audiobook, which Alter narrates. He does a very good job (much better than most authors who try to read their own work) and I highly recommend listening. It doesn't seem from the text like there are many things in the print book that you'd miss (e.g., pictures, charts or graphs)."

Irresistible explores the concept of behavioral addiction defined as a dysfunctional attachment to an experience that is harmful and that a person cannot extinguish.  I learned some cultural facts in this book.  Examples are the genius of the ""Like"" button on Facebook. Did you know that slot machines are the premier addiction delivery service? Who would believe that Kim Kardashian has ""earned"" tens of millions of dollars from her video game Hollywood? There is even a whole page devoted to the force behind the addictive popularity of Earth, Wind and Fire's 1978 hit record - September.  There is even a term- gamification that describes the rapidly expanding practice of morphing health practices, or even lawn mowing services into quasi games where the user earns points , badges, and levels.  Less you think that this is overstating the case, consider the fact that we're all in the game right now. Our salaries, seniority and promotions are only points, levels, and badges in disguise.  At least outright gaming calls it like it is.  Nevertheless, this is a must read. The book inspired me to I install an app on my phone that lets me track my phone usage. So far, I have it down to just 2 hours and 45 minutes a day. I'm gaining back my life, but I am also hooked. "

There are a lot of interesting points made in this novel and well as some great discussion had on how this is a problem today, and what we can do about it. I personally feel motivated to change some of my own behaviours in regards to technology after reading this, and I really do feel that that is the major benefit of reading this novel.

22,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,3,"Originally reviewed at The Book Wheel.Like most people I have a love/hate relationship with technology. I love waking up in the mornings and checking my Twitter feed and the news but I hate how the distraction can make me run late. I love the satisfaction of hitting my step goals but I hate that I feel compelled to log what I eat. I love being connected to other people but I hate the guilt that comes with not responding to something right away. These situations are not unique to me but that doesn’t mean it has any less of a personal impact. Technology, for all of its benefits, has a lot of drawbacks which have been studied more and more over the past several years. Parents who live a distracted life tend to foster that distraction in their own children. Always looking for the next like or favorite on social media can impact self-esteem. And let’s not forget that screen time can interfere with concentration, productivity, and even our sleep. We know these things, yet we continue to incorporate more and more technology into our lives, myself included. So why do we do it?Irresistible by Adam Alter takes a fresh look at how technology impacts our daily lives and why we let it happen. While he covers the more popular subjects that were mentioned above, he also delves into the psychology and biology behind our obsession and how anyone can fall victim to it. Using approachable and practical examples that everyone can relate to, Alter analyzes how outside forces and our own biology help foster the love/hate relationship. From games and apps designed to keep us hooked to the constant elevated heart rate that checking our work emails creates, he covers the spectrum of our obsession and shines a light in how even the most self-aware user often ignores the warning signs. There are plenty of articles online about how to step away from the Internet and connectivity, but doing so can do a lot more for your health than just improve your state of mind. For example, the average person checks their work email 36 times an hour and opens it within six seconds. What does this mean for productivity when it takes up to 25 minutes to get back to productivity in the first place? Imagine what we could accomplish if we just turned our notifications off.And what about wearables? After reading this book, I stopped wearing my FitBit because I realized I would pace my house at 11 PM in order to hit my step goals. It was tough at first because I like accomplishing things and those little green stars are very rewarding, but in hindsight I see how it was interfering with my sleep because I was elevating my heart rate before going to bed. Technology is amazing, and Alter does not advocate for giving it up, rather using it more responsibly and being aware of how you, personally, react to it. If you find yourself ignoring your own health for the benefit of a step goal, then it’s time to step away. If you find yourself ignoring your children because you want to check Facebook, then it’s time to step away. The repercussions of not doing so go far beyond our personal mental well-being and can impact our health, our relationships, and more. So while I may not be giving up my cell phone anytime soon, I am taking steps to rely on it less. After all, my health relies on it."

29,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"There is a reason that Silicon Valley CEOs restrict their kids to use technologies they invented. As a mother and an engineer who makes money by building (hopefully) addictive software, I know perfectly well what that reason is.This book is a summary of what and how modern technologies fuel addictive behaviour. We are in an epidemic behaviour addiction—Internet, gaming, gambling, shopping, fitness addiction, eating disorder, work addiction—you name it. Any activity can become addictive. It will only get worse— think VR, which is what called the potential legal heroin by the author.The book starts with basics of how addiction works. Behaviour addiction works the same way as substance abuse. I have read other books about addiction, so this part is not new to me. Addictive behaviours take advantages of the same pleasure centre and reward system of the brain. Behind addiction there is always unfulfilled psychological needs, and the mind learns to associate the behaviour in question with the stress release. Addiction is a social issue and a medical issue. The second part of the book is analysis of several behaviour addictions and why they are addictive by human design. This is the most interesting part. Topics covered are:1. Gambling: why gamblers hard to quit? Why slot machine is addictive?2. Video games: how popular games are designed to make players keep playing, and the human psychology behind the game design. Games analysed: Super Mario, World of Warcraft, Tetris, Kardashian Hollywood, Mobile games such as FarmVille, candy crush3. Shopping addiction: online flash sale business model (Gilt)4. Penny auction site, which is a mixture of shopping and gambling5. Social Media addiction: facebook’s like button6. Why Netfix’s autoplay leads to binge watching7. Why wearable fitness device lead to fitness addictionSome insights: 1. Ludic loop in gaming is addictive because it gives you reward once in a while2. Near win is always better than win in motivation; it makes players continue in order to ease the disappointment. When rewards unpredictable, players enjoy them more3. Video game design: constant small rewards; easy to start; music to make you continue; gradual increase of difficulties, and the art of finding the sweet spot of the best difficulties: not too easy so you get bored, not to difficult so you get frustrated.4. Tension created by not finishing a task makes you want more5. Our brain is wired to seek shortcut and the easy way out, therefore the importance of asking the right question: opt in or opt out?6. Goal setting: goals are important drive in motivation; however, using arbitrary number as goals can lead to the forgetting of the the reason of goals.The author answered the question of why social media is harmful to kids: Danger of social media addiction is not what it can provide, but what it can not provide: face to face communication, the ability to deep connect with a real person in real time. Social media is only a shallow version of real world socialisation. It stops children to learn from reading each other’s facial clues, clues from the tones and body language. Even video conference can’t be the same. Nothing wrong with making friends online, as long as you also make friends offline.In Part 3 the author offers some solutions to the ever growing problem of behaviour addiction. I am disappointed that available solutions are very limited, but that’s the situation we are in now. The best option we have is to delay the introduction of smartphones and limit the usage of internet and gaming in kids. How lame! The author mentioned a clinic named reSTART in Seattle that treat internet addiction.  The author also discussed the pros and cons of Gamification in education. We can’t go back to the age before Internet, before Google, and before smart phones, or can we?Two things I disagree with the author:1. The so-called Internet Addiction Treatment camps in China are notorious, where adolescents are held against their will and are forced to go through shock therapy, military style trainings and physical tortures. The author visited one of such centres in Beijing. He generally disagreed with such treatments, but he did not condemn the practice.2. Whether our risk seeking genes came from Neanderthals is debatable."
30,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,2,"We all know the general principles of this. Ever since we started monitoring our kids' TV time we knew this. Women's magazines, self-help books, picture-books, developers of apps that send us signals to stop surfing (or even shut our device down altogether), know that behavior addictions are just as real as substance addictions, and that many of the same processes are in play as we develop them, and as we fight with them.But we also know how hard that fight is for some people. So a book like this might be scientific enough to convince some skeptics that addicts need support, that youngsters don't need smartphones, that ebooks aren't the end-all.There are flaws in the book. It's already showing its age, as it mentions, for example, 'new' strategies that casual games have developed that are already, irl, common and easy to resist. Also no mention of Fear of Missing Out, which is a little different than the Dopamine Hit the author focuses on. There are also too many 'broken link' style errors, and things he took somebody's word for instead of checking on for himself.Also, he admits to having been hooked to a troubling degree many times himself. Does it make the book stronger & more interesting that there's personal experience, not just research? Or does it introduce extra bias that he uses himself and a few million others as examples of vulnerable addicts, disregarding the fact that there are a few billion people that do *not* have a problem, and disregarding the studies that came up with results that do not support his argument? I dunno. I'm reading it because it's addictively structured. There are just the right amount of random micro-rewards of interesting study results and data scattered among bite-sized pieces of text. ...I'm about 2/3 done and might be finishing now if I weren't waiting for the alarm to go off on the oven for our family dinner....... Ok done. Not a bad book, but not recommended. The science is moving too fast, and Alter's not rigorous anyway.Defining 'addiction' is an interesting section. I won't quote the whole bit that I marked with a book-dart, but I do want to remind us all to forget the older models that implied that addicts have weaker willpower, or that a person can be forced to become addicted, or that a treatment can focus just on the behavior or the substance. Remember the term ""destructive crutch"" because addicts simultaneously suffer and have come to rely on the support.Also, I like the one time use of the word ""compelling"" to describe games, substances, etc. that feel addictive but that the individual in question can indeed break free from. Iow, very few of us are actually addicted to our phones. If we simply put them on a charger in the living room and substitute a paper book for our evening gaming session, we'll sleep a lot better... and withdrawal won't be nearly as awful as the detox that a substance addict goes through."

Although I suspected as much, this book confirmed my worst fears: I'm addicted to my phone, and the tech companies planned it this way.Dammit.I liked to think I could quit my phone at any time. While I can, theoretically, Alter lays out a narrative where all aspects of our lives are intertwined with technology. It's hard to have a professional job -- or maintain relationships with relatives far away -- without a mobile phone or tablet. And, while you're living your life, companies like Facebook-Instagram and Google-YouTube are doing what they can to grab more and more of your attention.Even if you don't want to give it.For me, Instagram seems to pull me into a hellish landscape where they serve up content from ""people I should know"" and influencers that I never asked to see but cannot stop watching. My perfectly curated feed of cat photos has turned into a constant barrage of fitness videos, advertisements, and inspirational videos from people who aren't all that inspirational. I block some of the more pervasive accounts that make me feel bad, but Instagram still finds a way to push addictive content in my face. I'd look away, but what else am I doing?Oh, yeah, it turns out I have a life.If it were as simple as turning off the phone and expressing willpower, we wouldn't be a lonely and isolated society. Alter's book offers ideas and solutions to restore some of your time -- and reclaim your soul -- from these apps and platforms. I was so impressed with the book that Alter was a guest on my podcast.If you find yourself sitting in your car looking at Snapchat long after you parked, or if you wonder if you should join the craze and get a TikTock account, let me recommend Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked.We all need to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves. Hopefully, it's not too late."
32,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21053188-samuel-salzer,4,"Review: Illuminating read on online behavior and behavior addictions in general. Extremely informative and well-researched book that looks at our increasingly intimate relationship with our screens. Alter argues that many technologies including smartphones have become the panacea to many of our daily problems from boredom to loneliness. This is how behavior addictions arise-short term rewards in form of solving emotional problems lead to a chain of undesired behaviors done despite knowledge of adverse consequences. While the book indeed offers a quite grim message it also offers much help and guidance to ways of better managing and creating balance with technology in our lives. Still, it is an uphill battle since much of our most used devices and applications are designed and continuously altered to further hook us. Worse yet, they are becoming more addictive by the minute. Big thought: We must become better at helping people across all level and ages of society to manage the pull of the screens before we get completely lost in them. It is now or never. Favorite quote: “Walter Isaacson, who ate dinner with the Jobs family while researching his biography of Steve Jobs, told Bilton that, “No one ever pulled out an iPad or computer. The kids did not seem addicted at all to devices.” It seemed as if the people producing tech products were following the cardinal rule of drug dealing: never get high on your own supply.”"
33,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26517939-bouke,5,"This is a very important book on a topic that I've been thinking a lot about recently. There is a hidden societal cost on our population's obsession with smartphones and social media, that is not talked about and poorly understood. This book explores behavioural addiction, how it compares to previous addictions (like substance addiction) and what causes it. There's a good mix of research and anecdotes in this book, and the book is very easy to devour in a couple days. I think there's going to be a lot more discussion in the next couple years about the mass addiction to likes and shares, and this book prepares you fairly well on the subject. I'll be exploring it more, and hoping to create systems or apps to make sure I don't get sucked into the hole of social media/video games/VR/whatever people come up with next."
34,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," Argues that behavioral addictions can be nearly as dangerous as substance addictions and technology companies are honing their products to have the same hooks and snares to cause a person to invest time and money into their products in the form of apps, games, and social media. If you are finding that hours of time is disappearing down a black hole of screen time it is because these technologies are a devilishly conceived to make you hand over your eyeballs and money to them. If you thought Vegas was bad the stuff that is a mouseclick away uses things Casinos could only dream about. Definitely a wake up to the dangers of digital addictions and those who profit from it."

Looking at why and how this is happening but also suggesting how we can manage it this is a book that everyone who owns a computer, a mobile phone, or a tablet should read. It has certainly made me much more mindful of the way in which I use and the frequency that I use technology. Written in an accessible and interesting fashion that will appeal to the reader this is an important book that makes you realise that we should be controlling technology not the other way round. "

Not a major one, not a groundbreaking one, but decent.Instead, it's a boring book about how most of us nowadays spend too much time playing video games and/or on social media platforms. And then how some go to detox programs, and how some work better than others. And we should take better care.Ah, the time I have wasted."

38,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29975286-cat,4,"I just finished reading the book Irresistible by Adam Alter.  This book looks at our addiction to technology (smartphones, email, gaming, fitness tracking, etc).  It starts by reviewing the research on behavioural addiction (what it is and where it came from), how to create addictive experiences, and solutions for living in a world where abstinence from technology isn't an option.  It's different than the other UX books I've read in that it made me think about the ethics of creating addictive user interfaces and what responsibilities we have as designers of these products.  Here are the notes I took as I was reading:Addiction is a deep attachment to an experience that is harmful and difficult to do without.  Rather than involving substances, behavioral addictions arise when a person can't resist a behavior which addresses a deep psychological need in the short term, but produces significant harm in the long term.Research on rats demonstrated that anyone can exhibit addiction under the right circumstances and it isn't just based on having  an addictive personality - eg a probe activating pleasure centre causes rats to ignore food and rest, but when taken out of that environment they no longer show addictive behaviors.  This was revolutionary compared to the idea that addicts have brains that are predisposed to substance abuse.Ingredients of an addictive experience: goals, feedback, progress, escalation, cliffhangers, and social interaction.Humans are driven by a sense of progress.  When goals are smaller and easier to manage, people will be more likely to act.  Goals inspire action because they become fixation points.  The problem occurs when people start fixating on arbitrary goals, like getting to inbox zero, where we become obsessed with perfection and spend more time pursuing the goal than enjoying the success.  If the pursuit is governed by numbers (eg salary, Instagram followers, marathon time, streaks), goals will come in the form of round numbers and social comparisons, and repeated success will spawn one new ambitious goal after another.Feedback encourages action, whether it be pushing a button on an elevator or even a virtual button that does nothing (eg Reddit's 2015 April Fools prank).  When feedback is intermittent rather than guaranteed, more dopamine is released in the brain for each ""reward"" and the draw is bigger (like gambling).  Facebook took advantage of this phenomenon via their like button, which gives intermittent feedback about whether your friends like your post.  In gambling with slot machines, losses can be disguised as wins when you win back some of the money you spent on a spin (eg win 1 of 15 rows on a single spin would get you $1 win, but cost $1.50 to play).  The alluring whirl of lights and sounds can convince you that you won. Similarly to how slot machines measure success using time on device, game designers  capture how engaging and enjoyable their games are.  Designers use microfeedback to keep gamers hooked.  It is important that feedback immediately follows a player's action so the player feels they caused it.  Games like Candy Crush use a layer of surface feedback, like sights and sounds, to make it feel real and connect the player to the virtual world. Virtual Reality has the potential to deepen this experience and escalate behavioural addictions.Addictive games help users progress and offer something to both novices and experts.  Start with a hook, like the dollar auction game or Super Mario avatar setup.  Beginner's luck can also be a powerful hook because it shows you the pleasure of success and then yanks it away.  In gaming, this can be achieved by giving rewards quickly early in the game and spreading them out as the player progresses.Although people think they want to make life easier, there is actually research showing people prefer breaks between something pleasant and moderate hardship (examples of people in the lab giving themselves electric shocks to avoid the boredom of sitting alone with their thoughts for 20 minutes, and movie stars getting bored with everything coming too easily).  Escalation of difficulty is a critical hook that keeps games engaging long after you've mastered the basic moves - like Tetris getting faster as you progress with time.  Another study showed that children learn best and are most motivated when the material they're learning is just beyond their current skill level - called the ""zone of proximal development"".  When people enter the zone, they experience ""flow"" - the joy of being able to just barely overcome challenges.  In the context of gaming, this sensation is called a ""ludic loop"" where each time you solve part of the puzzle a new incomplete piece presents itself - e.g. Super Hexagon starts up again right away so the player can't wallow in defeat, music starts at random spot so it doesn't feel like as much of a loss - all to preserve the player's flow.  Near wins where you're sure you were close to winning are very addictive, sometimes more so than actual wins - eg lottery tickets.  People have inherent stopping rules that cue them to stop doing some activity (shopping, exercising, etc).  We tend to overlook them because in the short term it's more useful to know how to get someone to start doing something than to continue or stop doing it.  Unfortunately technology can disrupt stopping rules and make us less intuitive about what we're doing (eg calorie counting vs healthy eating).  Games like Farmville override stopping rules because they are persistently running, with no levels or sessions that tell you when your game begins and ends.Incomplete experiences occupy our minds more than completed ones - such as tasks and songs.  We can use cliffhangers to drive behaviour - eg Netflix autoplay function encourages binge watching, organ donation rates affected based on whether people opt in or opt out.People are endlessly driven to compare themselves to others.  Facebook and Instagram are addictive partly because of the feedback that comes in through likes and comments; something that isn't available through apps without a social network.  People also seek social confirmation - signs that they see the world the way others do, that they are part of a group.  E.g. Hot or Not app gives people feedback about whether their version of hot is mirrored by others.  Multiplayer games leverage interactions between gamers who share a common purpose to keep people hooked.  Making online friends isn't a problem as long as you also make friends in the real world.  One study found that gamers aged 10-15 who played 3+ hours/day were less satisfied with their lives, less likely to feel empathy toward other people, and less likely to know how to deal with their emotions appropriately.  This is especially alarming when recent studies show kids spend an average of 5-7 hours/day in front of screens.Children are especially vulnerable to addiction because they lack the self control that prevents many adults from developing addictive habits.  Hardship innoculation is the idea that struggling with a mental puzzle innoculates you against future mental hardships (like vaccines against illness), so depriving kids by handing them a device that makes everything easier is dangerous.  Since some screen time is unavoidable, recommendations for healthy screen time include: parents should encourage children to connect what they see in the screen world to their experience in the real world (""transfer of learning""), active engagement is better than passive viewing, screen time should focus on the content of the app rather than the technology itself.  A key idea is that it's easier to prevent people from developing addictions than to correct existing bad habits. Part of parenting today include lessons on how to interact with technology and for how long each day.When people try to suppress thoughts or behaviors, they tend to focus on them more.  Rather than trying to use willpower alone, it is a better habit to reduce the environmental cues.  A key to overcoming addictive behaviors is to replace them with something else (eg a stress ball instead of biting nails).  Habits consist of three parts - a cue, a routine, and a reward.  Keep the cue and reward the same, but change the routine.  Habits can take a long time to form - 66 days on average, but quite variable across different people.  Behavioural architecture - redesign your environment so temptations are as close to absent as possible (eg not keeping phone next to you all the time or while sleeping, automatically deleting emails while on vacation, etc) and blunt temptations that can't be avoided.  Not all addictive experiences are bad.  The same hooks that drive addiction can also be used to drive healthier eating, regular exercise, retirement savings, charitable giving, and committed studying.  Gamification is about taking a non-game experience and turning it into a game.  Three common elements include using points, badges, and leaderboards.  The risk of gamifying everything is that people can lose the intrinsic motivation to do the right thing - only exercising when it's fun, fees for picking up kids late from daycare become an economic decision, etc."
39,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan,5,"I was going through my Overdrive TBR when in the six or seventh page, I stumbled across this. I’m still very into reading about how the internet and social media affects us so I checked this book out immediately. Also, I guess my habit of adding books to my TBR list and then waiting for the right mood to read them is finally paying off – I don’t think I would have found the book at this time otherwise.Irresistible is a study of behavioural addiction and how modern apps have facilitated this rise. The book opens with a strong indictment – Silicon Valley’s leaders don’t allow their children to spend time on the very apps and devices they create (this Business Insider article has more details). Why?Alter argues that this is because addiction is not something that’s inherent in people, it’s “produced largely by environment and circumstance”. And not only can we be addicted to behaviours (like exercise, shopping, gambling), these are actually even easier to conceal. What is the difference between normal and excessive Facebook/Instagram usage? When does the worry over your likes cross over from normal to worrying?The first section of the book makes the case that behavioural addictions are on the rise and the second part takes us through the components of an addictive app. Alter argues that apps/platforms that cause behavioural addiction consists of six components:1. Compelling goals that are just beyond reach2. A sense of incremental progress and improvement3. Tasks that become more difficult over time4. Unresolved tensions that demand resolution5. Strong social connections6. Irresistible and unpredictable positive feedbackNot all platforms will have all six components but they will have several of them. Unfortunately, we can’t completely avoid them because “addictive tech is part of the mainstream in a way that addictive substances never will be.” Hence, the third and final section of the book explores some ways we can either use these addictive traits to promote good behaviours or employ methods to mitigate their harm. In terms of suggestions, other books like Digital Minimalism and How to Break Up with Your Phone have more concrete suggestions, but the chapter on gamification is interesting and worth a read.I liked that this book broke down the components that lead to behavioural addiction and talked about each of them separately. Most of the examples raised were apps but there was a really interesting look at the rise of Instagram and I think that it’s possible to take these components and use them to determine is an app, game, or platform is likely to produce behavioural addiction. That makes it more useful because there will always be new apps and new social media networks coming up and we have to be able to look at them with a critical eye.After reading this, I’m now curious about Instagram’s recent decision to hide the number of likes on a photo. That may remove one of the key components that make it irresistible (if I understand how this new feature works) which might affect the time on the app. I wonder why they would do it.Overall, this is a good book to read if you’re interested in finding out why certain apps and websites are particularly addictive. Even if the app or website you’re thinking of isn’t mentioned, you can probably figure out why it’s addictive after reading this.This review was first posted at Eustea Reads"
40,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20658260-jonathan,5,"My job is to literally teach kids how to use computers. I spend the majority of my life thinking about and delivering instruction regarding how technology can make the school day more successful, and I've got some major beef with what I do. Recently I've started to feel like something is majorly off with what is occurring in our schools. I've only been in the profession for about 12 years, but I've started to see a drastic change in the attention span of students who enter my classroom and it naturally makes sense. As teachers, we are constantly competing with the ""it and now"" of technology. Everything is instant in the lives of these students, we are now reaching a group of elementary kids who since the day they were born ""smartphones"" have been an everyday occurrence. I haven't done extensive research, but I've been able to see a correlation happening right before my eyes in society and I've begun to think more and more of the actions I witness in the classroom are directly related to the amount of technology these kids are constantly bombarded with.Well, thanks Adam Alter for actually doing the research and bringing my speculations to reality. Approaching the subject in much the same way as a Malcolm Gladwell book, Alter dives deep into the world of addictive technology and the harm that social media and video games are adding to this world, there is even a part that specifically highlights the decline in kids attention span over the past 10 years, imagine that!!!! To say this book is eye-opening is an understatement, and it has instantly called upon me to change my technology habits. How many of us are addicted to our smartphones, emails or video games? How have social interactions changed? Are we even going to be able to socialize in person with people anymore? I think if the world continues in the way it is that could easily be a reality, but even though this book is chalked full of facts, it brought on some deep contemplation that has helped me to reassess my values. It's impossible to live in an ever-advancing world and not embrace some of the new technology, but finding a way to separate yourself from the addictive behaviors is a must and I'd easily recommend this book to 99.9999% of people living in our country today. The social media epidemic is nuts and the way that smartphones have turned into a third arm attached to peoples head is disgusting. I challenge everyone to pick up this book and consider some of the main points it address, it'll change your life. Now my problem is how do I even continue on with my job knowing and thinking like I now do? I guess I'm going to approach it from a standpoint of not just teaching kids how to use technology, but showing them how to use it in a way that isn't addictive. "
41,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric,5,"I almost always struggle with assessing that fifth star, and that was the case here. But, this seems an important work even if, at some date not far down the path, some of what Alter has written about turns out to be a bit off the mark. For example, even I gave up ""Farmville"" as a regular time suck quite some time back. But understanding a bit more about tech addiction and gamification seems an exceptionally useful tool to keep at hand as we pick our way through our own daily activities and watch young people development habits, good and bad, in reacting to the world in which we are all placed. I suppose I was hooked when Alter made the claim in the prologue that Steve Jobs would not allow his children to partake of the technology of which he was so proud to have been the designer. Having read Walter Isaacson's biography of Jobs, I sensed that Jobs was not necessarily evil, but he was certainly complex. The manner in which tech becomes insidious needs to be understood. I suppose it is dangerous to give the Chinese much credit, but at least they make their motives intentional even if almost surreptitious as they seek to further state objectives through control of the technology. Having just watched our own political minders bumble through their questioning of Zuckerberg about ""Facebook"" I suppose we might take some small solace from their ignorance - or should we? "

43,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70125253-danika-gallant,2,Not what I was expecting at all. 
44,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46082728-rylee,3,"Really long review mostly not about the book ahead:I had really high expectations for this when I saw what it was about. I'm a teenager, and my generation is hooked on technology. I have a few friends whom I have never said more than 10 words to in person that I know better than my real friends. ""hanging out"" can mean spending hours sitting right next to each other, but be playing on our phones the entire time. If someone is telling me about something x said, they can talk for a solid 5 minutes before I realize that this all happened online. I've never been more than a period into school before I see someone checking their Snapchat. Many converations in the hallways are about what caption to use for a really good picture, how many ""ha""s to reply to someone over snapchat, what to like on Instagram, when to post something, and the list goes so far on. It's easy to say I'm not a part of it. I don't obsess over this and that. That's them, not me. It's not at all true though. I am an internet addict and I know it. I always know exactly where my phone is and I bet I spend 8-9 hours a day staring at screens. It's actually much better now than it was before. I'll elaborate.When I was in 2nd grade I won an iPad. Pretty cool for me then. I didn't use it much though, because my dsi was also awesome to me. I racked up a total of 450+ game hours on one pokemon game alone from 2nd-3rd grade. That doesn't include the time I spent playing other games. I also had a ps2 which I would play about 3-4 hours everyday from 2nd-4th grade.It's easy to say I was a kid, just having fun, which is fair, but this wasn't good. I remember playing outside as a chore my parents made me do. I didn't like it at all, and they had to tell me ""stay out there for x amount of time"" and those aren't fond memories. I understand now why they did it and I'm not saying they're right or wrong, but the fact is I was so hooked on my games I didn't want to face the real world. In 5th grade I got my first iPhone, and this is where it gets rough. I downloaded three social media apps that would hook me for years. ifunny, YouTube, and Instagram. It wasn't bad yet, but those three apps took up all of my free time.6th grade is where it gets really bad. Without fail, I would stay up until 12, 1, 2 in the morning on the internet. My grades were getting worse, I was worse at sports, angry, withdrawn so on and so forth. At lunch, I would sit with my friends and look at memes instead of talk. Why would I want to? It was the most entertaining.That next year was the worst of all. I now began playing on my phone in class (I never got caught, but I'm sure I missed a lot), staying up until 3, refused to talk to anyone but one friend, and would skip homework for 15 more minutes on the internet. Some days I wouldn't eat to save time for the internet. This was me at my worse. I knew something was wrong, and as stupid as it sounds, it took me months to realize it.I downloaded an app called moment and expected maybe an hour of phone use a day. In reality, I was pulling 6, 7, 8 hours on school days. Pretty pathetic, but I didn't do anything right away. I started in may by pulling back on little things. Lock your phone when you're not looking at it. Don't check social media more than once every 10 minutes. I was down to 3 hours.That summer was awful. I was off my phone as much and onto xbox. I played videogames for 9 hours straight regularly. I'd wake up at 1pm and fall asleep at 4am very frequently. The people I played with were the only friends I had. I could spend days without talking to a person face to face. I hated this, but I was addicted. What was I gonna do? My parents stepped in and said no video games during the week in the school year. Thank goodness. That first week was really really hard. All of my online friends texted me daily and I couldn't even talk to them. But I began using it less, and that was the key.8th grade was much better because I used my phone much less. Now, a year later, I'm down to about 10 minutes every day. Considering the average person uses their phone 3+ hours, I'm abnormal. However, I'm still hooked. I still think about it routinely, and I still need some help.That's why this appealed to me. How could this've happened? How do I fix it? I didn't get any solid answers really. A lot of things that relate to my issue, but nothing that explained precisely why or how this fixes anything. I'll look for another book that covers this same topic more fully because it's an interesting one that this one didn't explain well."
45,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5326469-sarah-carr,5,"What a phenomenal book! I was looking for a reason to knock it down a star but I just couldn't because there was no good reason. Chock-full of references from research as well as anecdotes from interviews, Irresistible explores traditional substance addiction, behavioral addictions like gambling, and what we can do about tech addiction based on what we've learned in these domains. It certainly had me putting my phone down a whole lot more often and it's having me rethinking my tech usage. "
46,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1281368-don,4,"This was on pace to be a 5 star book for me, but the final chapter which covers possible solutions to deal with addictive technology was not as strong as I had hoped.Here are some quotes I marked from the book for later review:“The highest risk period for addiction is early adulthood. Very few people develop addictions later in life fi they haven’t been addicted in adolescence. One of the major reasons is that young adults are bombarded by a galaxy of responsibilities that they’re not equipped to handle. They learn to medicate by taking up substances or behaviors that dull the instant sting of those persistent hardships. By their midtwenties, many people acquire the coping skills and social networks that they lack in adolescence. “If you aren’t using drugs as a teenager, you’re probably also learning to deal with your troubles using other methods,” Szalavitz said. So you develop a degree of resilience by the time you emerge through the gauntlet of adolescence.The most striking thing Szalavitz told me was that addiction is a sort of misguided love. It’s love with the obsession but not the emotional support. That idea might sound fluffy, but it’s grounded in science. Pg74-75.…addiction isn’t about substances or behaviors or brain responses. Addiction, to Peele, is “an extreme, dysfunctional attachment to an experience that is acutely harmful to a person, but that is an essential part of the person’s ecology and that the person cannot relinquish.” Pg 78Peele…railed against abstinence and Alcoholics Anonymous, and wrote again and again that addiction wasn’t a disease. Rather, it was the association between an unfulfilled psychological need and ta set of actions that assuaged that need in the short-term, but was ultimately harmful in the long-term. Pg 79What makes addiction so difficult to treat is that wanting is much harder to defeat than liking. Pg 87Addictions aren’t driven by substances or behaviors, but by the idea, learned across time, that they protect addicts from psychological distress. Pg 89The sense of creating something that requires labor and effort and expertise is a major force behind addictive acts that might otherwise lose their sheen over time. It also highlights an insidious difference between substance addiction and behavioral addition: where substance addiction are nakedly destructive, many behavioral addiction are quietly destructive acts wrapped in cloaks of creation. Pg 174“Remember: once your cucumber brain has become pickled, it can never go back to being a cucumber.” The phrase was designed to discourage inpatients from doing what Vaisberg had done where he life the center: believing that they could play just one more game without their addictions returning. Pg 229One study found that gamers aged between the and fifteen years wo played more than three hours per day were less satisfied with their lives, less likely to feel empathy toward other people, and less likely to know how to deal with their emotions appropriately. Pg 233…kids do better at a task that drives the quality of their social interactions when they spend more time with other kids in a natural environment than they do when spending a third of their lives glued to glowing screens. Pg 240There is good early evidence to support the idea that small doses of mental hardship are good for us. Young adults do much better on tricky mental puzzles when they’ve solved difficult (rather than easy) ones earlier. Pg 241"
47,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3755486-melinda,3,"This was an interesting read. There were facts and opinions and percentages, research and interviews, comments and suggestions. I think we are all aware of the increasing use of technology in our society, that increasing screen time is probably a bad thing, that we need to be engaging with real humans more than virtual humans. But we also tend not to think much about this 'addiction', so from that perspective, this book was a good first look into what we are doing to ourselves and where that road might lead us. The author also talked more broadly about addiction as a 'thing', and then explained that traditionally addiction was thought to be mainly about substance abuse, and that you one got addicted if you were weak willed and not in control of yourself. I think this book challenged those assumptions to a degree. The author argues that any person could potentially become addicted to anything, given the right (or wrong) set of circumstances, and then he goes on to explain that you can be addicted to loads of things, certainly alcohol, drugs, tobacco, but also exercise, food and definitely technology. However because we see our technology use as something that society has kind of evoled into doing, its not a bad thing. I think the author is trying to say we need to be aware that we could be addicted to using technology, and then, if you are using it too much, how can you reduce it in your life.An interesting book, and one that makes you pause and think about your own habits. And makes you consider whether you are actually addicted to technology, and maybe have conversations with family/friends about the topic. So in my mind, that makes a good read - reading, challenging, conversation afterwards. All good stuff."
48,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3962628-sarah,4,"3.5 stars. I learned some interesting things, but I spotted a couple places where the author didn't research thoroughly enough, or attributed correlation to causation because it helped his narrative.Addiction is dopamine dependent. There is no difference between substance addiction and behavioral addiction. Our bodies evolved to give a dopamine hit even for everyday things that are helpful to us: social interaction, drinking water, etc.In modern life, addictions are generally a coping mechanism. In indegenous society, simple social interaction provides validation that gives that same dopamine hit, but is non-addictive because it is a part of daily of life, not a coping mechanism.Experiments show removing the dopamine(-producing?) center in your brain eliminates *want*/motivation toward a thing (such as getting a sugar drink). It does not, however, reduce the amount of pleasure you received if a sugar drink is placed in your mouth (assuming you have already habituated to liking the sugar drink). There is therefore a difference between *wanting* something and *liking* something. It is possible to both hate something and to want it, which is what many addicts experience.Addiction is influenced by habit. Habit often depends on environmental triggers. Removing someone from the environment that triggers their habit can be helpful in eliminating the addiction.Lights and sounds trigger dopamine hits.Habit formation varies by person (18 day - 254 day range), 66 days average."

For example, Steve Jobs children did not have an iPad even though their father created it. Jobs was aware and concerned about the addictive nature of the iPhone and iPad for his children. IRRESISTIBLE is an interesting audio book. I heard it cover to cover. Alter is originally from South Africa then Australia and he reads his audio book. His accent was interesting and engaging in the book. The research and storytelling in this book was well-done. While much has been told about the addictive nature of substance abuse like alcohol or drugs, it was enlightening to hear the behavior addictive nature of a key device we use every day like a smart phone. Alter includes strategies for behavior adjustment and insights in this book. It holds your attention throughout with practical information. I recommend IRRESISTIBLE."

It's not- Alter is a compelling writer.This is the kind of book that will make you see the world around you differently- and will definitely color how you look at modern technology- for better and for worse."

He talks about how, for instance, many apps such as Facebook and Instagram, are perfectly engineered to keep user hooked. I never quite realised the power of variable rewards - the dopamine hit of these often outweigh that of predictable rewards. While research on behavioural addictions is not as substantial as that on substance addictions, it is nonetheless something that cannot be neglected. The end of the book did not cohere very well for me, e.g. chapter on Gamification. Seemed a list of ideas, but doesn't seem to conclude satisfactorily. Still, this book is worthwhile in its dive into we can and are being manipulated in ways that may not be healthy for us."

Adam Alter is an American author, and Associate Professor of Marketing at NYU. He has written for the New York Times, Washington Post, Huffington Post, among others. Alter’s research focuses mainly on social psychology, with emphasis on cues from the environment on human cognition and behavior. Alter also has his Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of New South Wales, as well as his M.D. and Ph.D. from Princeton University. Within Adam Alter’s Irresistible, I found myself stopping to think or to put his thoughts into a real-life scenario. I often found myself asking another person their thoughts on technology and our obsessions. 	This book is essentially broken down into four main parts: The Rise of Behavioral Addiction, Goals, Social Interaction, and Gamification. Alter likes to quote a lot of facts to help put things into perspective, for instance, “A staggering 41 percent of the population had suffered from at least one behavioral addiction over the past twelve months….almost half of the population had experienced the following symptoms: loss of ability to choose freely whether to stop or continue the behavior…unable to reliably predict when the behaviors will occur…interference with performance of life roles (e.g. job, social activities or hobbies), impairment of social relationships, criminal activity and legal problems…physical injury and impairment, financial loss or emotional trauma.” (Alter, 2018, p.25). If this doesn’t grab your attention, what will? I started considering my own emotional trauma after reading this quote. Am I addicted to my phone and other forms of technologies? Can I even walk out of a room and leave my technology behind? The references Alter makes in his book are examples involving the psychology of behavioral addictions and patterns in the psychology behind the behavior itself. 	Alter continues with how we can set goals for ourselves if we feel we are too engrossed in technology. “From a young age, humans are driven to learn, and learning involves getting as much feedback as possible from the immediate environment.” (Alter, 2018, p.121). The technology is the immediate environment he’s talking about. Think about the moment you get up in the morning. Technology wakes you up most of the time, you might check your phone ten times before breakfast. From the moment your eyes open, there is some form of technology surrounding you. “How does that change the way humans interact, [and] function as a society?” (Alter, 2018, p.142). He mentions goals so that we can have something to strive for. If we realize it’s too much of a tech world, and want to step back, our goals are there. “Goals function as placeholders that propel you forward when the daily systems that run your life are no longer fulfilling. “ (Alter, 2018, p. 119). Alter interviews with many people revolving around the field of technology, Alter finds Essena O’Neill, an Australian model. She says, “I’ve spent the majority of my teenage life being addicted to social media, social approval, social status, and my physical appearance. Social media is contrived images and edited clips ranked against each other. It’s a system based on social approval, likes, validation, in views, success in followers. It’s perfectly orchestrated self-absorbed judgment.” (Alter, 2018, p. 221). It seems the ‘addiction’ is all over the globe! Alter tells us we don’t have to be a model to experience what O’Neill did. As it turns out, “Today the average schoolchild aged between eight and eighteen years spends a third of her life …engrossed in new media, from smartphones and tablets to TV’s and laptops.” (Alter, 2018, p.237). A third of their life is spent on technology by the time they’re 18 years old. How does that impact our youth? “Remember: once your cucumber brain has become pickled, it can never go back to being a cucumber.” (Alter, 2018, p. 229). Alter starts off his ‘Gamification’ section with how it’s used. Alter talks about how the term gamification is used to test students, used in training for large businesses, and used in medical venues to test pain perception. A specific game he talks about is Kim Kardashian’s: Hollywood. “…uniquely toxic and addictive…perhaps the only app that really deserves the comparison to drugs.” (Alter, 2018, p.159). This is crucial! I mean, it’s talking about changing pain perception in people by using virtual reality! Is this the 21st century or what? Toward the end of his book, he tells us that, “There’s a fine line between behavioral addictions and helpful habits, and it’s important to keep that line in mind.” (Alter, 2018, p.295). Alter, A.

57,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633494-laura-leaney,4,"All the sociologists and behaviorists out there say that New Year's resolutions don't work, but I figured if I only made one I might possibly succeed at something. Every year, I feel compelled to write a long list of self-improvements, but I refrained this year and merely promised myself that I would stop checking my phone so often. Between the camera, email, texts, and lure of my personalized ""news feed,"" my brain is dissolving into an unidentifiable blob of dead cells. I'm not even on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. Goodreads is my only form of ""social"" media. And (after a Super Mario stint in the 90s), I don't play computer games. So Adam Alter is preaching to the proverbial choir here. I know technology is addictive; I feel it. So I began reading his book because I'd really like to get off the computer-smart phone-train. This is not to say I'm anti-technology; I love the instant connectivity; I love looking stuff up; I love knowledge. Yet, I feel like I'm using my devices in an unhealthy, compulsive, nearly robotic way. How can I own a smart phone without reaching for it so often? There's a reason that Steve Jobs and the other Titans of Tech didn't let their kids use iPhones, iPads, or iAnything while they were growing and developing.After the author discusses the nature of addiction and its rise in current behavior toward technology, he lays out some possible solutions in the last part. I had to wade through quite a bit of psychological and behavioral material to get there though. Still, if even half what Alter writes is true, we'll need to make a change or the majority of us will be utterly vulnerable to manipulation of the worst kind. When he discusses the compulsive, addictive qualities of Fitbits, I cringed. I've got friends with Fitbits, and the number of steps is everything. He says, ""Numbers pave the road to obsession"" before quoting Leslie Sim, an exercise expert: ""Counting steps and calories doesn't actually help us lose weight; it just makes us more compulsive. We become less intuitive about our physical activity and eating."" But I don't own a Fitbit. . . . I'm simply worried about the amount of time I waste on my phone. The chapters dealing with solutions had headings like, ""Nipping Addictions at Birth"" and ""Habits and Architecture."" Since I was born before the invention of the mobile phone and have no children, I skimmed that first chapter. The section on habits pretty much summed up what another book, The Power of Habit, also said: to break a habit, replace it with another one. Okay. Makes sense. This is something that the individual can do.What I liked about the final discussion in the epilogue is Alter's opinion that technology is, in many ways, a force for good and it need not be as addictive as it is. Workplaces ""can shut down at six--and with them work email accounts can be disabled between midnight and five the next morning."" ""Games, like books with chapters, can be built with natural stopping points. Social media platforms can 'demetricate,' removing the numerical feedback that makes them vehicles for damaging social comparison and chronic goalsetting."" I won't hold my breath. It's essentially up to me to stop looking at my phone screen so much. When my dad quit smoking, he did it ""cold turkey"" and I think that's my only solution. I hope I don't suffer the tech version of delirium tremens, drooling and moaning while I'm weaning myself from the teat of the Internet."
58,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5942798-shana-yates,4,"[4.5 stars]Alter’s book packed a particular gut punch for me. Like many, I sometimes joke about being attached to my wireless devices, and I can point to many times I stayed up later, failed to run errands, or put off important chores because I was engrossed (or mindlessly scrolling) in the internet, social media, or a game. But as Alter explained the history of addiction and behavioral addiction, how it is defined, how it works in the brain, and then how our brains specifically interact with technology, I started to see myself and my relationship with my devices in a different way.Alter is an excellent writer and synthesizes a number or areas into an approachable, intelligent, and important book. The chapters on addiction ably look at substance abuse and then how the definition of addiction began to expand to include behaviors, and how such addictions work in our bodies. This alone is helpful for those who need grounding in the science. He moves on in Part 2 of the book to look at how the technology we use is designed, and how easy it is to design games, apps, and other aspects of technology to be addictive. These chapters are especially striking as you will likely recognize the aspects he describes and how hard you personally find it to turn away. Ranging from the need to constantly check email and texts, to games ranging from Candy Crush to World of War Craft, to the architecture of streaming services like Netflix and the pull to just keep watching and binge, almost all readers will be reminded of their own technology use in some way.In Part 3 he discusses ways that we can moderate our technology use and the burgeoning treatments being applied to addicts. Especially striking is the discussion of how hard it is to moderate our habits. Unlike substance abuse, where people are advised to avoid places that act as a trigger (certain groups of friends, bars, etc.), technology is ubiquitous, and you can’t really go cold turkey and abstain – you have to find a way to use the technology reasonably. Perhaps most striking is the discussion of the impact of our technology habits on children. We have yet to have an entire generation reach adulthood who have been so immersed in technology, but early signs clearly point to the fact that screen time should be fleeting if at all for very young children, and screen time for older children should be monitored and of certain types (interactive, not passive, for instance). But such changes are harder to affect when screens are everywhere and parents, themselves, find it hard to look away. Well worth the read for anyone who uses technology, which likely is you since you are reading this very review online. Highly recommended. "
59,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4254142-susan,5,"This book was a lot deeper than I expected it to be. I anticipated a discussion of how technology affects our lives, but in fact, Alter takes us on a comprehensive exploration of behavioral addiction, from exercise addiction to Internet addiction to behavioral components of substance abuse. Alter makes the astonishing claim that half of the developed world is addicted to something, and for most people that something is a behavior: checking email, posting to Instagram, scrolling through Facebook, playing video games, or binge watching on Netflix. He explores not only the ramifications of these addictions, but also the intentional design of the technology that hooks us. He argues that will power alone is not enough to fix the problem; instead we need to design our environments for success. ""Behavioral addiction is still in its infancy,"" says Alter, ""and there's a good chance we're still at base camp, far below the peak. Truly immersive experiences like virtual reality devices have not yet gone mainstream. In ten years, when all of us own a pair of virtual reality devices, what's to keep us tethered to the real world? If human relationships suffer in the face of smartphones and tablets, how are they going to withstand the tide of immersive virtual reality experiences?""So what's the solution? We can't get rid of technology altogether, nor should we, says Alter. They are miraculous and life-enriching. Instead, we should use careful engineering of our experiences, schedules, and environments so that they don't become addictive. Alter suggests solutions like disabling work email between midnight and five the next morning, removing the addictive metrics (like and share counts) from social media platforms to disable damaging social comparisons, and introducing children to screens slowly and with supervision. ""Our attitude to addictive experiences is largely cultural, and if our culture makes space for work-free, game-free, screen-free downtime, we and our children will find it easier to resist the lure of behavioral addiction. It its place we'll communicate with one another directly, rather than through devices, and the glow of these social bonds will leave us richer and happier than the glow of screens ever could."" Sappy conclusion? Sure. But the point is still well-made. Highly recommended. "
60,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1368686-judy,4,"""Children can be introduced to screens slowly and with supervision, rather than all at once. Our attitude to addictive experiences is largely cultural, and if our culture makes space for work-free, game-free, screen-free downtime, we and our children will find it easier to resist the lure of behavioral addiction. In its place, we'll communicate with one another directly, rather than through devices, and the glow of these social bonds will leave us richer and happier than the glow of screens ever could.""In recent years, there has been an evolving role reversal in my relationships with my four grown children. Just as they reacted to advice from their father and me, my response to their suggestions is often mixed; in fact, there have been times when their well-meaning interventions have been met by me with defensiveness and even resentment. However, when my oldest son Chris told me about this book and offered to order it for me, my interest was piqued.Alter's book is plainly written and interesting from start to finish. It is a more scientific and fact-oriented piece of writing than I usually read, so I was a little proud of myself for sticking with it. Using many studies to back up his examples, Alter includes examinations of addictions such as phones, television, exercise, food, and gaming. It was troubling to me that, as I read this book, news broke that some major league baseball players are experiencing the physical effects of playing too many video games on their phones! What is going on when players who are being paid millions of dollars inflict damage on their bodies in these ways?After discussing numerous negative addictions, Alter turns to ""good"" addictions toward the end of the book. He concludes that we are all addicted; the solution is to become addicted in good ways. This made me think about our family of grandparents, children, and grandchildren. Some of the addictions that exist in this group are: knitting, basketball, walking, cooking, exercise, writing, and on and on. Indeed, the concerning addictions covered by Alter have crept into our family as well, such as Facebook and television, but hopefully we can help each other find more positive ways to spend our time and relate to one another rather than to technology."
61,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48646-melissa,5,"I read this because I'm unhappy with how much I'm addicted to screens. During the last year, I've dramatically reduced how much I use social media in some ways and increased it in other ways. For a long time, I quit Facebook. Now I'm back on it, but I deleted the app, which I felt convinced spied on me. I'm much happier and more productive the less I use Facebook. I would love to stop using it altogether, but I feel kind of trapped by it. Like how other sites use it to log in, for instance. But ultimately, I recognize that it's just my addiction keeping me on it.Sometimes I wonder if I'm addicted to reading. Goodreads tracking and goals has ""gameified"" reading for me to some extent. Recently, I've stopped entering when I STARTED a book on Goodreads, I only enter the book once I've finished it. That makes me less likely to continue reading a book I'd rather quit reading, which improves my experience of reading and ultimately leads me to complete more books. I view reading as a productive activity and one that is necessary for my writing, a goal that is motivated intrinsically for me, not extrinsically, so I guess reading obsession is acceptable. Still, I think about this a lot. I find using Kindle on my phone so convenient and I'm unlikely to stop doing that before bed anytime soon. I guess I need to get those glasses that block the blue light.Anyway, I found this book to be enjoyable to read and interesting. I really feel for the kids today who grow up with parents who are looking at their phones all the time and constancy access to screens. I babysit for much of my income and in my experience, screens turn kids into raving lunatics when you try to get them away from them. They truly act like addicts who NEED THEIR NEXT FIX and will go to any lengths to get it! It can't be good!Also, the games! I've been badly addicted to games before and managed to quit each time...EVENTUALLY. Once I've deleted the addictive games, each time, my productivity in things I actually care about has skyrocketed.So, yeah. Good book that rang very true for me."
62,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6144105-joseph-rizzo,4,"This book is a wake up call. Even if you think you have a healthy relationship, you likely need to reevaluate. We all have an opportunity to be more mindful in our use of technology. The book details the rise of recent technological advancements that have brought technology to the home and mobile, and how designers have engineered them to be addictive. Internet addiction and sub addiction to particular sites, games, and social media sites are now their own category of behavioral addiction. Even people who think they have restraint might be using their smartphone an hour or even more per day. Many users who have no idea they have a problem, might be using their combination of devices for 3-7 or more hours....per day. This is a dangerous situation that is breaking down societal communication and healthy relationships. The book outlines the many similarities technology has to the dopamine releases of other substance and behavioral addictions. It outlines how it even changes the structure of our brains, and how it is especially influential to young children in development. If you own devices with screens, you should read this book to come away with some self examination and practical tips for how to get into a more healthy relationship with technology so that you are using it as a utility rather than it using you. I came away with two very helpful things to implement right away, a blue light filter on my phone, I basically have turned my display to black and white. This will reduce the amount of melatonin I lose by looking at the phone at night. The other was an app called RescueTime which monitors my smartphone usage to give me metrics. I've found even after a day, knowing it is on the phone has given me an immediate incentive to decide not to pick it up knowing it's going to be counting me. The only real negative I found is that there doesn't seem to be much of a conclusion to the book. While it gave some very practical tips throughout, there wasn't a major finding overall. "
63,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6397454-peggy,4,"I really liked Part One which offers an engaging discussion of how addiction works and makes a convincing case that new technologies are increasing the number of behavioral addictions. The rest of the book is also interesting -- I learned a lot about how software and products are designed to encourage addictive behaviors -- but at a certain point, I started feeling like I was reading a string of anecdotes rather than a thoroughly researched discussion. Granted, so far, most of the research tends to be anecdotal evidence and small studies, but the first half of the book just seemed to be more developed and thorough in connecting evidence to a bigger point than the last section did. Even so, I'm glad I read this. If Alter is correct, I'm not alone in disliking how much time I waste thanks to technology -- and I was feeling particularly aware of that since thanks to a move, I'd gone nearly two weeks without internet service while reading his book. The book inspired me to take some steps to disconnect more easily such as turning off text notification sounds and to realize how hard it is to make a decision to do so and actually follow through on it. His discussion of the downsides of being too connected convinced me more than other texts I've read (like The Cyber Effect earlier this year) that controlling technology use as opposed to letting the technology control me is really important for a lot of reasons. The other texts informed me on this stuff, but didn't really change my behavior. This one was compelling enough to get me to act. "
64,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568480-giuseppe-d,4,"Well, where to start, I really enjoyed it. This book talks about the rise in behavioural addiction in our society. Behavioural addictions are those addictions that don’t involve any substance but rather behaviour that we cannot resist and which provide pleasure in the short term but produce significant harm in the long term.The author focuses on technology use and abuse. Since the beginning, he acknowledges that technology usage “differs from substance addiction, because it’s almost impossible to return to society without using technology.” And nowadays it’s not enough to have a strong willpower when literally there are people in the social media and gaming industries who sole job is to find new ways of keeping your attention for a longer and longer time.In order to keep our attention hooked, many of these platforms use feedback in the forms of lights and sounds. Feedback is pleasurable. That is why slot machines are so addictive and that is why you’re finding yourself playing candy crush for ‘just another level’. When you form a line in the game, “a reinforcing sound plays, the score associated with the line flashes brightly, and sometimes you hear words of praise intoned by a hidden, deep-voiced narrator’.Not only that, but there is also pleasure taken in achieving progress. That’s why progressing is easy at the beginning but then it gets harder. Game designers found that if you can only have lives for a limited amount of time, you’d pay money to continue playing and that’s why keeping your attention hooked is linked to profitability.Is it all bad though? Well, there are a few upsides, technology isn’t inherently good or bad, it’s all about using it sustainably!For instance, according to some studies, being immersed in a game can help reduce the effect of traumatic experiences.Not only that, but using the concepts of “gamification” we could harness the power of getting hooked into something, of having feedback and rewards, and progress to achieve our goals. For example, I’m a Todoist user and I feel very satisfied when I complete all my tasks for the day and I’m free to relax and I also get more “karma points”.However, I will definitely try to spend more time offline after reading this book and also more time making social interactions with people in the real world.

65,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20366831-stephen,3,"“There is one subtle psychological lever that seems to hasten habit formation: the language you use to describe your behavior. Suppose you were trying to avoid using Facebook. Each time you’re tempted, you can either tell yourself “I can’t use Facebook,” or you can tell yourself “I don’t use Facebook.” They sound similar, and the difference may seem trivial, but it isn’t. “I can’t” wrests control from you and gives it to an unnamed outside agent. It’s disempowering. You’re the child in an invisible relationship, forced not to do something you’d like to do, and, like children, many people are drawn to whatever they’re not allowed to do. In contrast, “I don’t” is an empowering declaration that this isn’t something you do. It gives the power to you and signals that you’re a particular kind of person—the kind of person who, on principle, doesn’t use Facebook.""Fine overview of addiction to technology.Some nuggets:1) As above, use ""I don't"" rather than ""I can't"" to describe your actions2) New habits may take two months to be cemented3) Who you surround yourself with is who you become close with4) Replace addictions with something positive rather than just trying resist or ignore the addiction."

Alter breaks down science in a way that is palatable for the general audience. The author did a really great job with explaining why and how it is hard to actually turn bad habits into good habits, specifically the neuroscience of addiction and the play of the social environment in promoting/hindering addictive tendencies. He offered some helpful tips to overcome addiction at the end with some opposing opinions on each techniques. Even though he doesn't go into depth with the tips, I still think they are helpful for some people. I assume because addiction to technology is relatively new that there needs to be more research in order for him to write with confidence and scientific backing on this topic. I'm sure he'll follow up on this topic once more research is being done. The main take away is to put down your technological gadgets if they become addictive and do healthy activities (and I'm sure you know what those things are), like actually socializing with people face to face and create meaningful relationships, exercising, working on meaningful projects, being in the moment, and all that jazz etc."

It's not ... quite that, although it does present a really good counterargument to Neil Postman's assumption that making education entertaining is counterproductive.There are some very interesting anecdotes in here (the Vietnam vets and heroin bit is particularly memorable), and I think this probably serves as a good introduction to the idea of behavioral addiction. The problems and ideas that Alter raises throughout the book seem very timely and real to me. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a bit more clarity in how to combat these addictions effectively. This might be an unfair expectation, as I'm not sure that the science is really settled on that, but the writing on this bit is kind of scattershot. Alter goes quickly from saying that negative reinforcement won't work without addressing the underlying psychological need that the addiction fills, to describing bracelets that shock you if you check Facebook. So does it work, or doesn't it?If you're looking for a 10,000-ft. view of addictive technology, and the state of discussion around it, this would be a good read. If you want something a bit more actionable, it's a good start at least. "

There are so much noises of up-to-date products, fancy new phones, better clothes, etc., that keep being shoved into our face everyday in advertisements, on the streets, T.V., online, and especially the people with whom are interacting. So, avoiding those noises seems almost impossible, and resisting the temptation of plunging ourselves into these ""trends"" is challenging.Buying new things should make us feel enjoyable for finally treating ourselves right, but right now, we buy new products to release the pressure of not buying them, of being left behind by our friends and modern people.

And there is science and experiments that prove much about our human, destructive behavior. I am glad that he hits on some solutions, finally, toward the end. It's nothing really mind blowing. It's what you expect. WE have to be held accountable for what we do. We need to be present in our children's lives. We need to set limits, for ourselves, for our children. It all makes sense, but in the rise of everything being techie and manufacturers knowing more and more about how the human mind works and how to market to our deepest wants/needs/desires, it makes it no less troubling...knowing what needs to be done. Just like everything in life that is important...the concept is rather simple, the practice, not so much."
70,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96009131-jay,4,"Outsourcing recall to technology has given us digital amnesia. Without some struggle, the brain does not grow and looks for other problems to solve. As such, we have created a society of neurotic computer/smartphone dependents with a massive case of FOMO, social ineptitude, and the need for dopamine reward of constant attention....yet not deep connection. The irresistible call of the techno sirens call have become so ingrained into daily existence. Instead of freeing our time for quiet contemplation, ingenuity and genuine emotional connection, we have created a world of obsessive technological behavioral addiction."
71,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13257009-allie-ford,5,"This is a fascinating book about why people do (and overdo) many of the things they do - from work to computer games to gambling to mobile phone use. It highlights how the world is being engineered to get us hooked on technology - and how the prevalence of technology makes such addictions so very difficult to overcome. It's an engaging read, with lots of anecdotes, experimental results, and facts throughout. The book is divided into chapters, but a lot of the content intertwines. Definitely recommended, especially for those with young kids."
72,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3736078-uwe-hook,3,"This book was an interesting if shallow look into behavioral addiction as applied to technology, but I didn't feel like it dove into the technical side enough. I wanted to see more details about the sites, apps, and devices we use and the specific tricks they use to hook us. Instead, this book was more about the general topic of behavioral addiction, as applied to technology, and I didn't think it was particularly insightful in that. A lost opportunity. "
73,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/965497-kristin-lenz,4,"I read this for my social work book club - an easy read, interesting stories/science, and it made me examine some of my own behavior. I expected the book to focus mainly on cell phones and social media, but the author covers a lot of ground - from heroin in Vietnam vets to gambling. I skimmed at times - there was a lot about gaming, but overall it was interesting to learn more about the aspects of technology that are created specifically to keep us returning for more."
74,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8464281-darnell,2,"I mostly enjoyed this book, but can't recommend it very much. It falls into that category of nonfiction where the author repeatedly throws research and factoids at the reader without adding very much value - there are some good pieces, but it's not the best nonfiction. The theme of the book is loose, more a container for a bunch of research, not a grand thesis."
75,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94296807-ana,5,"Great book, very well written and built. It's really helpful to realize how hooked to technology we currently are and how to overcome that. This book has a big amount of studies and data collected from many investigations concerning behavioural addictions. I only recommend it, if you have real interest in the subject or/and want to learn more about it."
76,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83121598-kanwal-shamsi,5,Really interesting comparisons of how behavioural addictions mimic substance addictions in many ways. The amount of psych studies that are included in the book made it really enjoyable for me! Overall a really interesting and addictive read. Adam Alter’s writing style is very engaging and made this a hard book to put down.
77,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36146560-dakota,4,"I'm as susceptible as anyone else to the pull of tech and get hooked by it. Beyond the facts and stories, this book served as a reminder that my personal email and Facebook have no place on my phone. I also installed the app Moment, which sums up total screen and individual app usage time. Concrete results are the sign of a good book!"
78,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63707436-apoorvaa-agarwal,3,"This is a book with great insights and I'm sure that to a lot of readers it will serve as an eye opener or a well timed intervention. However, for me, the book was not engaging enough, it could have left the reader with more to mull upon. Definitely expected more."
79,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29807541-zeke,4,"Great book that dived into how technology is designed to be as addictive as possible. I did feel the book got side tracked with too many details; some chapters felt repetitive. The book included tips to help combat addiction. For example, when you sleep at night, keep your phone in a separate room, so you are not tempted to check it until you wake up. "
80,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18948213-michelle-jarc,4,"Every adult should read this. You will be struck with reality and the hard truth even within the first few pages. This book is research based and study rich - so it can be dry at times, but it held my interest the entire time. It is hard to debate hard facts. "
81,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17817088-anne,3,"This was interesting enough. Lots of anecdotes and rather appalling stories of how the internet is ruining us, but not a lot of suggestions for how to fix it. It kind of made me want to pull the plug on everything though so....there's that."
82,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49911890-kate,4,"Sits right on the brink of a 3.5 and a 4. Made me uncomfortably aware of my smartphone usage. Brings forward an interesting discussion on behavioral addictions, but seemed a little too widespread and just the slightest bit offbeat to pull through to anything higher for me. "
83,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10878734-katie,4,"An interesting book about addiction, technology and gaming. I did feel a little bad to be listening to an audiobook about technology addiction on my smart phone."
84,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12341549-emily-morrison,5,"This is an absolute must-read for anybody with children, a smart phone, and/or (probably more critically) children with a smart phone."
85,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46226491-stefan-svartling,4,Very interesting but I don't really believe in internet addiction. It's simply is how humans evolves
86,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37961987-gamespacenl,4,"Well written, full of great stories, but it helps to have a background in social science to be able to contextualize most of the referenced work."
87,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2066129-cari,5,An interesting look into the science of addiction and how to engineer experiences that can be addictive - and whether or not that is something we should do.
88,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20741824-julie-stoops,5,I found this book very interesting. It held my attention and taught me a great deal about how developers and companies exploit the human brain’s natural wiring and reward system. 
89,1594206643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23942385-kayla,5,"Very readable and applicable- I really liked how the book was broken down to explain how and why addictions happen, and then gave some solid non-alarmist advice on how we can live with amazing new technology without being overthrown by it.Note: Has a few swears"
