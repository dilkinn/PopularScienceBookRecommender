Back when I was a partying single graduate student, I'd frequently hit the town for some fun. Inevitably I'd meet someone, strike up a conversation, and they might ask me what I did for a living.""Oh, I'm a cosmologist."" ""Cosmetologist? Cool, do you do make-up for movies?"" ""Um...not unless rouge is a component of dark matter."" (ba-da-bum)""...""""I make detectors and use them to study the origins and geometry of our universe."" ""Uh. No way. You ever work in movies?""I discovered after a few years of this that it was much easier and simpler to tell people I was Mary Poppins at Disneyland. Without exception, folks believed me, made a joke and moved on. The physics thing just cause wrinkled faces, and very odd non-sequiturs. Once I had a guy tell me all about a distant cousin who studied shrimp in the Netherlands. Frequently I'd get the physicist = physician mix-up. Luckily no one ever showed me their rash. Oh well, such is the life of the lonely, misunderstood cosmologist.Why am I telling you about all my misadventures in life? Oh yeah, to let you know that my background is observational cosmology. (I.e. making devices, detectors, instruments and doing experiments in labs, in Antarctica and on space-born projects.) I'm not a theorist, and most definitely not into string theory/membrane theory/M-theory. That stuff isn't even touched upon in most graduate programs. It's esoteric, wicked complicated, and honestly still in a very nascent stage.So, I'm not qualified to comment on M-theory being THE answer to The Grand Design as Hawking and Mlodinow so insistently propose. The question then becomes did they sell me on the idea. I dunno... maybe? It was all so very glossed over, overwhelmed by all the history and background needed to give the reader an appropriate framework. Then when they finally game to the climax of the story, where all the previous information should coalesce, M-theory barely got much of an explanation or treatment at all.I got the impression they wanted to push this Grand Idea, a wrap-up of all previous ideas, made with sweeping statements and generalizations to get press. Plus, if it turns out to work and be right, they can point to this very thin book and say ""A-ha!"" That's why I removed a star.Now, if you are looking to learn more about the science of the universe this is just the book for you. They do an excellent job explaining aspects of special relativity, general relativity, particle physics, early-universe physics, even my favorite field, the CMB. (Which maddeningly they call the CMBR, a very outdated term, and refer to the fluctuations as being in the microwave regime, even though they are sub-millimeter radiation! Grrr!) They even throw in a ton of historical context, which helps the reader understand the difficulties of the field and the constantly evolving nature of science.The science is great, you will learn a ton. Really. The writing is clear in that no-nonsense style Hawking is so famous for. Unfortunately in a few areas the explanations get really muddled to the point of incomprehensibility, and I suspect that might be Mlodinow's doing, since those muddled spots fall in his particular area of expertise. One would expect a research scientist in the field (even if she's a lowly experimentalist) should be able to breeze through all their scientific lessons. I found the string theory section to be really tough-going, with pretty poorly thought out examples. But it is a very esoteric field, and maybe there just aren't easy ways to help lay-folks visualize the 11-dimensional space and the vibrating membranes?Speaking of clear teaching examples, the book is filled with ways to help the reader visualize some very hard concepts. Gravity affects space-time like having a rubber sheet for your pool table, then pulling down on one spot right in the middle. The balls will curve around the area in much the same way that objects do near-ish black holes. The ""strings"" in string theory are described to be like a straw, with a surface space, but curled up on itself. However, from very far away a straw looks like a 2-dimensional line.And yet a few of their examples obviously fall short, which I suppose all stand-ins for the real thing will eventually do. The one that really stood out like a a sore thumb was the balloon-as-expanding-universe. Their illustration looks like someone could take a marker and draw little galaxies on a balloon. Then as the balloon is filled with more air and expands, all galaxies will move away from each other independently. The first trouble is that the galaxies, if drawn on, would expand themselves, which doesn't actually happen. (The mass and hence gravity of galaxies is a stronger force than the expansion of the universe.) In the text, it's made clear that the galaxies have to be treated as points on the balloon, but the graphic is a bit misleading. Secondly, the obvious question to the balloon is: Okay, the balloon expands into our 3-dimensional space, so what is the universe expanding into? They certainly touch on the answer later, but never refer back to our balloon. What a shame.At any rate, here's my advice: Believe their grand M-theory answer or don't, I don't think it matters as long as you have learned a few things about our scientific understanding of the universe along the way.Since I made fun of ""The Industry"" suitors I encountered around Los Angeles, I should relate a tale of the foolish physicists. Create a supersymmetry of courtship mishaps or something. I was at a party on campus, which was completely populated by science grad students, and maybe a few random stray people. I met a guy, he seemed nice enough, so we chatted about motorcycles for a while. He asked me what I studied, so I very jokingly told him I was a Theoretical Cosmetologist, and a student at the neighboring university (which has many, many more women). Ridiculous, right? The guy fell for it hook, line and sinker, and wanted to know more details of this theoretical cosmetology. So I told him all about color theory, combining it with an understanding of personality traits, and the effect of shadowing on first-impressions. Meanwhile, my co-workers stood behind him, trying to hold in their laughter. It was mean, but he believed me! If you ever meet me in person, only believe about 63% of what I say. The rest is a joke. And that's a scientifically proven fact."
1,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"When this book was released, I was reading a story about it on-line, and the headline said something like: “Stephen Hawking Says There Is No God”. Then I made the critical mistake of looking at the user comments under the story. It was the usual collection of badly spelled notes from ignorant asshats who tried to say that stupid science didn’t know nuthin’ or that it was all Obama’s fault. But one in particular caught my eye. It was by someone who undoubtedly dabbles in both neurosurgery and rocket science in his-or-her spare time, and it said something along the lines of: “THAT”S WHYY STEVN HAWKENS IS IN WHEEELCHAR!!!!!! BCAUSE HE DON”T BELIVE IN GOD!! JEBUS IS PUNSINGHING HIM!!!”Which got me thinking about why anyone would expect a guy who has suffered from ALS and been confined to a wheelchair for most of his life to believe in God? Among the many people who have just cause to question that a loving God is waiting in heaven to dish them out a heaping plate of Sky Cake, I’d think that Stephen Hawking would be one of them.It’s that kind of thinking that Hawking and Mlodinow take on here. Some people will point out the odds against any kind of life existing on Earth and say that God must have set it all in motion and made this place just for us and that it’s proof of an intelligent creator. Or you listen to a scientist like Hawking who points out that there’s whole multiverses where life doesn’t exist and that the only reason we know how lucky we are is that we exist to appreciate how lucky we are. Basing the idea that there must be some kind of intelligent creator simply because we’re here is bad science.And that’s Hawking’s point. This isn’t an anti-God book, it’s a pro-science and pro-critical thinking book. Hawking does a nice job in the early chapters of giving a brief overview of the development of the scientific method and how beliefs in mysterious beings have been incorporated into theories and then debunked over the centuries. Then he lays out the flaws in the models that insist that there has to be some kind of creator being in the mix. Even though Hawking does his best to dumb down the quantum physics that he claims proves his point and provides lots of handy pictures and graphics to help out the math and science challenged like me, it’s not exactly light reading. It’s short at 181 pages, and that helps, but while I’m fascinated by this kind of stuff, I’m also stupid enough that I had to read over some sections a couple of times before I thought I had a handle on it.It’s enlightening and a nice overview of both the scientific method and quantum physics, but unfortunately, I can’t see any of the people who should read this actually picking it up.

The book examines the history of scientific knowledge about the universe and explains 11 dimension M-theory. The authors of the book point out that a Unified Field Theory (a theory, based on an early model of the universe, proposed by Albert Einstein and other physicists) may not exist.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهارم ماه مارس سال 2012 میلادیسه برگردان فارسی از این کتاب وجود دارد: «علی هادیان و سارا ایزدیار نشر مازیار»؛ «حسین صداقت و امیر امیرآبادی نشر نقش و نگار»؛ «جمیل بصام انتشارات افکار»؛ ا. شاستیون هاوکینگ می‌گویند: ممکن است روشی که کیهان بوجود آمده، هماهنگ با قوانین دانش باشد، که در این صورت نیازی نیست به خدا متوسل بشویم، تا تصمیم بگیریم، که کیهان چگونه آغاز شده‌ است. اگر ما یک فرضیه همه‌ جانبه و کامل را، در مورد پیدایش عالم کشف کنیم، این مهمترین پیروزی انسان خواهد بود، چون ما قادر خواهیم بود، که فکر خدا را بخوانیم...؛ بشر، راز خلقت جهان را گشوده‌ است. جهان می‌تواند بطور خود بخود (خود با خود)، خودش را از هیچ بوجود آورَد، بعلاوه می‌تواند در حالت‌های متفاوت ایجاد شده باشد، و همه ی مشاهدات، و محاسبات بر این نظر صحه می‌گذارند. در سال 1999 میلادی، استیون هاوکینگ، در یک سخنرانی، پس از اشاره به زمان‌های دور، که بشر نخستین برای رویارویی با بیماریهای کشنده، و حوادث طبیعی (سیل و زلزله)، دست به دامان خدایان می‌شد ــ به معنی معکوس به نقش خداوند اشاره نمود و گفتThe future of the universe is not completely determined by the laws of science, and its present state, as Laplace thought.

Stephen Hawking is smarter than I am. That's no big feat because two of my cats are smarter than I am. The other cat is a certifiable idiot. But Hawking is way smarter than I am. The Grand Design is Hawking's explanation, more or less, about why the universe is the way it is. The answer comes down to M-theory which is more of a combining of explanations than one single unifying theory. Many reviewers seem to think Hawking is saying there is no God but he really seems to be stating that God is irrelevant. The real question is did we come from something or nothing. The beginning of an answer involves an understanding of quantum physics and multiverses that Hawking put as well into laymen's term as we can hope for. I don't pretend to understand everything in this book. I'm still contemplating why the world needs hairballs. But I did immensely enjoy reading this short book and can honestly say I understand a little bit more."

More than half were written by the very professors that were teaching me. Quite frankly, it's a giant scam. Those professors have already been paid for the first material through their salaries. Why should we have to pay them again for copies of their pretty badly written books? Yes, these books are very expensive, and many don't deserve to be read. A few years ago, I was asked to review a chapter in a research text. The friend who sent me the invite told me over a drink that I was the third person asked, and would I please go easy on the papers. I said yes."

8,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"I have a feeling that the publishing industry is milking Stephen Hawking. There was a time when we had a dashing physicist named Richard Feynman who used LSD and played banjo in a strip club. The naked pole dancers didn’t distract him from formulating quantum electrodynamics. He was quite a genius, and he was all over the place with his talks and popular books. But he’s dead. Now Stephen Hawking seems to be the coolest physicist around. He’s paralyzed and wheelchair-bound, and he speaks through a voice synthesizer by twitching a tiny working cheek muscle against a screen to pick up a displayed word. How cool is that! So he’s become quite a celebrity, and he fully deserves it. The public is fascinated with him. But that doesn’t mean a whole lot for the quality of his books. I’ve read better pop-physics books than this one. Besides, I didn’t see anything new here. This book got more publicity because it’s supposed to take on the question of God. It’s no secret that the great biologists and physicists tend to be atheists. That’s a very telling fact. But having acknowledged that, I don’t see a point in a physicist trying to “disprove” God through physics. Upon being asked by Napoleon where God fits in his physics, Laplace is reported to having said: “Sire, I have not needed that hypothesis.” Science, by definition, does not and cannot use the God hypothesis. I don’t see why it should get into the business of rejecting that hypothesis. Those who are inclined to reject God can point to the findings of biology and cosmology for support. But that is quite different from a physicist setting out to refute God based on physics. As for the God-rejecting physics – it can be summarized in two points: 1) While no individual physical object can appear out of nothing, an entire universe can. This is because the sum-total of the energy in the universe is zero. 2) There are almost an infinite number of universes popping out of nothing into existence. One of them, like the one where we live, can, by mere chance, have the right properties (laws and constants of physics) for the emergence of starts and planets and eventually life. The book goes into explaining the physics behind these two claims. Unless you’re a physicist as good as Hawking, there’s nothing you can say about his physics. "
9,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5973308-david-boyce,2,"As a cosmologist and a Stephen Hawking fan, I have a real issue with this book. His statement, that the Universe unpacks itself and therefore does not need a creator is based on some really flawed logic called 'model dependent realism'. MDR is a way of comparing reality to a model, if the model produces the same observable characteristics as observed in reality then the model is said to be as true as any other model.Imagine this, if there was equal amounts of incriminating evidence that two people committed a crime and prosecution lawyers could build a case against both men then under MDR both are guilty of the crime irrespective of the fact that it only happened one way. By invoking MDR Hawking is blatantly ignoring the lessons of the past, that evidence makes or breaks models, and so far M-theory is unsupported by evidence.In fact if you follow the line of Hawking's logic, rather than his conclusion, you can even say that Hawking categorically proves the existence of God - All be it as an MDR model of Universe creation. However he selectively ignores this and only looks at how MDR supports his religious beliefs. But, there are a lot of things wrong with this book. Let me explain....Hawking contradicts himself. He says that Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and Newton saw that the laws of physics were the work of God and that this God was not the God the Old Testament. However we do not have enough written down about the religious beliefs off all of the above to know that this is true and this statement is certainly not true for Newton who was as Christian as you could get. Hawking is doing something quite unscientific here, he is trying to re-write history. It is an embarrassment to atheism that some of the greatest geniuses off all time could have a religious belief like the rest of us and so Hawking is trying to apologise for this by making out that somehow the religious beliefs of these scientists were different to that of the rest of the population.Hawking suggests at some points that we must take the Universe at face value, that we must consider real only what is measurably real and then contradicts himself (when talking about the holographic theory) by saying that the Universe may be fundamentally different to how we observe it.Hawking suggests that God doesn’t intervene, and defines intervening as a suspension of the normal laws of physics. But what about intervention using the laws of physics. What about a God that intervenes only rarely. Under MDR all are as real as a God that never intervenes. Hawking laughs at the idea that we might all be the figment of someone else’s dream, but under the logic he himself invokes, this theory is as real as M-theory.Hawking describes how our perception of reality can be changed by placing upside down glasses on our faces. Our minds are so set in their ways that they refuse the new reality and change the input to fit with the model of the reality in our heads. In MDR the model each person has in their heads is a real reality. Reality is unique to each observer. If God exists in my model, it is true for my Universe, if he doesn’t in yours then God really is absent from yours.Hawking describes how St Augustine concluded that the Earth was young due to the ages of people in the bible, but at the time there was no recognised evidence to suggest otherwise. According to MDR young Earth creationism was the reality, since no other model existed. He says that young Earth creationism in the present day is as real as the big bang theory. But Hawking is breaking his own logic here. In today’s day and age we have a lot more evidence that the Universe began with something like the big bang which means that under MDR, this model is considered to be MORE real.Hawking describes how Hubble’s model of the Universe was accepted because it was the most natural model but naturalness and elegance is purely subjective. In MDR plausibility is not measured. Hawking mentions how the laws of nature determine a range of probabilities of various futures and past, and yet avoids the issue about how a selection is made. Somehow a selection IS made.Hawking describes how the Universe is comprehensible because it can be modelled. This is not true. Only the model is comprehensible. The Universe is not the model; the Universe is infinite and by its very nature incomprehensible and thanks to quantum physics not even entirely measurable.The bits that really make me cringe, and I have a degree and a PhD in this, is where Hawking gets his science wrong. Hawking suggests that the standard model “agrees with all current evidence”, but this is not true. Experiments have observed that the neutrino has mass, and the standard model cannot account for this.Hawking suggests that inflation in the early Universe really did happen, but recent observations by his old friend Roger Penrose have cast serious doubts over this. Hawking also suggests that this Universe is casually disconnected from the other possibilities, and so what we experience is just one possibility. However M-theory suggests that gravity information leaks between membranes, thus collapsing the universe into one possibility. This one.Hawking suggests the Universe has 4 dimensions of space time as the result of our selection. In his words the Universe is like this because this is one of the possibilities it could have been and our selection is this. But as Einstein said, “God doesn’t play dice”. To suggest that some thing’s have no fundamental reason for existing is like saying “Everybody stop all scientific research, because there is no fundamental reason for any of this”.Hawking also suggests that the act of creation is understandable purely within the realm of science, but doesn’t mention that we have no science that works at t=0. The science goof that nearly had me eating my kindle in apoplexy was when Hawking suggests that black holes have positive gravitational potential energy. If that were true, the milky way would be spread around the Universe. Hawking does do well at talking his way out of the fine tuning argument. He effectively kills that argument dead and I agree we do not need God to explain why the Universe is perfect for our existence. But my reply is that, people shouldn’t have been using that line of apologism in the first place because it doesn’t make theological sense, let alone scientific sense. According to Christian doctrine God made creation for himself, he did not make it for us.Hawking does well at explaining how quantum mechanics and relativity on intermediate scales produce Newtonian like physics. This is the Hawking we know and love and this book should have been full of this kind of stuff. Instead it is full of laughable pseudoscience and theology. Model dependent realism is not robust enough for Hawking’s confidence in it and doesn’t hold up to scrutiny or close inspection.The theological work in this is very much of the style of Dawkins and others who successfully disprove Gods of their own imagining. They create a God, give it powers and then disprove the God that they have created. But they don’t get anywhere near the God that people worship in churches. Hawking’s intellect outstrips his own imagination and it really shows in this work. I am very happily the other way around."

01.11.2016: Stephen Hawking warns that the Higgs Boson field could collapse, resulting in a chain reaction that would take in the whole universe with it.
 The nihilists have been right all along...M-theory: Doubts linger over godless multiverseSTEPHEN HAWKING'S new book The Grand Design sparked a furore over whether physics can be used to disprove the existence of God. But few have noted that the idea at the core of the book, M-theory, is the subject of an ongoing scientific debate – specifically over the very aspect of the theory that might scrap the need for a divine creator.That the laws of nature in our universe are finely tuned for life seems miraculous, leading some to invoke divine involvement. But if there is a multiverse out there – a multitude of universes, each with its own laws of physics – then the conditions we observe may not be unique.Source"

On the flip side, I had several light bulb moments, which is always nice.Among other things, Hawking makes a few great points particularly about the essence of ""reality.""And this passage below, which touches on free will, intrigued me.How can one tell if a being has free will? If one encounters an alien, how can one tell if it is just a robot or it has a mind of its own? The behavior of a robot would be completely determined, unlike that of a being with free will. Thus one could in principle detect a robot as a being whose actions can be predicted. As we said in Chapter 2, this may be impossibly difficult if the being is large and complex. We cannot even solve exactly the equations for three or more particles interacting with each other. Since an alien the size of a human would contain about a thousand trillion trillion particles even if the alien were a robot, it would be impossible to solve the equations and predict what it would do. We would therefore have to say that any complex being has free will--not as a fundamental feature, but as an effective theory, an admission of our inability to do the calculation that would enable us to predict its actions.So basically free will is an illusion, but given our inability to tease out all the complex biological processes that contribute to behavior, it is a good working theory for practical purposes. Thought this was an interesting way of looking at it.Worthy book, well written, and as good an attempt as any to simplify some very complex topics."

There were a couple of sections that I re-read, in an attempt to make concrete some of the more abstract aspects of m-theory. Despite my rudimentary understanding of quantum physics, I still gleaned a great deal from this book and would recommend it to anyone who is even mildly curious. Those who have a more advanced education in physics may find this book too basic, especially the earlier chapters.Questions such as ""What occurred before the big bang?"" and ""what instigated the creation of the universe?"" are addressed in the last chapter, and the earlier chapters build up a nice base of prior research for those unfamiliar with m-theory.

As is the case with most such gifts, I began to read it immediately.I was almost immediately turned off by the text owing to an extraordinary display of ignorance on the part of the authors and the editors, a mistake appearing in the first few pages in their lead-up to what is supposed to be a survey of the history of physics as germinated in Ionian philosophy. Here they note in passing that writing was first employed around 7000 BCE. In fact, so far as we've evidence, writing first appeared about 6000 years ago, in Sumer in approximately 4000 BCE.To make matters worse the authors go on glibly to dismiss philosophy as defunct--not too surprising as their review of it doesn't display much familiarity with the discipline.Beyond this, I found the jokes peppering this slim volume condescending yet sophomoric, unfunny and far too frequent.As regards the physics, I'm hardly qualified the judge, lacking as I do the background in mathematics and research physics to evaluate their positions. However, as someone with some background in philosophy and in the history of science, I find nothing original in their M theory business, such contextualization being rather old hat.There are many fine books written for generalists which attempt to explain modern cosmology and microphysics. This is not one of them."

At first we are told about the concept of formation of universe in the earlier times. From ancient Greeks to Galileo, Newton to Feynman , basic classical theories to the formulation of M-theory , this books tries to explain the fundamental questions related to Universe. It's a very good book if you are striving to comprehend the Universe scientifically . And the explanation is simple enough for a normal high school student to understand."
16,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill,5,"STEPHEN HAWKING WRITES VERY CLEARLY.That's like the big glaring thing I need to express with this review. Are you worried you won't understand science because it's dense and dry and has diagrams instead of pictures? This is the book for you, then -- short, succinct, full-colour, and most importantly: clearly explained. The concepts here are intense and heady, but Hawking (and Mlodinow) write about them in a way you can actually understand. The mathematics are lacking, so this is definitely pop-science (and when I tried to explain an experiment referenced to a friend, I realized I wasn't completely sure when or who had conducted it, so..a bibliography would have been nice?). It's like a cosmology buffet: chronologically organized, mostly, from mythology to M-theory, with a sampling of the ideas therein. You'll need to delve further for a real meaty meal, but as appetizers: this shit is high-class. I don't know that I loved it, but it did express wacko concepts in a way a layman can grasp, and if that's all it set out to do: kudos & job well done.Also the Fibonacci spirals at the end of each chapter kind of made my life ngl <3"
17,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9512361-andrew-langridge,1,"There are only a couple of positives that I can think to say about this book. Firstly, Hawking has some Feynman-like qualities in being able to lucidly express important ideas in physics such as time dilation in special relativity and the double slit experiment. Secondly, his philosophy of science that he calls model-based realism has many things going for it, although why it is called realism is never fully explained. I did not find this book particularly easy to read, probably because I did not believe from the outset that I was going to be enlightened about our origins.Hawking states ""Philosophy is dead"", but scientists should be especially circumspect when trying to extrapolate their ideas into the humanities. Contemporary readers are still able to detect an elusive thread of truth running through all great philosophical works, and that, like the great works of art, they certainly have not been superseded by developments in science. Scientists meddling in the humanities often give the impression of never having studied the subjects they are criticising and tend to make 'straw man' arguments. The question 'why are we here?' is supposedly solved by science, but is of much more profound significance than Hawking credits. We feel our lives to have value as well as function and our desire throughout history to find life meaningful cannot be dismissed as lacking any significance. 'Is there a creator?' I have no particular axe to grind in favour of religion, but Hawking hypocritically rehashes ancient philosophical arguments for the non-existence of God, such as ""who created God?"". Moreover, religions cannot be treated simply as ontologies devoid of all the mythical elements that have inspired some of the greatest products of art and civilisation. Indeed, Weber tells us that science itself was given impetus by Protestantism.Hawking spends a long time discussing 'anthropic' arguments, but I don't understand their significance. It is only strange that the universe has these particular values for the universal constants or that the Earth's orbit has this narrow range of orbital parameters leading to the evolution of humanity if you have some reference point outside the universe to assess it from. We are doing science from the perspective of the human race as we are here and now, so of course the universe appears to us to be evolved to suit us, otherwise we would not be here to do the science. Hawking advances M Theory as the key to explaining the universe. I am not sufficiently qualified to give an opinion on this, but one thing it seems possible to say is that 'multiverse' theories are unique in science not only for never having been tested but also for being impossible to test. A far-fetched theory for why the dinosaurs died out at least has the possibility of being tested against palaeontological evidence. Any notions we entertain to make the concept of causality apply beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause. I agree with Pliny (ancient wisdom that Hawking dismisses) who states the impossibility of measuring the universe or understanding how it arose. To me, 'universe' by definition means everything that exists, so how can there be any reference point outside it from which to measure it? Cosmological physics turns out paradoxes by the dozen. If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into? What caused the big bang? If we need mathematics to explain this, what makes us so sure we can rely on mathematics? And what about reasoning itself? What is truth? Oh darn it - another philosophical question!"
18,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1777325-julia,3,"I own several of Hawking's books, and so I was drawn to this thin volume. Obviously his co-author did most of the work, since Hawking's health continues to deteriorate. Mlodinow is a physicist at Caltech and an author in his own right. His name should appear as co-author, but my cynical brain thinks the publisher felt Hawking's name would sell more copies.Much time is given to Richard Feynman and his work in quantum physics. In fact, this book promotes the study of quantum theory as the main answer to human questions about existence. The book does a decent job of tracing the historical ways in which humans tried to comprehend the universe, but it does so in an egotistical way that bothers me. The very first page says ""philosophy is dead"" and advocates science as the only TRUE way to approach the deep human questions about the universe and our place in it.While I do hold science as the basis of my belief system, I'm just a bit concerned that Hawking put his name to a book that occasionally ""sniggers"" at the ides of earlier thinkers. Just because Ptolomy's design of the universe has been proven wrong should not denigrate the desire of his mind to understand the universe.So while I found some of the ideas interesting, WHOEVER really wrote this book comes across as rather egotistical. The sections on quantum theory are very complex, and I had to skip over some of the more esoteric parts.I've always found Hawking's books to be centered on his fascination with understanding this universe. In none of them did I ever find the condescention that is part of this book, and that's a danger for a scientist. Humility should be as important to a scientist as to a philosopher--Socrates knew that when he said he realized the Oracle of Delphi had claimed he was the wisest man in the world. He realized he WAS the wisest man only when he came to his famous conclusion that he ""knew nothing"". This book needed that humility lesson."

21,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35532567-alex,5,"He can get quite technical at times but overall a cogent read. In the end, he jumped a little for me. For example, here he tries to refute that a creator is required:""If the total energy of the universe must always remain zero, and it costs energy to create a body, how can a whole universe be created from nothing? That is why there must be a law like gravity. Because gravity is attractive, gravitational energy is negative: one has to do work to separate a gravitationally bound system... black holes have positive energy [and they balance out the negative energy]. That's why empty space is stable. [that is, a body cannot appear in empty space.] Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.Because gravity shapes space and time, it allows space-time to be locally stable but globally unstable. On the scale of the entire universe, the positive energy of the matter can be balanced by the negative gravitational enerby, and so there is no restriction on the creation of whole universes."" (p.180) Nevertheless, it's difficult to find a book of this length that does a better job at explaining some pretty mind-blowing concepts."
22,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"Ever since I was little, I remember the image of Stephen Hawking from TV. I don't know why, but he remained embroidered in my brain after watching a TV show that spoke of him. This must have been 10 years ago, or something like that, but when it was explained to me what he was and what he was doing and did and why he looked the way he looked (remember I was 7 or 8 so I was bound to ask hurtful questions), I became to develop this fondness towards him. In my late years (oh, I'm soooo old), when I was 15 or something like that I started searching information about his work. Now, we have to be clear on one point. I do not, never did and probably (though hopefully not) never will understand physics. It has always been beyond my grasp and I sucked ass at it both at school and at home. Physics for me has to be explained in words and verbal theories. When you lay formulas on a paper, you lost me. And I mean really lost me. This bad understanding of mine is somewhat minimized by the fact that once I understood and learned something, I will never forget it. My memory is really good, and I'm proud to say I've learned a bit of physics both in school and outside of it, just by having it explained over and over again by patient friends that took their time with me. Now, when it comes to anything more complex than normal, simple, high school physics, you lost me again. Quantum physics is something that is absolutely and completely beyond my grasp. Still, in this little book of his, Stephen Hawking managed to explain some things to me, not just me but all of us who read the book. And after finishing it, I felt like I kinda/sorta understood them. Now I know that Stephen Hawking himself isn't able to ""write"" a book. But I've been doing my research and I found out some amazing things about him. The way he pours his thoughts on a paper is by help of his assistant, who sits next to him and asks him simple questions like ""what word are you searching for?"". Then he goes on to trials ""reassuring? reassured? reassure?"". Whenever Hawking agrees to a word, he slightly blinks. Whenever he doesn't, he grins. This is painstaking work. It's horribly slow and you have to be incredibly patient in order to do that. It's monumental work, really, and it deserves respect. Another thing I found out about Stephen Hawking that really impressed me was the fact that when he realized he wouldn't be able to write on a paper and make written calculations of his theories, he developed, inside his mind, a way of ""looking at the universe"". Put simply, there's 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D. We people see 3D. Hawking has developed a means through which he sees, or better imagines in 4D, the dimension that includes time. Isn't that awesome?! I've barely learned to read and write in my whole life! Anyways. I feel like I turned this review into an essay about how great Hawking is. Oh well. Read the book. Read his other books. You'll understand more when you finish them. "

The book gives a good answer to the so-called ""anthropic principle""--namely, that the laws of physics and the fundamental constants appear to be perfectly tuned to allow our world, life, and humans to develop. If any of the laws or fundamental constants were to deviate even slightly, life might not be even possible.The answer to this dilemma, the authors state, is not that God created the laws of physics, and the answer is not that, by some fantastic coincidence, the laws of physics just happen to be perfect. Instead, an infinite number of universes have been created, each with its own unique set of laws. The book is interesting, but seems to fall down in the last chapter, titled, The Grand Design. In the last chapter, the authors argue that M-Theory is the only candidate theory that explains the universe--but that it has not yet been verified by observation. In fact, the authors state that M-Theory has not yet been fully developed; only some characteristics of the theory have been described. The wide, sweeping statements and conclusions made in the last chapter just don't seem to satisfy me."

27,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"I make no secret about the fact that I love science, and of all the sciences, I will make no secret about my love for physics, for theoretical physics, and for cosmology. These fields help us understand the universe, that crazy thing that’s all around us, and the fact that we have come so far is simply amazing. In The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow reflect upon how physics achieves this understanding of the universe, with a particular emphasis on how physics can explain the origin of the universe in a way that removes the need for a deity (whom we’ll call God).Mlodinow gets his name on the cover, but this is clearly a Hawking book first and foremost. His name is bigger, and the inside of the dust jacket begins, “The first major work in nearly a decade by one of the world’s great thinkers…"" (emphasis mine). Sorry, Mlodinow! You’re a nice guy, but I guess you’re just not a “great thinker”. (Actually, although I think I’d heard of him before, this is the first time I have encountered one of his “his” books, and now I can go and mark down a bunch of his other books to read. But I should probably talk about this book now.)I shall hereafter refer to Hawking and Mlodinow as “H&M” because it tickles my fancy to fantasize that a clothing chain might write a book on physics.The Grand Design is certainly an engaging treatise, but it is also problematic. I had a lot of fun reading it, and although I have a lot of experience reading about science, I feel confident recommending it for people who might otherwise quirk an eyebrow and say, “Erm … science? I don’t know….” It’s a very short book; it’s extremely conversational in tone, with plenty of analogies; and there are no tests at the end. There are even pictures (albeit not very good ones)! By problematic I mean that, from my own reading and from what I have read of reviews here on Goodreads, H&M confront the role of physics vis-à-vis religion in a way that doesn’t lend itself to clarity and suasion. There seems to be a disconnect between the evidence they present (which is very good) and how they phrase or otherwise communicate the conclusions they draw. This results in an ambiguity that means people will often misinterpret those conclusions or dismiss them out of hand. The Grand Design, one might say, suffers from a grand design flaw.(I am so sorry for that last sentence.)I can give an example from the very first page of the book, which, by the way, begins not with a foreword, preface, or introduction, but Chapter 1. It’s true that this first chapter is very much an introductory chapter that lays the ground for the rest of the book, but I have to give H&M and their editors credit for not subjecting us to another scientist pontificating about these guys or a token preface. The conciseness of this book is appreciated, even if it leads to pithy statements like this:Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.As someone who unequivocally supports science as a way to discover and understand the universe, I must nevertheless shake my head at this passage. Taken literally, it seems like an unnecessarily harsh indictment of philosophy, particularly contemporary philosophy, which is very much alive. Even leaving aside philosophy that concerns itself with things other than those questions (such as “Who are we? Where did we come from?”), philosophers routinely discuss developments in science in their philosophy. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that most scientists also become philosophers—as you will see if you read this book, it is clear that H&M are. However, to be fair to them, I think that what H&M are trying to distinguish—albeit sensationally—is the difference between purely attempting to reason about our existence and our origins (rationalism) and using tools to collect data and make inferences about that existence and those origins (empiricism). The program founded in the Western world by Aristotle and raised onto a pedestal by the Enlightenment scientists has failed: we cannot know the world through reason alone. Bacon, Newton, Galileo, Franklin, etc., realized that we must experiment—we have to conduct tests that anyone with the appropriate knowledge and equipment can reproduce. So philosophy alone cannot take us the entire way, and science provides that next crucial step.If you haven’t read the book, and especially if you approach physics with more wariness than I do, you will find this very weird, but I found the first half of the book much heavier than the last half (with one notable exception). Following that incendiary introductory passage, H&M segue into a deep discussion of what science is, where it is coming from, and where it might be going. Specifically, they introduce a concept called model-dependent realism. And I think this is a fascinating, perhaps even peculiar decision on their part, because I doubt many of their readers would have ever heard of this term—whereas, in comparison, even most laypeople will have heard words like “quantum mechanics” and “general relativity”. H&M have great confidence in their audience, for they have faith that the audience will not be deterred when they drop some philosophy of science in the first chapter.It makes sense to talk about model-dependent realism, though, because it is relevant to M-theory, which is the group of theories that H&M discuss as a candidate for the ultimate “theory of everything”. And kudos to H&M for trying to pull back the curtain on the somewhat mystical way “theories” are constructed and viewed (at least by some scientists). In particular, I love the analogy they use with a map of the world: we can’t accurately transfer a three-dimensional sphere to a two-dimensional surface, so no matter what projection we use (e.g., Mercator, Robinson), it will always be distorted. So just as different projections provide different but useful models of our world, different theories provide different but useful models of the universe. Some of these theories have been collected under the name “M-theory”, and together they might be “the answer” when none of them alone could make the cut.Of course, I like model-dependent realism, because I am a realist, and as H&M say, it “short-circuits all this argument and discussion between the realist and anti-realist schools of thought”. I won’t go into realism versus anti-realism here; that is probably best left for a deeper discussion of the philosophy of science. Suffice it to say, science is not about establishing a single, fixed “truth” outlined by a single set of theories. As H&M point out, Ptolemy and Kepler’s model of a geocentric orbit using epicycles is as valid as our heliocentric model—one certainly can regard the rest of the solar system as “orbiting” the Earth. Yet the geocentric model is fiendishly complex and quickly becomes unwieldy if one ever wants to perform actual calculations; the heliocentric model has the advantage of being simpler and more elegant. So these are all thoughts that H&M want us to consider as they launch into an overview of the state of physics in the twenty-first century.I like that H&M go to the trouble of distinguishing between “probability” as we use the term colloquially and the role probability plays in quantum mechanics. Nancy Kress discusses probability in quantum mechanics at length in 
Probability Sun
, but she only alludes to the difference rather than explicates it. Quantum mechanics is weird and strange and revolutionary precisely because of one word: uncertainty. It blew away the classical world, particularly the deterministic aspect. That pesky Heisenberg uncertainty principle means we’ll never know exactly where a particle is and how fast it is moving. Hence, according to quantum mechanics, asking where a particle is is a meaningless question. Rather, ask what the probability is of a particle being in a particular point in space-time. There is a probability that all the particles in my left arm might actually be in Switzerland right now, but the probability is tiny compared to the probability that they are, in fact, attached to my left shoulder! (And for this I am thankful.)Similarly, The Grand Design finally clarified for me what a boson is. I just have these song lyrics stuck in my head:They suppose that particles have mass becauseThere is this Higgs field that extends through all spaceAnd some particles slow down while other particles raceStraight through like the photon — it has no massBut something heavy like the top quark, it’s draggin’ its ***And the Higgs is a boson that carries a forceAnd makes particles take orders from the field that is its source.If you haven’t already seen it, the Large Hadron Rap is one of the most amazing science raps I have ever seen, and it does an excellent job at explaining what scientists are trying to achieve using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, I still wasn’t clear on this idea of bosons and force fields. Something about the way H&M explain bosons in The Grand Design finally made it click for me:… according to classical theories, forces are transmitted by fields. But in quantum ield theories the force fields are pictured as being made of various elementary particles called bosons, which are force-carrying particles that fly back and forth between matter particles, transmitting the forces.So the field and particle are dual concepts, one of which applies to classical theories (like relativity) while the other applies to quantum theory. Particles are the language of quantum mechanics, and so force fields have been replaced by a particle that conveys each force: photons for electromagnetism, gluons for the strong force, W and Z bosons for the weak force, and perhaps gravitons for gravity (we haven’t found them yet!). That’s really cool, and I am glad H&M cleared that up for me. This is why I read so many books that cover the same scientific concepts, even similar books by one author: each different method of explaining a concept aids my understanding in some small way.This kind of incremental learning is present in science as well. H&M mention, “Modern technology is sensitive enough to allow us to perform many sensitive tests of general relativity, and it has passed every one”. That relativity is testable and falsifiable—and, correspondingly, has passed all of the tests we have thus far devised—lends great credence to its accuracy as a scientific model. There are, of course, more subtle questions about the roles of testability and falsification play in judging a scientific theory (e.g.: Evolution is arguably not testable, nor is string theory.) What’s important is that H&M emphasize that science is not some kind of mysterious black box where we plug in data in order to obtain inviolable laws of nature. So that’s why I’m fine with people criticizing, say, evolution, because all science should be open to criticism—but the moment that criticism rests on an objection like “it’s only a ‘theory’!” I will stop listening. Our scientific principles are theories because science is self-correcting and constantly improving upon and revising those principles. That is why science is so powerful, so important, and so very cool.By far the most mind-boggling concept in The Grand Design comes at the end, and it is the exception to my earlier remark that I find the first part of the book the heaviest in terms of mental exertion. The ultimate thesis of this book is that we can explain the origin of the universe without invoking a creator deity, a God. I think it is very important to note that H&M are not saying that science can disprove the existence of God, nor is that an objective of The Grand Design. While it is clear that H&M, like myself, do not believe a God exists, this is not their argument. Instead, they are merely removing the necessity of God’s existence. I can see how one can misinterpret the book—hence my initial comments about the disconnect and design flaw. H&M’s scepticism is vividly demonstrated, and they raise some of the problems with attempting to fit God into cosmogony—namely, if God created the universe, who created God? If the answer is that “God is eternal and has always been here,” then why can’t we just replace “God” with “the universe” and leave it at that?This might seem impossible, for we know the universe is not eternal in that sense: we can measure its age (with some degree of precision), and it’s only 13.7 billion years old! Moreover, we know that the universe will eventually reach some sort of end, whether it is heat death, a Big Crunch, etc. H&M resolve this, and that unfortunate singularity at the origin of the universe that prevents our physics from explaining anything, by saying:In the early universe—when the universe was small enough to be governed by both general relativity and quantum theory—there were effectively four dimensions of space and none of time. That means that when we speak of the “beginning” of the universe, we are skirting the subtle issue that as we look backward toward the very early universe, time as we know it does not exist! We must accept that our usual ideas of space and time do not apply to the very early universe.Read that twice: asking what happened “before” the universe existed is meaningless, because time itself did not exist as we regard it today. If that sounds too strange and too incredible to accept, believe me: you are certainly not alone. Much like my experience with bosons, I am only now, after confronting this several times, beginning to wrap my head around this explanation. We are just so obsessed with our view of linear time that thinking of a universe where time functions differently boggles our intuition. It is definitely the most difficult concept H&M present in this book, and as with some of their other explanations, I do not think they entirely succeed in presenting it the way they probably hoped.The Grand Design is ambitious. It is also brief and conversational, as physics books go, and at times this runs up against that ambition. As someone who loves the philosophy of science, loves physics, and has read quite a lot of books about physics, I enjoyed The Grand Design and found it enlightening. Although I recommend it to others with less experience, because it really is a very accessible book, I do so with one reservation: if this is your first physics book, don’t let it be your last. There are so many good ones out there, and while The Grand Design is a fine place to start, it is not the last word on the theory of everything.

28,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120477-jacob,3,"I've read snippets of Hawking's books before and enjoyed them. The particular theme of this one interested me so I picked it up. It started out with some creation myths and a well-paced history of bigger picture science. It bogged down in the middle with an exploration of quantam physics that the author felt was necessary for his subsequent theory of Grand Design, but in reality did little for his theory or the book as a whole.In fact, while engaging, fun to read, and highly informative, the book falls flat at the end. The line of reasoning, from my perspective, leaves much to be desired. Consider a few quotes from the last chapter:""It is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, the the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. In this view it is accepted that some entity exists that needs no creator, and that entity is called God. We claim, however, that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings""While I find the philosophical question of who created God, highly intriguing, I think Mr. Hawking confuses the fact that we are constantly finding laws that govern existence, thereby explaining what we thought was only attributable to divine interference as proof that the divine does not exist. Take this next quote:""Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.""Really? Is it any less plausible that the universe just started randomly 13 billion years ago than a supreme being created it? Either line of thought requires a good amount of faith to believe in. It reminds me of C.S. Lewis' arguments for the existence of God and how they all fell short if you did not start from the premise of belief in something more than the random universe--ultimately you have to believe one way or the other and no amount of ""proof"" will stand up to scrutiny because there is simply too much we don't know.Regarding the Grand Design itself:""M-theory is the UNIFIED [caps mine] theory Einstein was hoping to find. The fact that we human beings-who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature-have been able to come this close to understanding of the laws governing us and our universe is a great triumph...If the theory is confirmed by observation, it will be the successful conclusion of a search going back more than 3000 years. We will have found the grand design.""This is from the last paragraph in the book. The problem is that there is nothing unified about M-theory. Hawking states this in his opening chapter and we learn later in the book that M-theory takes into account electromagnetism, strong forces, weak forces, and string theory in order to produce a multi-verse version of reality that includes 10 to the 500th power possibilities. Not only is this pretty far from fathomable to the average man, but it violates his first two principle of a good model from chapter 3, ""A model is a good model if it: 1. Is elegant 2. Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements"". A convoluted mish-mash of theories that produces so many various elements (mathematically computable or not) is hardly a ""good model"". Due to the sheer volume of calculations necessary it is hard to confirm fulfillment of the last two criteria that the good model: ""3. Agrees with and explains all existing observations 4. Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out.""Don't get me wrong. I am no quantam physicist nor cosmologist and certainly don't have the knowledge to disprove any theories in these fields. Likely we are on the right track with something like M-theory. However, it is not an easily understood unified theory (such may not even exist), and it certainly doesn't provide any answers about the why of the universe as it claims to. As with much of both science and religion, the more we learn and understand, the more questions arise.The poor finishing premises of this book and agonizingly thick explanations in the middle of this work, knock it down two notches, but it is still worth the read if this sort of thing interests you. Solid 3 stars."

There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”(Douglas Adams)This book totally agrees with that, in the end. I have this book because my sixteen-year-old stepson had to buy it for a class he was going to take, and then decided not to take the class. Perhaps that’s why I so strongly perceive it as written toward a “younger” audience. But, as with a lot of things written by very intelligent people toward an audience they knew to be dumber than they are, there are a lot of jokes that sort of insult your intelligence without really meaning to. You know, the kind of jokes that make teenagers really roll their eyes, which is especially bad when they’re in there to try to “relate to” the very people who roll their eyes at it.In talking about the Stoics describing “physical processes in legal terms and [believing] them to be in need of enforcement, even though the objects required to ‘obey’ the laws were inanimate”: “If you think it is hard to get humans to follow traffic laws, imagine convincing an asteroid to move along an ellipse.”It tends to be distracting and awkward and tacked-in-there. And it’s not needed; the book’s written in simple language, and it’s exceedingly easy to read, which makes it easy to be interested in it so long as one has at least a little interest in the subject anyway--which is not something these jokes would induce in any case. Still, it wasn’t enough to really degrade my opinion of the book.I did get a little frustrated with the over-simplification of things here and there, because so many times that kind of thing leaves out the explanations I come into this kind of thing looking for. And when I get all frustrated like that, I miss things, which was my main problem in college. The teachers tend to want to get to this point or that point and spit out some model along the way that I’d really like to dwell on, but their explanation is, “It exists because we need it for the equation all of us are on now so come on, come on.”I don’t even like to think about how long it took me to finally figure out where π came from and why we use it, and how frustrated I was with teachers who kept telling me, “Just feed your numbers into the formula and give the damn answer.”But I only hit that wall, really, there in the middle. The thing I found most useful about the book was the scientific history lessons. Reminders of when people like Newton and Aristotle lived, and just what they came up with---before we modified and reworded it. That was my favorite aspect of the book by far.My other favorite thing was the introduction to John Conway’s Game of Life. And I can’t believe I’ve never run across it before. How completely and utterly baffling, to me, that I never have. (Or maybe I have and it was just never presented in such a memorable way?) You can even download it and play with it as a “game”: http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/I’m not sure either of those links can show at all why I love the implications so much (because I haven’t actually read through those sites), but to explain I have to plagiarize pages of this book, so I’ll leave it be. And maybe call a buddy to see if he can download Life for me. Heh."
30,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,2,"The blurb calls this a major work. It's not. I know I'm in a minority, but I am not a fan of Stephen Hawking as a popularizer. Undeniably, he is a major physicist, and I remember liking his Brief History of Time, but I read that a long time ago. His popular works since are all very oversimplified, and this one could almost be considered as a children's or YA book -- I would have no problem with it if it were marketed as such. But as an adult book, it covers no new ground which is not covered in more depth in many other popular science books.He begins by saying that ""philosophy is dead"", replaced by science. Okay, as someone with a degree in philosophy that may have prejudiced me to begin with. He then spends about 15% of this very short book giving a lightweight history of philosophy, not only oversimplified but full of errors. For example, he calls Thomas Aquinas an ""early Christian philosopher"" -- even if we consider modern philosophers who happen to be Christians as ""Christian philosophers"", he was past the middle, closer to today in time than to the real ""early Christian"" philosophers like Tertullian, Origen and Augustine. He calls Aristotle the leader in rejecting observational science -- actually he was probably the best observational scientist in antiquity, especially in his specialty of marine biology. He contrasts him to Galileo on the question of falling bodies -- probably it was Aristotle who actually experimented on this, dropping objects in liquid to slow them down and thereby discovering the laws of bodies at final velocity; while Galileo certainly never dropped the balls from the tower of Pisa -- he didn't have the instruments to prove anything that way anyway -- and whether he did the experiment with inclined planes is open to doubt (his first edition talks about rolling balls, which would have given very different results than he claimed; the later editions correct it to sliding blocks.)Hawking then moves to physics ""lite"", and while I'm not presumptuous enough to claim there were errors, it was certainly very oversimplified. His ""philosophy"" of ""model-dependent realism"" is presented very simplistically, without any consideration of the philosophical issues it raises. He gives very briefly all the standard analogies and examples which are in every book on relativity and quantum theory, from the two-slit experiment to the inflating balloon, and almost nothing which is not found everywhere else. The book is very short; the actual text, excluding the glossary, acknowledgements and index (there is no bibliography at all), is about 180 pages, of which 30 are either just chapter titles, blank, or ornamental illustrations. The font size is very large, and there are unnecessary large illustrations throughout, giving it the appearance of a children's book -- I know he has physical limitations on writing long books, and has more important things to work on, but it would have been more honest to write a short book than to pad it out to look longer than it is.Only the last ten or fifteen pages have anything which might be new to some people (but it's all in his earlier books) -- the no-boundary condition as a basis for the multiverse, very lightly explained. I was very disappointed in this book."
31,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13151041-manish-sinha,4,"This book isn't for beginners. They should first read more simpler books before starting with this one. The first few chapters of the book are relatively easy to understand and need just basic physics to understand. It assumed you remember concepts of physics like matter-wave-duality. It even assumes you have a basic knowledge of our view of universe some two hundred years back like we are in center of universe etc.The book contains beautiful graphical depictions and photos. It makes the book easy to read and to some extent interesting.This book asks a beautiful philosophical question ""What is reality?"". It explains that our knowledge of ""reality"" keeps on changing as we question ourselves and build our the scientific temper.Later on in the book Hawking uses more difficult terms like space-time and references to Feynman which some people might want to skip if they don't have a stronger physics background.One of the most interesting chapter is ""Choosing our Universe"". In that chapter he explains Creation myths in various cultures and traditions. Then he goes ahead and explains the big bang and how galaxies are expanding, terms like gravity well, space-time wrap etc.Explaining the book in more detail would act like a baaad spoiler. I guess my review did act a spoiler to some extent, but I would prefer to put it forward as a ""trailer"" to the beautiful journey of reading the book."
32,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2284638-jonathan,2,"The subtitle to this book could have been ""Assertions in search of an argument."" The book isn't documented and arguments aren't given at some key points. Hawking and Mlodinow also manage to make themselves look a little naive at times. For example, stating, in the very beginning of the book, that ""philosophy is dead"" and then going on to rest their entire theory on a (highly controversial) philosophical theory of model-dependent realism. Of course, Hawking is a huge authority in the eyes of the public, so the layperson will eat this stuff up, hook, line, and sinker. Unfortunately, I'm sure I'll be hearing about how Feynman's sum-over-histories proves the many worlds hypothesis for a long time my now, by people who really have no idea what exactly it is or how exactly it proves it.

I personally enjoy this topic, but can very easily see how folks not to keen on understanding many of the topics enclosed, can be stuck rereading many portions of the book. I went with 4 of 5 stars, as I am a tad disappointed that it seemed some questions were a little skirted around. Otherwise I found it very insightful and very fun. M-theory is a complex unified theory of essentially the makeup of everything, explained throughout this book with fun diagrams and medium difficulty explanations by one of the most brilliant minds of our time.Simply put, its a great read for those looking to venture into the beginning of the great scientific rabbit hole that is the understanding of why we all are here.""The fact that we human beings - who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature - have been able to come this close to an understanding of the laws governing us and our universe is a great triumph."" -pg 181"

36,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,4,"As a longtime fan of the popular science books of the late Stephen Hawking it is nice to be able to extolled his book co-authorized by Leonard Mlodinow, The Grand Design. Because so much of this book is about quantum mechanics it can be hard on almost all readers. Advanced level readers will find it too basic and perhaps dislike the orientation/history that opens the book. Readers with little or no background should be relatively comfortable. For myself I remember the several versions of the statements made in this book. If you think you understand Quantum, you don’t. Or the better one: If thinking about Quantum mechanics does not blow your mind, then you do not understand it.Having read the book, I can say without shame that my mind is blown, but in a very positive way. The lack of lineal logic makes a logic of its own. I had been one to argue, loudly that ours is a world of cause and effect. Not fully appreciating I was stuck in a Newtonian world and behind by everything since before Einstein. The universe is much more likely: cause and most likely or probable effect. The various qualifiers “likely” and “probable” are deliberate and more in line with a host of things we now think we know and that call into question a lot about what we were certain we knew. Physics and math still rule but only up to a more or less predictable limit.A friend of mine, a Ph. D Physics and with profound religious beliefs once proposed that the space between cause and effect and cause and probable effect is where God can(?) express his/her will. He may be right.Two specific explanations in The Grand Design stand out as particularly enlightening. We are bound by our senses in what we can understand. If we are so many gold fishes living in gold fishbowls, our view of the universe would be of a more curved and less linear universe. Our models of the universe would reflect our experience of relating to the universe through the distortion of the gold fish bowl. It would be unlikely that any experiment we designed or results we generated could be controlled for the limits on our ability to comprehend our model of the universe. It is therefore just as likely that as humans we are bound to the universe we are in and unable to build experiments beyond the limits of this particular universe. Could we escape the limits of the models we can imagine and the limits on reading our test results, it may be that we could close the gap in the in the probable side of cause and effect, or we might just find new ways to reach the same limitationsAgainst those who write science fiction based on the notion that there are other universes, and play with the variations possible in a ‘mega’ universe of unlimited alternate universes, Hawking and Mlodinow limit the number of possible universes to something like 1 *10 to the 100th power. So we are in one of a google-plex of possible worlds and that number can vary as some will be less stable than others. Creating an ongoing cycle of new ones from the matter and energy of the less stable.On a more specific level, I had never had much respect for Feynman’s concept of sum over histories. That any given time particles take every possible path to where ever they are finally detected. Rather like one of us buying tickets from LA to Las Vegas via every possible combination of flights that leave the LA Airport in any given time but ultimately connect to the McCarran International Airport in North Vegas. Nevermind the problem of us being in several airplanes at the same time. Quantum allows for that, or something like it; who among us has at the sub atomic or economic level has that much energy or that much money? Via the illustrations and the rest, I think I almost get that in the sum over histories, some possibilities cancel out others with the results favoring only a few probabilities. So that maybe LA to Bakersfield to Las Vegas makes some kind of sense and therefore has some probability; while LA to Hong Kong to Atlanta, back to San Francisco and then to Vegas, not as much.Having read other Stephen Hawking’s books before, The Grand Design has some very high quality illustrations and some wonderful cartoons. In the cartoons I detect the famous Hawking’s wit but in the great and greatly helpful illustrations I speculate that I see the previously unknown (to me) hand of Leonard Mlodinow.Once again a relatively readable book. Perhaps better for the sometime dabbler in physics and less so for the serious student. In my day we had college classes affectionately known as Physics for poets. The Grand Design might be perfect for that reader."

It is a thought-provoking and a fascinating journey that makes us meditate and question our deepest convictions. Thanks to this book, I had a glance at the amazing world of modern physics that I couldn't find anywhere else since all the documentries that claim explaining those concepts do nothing but mystifying us even more.Though it is a pro-atheist assay, the scientific concepts are well explained and nicely illustrated. What we know today about our universe is amazingly puzzling ! Scientific theories are now based on mathematics so advanced that they no longer agree with our everyday experience, and it makes them hard to imagine. Space, time, the cause-and-effect principle and other corner stones of our reasoning are twisted and sometimes abandoned in modern physics. Though the authour doesn't see any other miracle in all of these phenomena but the maths and us wodering about it, I see miracles everywhere ! "
38,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54949416-najmi-ayob,5,"A great book, provocative yet amazing. This book is proposing M-theory (a candidate for the TOE) but it does so gracefully. One does not simply shove quantum physics and the questions of laws of nature so easily at people. To introduce ""heavy"" concepts, the authors infused the appropriate amount of relatable humours. The authors also beautifully picked up human histories that reflects each modern achievement in physics, which is very interesting to look at. This is indeed the first time I have ever smile and laughed at a book about quantum physics. Oh Lord, I love the language. It is so easy to understand the language yet it is by no means superficial. It is as grand as its title. I would suggest all science students to make this book a compulsory reading, for its ways of argument and logic will be very helpful. It is also helpful for those who are practicing to communicate the sciences. Science in this book, is very well-communicated."
39,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12011253-mikael-cerbing,4,"This is an interesting book in many ways. I have read a fair bit of science history so those parts of the book I already knew and understood (mostly). But when it comes to the actuall science I have no idea. I recognise a fair bit of it from earlier readings, but recognition and understanding is two compleatly different things. Then again, can you understand modern physics? You can understand the math, the experiments and the applications. But can you really grasp what it means? As a monkey from the grass plains of Africa. “If you are not completely confused by quantum mechanics, you do not understand it” as one physisist put it. And I am both confused and I dont understand it. But that is not the fault of this book, its me and (I am pretty sure) my evoultionary history. Planck scale makes no sense. The big numbers in this book makes no sense. My brain has not evolved to grasp these concepts. And I dont think anyones have. But if you have the math, at least you can get a theoretical understanding of it. I have no idea if the M-theory is the right one, no one seems to do, so I Guess we will have to wait another 20-30 years and see what they find out. "

There were many jokes snuck into the writing, some reminding me strongly of A Series of Unfortunate Events (paraphrased from this book: symmetrical like a doughnut, unless one side has chocolate topping in which case it would be better to eat it.) The jokes could be odd or incongruous but were not dwelt upon which gave them an added charm of just being snuck in. The philosophical nature of the books ideas, and how easily points could be applied outside of science did well at grabbing my imagination."

""The Grand Design"" is one of the most ambitious books ever written by one of the world's great thinkers. It attempts to answer the ultimate questions of life through science. The ultimate question of course and the title of this book, is the apparent grand design offer proof for a supernatural designer. This fascinating 208-page book, is composed of the following eight chapters: 1. The Mystery of Being, 2. The Rule of Law, 3. What Is Reality, 4. Alternative Histories, 5. The Theory of Everything, 6. Choosing Our Universe, 7. The Apparent Miracle, and 8. The Grand Design. Positives: 1. An ambitious book that is well-written, well-researched and concise. 2. Surprisingly accessible book that is profound without being unintelligible. 3. Evenhanded, respectful tone throughout. 4. In essence, a modern update to life's biggest questions. 5. No complex mathematical equations to worry about, elegant prose was used to convey concepts. 6. Great use of illustrations. 7. This book is in essence about the M-theory Network. What phenomena it describes and what are the limitations. 8. Thought-provoking book indeed and fascinating quotes, ""Ignorance of nature's ways led people in ancient times to invent gods to lord it over every aspect of human life"". 9. An interesting look at the history of scientific inquiry. 10. Fascinating tidbits throughout. 11. The debunking of free will. 12. The explanation of what constitutes an effective theory in physics. 13. Model-dependent realism defined. Very interesting. 14. The explanation of what quantum physics really is. 15. Special and general relativity in context. 16. The search for quantum versions of the laws of physics. 17. The never-ending quest for the theory of everything. 18. The history of the ""big bang"". 19. A clear explanation of what we do know versus what we don't know. 20. The realization that time behaves like space... 21. The anthropic principles defined. 22. The triple alpha process...who knew? 23. The multiverse concept defined and how it can explain the fine-tuning of physical laws. 24. Spontaneous creation. 25. A much needed glossary of terms. Negatives: 1. Will disappoint the more scientifically minded as this book was written for the masses. 2. This is an accessible book by design but the nature of physics is so complex that it will still leave some readers dumfounded. 3. The book's hype may have lead some readers with the wrong impression and thus not satisfied with the end result. 4. I think some readers expected new groundbreaking ideas (and please correct me if I'm wrong) but in reality it's a book that provides the latest in scientific knowledge and future aspirations. 5. Philosophy is still alive and well. 6. He has yet to find the Holy Grail of Physics. In other words, the book feels incomplete because it is. In summary, this is a very solid concise book but it doesn't ultimately answer all the questions and will leave those readers with higher albeit unreasonable expectations with a degree of dissatisfaction. It's a book meant for the masses and in that respect accomplishes what it sought out to do. However, for those with higher physics acumen this book as evidenced by the reviews from readers who hold Hawking in high regard, it will be disappointing. If you are a layperson this book is a worthwhile read, on the other hand wait for a more advanced edition or book. Recommendations: ""Physics of the Future"" by Michio Kaku, ""The Age of Everything"" by Mathew Hedman, and ""The Elegant Universe"" by Brian Greene."

45,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256070-jose,2,"I think this book deserves one star but I can't bring myself to give that rating to a book by the great Stephen Hawking. I don't even know where to start... if you read A Brief History of Time just reread that. That book is light years ahead and I honestly thought maybe this one was meant for adolescents. There is some interesting discussion in the beginning about the nature of physical models but it is quickly abandoned. Ok that's fine, bring on the ""real"" science right? Wrong. In fact the entire book rushes through topics quickly and unsatisfyingly. There are a few nuggets but for a book that I read in just 3 QUICK sittings this is not enough. I did like reading it but it was all stuff I had seen before and to better depth. Maybe I just came with too high of expectations.The book claims to offer answers to the BIG questions. If you didn't know much about modern physics and saw this get ready for a big disappointment. Surprise! science doesn't know why the universe came into existence. It also doesn't know why the universe has the laws it does have. The book claims it is because there are many universes and we happen to be in one with ""good"" laws. Does that pass anybody's BS test? In fact, upon my reading it's hard not to conclude that current physics is pretty utterly lost. I don't know how Mr. Hawking can think string theory is anything more than a giant math trick. Physical theories have to be experimentally grounded and M Theory is a joke. By the way, it is barely, barely defined here! Not even the traditional high level description of it. I'm sorry but when our best unified physical theory for the universe calls for the existence of an enormous amount of parallel universes and is untestable... it is worthless. "
46,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5496860-julie-shennan,1,"THE problem with Stephen Hawking’s creation theory is it’s not his theory. His latest novel The Grand Design paraphrases every scientific, religious and mythological hypothesis of the universe, except his own. After 180 pages of mind numbing reading, I reached the conclusion, hoping beyond hope, this would be Hawking’s big revelation. Alas, it wasn’t, instead he said, ‘the M - theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe’...That would be Edward Witten’s M Theory. What is this M Theory? Well, I got the impression that it was just a combination of theories which offered a spatial reading of creation, no pun intended. These theories outline that cosmos aren’t linear so don’t have a set matter, place, era or event in which they started, such as the creation of our universe. The theories also state multiple universes were created at the same time, with different environments and natural laws.Hawkins argues this spatial reading of creation clashes with the Christian First Cause Theory, because it suggests that there was never a blank canvas for God to create life from. He also claims that the simultaneous creation of multiple universes suggest that our planet is not unique in its hospitable climate, and so was not created especially for us, as the Grand Design theory suggests.Yet, Hawkins critique of Christianity is unoriginal, and with no evidence to further Edward Witten’s theory I can’t help but think if The Grand Design were a dissertation, it would merit a fail."
47,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45877282-jeffrey-debris,5,"It's almost impossible to imagine that Stephen Hawking has passed away. He was one of our brightest minds and reading this book has changed the way I perceive reality in quite a few ways. The book starts with this sentence: ""We each exist for but a short time, and in that time explore but a small part of the whole universe."" Given just how mindbogglingly big our universe is, this sentence hit home right away for me.Hawking then goes on to inspire us, by saying that the Human species is a curious one, in constant search of answers to questions. This book aims to answer a couple of the great ones in our lives. What is reality? Does God exist? Does a multiverse exist?Each chapter in this wonderful book aims at giving an answer to these important questions. Hawking lays it all out in front of the reader in language that even the layman (like me) can understand. He does so with a smooth writing style and a touch of humour, which keeps things a bit lighter than they really are.This is one of those books you really want to have in your collection for more than one reason. It aims to explain, but it will also spark your imagination, and make you want to learn more about our universe. I will definitely pick this one up again at some time, simply to remind myself just how brilliant a mind Stephen Hawking had and how science can possibly be our greatest hope of survival in this crazy, chaotic world we live in."
48,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,3,"Hawking is a terrific self-promoter, and he managed to grab a lot of headlines for this book by claiming he'd killed God or whatever, but the truth is there's very little in this book that Brian Greene didn't cover - and cover better - ten years ago. In fact, a lot of this is stuff Hawking himself has covered in A Brief History of Time.In the last chapter he brings up Conway and Turing and things get significantly more interesting, but it's too late by that time, since Hawking apparently feels he can't publish a book of more than 200 pages. I felt like we were at the start of something interesting there; I would've liked to hear more about it.In general, this confirms that I'm not a big fan of Hawking. He bills himself as ""science explained for the masses,"" but he doesn't actually explain things all that well - or, at least, there are folks who can explain it better. And in trying to cover so much in his books, he ends up covering nothing well enough."
49,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12508032-jyotsna,2,"Actual rating: 2.5 starsI kind of have mixed feelings about this book. What I did not like: This is a book by physicists for physicists. Being an engineer and having had a good interest in physics, the book was easier to read, but if any person with no background of physics picked this up, they would be totally lost! This book is not for the masses, it purely talks to those intellectuals in the science field. What I liked: The good explanation of physics and mainly theoretical physics as a whole. I liked the breakdown of various theories from Newtonian physics to Quantum physics.  The idea of attempting to explain the universe in a scientific manner does work as the writers assume that you have to go from A to Z and not feed you the intermediate steps directly. In short, a well organised book.Conclusion: Only read if you are actually aware of basic physics. Otherwise, you may not enjoy it that much."
50,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651858-george-musser,2,"Frankly I found the book incoherent. It argues on the one hand that a final theory of physics is unattainable, because there's no objective way to decide among competing theories (a position they call ""model-dependent realism""), and on the other hand, it says that physicists have found such a theory: M-theory. The authors do not acknowledge this apparent contradiction, let alone explain how it might be resolved. (I personally think it can be done, but shouldn't the authors do this for us?) Crucial concepts, such as why M-theory should be taken as the final theory to begin with, are hardly explained, and the authors present model-dependent realism as though it were their own brainchild, not acknowledging the work of Poincare, Bohr, and the positivists."

This is not a book for scientists, and unless the reader is willing to accept all that is said at face value, trying to find supporting information within these pages is largely futile (the motivated reader might search for such support elsewhere). And the punch line, that M-Theory (undefined) may answer all questions about the origins and nature of the physical universe, is pretty much left undeveloped. The book is nevertheless interesting if only to glean a bit of insight into some (pretty counter-intuitive) alternative explanations of reality. "

56,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162048-james-carroll,4,"""Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge."" Stephen HawkingI couldn't agree with that statement more. Some of his other conclusions in the book from which the quote was taken ""The Grand Design""... not so much.But in what way is philosophy dead? Clearly the love of wisdom is not dead, but it may well be that the field of liberal arts philosophy may indeed be dead (or at least loosing relevance and productivity). To attempt to discover the real truth requires more than sitting and thinking, it requires observation, and then modeling, which requires math. This means that today the mathematicians and physicists are doing the real leg work of philosophy, while the liberal arts philosophers are, for the most part, spinning their wheels. There is a feeling that theology and philosophy should be the ones asking the questions about morality, theology, meaning, and God, while science should keep its distance. But I believe that you can't ask these questions correctly without a firm grounding in the observations of science and physics, which MUST inform any inquiry into philosophy, or even theology. As Einstein said, science without theology is lame (in the sense of not having the power to move things forward), while theology without science is blind (in the sense of moving forward, but not seeing where it is really going). Therefore, I find that I simply can not agree with those that say that science should leave such theological matters to religion. In my view, Stephen Hawking has every right to venture into the field of theology, and to bravely see what implications his understanding of the laws of physics has on his understanding of God. This is a useful and potentially very productive undertaking.Let us take some of Hawking's conclusions in this book as an example, and see how science can inform theology:1. In the beginning, the world was very small, thus the rules of Quantum Mechanics hold, and things like the universe can (and indeed will) appear out of nothing without violating the rules of quantum mechanics, so long as it eventually cancels itself out, just as virtual particles usually do.2. The universe has an equal amount of positive and negative energy, and so is a cosmic free lunch, and can (and will) appear out of nothing (essentially, the universe cancels itself out, much like virtual particles do).3. But the universe was also hugely massive, so it followed not only the rules of quantum mechanics, but also the rules of relativity, which says that mass bends space and time, and at the point where you have enough mass to make a black hole (as we clearly had in the early universe), time itself stops, so there IS no time before the big bang, time curves back upon itself, and comes to a single closed point, creating a beginning not only of the universe, but of time itself, and thus it creates a beginning to the chain of causation. The chain of causation (where the causes come before the results) comes to an end at the Big bang, which necessarily had no cause, because there was no time before the big bang for that cause to act in. His conclusion? There is no God in the platonic sense of the ""prime mover"" or ""first cause"" because 1. we don't need him to explain how and why the universe could come into being, (quantum mechanics does that) and 2. there could be no creator of the universe, because there was no time before the universe was created for Him to act in. Essentially, God could not ""cause"" the universe, because relativity guarantees that there was no time in which he could act to initiate such a cause, and after the big bang bangs, we don't need Him to explain the progression of the universe from that point on (the laws of nature do that). Whether or not you agree with these conclusions (which I do not), it is clear that a firm understanding of the issues surrounding quantum mechanics should indeed necessarily inform our theology. Even if his reasoning here is flawed, that is the way science works. It is necessary for someone to make these sorts of inferences, so that science can move forward and either prove or disprove this theory.So, why don't I come to the same conclusions as Hawking? His reasoning appears rather solid at first glance. However, relativity and quantum mechanics are notorious for their inability to play nicely together, and there are a myriad of potential theories that have been proposed in an attempt to produce a good theory of quantum gravity. He is here espousing one of these theories, granted, it is the one that is (so far) the most mathematically robust, but it is by no means the only solution to this problem. For example, some theories of quantized time predict a big bounce instead of a big bang, in which case there was indeed time before the big bang. Another competing theory predicts that two of the membranes predicted by M-theory collided, producing the big bang, again, this is a theory that predicts time before the big bang. Still other theories predict that there are other dimensions of time, outside of our own. It is also unclear to some whether quantum fluctuations can create virtual particles without space or time in which to create them, which could cast doubt on whether a quantum fluctuation alone could create the universe from no-where and no-when. The possibilities are nearly endless. And, most importantly, we have yet to find observations that can clearly differentiate between many of these competing theories. Essentially, we have no observationally verified theory of quantum gravity, which is necessary before we can make any real predictions of how the universe behaved in these early moments that are so essential to Hawking's arguments.So, if we take this into consideration, we can rephrase Stephen Hawking's brilliant deduction differently. IF we accept THIS theory of quantum gravity, together with its predictions about quantum fluctuations and the beginning of time, THEN the universe necessarily had no cause within our dimension of time, and thus, there is no God that exists solely within our universe's dimension of time. I believe that this is a valid deduction, and, to some extent, it should inform our understanding of God. It is only unfortunate that he didn't state his conclusions with this level of cautiousness. Instead, he is far more confident in his conclusions than is warranted by the data, and he leaves out the many ""if""s that should have preceded his conclusion. This was perhaps my only serious disagreement with the Book.And what of my own conclusions about God? That is not really what this review is about, but to be short:Theleologians in my chosen branch of Christianity have often said that God does not just predict the future, he quite literally sees it. For this to be the case, God must, of necessity, exist outside of our dimension of time, and likely outside of our dimensions of space as well. I find the fact that science is now predicting a universe of multiple dimensions and multiple universes (some with different laws of physics), and is finding that God cannot exist only within our dimension of time and still create the universe, to be quite faith promoting since that is in line with what I believed all along. Stephen Hawking would likely take issue with my interpretation of his work, but hey, that is what Science is all about, and we should be grateful to Stephen Hawking for so clearly expressing this brilliant deduction.

Did they manage to do so?, I doubt!Trying first to disqualify Philosophy saying it’s dead ( although mere advances started first from philosophers’ thinking -true or false- but it was just a start!, then building the meaning of reality ( which was basically philosophical at first, then continued by simple explanations of Quantum Physics and some other terms: ( 4 forces of nature, General relativity, Special relativity, QED, QCD & GUT). All that was good & easy to follow, while some other terms & principals were not that easy [Like: re-normalization, W+, W- & Z0 particles , or other philosophical descriptions(again) as creating history by our own observations rather than history creating us], the last model of creation (Game of life) & its shape models was quite difficult to fathom!The last 2 chapters were quite contradictory to each other, while in Chapter 7 “The Apparent Miracle” was in my opinion an evidence that this universe can’t be a result of a coincidence as in page 160 ( Change those rules of our universe just a bit, and the conditions for our existence disappear! ), Chapter 8 “The Grand Design “ page 179, claims arrogantly that ( we are the creators - we choose the initial state of the universe by specifying objects and their positions at the start of the game). Where were we when we started selecting all these laws & conditions?!! The weakest point in this book, that it didn’t describe well the theories that the M-theory consists of, hence when last phrase in the book confirms that this theory isn’t confirmed by observations, then it became totally vague to confirm the writers’ opinion at all!!

In this book he explains why there is something rather than nothing, and whether that existence requires a deity to drive it. He simplifies to a great extent an extraordinarily complex subject, although without a working understanding of the necessary math, no lay person can truly claim to understand the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, string theory, or M-theory. Hawking certainly makes it possible for us to get a feel for the subject, though, without scaring us away with equations. If you want a lucid introduction to current theories of cosmology, read this book. And Hawking's wry humor infuses the text. "

The essence is that ""M-Theory"" is what seems to be most promising theory of unified forces as of now and involves multiverses.A good read for someone who is not completely a layman in this subject and for someone who is not totally into this subject."
63,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078732-will,3,"I decided to read this book because there have been so many attacks on it by people offended that Hawking had the audacity to propose a model of the universe that could have come into being without the help of a divine being.The book itself is not very long but it is filled to the brim with information about the evolution of scientific knowledge throughout history. If you don't have any previous knowledge or understanding about general relativity, quantum physics, string theory, cosmology or a background in mathematics, it is going to be a difficult read even though Hawking does a very good job of making these esoteric topics understandable to the average person.The book revolves around the idea of model dependent realism because it sidesteps the common philosophic rut of arguing about what reality actually is. Hawking goes through all of the scientific breakthroughs that led to the current models we use to understand the physical world around us. While most of it is easily accessible to the average person it does drift into territories the stretch or surpass anything most people's minds can easily grasp and will require a great deal of reflecting to fully comprehend.I believe this book was written to show people, who may not be aware, that there is a compelling argument for and a kind of beauty to a universe that is formed by processes that logically result in everything in the universe, including life. That being said, I think Hawking misses fully developing his argument to a satisfying and complete conclusion since M-theory has yet to be confirmed by observation. He states that ""M-theory is the unified theory Einstein was hoping to find"" but I am still skeptical about his conclusion until it has been properly vetted by time and observation.The Grand Design is a concise history of scientific striving to model and understand the physical world and it's evolutions that ultimately lead up to our current era. I think the people that need to read this book won't. I also think that the people who do read this book should do so with a healthy skepticism."
64,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6000454-william-holm,0,"Hawking is undoubtedly one of the most influential physicists of our time. In part this is due to his ability to outlive every prediction concerning his illness. However, his contributions to cosmology are of great importance for the field. I once heard him say in a lecture that if anyone could travel to a black hole and measure the so called Hawking radiation he would get the Nobel prize. It feels good that this type of scientist devotes at least some of his time to write books accessible for larger audience.In this book Hawking tackles the ""eternal"" question of how it can be that the universe seems to be extremely carefully designed to harbor life in the form that we know. The answer he arrives at is what is known as anthropic principle, i.e. the world is the way it is because otherwise we would not be here discussing it. Although this argument has been used before Hawking now has M-theory and Feynman sum over histories to back it up. There is even an estimate of the amount of possible universes created (ten to the power five hundred). The book is well written and delusively easy to read. A considerable part is devoted to the nature of physical laws and of a philosophical approach called model-dependent realism. There is also a popular introduction to quantum mechanics which I found quite fresh despite the fact that several such introductions have been attempted in the literature. The part about M-theory is maybe the weakest in the book. Probably because the level of complexity in the theory is so high that it becomes difficult to explain it without resorting to equations. Also a discussion on testable predictions produced by the theory would have been nice. All in all this a very readable book reporting in popular form from the research front on some really basic questions."
65,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2340346-chris-walker,3,"This book is not going to help your existential angst. It is a great romp through subjects of which I knew very little including: quantum physics, model dependant reality, the uncertainty principle, Feyneman's diagrams, the double slit experiment, John Wheeler's delayed choice experiment, quantum electro dynamics, quantum chromo dynamics, super gravity, CMBR, multiple universes, string theory and cosmology. It is also full of arresting statements such as ""in quantum physics an object's path, position and even its past and future are not precisely determined"" and ""the universe has no single past or history. It has every possible history. The observations you make of a system will affect its past."" But philosophically the man in the chair (who I've always thought, most respectfully, has had a lot of time to think about these things) says at bottom we humans are basically just the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe. (If you are religious, this could mean God really does play dice.) He examines the strong anthropic principle which says the fact that we exist imposes constraints not only on the conditions we find ourselves in but on the laws of nature themselves. He looks at the extreme fine tuning that has made it possible for us to exist and evolve to an extent where we are able to ask about our existence but dismisses intelligent design preferring ""model dependant realism"" and the M theory. This basically boils down to the fact that given the fundamental laws that exist in the universe ""spontaneous creation"" of the universe was possible from nothing. It was not necessary for God to light the blue touch paper to get the universe going. However, why are the fundamental laws as they are? This book was great but left me feeling lonelier than ever."
66,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/183639-irwan,4,"This book contains many of the big ideas that fascinated me during my student days. Quantum physics with its philosophical implications. Robotics and artificial intelligence. The Conway's Game of Life. Those ideas have helped me shape my own thinking by giving alternate perspective of life and everything besides those I got from my surroundings in the childhood years. It was a kind of romantic dream in which I imagined how revolutionary those grand ideas would change the world. At the time, the pursuit of Theory of Everything was still ongoing. I fantasized how future life will be like when humans are able to get away from the narrative dominated by those less scientific approaches. The pursuit has been going with its twists and turn. This book may be seen as a compromise of the previously ambitious attitude. People are still killing people for many ridiculous narratives. Being well-written and highly accessible to the general public, it gives a tour of those grand ideas with a nice and flowing narrative and beautiful illustrations. However, as one gets older, one realizes that there is no santa, or unicorn, or any other childhood myth you grew up with. I am afraid I am feeling less romantic about those so called revolutionary ideas. Daily life issues seem to dominate people consciousness. Although this ideas keep brewing in those quiet corners like the academics, the popular science medias (scientific american, wired magazines, etc), it is seemingly without any significant influence in wider public.I enjoyed reading this book while reminiscing how it would make me feel if had read it a few years back."
67,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,4,"My biggest pet peeve with academia has been it's restrictiveness to like-minded academics- researchers doing fancy math for a small bunch of individuals and publishing it in esoteric journals. This is why I absolutely loved that Stephen Hawking simplified all the research having been done regarding the beginning of the universe. Although quite well-written and very enlightening, I wouldn't give this book five stars because it gets a little too heavy on theory at certain points. In a nutshell, Hawking proposes the following: a unified theory of the universe, known as M-theory, is not a unique principle but an amalgamation of principles that overarchingly account for the four broad kinds of forces-gravity, electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear forces . This is akin to a globe being charted out using tons of flat maps, which wherever they overlap, lead to same countries/regions. The research is rooted in scientific determinism- that the universe is governed by laws and there is no divine being at the helm. Personally, I wasn't too convinced with his argument of the lack of a divine being (not to say that I believe in one, but I felt he didn't convince me to discard it). He discusses that the reason for the lack of a divine being is that the earth isn't too special after all. Multiverse theory dictates that there are countless universes with their own solar systems that are governed by different sets of laws. It just happens to be the case that our planet is subjected to conditions conducive for the existence of complex beings. Basically, he says that our existence is the result of mere coincidence. A little weak, in my opinion."

It doesn't seem logical. I mean, imagine a world that's identical to ours, except in our world Hamilton wasn't a big success. But how could that be? If everything were identical, then all the people who see Hamilton would be the same ones in both worlds, with the same likes and dislikes, so they'd, on the whole, really like it. If they didn't, then something must have differed prior to that. Or in a simpler case, there's no universe that's just like ours but where elephants if they choose to can float. Can there be?

70,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53081714-michael-santini,2,"This recent book by Stephen Hawking examines the history of scientific knowledge about the universe. The central point of the text is that Einstein's theory of general relativity, together with the (new and improved) theory of quantum mechanics, can explain how the universe formed out of nothing. Leaving God out of the equation, Hawking uses his own coined term, ""spontaneous creation,"" to explain how matter and energy appeared for the Big Bang event.Although I appreciate the simplified, thoughtful writing of Hawking, one can grow weary of his hard-core atheism. The man goes overboard in retracting his 1970 thesis that time had a beginning (in order to remove a divine initiator). He does this by converting time to a spatial dimension, and then the dimension to a circle, which has no beginning point. His new quantum approach uses M-theory, which tells of multiple, untold universes, each having 11 dimensions. We are just lucky to be in the one universe that just happens to support life. Shall I go on?This book shows why science and religion don't talk with one another - from the science side. Rather than invoke a crumb of spirituality, popular scientists like Hawking continue to invent far-fetched, scientific scenarios for the public to consider, while searching for a Unified Field Theory. After the bold proclamation that ""philosophy is dead"" in the first chapter, The Grand Design points us to science as the only answer. And that answer was a big disappointment."
71,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76688-eric,4,"Although some of the more complicated theories and scientific explanations mentioned in the book went a bit over my head -- quarks, string theory, m-theory, multiverses, etc. -- I enjoyed reading The Grand Design, as it gave a short history of science and philosophy and its quest to try to explain how the universe came to be and what exactly we are doing here. It shows how Hawking has continued where great minds like Einstein, Faraday, Newton, Descartes, Galileo, Archimedes, Aristotle, Plato and Socrates tread before him, albeit now with complicated math and physics that belie what our senses would tell us. It definitely succeeded in making me think, and kept me interested throughout with examples of how these theories could be applied to a layperson such as myself. My personal favorite was the explanation for how the fish's model of reality is just as valid as our own, despite the fish living in a round fishbowl that would warp everything it sees.There seems to be a lot of concern as to what Hawking wrote about God in the book, although to me I fail to see the controversy, since all he said was that he did not believe the universe necessitated a higher power -- ""[the universe] does not require the intervention of some supernatural being or god"" -- not say that science has disproved the existence of God."
72,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675987-lon,3,"After having enjoyed his mind-stretching A Brief History of Time, I looked forward to this new Hawking book tackling the great questions. Unfortunately, instead of mind-stretching, this was a little more mind-numbing--at least for me. He covers much of the same ground he'd already covered, but this time less captivatingly. One reason I wanted to read it is because it raised quite a stir for his remarks dismissing God from the equation. Much ado about nothing, really. All he says is that we no longer need a ""miracle"" to explain our cosmological origins. That doesn't rock my world, since I've always believed that miracles, instead of violating laws of nature, are simply manifestations of phenomena for which we don't have explanations yet. Given the abundance of evidence around us that the universe operates according to natural laws, it seems reasonable to me to conclude that if we do espouse the idea of a Divine Creator, then we can assume that Creator operates within natural law, as well. This doesn't detract from the creation anymore than an acknowledging that a great architect has designed something extraordinary which nonetheless reflects a superb mastery of the laws of physics and abides by those laws. "
73,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11301247-rob,2,"Previous books by Stephen Hawking in the past have been quite good and explained some extremely complex physics in a matter that the lay person can understand it. Unfortunately, this book falls short on explaining the science to the layperson so I have a hard time recommending it on those grounds. However, as I read the book I came to think of it less as a science book and more as a philosophical thesis by Mr. Hawking even though it declares that ""...philosophy is dead."" on page five (page one of the content) Unfortunately, if the book falls short as a ""science for the layperson"" book, it falls even shorter as a philosophical thesis, as it provides a brief whirlwind tour of the current state of physics and M-Theory and uses it as an argument that a God is not needed to set things in motion nor is free will needed as sufficiently complex systems cannot be modeled (at this time).Overall, the writing style was approachable and well edited; but at times it does feel like you are being talked down to and the book as a whole seems a bit thin and not up to the usual standards for Mr. Hawking's books."

Stephen Hawking delves into the origin of the universe and its laws that support our existence so wonderfully. One of the problems with physics is its inability to combine quantum theory with Newton's law of gravity (among other things). With the M-theory, things can be explained separately, giving truth in a patchwork of overlapping theories instead of a single unified one. ""The grand design"" doesn't explain anything in any depth and appears deceptively simple. I'm perplexed enough to want to continue with Brian Greene's ""the Hidden Reality"" which appears to tackle many of the same problems - quantum theory, multiple universes - in greater detail. I'm not sure it will help my understanding much, but it might satisfy some of my infinite curiosity on the mysteries of deep space, eventhough I can't hope to grasp all the details. If you never read above your level, how can you hope to make any progress?"

Stephen Hawking has a really shrewd and humorous way of looking at these sorts of things. He especially promotes string theory as the only possibility to provide a unified theory of physics, which seems reasonable, but I don't know enough about it to really comment. Some background in physics would help the reader, but it is not necessary. I also liked the background in the history of science that he gave, something not just about certain scientists and events, but touching upon the paradigms and how it shapes our worldview. Another thing he talked about was model-dependent realism, which was interesting, though I'm not convinced that this is a good way to understand the world. I especially liked when he talked about the multiverse and different universes and their creations--fodder for novels, indeed!I listened to this on audio, and it was superb, so I would highly suggest that method for people who like audiobooks."

Needless to say, Hawking is of them. And probably even one of the greatest men to ever exist.

The M theory is an attempt at a theory of 'everything' meaning a theory fit to unify laws governing both subatomic particles, energy fields and big bodies, so far an unattainable feat for physicists. It's based on superstring theory and unifies quantum mechanics, general and special theory of relativity, and supports the view that our universe is a part of multiverse- an infinite collection of universes like ours. The book itself is extremely readable, clear and to the point peppered with Hawking signature quirky humour. It has an very clear explanation of quantum mechanics laws, and why god is not needed in the creation of the universe."

I finished it yesterday, and can barely describe any of the concepts, much less pretend to explain any of the premises of the book.

89,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75854653-hyung-park,5,"The main underlying theme of the book was the idea of “model-dependent realism,” the idea that your reality depends on the model you employ. I think this is an excellent point. The core idea of “model-dependent realism” can be summarized by: “We build mental pictures, or models, of how the world works, and we interpret the world through those models. We don’t have direct access to the world as it actually is, only to the world as it is filtered through our model.” The billiard ball model of molecules, the double helix model of DNA, and Newton’s laws as a few numbers instead of every interacting atom in the object… these are all excellent models, that help us understand the world— often so effective and powerful in prediction, and give us strong impressions that there are some correct models and that the complex happenings around us could be reduced to simpler principles. However, a model represents the world, but only the parts you need or only those you are looking at now. By choosing a right model, you can look at just one piece of a far more complicated world, that helps you understand it, which is great, but it may be great only “locally.” For the “grand picture” of the world, the book suggests a theory called M-theory, the network of theories (the networks of models). Each theory (each model) in the M-theory network is good at describing phenomena within a certain range. In other words, reality (or realities) lives (or live) in the network of multiple models. Each model can describe and explain certain properties. I think the Universe is out there, but at the same time it is within us, because it depends on how we look at it and how we model it. For example, the wave/particle duality, where two very different theories accurately describe the same phenomenon. I agree with Hawking and Mlodinow that reality should be interpreted based upon these models, where “several models overlap in describing a particular subject, multiple, equally valid, realities exist.” Or perhaps, the Universe depends on how we look at it and how we model it, because we are already part of it, and there exists rather a very strong interaction between a part and the whole :)"
90,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,4,"Reading The Grand Design is an interesting experience. On the one hand, I am dazed by the quantum field theory, quantum chromodynamics, strong and weak anthropic principles, and other modern theories proven and are used to explain the composition and/or part of the creation of the universe. On the other hand, my mind has great difficulties comprehending these ""new"" concepts, even though they were discovered in the early- to mid-twentieth century. Perhaps partially it is because they are not taught in school like Classical Physics or Newtonian Physics is? If the science community has already adapted these theories, why aren't they in the school curriculum?One of the main focuses in this book is the concept of M-theory, which stands for Model Dependent Theory/Realism. It's the amalgamation of theories that all can be used to describe the creation of the universe. To put it plainly, M-theory is simply a way to look at the world objectively within the confine of a particular space-time subjectivity. In a sense, it echoes the contemporary, pluralistic worldview in the social sciences.In my opinion, this book is less about physics but more about the way we view the world. The truth is, much of the physics in this book, as simplified and generalized as it might be, is still way over my head. For people who are open-minded to new ways of thinking, they will find this book interesting. It gets 4 stars from me. (And I know I will be re-reading this book again soon.)"

Thus making the rating of such books as good or bad inherently easy , but also the only meaningful thing for the reader . The stars aligned for me , so i marked them accordingly over yonder . I could have been more vague |TRY ME|. How this stands out is quite remarkable actually ! I felt transposed by the immersive nature of narration literally dragging me to the other end of the universe and back. Unlike other such works however ,where you have to keep your attention tight for the long run , here it happens naturally and you acknowledge it 2/3 in the book that it actually cost you no effort to keep up with the otherwise crazy business .What surprise me was that the introduction was meaningfully used to give the whole book a well defined form ,structure and connecting with the ending on theme it gave the whole work a finished feel playing a huge role in the future recollection of the whole experience . Exactly that is indirect evidence to me that the author is one of the few authorities on the subject which is the most valuable aspect i search for ! One word : Cool but also delightful !"
92,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39168284-marta-d-agord,5,"I read this book as a lesson of scientific methodology that could be applied to other areas, beyond physics, due to the idea that reality is constructed by our models. Newton’s law of gravity, published in 1687, said that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to its mass. It showed for the first time that at least one aspect of the universe could be accurately modeled. But no single mathematical model or theory that can describe every aspect of the universe. Instead, there seems to be the network of theories called M-theory. Each theory in the M-theory network is good at describing phenomena within a certain range. And that is important: a certain range, how evaluate it? Classical theories such as Newton’s are built upon a framework reflecting everyday experience, in which material objects have an individual existence, can be located at definite locations, follow definite paths, and so on. Quantum physics provides a framework for understanding how nature operates on atomic and subatomic scales, but as we’ll see in more detail later, it dictates a completely different conceptual schema, one in which no object’s position, path, and even its past and future are not precisely determined. Quantum theories of forces such as gravity or the electromagnetic force are built within that framework. There is no model-independent test of reality and a well-constructed model creates a reality of its own. As an example, the Game of Life, invented in 1970 by John Conway."
93,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/188289-magdalena,0,"The Grand Design is not really a book for those that obtain their scientific information from peer reviewed scientific journals. It isn’t a breakthrough so much as an explanation for the non-physicist, and a beautifully presented one at that. For those, like me, who felt the ground beneath their feet move after reading A Brief History of Time, and Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays, The Grand Design won’t disappoint. As with its predecessors, the book is written is clear, simple, but never condescending language. The authors never make the assumption that the reader is intellectually disabled due to a lack of mathematical or scientific knowledge. Instead the reader is invited into the inner-circle – to begin contemplating the same questions, with the same (quantum) quirks and issues, as those who spend their lives steeped in cosmology and quantum physics. The excitement and almost childlike joy that the authors have in their subject matter is infectious. The book presents a cumulative, historical perspective, moving from Greek philosophy through alternative pictures of reality, to early quantum mechanics, to current cosmological theories, bringing the reader to speed, before providing the denouement. The book is printed on thick, glossy paper, with stitched binding, and full colour artwork, photography, diagrams and cartoons, making it an appealing artefact in and of itself. The text is further lightened by quotations, anecdotes and a number of accessible analogies to help make the concepts clear. The book presents its evidence using simple words and logic, with no jargon and no mathematics (there’s a basic glossary at the back, but all terms are explained as they appear). However, the book still demands clarity and deep thought from the reader – and perhaps the ability to get outside one’s own skin – to see a bigger picture than here and now: Because gravity shapes space and time, it allows space-time to be locally stable but globally unstable. On the scale of the entire universe, the positive energy of the matter can be balanced by the negative gravitational energy, and so there is no restriction on the creation of whole universes. (180)The overarching premise of The Grand Design is that the universe we perceive is merely one of many, and that the best, most scientifically provable theory to describe these is M-theory. I’m not a physicist, so my understanding of M-theory is poetic, rather than mathematical, but Hawking and Mlodinow do an excellent job of explaining this rather oblique theory and making it appear reasonably plausible and even evocative. Using the term ""model-dependent realism"", the authors posit that we are limited in our perspective because the reality we’re testing is different depending on where we’re standing and the models that we create of the world – models that create a reality of their own. Nevertheless, and I don’t think it’s a spoiler to say this, the ultimate message from this book is that M-theory is not only the ‘theory of everything’ that Einstein and many others spent their lives in search of, but that it’s the only solution that works as a good scientific model, eg is elegant, contains few arbitrary elements, agrees with all existing observations, and makes provable predictions. M-theory itself is used to show how a ‘brane’ universe can create itself out of nothing. Whether or not you accept this may depend on how much it matters to you and whether this conflicts with some other theory (including that of a human styled divinity) that may have been working for you most of your life. From what I’ve been able to glean, much of the criticism of this book comes from either those who have spent their lives working in this area, or those to whom a theory like this poses a personal threat. From a practical point of view, for the layman to whom the book appears to have been written, it probably doesn’t matter one bit whether the ‘truth’ lies with M-theory or a theory of stacked turtles. However, the spare beauty and at times raucous wit that strikes me as very Hawking-like, can’t be denied, nor, to me at least, can we discard the elegance of a theory that posits something so elegant as supersymmetry between forces of nature, uniting general relativity/gravity with quantum physics. If I understand correctly, and it’s more than likely that I don’t, this is a book that doesn’t provide all the answers any more than Douglas Adam’s 42 – a joke that the authors nod to at the start. After all, no matter how good the maths, there’s really no material way to move beyond the theoretical when it comes to universe sized membranes – we’re trapped in our universe or our relative positions, and that’s that (though who knows what the future will bring – superpartners and squarks are yawning at the horizon). But what it does do is to open a door to the non-physicist that was previously kept closed, allowing us to perceive, at a surprisingly high level, a macro perspective on the universe we live in that is reasonably scientifically acceptable. That’s good enough for me, especially when presented in such an aesthetically pleasing, and intellectually stimulating form. If Hawking and Mlodinow are proved to be utterly wrong within the next decade, then I’m sure that, being the consummate scientists that they are, they will thrill to the answer and accede to those that will have used their theories to step up to the next level. In the meantime, I'm all for cracking the champers and toasting the multiverse. There's so much more to love.

94,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76152806-ashish-samuel,4,"I have read a few science books this year that claimed to give grand explanations to everything, but they mostly beat around the quantum bush. I found them cautious and deliberately vague, probably under the pressure to keep it overly simple so that layman readers aren't scared off. Therefore I was skeptic about this book, given its genius author. But I was surprised at the lucidity of the language throughout the book without sacrificing the nitty gritties and nuances. The book started off by saying philosophy is dead. But the book kept itself somewhere between heavy philosophy and intelligent guesswork. The book provides an engaging introduction into the various scientific explorations that were cutting edge a decade ago - QCD, electro-weak force unification, string theory, and most prominently the m-theory. There's a lot that one can learn from this book, but the ambitious title remains to be justified. The authors admit that the theory that can explain the grand design is still in its nascent stage, so maybe the title was a little precocious. But still, this one explained quantum theory's affair with gravity a lot more clearly than most other 'science popularizers'."

A theory that can account for anything and everything, not in just one universe but in all multiverses. Hawking goes further to express the possibility that according to quantum mechanics it is just not possible that only one universe exists. Rather, there have to be many universes existing simultaneously. This book is appreciable for its expression of ideas as Hawking takes a rather difficult-to-comprehend subject like astronomy and explains it in such a way that even a middle school student with no prior knowledge in astronomy could understand the depth of the text.Overall, reading this book was very interesting. Reading such a piece about astronomy and especially the way it was written sparked a fascination for the cosmos. It made me realize that our planet is like less that a grain of sand if the universe is to be taken as a beach and following this analogy, there are infinite more beaches like these. This book is good for people who are new to the field of astronomy and want a really engaging text to further spark their interest in the field of astronomy"

Stephen Hawking will guide you through philosophical conversations in Greece, where Ionian founding fathers were starting to get a hold of rationality and laws of cause and effect. Later those ideas developed into empiricism and scientific method, for which we should thank Descartes. And finally nowadays we have a thing called ""model-dependent realism"", which is basically saying that if any model predicts measured data it can be considered valid, regardless of how counter-intuitive it may be. The good example of that would be quantum theory, which famously if you managed to understand means that you probably didn't.

122,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61683014-shalini-biswas,5,Written in a way even a layman can understand without having to look up definitions every other paragraph :)
123,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62399407-grpunksmile,5,It is a typical Stephen Hawking informative book: understandable pretty fine scientific - philosophy reasoning without any kind of scientific equations for everyone. In this book he looking for the final big questions of universe collided it with the theological answers. The final decision can do the reader itself. :)

129,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,3,You don’t need to know much theoretical physics to follow along. But some basic background about the basic ideas can really help. 
130,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4482859-kate,3,"The Grand Design aims to give readers a basic understanding of physics so they can then understand how physicists and cosmologists are answering—or at least trying to answer—some of the world's biggest and most confusing questions. Sometimes Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow accomplish what they've set out to do. They throw in an amusing historical fact to keep you interested in dry material, use basic and familiar concepts to make more difficult ones approachable, and they mostly write in a clear and concise fashion. Unfortunately, other parts of the book are bogged down by the overuse of less familiar terms or, worse, acronyms. Hawking and Mlodinow Know Physics, but Do they Know Everything?This isn't purely an informational text. It's also an argument. Hawking and Mlodinow attempt to show how the physical laws of the universe make it so that a creator, a god, is not necessary for our existence. From a technical standpoint, they argue, everything we know can and has come from nothing. Gods, therefore, are entirely irrelevant. Moreover, there are many worlds out there, some not so different from our own, so it only stands to reason that at least one, at least ours, has supported intelligent life (or mostly intelligent, anyway) at random.As you might suspect, this idea causes controversy in some circles because it leaves little room for more literal interpretations in religion. As such, whether Hawking and Mlodinow convince you that we exist thanks to nothing and no one probably depends on whether you enter into the book as a deeply religious person or as an agnostic/atheist. That's just the way of things. Personally, I'm holding out for the computer simulation theory because it would be hilarious.If you get this reference, I love you.My biggest complaint with The Grand Design is its lack of source material. As much as I admire Hawking and Mlodinow and don't at all doubt they know what they're talking about when it comes to physics, I expect a bibliography if they're going to talk about subjects outside of their fields (as they do). You have no idea where they get some of their historical information, and this isn't solely a book of their theories for them not to cite sources. I expect unsourced statements from Wikipedia or in an essay written by a hungover college student (sometimes one in the same), not from a book written by some of the most respected scientists of our time. At the very least, there should be a ""further reading"" section.The Grand Design is a pretty good read, but it didn't impress me as much as I expected it to, and not merely because of a few muddled explanations or the absent bibliography. Interestingly, many of the newest, most cutting-edge theories discussed in this book were ones I was already very familiar with by way of science news articles. Whether that's testament to Hawking and Mlodinow or the media's growing interest in our universe, or even my own nerdiness, I'm not sure. What I got from this book was a more stable foundation with which to better understand some of the theories I read about, but it's only a starting point, and I can't help but think there are better ""basics"" books out there.

========================================Quotes From the Book
(Apply your own positive/negative connotations.)
========================================In 1992 the Roman Catholic Church finally acknowledged that it had been wrong to condemn Galileo.---The laws of M-theory therefore allow for different universes with different apparent laws, depending on how the internal space is curled. ---One thing that may have been apparent even in early times was that either the universe was a very recent creation or else human beings have existed for only a small fraction of cosmic history. That's because the human race has been improving so rapidly in knowledge and technology that if people had been around for millions of years, the human race would be much further along in its mastery."
131,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8296061-clark-goble,3,"Too many times when Christians voice their opinions on matters of science it becomes glaringly obvious that they haven’t a clue about what they’re saying. I’ve even seen some pastors veer off topic in the middle of their sermons and take matters of science out of context or misrepresent a particular issue. I’ve also grown frustrated from commonly seeing matters of theology and science pitted against one another in a cage match to the death. As a result, I set a goal for myself to learn more about science. I wanted to learn for myself where theology and science diverge or even clash with one another. It was with that goal in mind that I picked up Stephen Hawking’s The Grand Design.Hawking begins his book by posing some of the bigger questions humanity has ever confronted:“How can we understand the world in which we find ourselves? How does the universe behave? What is the nature of reality? Where did all this come from? Did the universe need a creator?”Hawking then makes a huge assertion:“Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments of science, particularly physics. [As a result], Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.”It should be noted that Hawking’s bombshell is dropped on page 1. If he is correct in his assessment that philosophy is dead one must wonder why he even continues to write, however, he assures the reader that “The purpose of this book is to give the answers that are suggested by recent discoveries and theoretical advances.” I must admit that I was hooked from this point on. I couldn’t wait to see Hawking answer the questions that philosophers have been asking for centuries in the definitive and irrefutable manner he seems to promise.Hawking’s book was a challenge. I walked away from it with a much better understanding of the difference between Quantum and Newtonian Physics, the Multiverse, and scientific laws. It is all quite fascinating really. In fact, as I read Hawking’s book I couldn’t help but think about how awesome God must be to have designed a universe as fascinating as the one in which we live.Hawking, however, comes to a different conclusion:“Ignorance of nature’s ways led people in ancient times to invent gods to lord over every aspect of human life.”“But with Thales of Miletus about 2,600 years ago, that began to change. The idea arose that nature follows consistent principles tat could be deciphered. And so began the long process of ofreplacing the notion of the reign of godswith the concept of a universe that is governed by laws of nature …”It is here that Hawking seems to reveal the underlying purpose of his book. He isn’t content to address life’s biggest questions from a scientific vantage point, rather, Hawking feels the need to declare philosophy dead and desires to replace the notion of God with the notion that the universe is only governed by laws of nature. Hawking even writes, “Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.”Here’s the problem. The statement, “Philosophy is dead” is a philosophical statement. In his wonderful book God and Stephen Hawking, John Lennox expertly demonstrates how Hawking continuously engages in philosophical exercises throughout The Grand Design despite his pronouncement on page 1 that philosophy is dead! In reality, however, philosophy isn’t Hawking’s true target. Rather, he has God in his cross-hairs.It is an assassination attempt, however, that falls short. As it turns out, Science hasn’t yet found a suitable replacement for the Creator. Hawking does, however, present some wonderful theories on the process of creation. I found myself quite intrigued by Hawking’s thoughts on the multiverse and was left after reading this book with a desire to learn more about space and time as they relate to one another.In short, Hawking is a fascinating scientist and his book is sure to satisfy anyone curious about the universe. Hawking does seem to cross a line, however, in his attempt to replace God with science. In the mind of Stephen Hawking science is an idol and God is an afterthought. I did, however, enjoy this book."
132,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49635284-dolf-van-der-haven,3,"This book is very accessibly written.It loses one star by dumbly stating on the first page that Philosophy is dead (while creating an extensive Philosophy of its own in the following chapters).It loses another star for, predictably, taking the narrow perspective of ""Science is all there is"". It should lose another star for subsequently dumbing down the scientific discussions such that the eventual explanations are mostly non-sequiturs: the andwer to the question what was there before the Big Bang is that in the specific circumstances back then, time behaves as a physical dimension, so there is no issue with before and after the Big Bang.And so on, and so forth. Dumbing down science in a popular book is necessary, but at least the authors should come up with believable explanations of what they are trying to convey.The book gives an overview of the state of Physics and Cosmology until now, but revels too much in pretending to have the answers to Life, the Universe and All, but does a poor job by exposing the limited understanding Science really has. Its supposed ""Laws"" are often no more than incomplete theories that leave a lot to be filled in. How the authors fill it in is bordering on speculation."
133,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832666-david,2,"On the positive side, this book is remarkably concise. Hawking does a great job of covering a large amount of complex, heady, modern science in a very few words. He flies through explanations of quantum uncertainty, quantum electrodynamics, string theory, general relativity, the quest to unify the four fundamental forces, the cosmic microwave background, inflationary theory, heavy element generation inside of stars and through supernovae, etc. I was already familiar (at least as a layman who reads science books) with all of these. I'm not sure how effective this book would be for introducing readers to the concepts, because it covers them so quickly. But if the purpose was to stuff all of those ideas into the reader's mind in a short period of time for a kind of grand, high-level picture of modern physics, then that worked, at least for me.The problem (and the source of my two-star review) is that this isn't really a science book at all. The race through modern physics only serves as a foundation from which to explain Hawking's philosophy. He starts the book by claiming that ""philosophy is dead,"" but all he really means is that he considers his philosophical perspective (and mode of reasoning) to be superior to any other theology or philosophy, because the entire book is a philosophical treatise.Hawking's philosophy boils down to this logical sequence:1. There are many aspects of our universe (the strengths of the fundamental forces, the cosmological constant, etc.) that must be exactly they way they are in order to give rise to human life.2. Although this may suggest the existence of a Creator, I would rather not believe in God.3. I will therefore start with the assumption that there is no God, and logically reason my way to a self-consistent model that ""must"" be true, given my initial assumption.He then imagines for himself, based on cutting-edge modern physics (some of which is pretty well established, and some of which is still quite controversial), a self-consistent model of the universe that obviates any need for a Creator. This model includes:1. The existence of an extremely large number of universes, randomly generated with all possible parameters, such that the one we live in is the lucky one that had all the right values to produce us.2. The idea that time is a dimension, like space, which curls around and converges to non-existence at t=0 (the Big Bang), kind of like the latitude lines at the South Pole, which means talking about what came ""before"" the Big Bang is nonsense. Time didn't exist at that point.3. The conclusion that M-theory must necessarily be the ""theory of everything"" that physicists have been hunting for a century, and we just have to work out the math.What drove me crazy about this book was the unexamined premise that there is no God, which was a necessary premise for the logical reasoning. If you start with an alternate premise (e.g. that the universe WAS created by God), then there is no need to explain how the parameters of the universe are consistent with human life. In both cases, you are starting with a premise and logically reasoning from that point. But Hawking seems to think that because he has imagined a self-consistent model from his premise, then it must be true. But I can just as easily come up with a self-consistent model given the premise of a Creator.This is the point at which detractors generally produce the ""Occam's razor"" argument: If a model exists which does not require the existence of God, then it is simpler (and thus more likely) that God does not exist. But given the logical gymnastics required here to imagine an enormous Monte Carlo simulation of universes and eliminating cause and effect by tying the dimension of time up in a neat bow, I'm not sure that Hawking's model is the simpler or more elegant one.I wouldn't necessarily have minded the book if his premise had been clearly set out. Instead, Hawking relies on the complexity of his subject material (and his reputation as a world-renowned scientist) to suggest that he has logically disproved the creation of the universe by God, when all he really did was assume it as his premise in the first place."
134,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7757510-jaakko-j,4,"I opened with rather grand expectations the much talked about book by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow called ‘The Grand Design’, as I really expected to be told how and why our universe was born.However, I did lay this book down a a bit disappointed two nights later. In reality the book was just a grand tour of the latest theories in cosmology over which I did really already have a working knowledge even before reading this book.Of course, the big news was that Stephen Hawking has thrown his full weight on the M-theory that does contain the idea of the multiverse. On the other hand, maybe the real big news for the general public was that Stephen Hawking has finally triumphantly and openly dismissed the idea of a creator-god as an unproven and unnecessary hypothesis.This all is big news for those who are inclined to hero worship and Stephen Hawking has undoubtedly been a hero for many. Because of this fact, this book can of course have a bigger impact on the world than an reader like me can imagine.I can freely admit that I have always thought that a person with the amount of knowledge and experience like Stephen Hawking has accumulated can never be other than a deist, agnostic or atheist. A person who is well versed in real science over the nature of our universe and cosmology in general just cannot believe in the kinds of gods that religions have on offer. This is true, if he or she wants to remain sane.Of course, a scientist like Albert Einstein can believe in a pantheistic spirit of the universe or in a spiritual sameness of the whole nature. For some unknown reason, he preferred to call this idea confusingly with a same name that the religions do use for their own ""gods"".One must really remember that this Einsteinian spirit of the universe has nothing to do with the angry and worship demanding god-figure that is available in, for example, the Jewish and Christian religions.However, the book is an excellent read and for a person just dipping his or her toes in these matters it can be a real eye-opener. The writers do explain in a clear and crisp language very many difficult concepts and ideas. They really explain a lot of the nature of the bits and pieces that make up our universe.I did enjoy the book all the way. However, I was left with the feeling that towards the end of the book the grip of the writers had lessened. The grand ideas presented there are just presented with a little too thin layer of explanations.After all, I was left after reading this book at the very same point as before reading it. I am greatly enthralled by the M-theory and a keen believer in the idea of multiverses, but even after reading this book I do think that they are still theories, even if very, very, very promising theories. I hope that one day we can also prove them, as they offer a good way to solve many puzzles in the nature of our universe.Sadly this day is not here, even if Stephen Hawking has apparently become quite convinced on the validity of these theories. Of course, this endorsement gives a major boost to the scientific reputation of these theories, but reputation alone does not prove a theory.On the other hand, we can also think as my wife. She said just recently when we did discuss the nature of our universe: “I do not need to know how the refrigerator works to use it”. In other words, we can live happy and full lives even with the full knowledge that we do not know for certain why our universe was born. Of course, we can get comfort from the certainty that we most certainly will have better knowledge about this matter in 10 or 100 or 1000 years.There is the incredible hubris of the creators of these religions who claim to having found all the answers to all of the unanswered or difficult questions that humanity has ever faced.This book would of course be a valuable source of information just for people quite satisfied with the crude and extremely simplistic answers offered by the religions, but I’m afraid the people who would need most to read this book will never come even near it."

137,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65100796-henrique-a,4,"If it was possible I would give 4.3 stars to this book. The book starts with the most fundamental questions that humanity's been asking for hundreds of years, and answer them throughout the whole book, with cosmological, physical and astrophysical concepts. Some of it's examples are a bit complex and may need a second read, but most of them are mundane, making it easier to comprehend. Overall it is a really good book for non-expert readers and for the ones that know a bit of the subjects, but if you are looking for complexity and detail this book will not meet your expectations."
138,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762314-walt,2,"Like so many other readers, I am a lay person with very limited understanding of quantum physics, so I can only comment on what I interpreted from this book. First of all, I think Hawking has dumbed the content down too much in this book. I could never understand the math; but I got very tired of the basic approach of 'just trust me, there have been way many studies that prove...' I re-read it to get a better understanding of some parts that were especially confusing and, light. But ultimately, I finished the book with less faith in science than when I started. I think there is so much more left to discover; and that some of the ideas he was discussing, such as M-Theory, are too vague and ill-defined to accept. The book discusses topics that we cannot see, even with microscopes or super observatories. However, quantum physics seems to study the universe by experimenting with sub-sub-atomic particles. Granted, some of these particles (Quarks) have not been proven to exist; but again, just trust me.....there have been lots of studies....As a layperson with minimal background in physics, I cannot accept that the infallible laws of nature vary with sub-sub-atomic particles and human beings. He uses the analogy of soccer balls passing through two slits in a wall toward the goal. In ""my world"" they act one way; and his ""world of quarks"" they act differently. It seems that faith is required, rather it is faith in Hawking, God, gravity, or quarks, at some point, the reader has to simply believe that something is right. This leads me to a second problem with the book, it appears to be more philosophical than scientific. Simply, because Hawking keeps asking his readers to believe in the science. He spends several chapters discussing reality, and come to the conclusion that reality is created by our brains. Eastern religions say something very similar. Yet, they give advice on how to craft those realities. That seems to go above and beyond Hawking. While he does not directly refute God, he clearly has no use for God or an unmoved mover. This brings me to my next point, and why my faith in science was shaken with this book. The Big Bang Theory. In this book, all matter in the universe was packed into a space about the size of a centimeter (?) and exploded outward, gaining speed as it spreads. However, my college science courses taught me that there needs to be fuel to continue speeding. Science says the universe should be slowing down, not moving faster. Furthermore, if it is an explosion, why are galaxies crashing into each other? NASA has beautiful pictures of galaxies colliding. Even the Milky Way will pass through a larger galaxy in the future. Something does not seem to be correct. Finally, the most difficult chapter in the book covered ""infinite universes."" How? Returning to the soccer ball analogy, sub-atomic particles behave differently than fully-sized soccer balls. How is this possible? Well, the particle must move along every conceivable path to the goal. This includes crashing into the wall, passing back and forth through both slits, and even a visit to the moon. Sound absurd? Trust me, this study has been proven many times...."
139,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51576-lisa,3,"Here’s a tip: driving through downtown Chicago traffic is not the time to try and absorb the details of quantum physics. Dangerous stuff, that. The Grand Design is part history, part philosophy, part science. It goes back to Ptolemy and Plato, forward to the probable end of the universe. It strives to answer the great questions of life:“How can we understand the world in which we find ourselves? How does the universe behave? What is the nature of reality? Where does all this come from? Did the universe need a creator?”Those are weighty questions and a tall order for any book. Of course, there are no concrete answers, but modern science has made a lot of progress, despite those who would hold it back. This book was a fascinating look at one of the approaches to the answers.I will be the first to tell you that I didn’t understand all of this. (And you know how I’m always saying that some books are better as audiobooks? This one was not. It would have helped me to be able to read and re-read some of these sections, until the lightbulb came on. Tough to do in the car, especially in Chicago traffic.) I did come away with a better understanding of the way the current theories have developed. Looking at the ways that earlier theories morphed into different systems, were influenced by the political and philosophical beliefs of the time, and evolved into our modern sciences was illuminating. I feel like a little more conversant in those theories. I won’t be teaching any graduate-level physics courses, but if — at a cocktail party, let’s say — someone starts throwing out terms like boundary conditions and probability amplitudes, then I can come up with a bit of witty banter about multiverses and excuse myself to grab another cocktail.This book is funny. From the very first chapter and its shout out to Douglas Adams and The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, it’s obvious that these two authors are serious, but not somber.“In other words, if you see a herd of zebras fighting for a spot in the parking garage, it’s because there really is a herd of zebras fighting for a spot in the parking garage.”The humorous examples give your brain a bit of a break from some weighty subject matter. It helps, and they keep you going even when you’re pretty sure you’ve lost the thread of the discussion. I am still better off and better informed for having read it, and I think eventually I will pick it up in print, see if reading it on the page helps me parse it a little better. Until then, I will console myself with the fact that ground-breaking American physicist Richard Feynman once said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.” At least I’m in good company."

Yeah, Hawking. Another I like is The Elegant Universe. OK, I'm a bonafide Geek cardholder.....Publisher's SummaryTHE FIRST MAJOR WORK IN NEARLY A DECADE BY ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREAT THINKERS—A MARVELOUSLY CONCISE BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFEWhen and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation?The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet—if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity.In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything.” If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design is a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other."
141,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6006763-matty,0,"Imperfect Creation by Marcelo Gleiser and The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking and Leonard MlodinowMarcelo Gleiser in his book Imperfect Creation has attempted to reconcile science with god, something that leaves a rather bitter taste in my obviously biased mouth. His attempts are disguised loosely in a shroud of science but unfortunately it seems Gleiser stopped researching scientific theory in the 1980's at some point and has failed to keep up with modern discovery which puts him at serious disadvantage.Not only is Gleiser in ignorance of the modern theories put forward by science but it is evident that he is also ignorant of the established scientific principle, what’s more he seems to be happy to continue the habit as he states “our need to believe trumps all evidence against that belief”. I found it somewhat insulting that Gleiser took it upon himself to put words and thoughts in the mouths and minds of posthumous scientists insisting Kepler would not deny the existence of god if he could see his laws work across the cosmos and suggests Laplace was merely joking when he famously told Napoleon that god was not needed to account for planetary motion.I could continue to poke holes in Imperfect Creation; instead I am offering an alternative to quench the thirst for the pop science reader. The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow has just been published and in it the two authors also argue that there may not be one unifying law that describes our universe; however, here we are offered scientific theory, theory that has been established after observation and analysis, theory that is testable and accountable. The Grand Design introduces us to M Theory. M Theory is a new take on quantum mechanics that does not claim to be an all encompassing single law but rather a series of laws that have overlap to form a continuum that can be applied.Hawking and Mlodinow execute this book wonderfully, with intelligence, insight and humour. Philosophy is inserted back into science cleverly and unashamedly exploring what is meant by the term ‘reality’, explaining it is a model construct and that other less conventional models can be used so long as they meet the criteria. Although the concepts are at the forefront of modern science and require abstract thinking to understand, the authors here write with such elegance as to simplify the ideas without condescension. The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow is essential reading for anyone curious about the workings of the universe, reach over Imperfect Creation and pick up The Grand Design."
142,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1803037-alan-levine,2,"As learned theologians may prove poor connoisseurs of science and its methods, and correspondingly unable to articulate what science is to the general public, so conversely being a top-notch scientist does not mean one has more than average abilities to address the existential questions of theology.Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow conclude that science now serves man in the role formerly played by philosophy and religion. They do this without acknowledging they now espouse a new philosophy and a new religion of sorts. Save that it's not really new. For as G.K. Chesterton pointed out, a materialist is a materialist is a materialist whether they live in the twelfth century or the twenty-first century. And so for a theist. The difference between now and then is today we have more data and more complicated theories with which to deal. Deny it though they might - surely they would - Hawking and Mlodinow are really neo-pantheists. They worship in the church of scientific materialism and on their altar is gravity. For the punch-line of The Grand Design is that the law of gravity makes an otherwise improbable universe inevitable. Gravity is a priori. But while they point out that the religionist is fairly asked whence the God they worship comes from, the scientists never feel the need to ask themselves Who authored the law of gravity. The book itself is okay. It is reasonably well-written, concise, and beautifully illustrated. However, there is much in the substance of the science and theory that is unsatisfactory. In fairness, the only way it could be made complete in this respect while maintaining its readability were if the reader to go earn a doctorate in theoretical physics and then come back for a fuller treatment of the technical details of quantum mechanics and m-theory. But then, that would be a different, and much longer book. Read The Grand Design for a glancing view of the picture of creation which physics and cosmology have revealed to those smart enough to design the experiments, manipulate the math, and imagine the theories. But don't get your theology from the authors. Better to read the Sermon on the Mount, G.K. Chesterton, C.S. Lewis, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Mother Theresa, Elder Porphyrios and so on, for one's spiritual education. For while Hawking and Mlodinow may be brilliant scientists, they are mediocre atheists who believe they've evolved beyond God. In doing so, they've become mere pagans fetishizing not mountain spirits and wood demons, but rather gravity, m-theory, and all the universes they see in their equations."

The only airport bookstore I found was tiny and the books on the shelvers were all titles I could only imagine reading under extreme duress (or, rather, wouldn't want to be seen reading unless under extreme duress -- I'm such a snob), and I was on my way out of the store, despairing of having anything to entertain myself but my own over-active and troublesome imagination, but especially no shield against strangers and the rest of the world, when I saw the name Stephen Hawking in big, stark letters and I knew I was saved.Just for background, without the influence of Stephen Hawking, I might not have a master's degree in physics. Really. I count four main influences (other than my parents) in my choice of a physics degree. The other three were teachers/professors. A boy who was enamored of me once sent me a copy of A Brief History of Time. It was a really good gift. Probably the best gift I ever got from a boyfriend before I met my husband, who buys me bookshelves. (I just checked, because I couldn't remember, and the book wasn't inscribed. That boy was kind of an idiot.)This is a book of grand ideas on the nature of the universe -- that tries to establish an understanding of the scientific theories on the most basic and fundamental questions underlying the universe. So, you know, big. From grand unified theories to the big bang to string theory, with multi-verses, alternate histories, and the probability of a Chinese pope along the way. It goes about explaining all this with humor, some fabulous illustrations, and Hawking's trademark straight-forwardness, which assures that ""all of this is understandable.""That said, I had my usual complaint about this book that I have about all science books written for a lay audience. That is, my understanding is always deepened when I can see the math. It's just how my brain works. Most lay readers, however, are terrified of equations, so it will remain a problem for me. It only really bothered me in the section on Feynman's sum over histories -- something never really covered in any of my classes, but which I'd like to understand better. Time to get myself a textbook?I would say there is no better place to look for a small, easy-to-understand (but intelligent!) book on the current scientific understanding of the history and structure of the universe, were it not for the recent (maybe) discovery of the Higgs boson -- there's not so much on elementary particles here. Still recommended, anyway. "

Short/quick read, highly recommended for any science nerds out there."
145,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27248823-vishal,5,"If you happen to be an avid science reader and enthusiast, then this book is definitely an answer to some of the queries which may arise in your mind during your explorations of the facets of science. Although, the book is written simply and touches very briefly some of the difficult topics in theoretical physics, you need a familiarity with such concepts to understand the text. You can start with earlier books of Hawking and , maybe, some about basic quantum mechanics. And if you are a sore loser at physics, then don't even try with this book!The last line may appear a bit harsh, but that is a response to the numerous critical analyses this book has evoked, some of which are like 'raises more questions than answers' and so on. In my case, it clarified many of my queries and speculations and I'm fairly satisfied with it.The idea of multiverses, alternative histories, relation of anthropic principle to the ultimate theory of Universe is elaborated and easily assimilable for anyone who is familiar with modern physics. The best part, however, in book is the illustration of the mathematical Game of Life by John Conway. It shows how a very simple set of absolute rules can lead to complex apparent laws in a two-dimensional Universe. Hawking doesn't say whether our Universe may or may not be governed by such absolute or ultimate set of rules, but he indeed specifies that how a Universe can create itself out of nothing without needing a Creator. This particular explanation, in my opinion, is quite convincing and irrefutable.Some people may whine and slam the book on that basis that it eliminates the reasons for a Creator to exist, but I insist that for that reason alone this book should be read. But remember, you need to be familiar with basic modern physics.Coming back to Hawking and his ideologies protrayed in his subsequent texts, if you follow him since the beginning, you may observe a certain sort of evolution in his ideas about Universe. Reading his books in chronological order shows how much the Science and he, himself, has progessed in just a few decades.It is true, that the book doesn't end our queries but raises some more, but it must be kept in mind that a writer can write only so much in a book for common readers. We must, therefore, seek some other measures(more scientifically oriented books) to quench our curiosity, and so this book definitely inspires the common reader to jump into the sophisticated realms of science. Applause!"
146,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1429082-daniel-solera,3,"The Grand Design is as close as I will ever get to understanding quantum physics and the incomprehensible nature of the cosmos. Written with mathematician Leonard Mlodinow, author of The Drunkard's Walk, the book is a short attempt to explain the behavior of atoms, subatomic particles and the origins of the universe using quantum theory, string theory and the so-called M-theory or ""Theory of Everything"".As is routine with books dealing with concepts like quantum physics, the multiverse and Feynman's histories, there comes a point where the subject matter, no matter how coddled and oversimplified, becomes too mind-bending to follow. The book reads like its authors expeccted to reach a broader audience than the elite scientists who would simply use the book as a very brief compendium of their life's work. The diction and occasional quip suggest that it is meant for the average (but sufficiently educated) lay person. This, however, does me no favors because I was scratching my head throughout most of the middle 50% of this book. If you're anything like me, then simply trying to understand the universe is an ordeal. Now try to imagine a fifth dimension, or a sixth. Or the idea of the nonexistence of time. Or the fact that all particles exist everywhere at the same time until noticed by an observer. Or the curvature of space (though he did get me to briefly understand this, which was a relief).Towards the end of the book, Hawking makes his final case for the validity of science by showing how the very nature of the universe allows for the development of life without the need for a creator. He does this by explaining that had the forces that govern the existence of the universe (gravity, strong and weak nuclear force, electromagnetic forces, etc.) been any different, life would have not emerged. His argument is, the conditions are there for life, there's no evidence that it was created. However, I can just as easily hear the counterargument: they were designed in such a way to support life by a creator who knew the exact parameters. But if an omnipotent being wanted life in the cosmos, he could just make it so without need for specific parameters. And so on, and so forth, ad infinitum.All matters of theology aside, if you want a primer on quantum physics, this is a great place to start."

Just to avoid misunderstandings, they delivered all I've expected: the anticipated serendipity! It's just I expected more.The concept to unfold the nature of reality and the human struggle to comprehend it through history of science was fantastic. However, despite the fact that the topic of the Designer was unavoidable, allowing the story to drift away toward proximity of infinite regression is somewhat strained, a bit desperate. The scientist who starts arguing about whether there is a giant turtle or not or any other kind of designer is on risk to be attracted by religious pull, and will miss the beauty of the journey of exploration by becoming a kind a believer theyselves too. I still think it's much wiser to say: We just don't know!No, I don't think both of my heroes, Mr. Hawking, nor Mr. Mlodinow are about to speculate to avoid the journey of finding things out, I was just surprised with involvement of, if there is, or there is no, some creator -I don't think we have enough evidence to claim that physical laws which govern the universe can exist just by ""per se"". Some claim, where there is a law, there is an intelligence as well! To believe, I must have evidence.To think about who or what made all we perceive as reality is challenging and exciting, but there is no need to immediately, obligatory every time we jump and knock on all doors for ultimate truth whenever we dive into philosophy, cosmology or physics.Those who like to have things right to the point will be delighted with ""The Grand Design"", because what is captivating the attention is the impressively concise style and the Mlodinow type of language precision I had pleasure to enjoy in his ""The Drunkard's Walk"" in the past.I thought it will be somewhat much unique, but don't take me wrong, it was a joy to read every raw of this Book! Thanks a lot!"
148,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5218053-rick-sand,3,"Stephen Hawking tries to revitalize the argument of ""what is reality"" using science instead of philosophy. There is a significant portion of this book dedicated to explaining how the universe could exist without a creator. I don't think it's an effective approach. Hawking, for example, writes about how particles can appear out of nothing, so two particles could have appeared from nothing, collided, and created the big bang. Well, it's backed up enough by data that has been observed to follow that logic, but then one must wonder: ""Where did the particles come from?"" Or where do the laws of nature that allow for this spontaneous creation from nothingness come from? All Hawking does is present answers that can be further questioned, which means it's impossible to rule out a creator. Now I'm not a religious person, so this point of view isn't slanted by religious bias. Even with the main purpose of the text a misfire, there are some interesting ideas explored in this book, presented in a way a non-scientist (like myself) can mostly understand. This book is not as easy to read as Hawking's ""Brief History of Time"" and includes a number of chapters that non-scientists may find difficult. Overall, it is reasonably accessible to a larger audience. The discussion of ""what is reality?"" is probably the best part of the book, beginning with an easy to contemplate perspective on reality to a goldfish. To a goldfish, the world outside the bowl is curved due to the shape of the bowl. The same mathematics we use would not function in a fishbowl. It basically explores the idea that all reality is a construct of human observation, that reality is relative to the observer. A number of other science concepts are discussed, particularly in the field of quantum physics. I rate this book 3/5 stars because it is fairly easy to read with some exceptions, presents some interesting ideas, but completely fails to make any strong argument about whether or not a creator exists, which seems a primary purpose of the text."
149,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,4,"Stepehen Hawking's book The Grand Design is a popular science digest of what contemporary physics has to offer human beings about the underlying nature of the world. Some of the astonishing theories are the following. (1) Multiple universes did, do, or will exist that arose, are arising, or will arise from quantum jitters, at least one of such occurrence created the universe human beings inhabit and which is (obviously) conducive to life. (2) The world as we know it has no definite history but several possible histories, some more probable than others. The state of any physical system now or in the future is also at most only probabilistic as well. (3) Multiple dimensions exist, perhaps as many as ten (10), but humans of course perceive only three (3) spatial dimensions. (4) There is no guarantee that the world exists as humans perceive it, since we evolved to perceive the world as we do because perception of objects as extended in space, colored, possessing traits/qualities like hardness, warmth, and so forth are all advantageous to our perceptual system. Riding close on the coat-tails of the previous claim, (5) model-dependent realism is the best we have to understand the world, which involves taking as given input to the human perceptual system and constructing better and better theories so that we could more optimally align the theories and the observable data to create sounder explanations and more accurate predictions of phenomena. The book was almost perfectly comprehensible except for the last chapter, in which it was difficult to understand the aspects of a game analogy (read for yourself) to the creation of the world; it read as though it was a little hurriedly produced too. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book, and it is now one of my new favorite books."
150,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1122754-lostinanovel,3,"An enjoyable read for someone with no scientific background.  I enjoyed the history of scientific achievements relating to our self-understanding and diminution. Hawking writes with humor even including several New Yorker cartoons. However, I must confess confusion at the harder concepts.  I can regurgitate his views and summarize them but not with understanding. And in a higher sense, for me, this ironically leads me to simply have ""faith"" in his views. The theories of quantum physics can be explained and he can even discuss tests which prove their validity but it isn't easy to grasp. I can travel round the world, I can drop two weights from a tree but how can I prove to myself that things work ""kinda funny"" at the atomic level? Not that I don't believe Hawking, I do. But I recognize that my faith is in Mr. Hawking,  Mr. Feynman and the general scientific community which I assume has scrutinized their work. It's a faith in society and its pressures, for which I am sure cause the God-believers to roll their eyes. I should say that I think the media has somewhat misrepresented what Hawking is saying about God.  He never says God doesn't exist.  What he says is that every natural phenomenon, including the origins of the universe (and all other universes), can be scientifically explained.  There is no need to use God as The Explanation.  For me, I picked up this book because I thought that this seemed such an important question, however, as I read on, I realized that in the end, I am not sure these questions really matter to my daily life.  So there are multiple universes and time is infinite?  Ok, should I have red or white with dinner tonight?"
151,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1939617-andrew,4,"I just finished Hawkings new novel and figured I'd share some thoughts. First as others have said, this book is a bit more dry than A Brief History of Time, and lacks a good chunk of the wit and humor that made ABHoT so enjoyable.This book can really be divided into two parts. The first part is an excellent summary of mankind's quest to mathematically describe the laws of nature. Much of the info is about the current push to unify the laws of physics, in particular Quantum Mechanics and Gravity, the micro & the macro. Where the book really succeeds here is in its description of Quantum Mechanics in terms that a layperson might understand (read non-mathematical). I have read probably half a dozen non technical descriptions of Quantum Mechanics and Hawking's is by far the clearest, most concise, and most understandable I have read.On the other hand, where I felt the book fell short was in describing The Grand ""Design"". The book concludes very abruptly. I read a digital copy of the book and I honestly thought I might have been missing the last few pages. The problem is that Hawking spends a large portion of the book explaining the background you need to understand his conclusion, but never clearly makes the connection from his supporting materials to what is ultimately his grand conclusion.In summary, read this book if you want to understand Quantum Mechanics and Physics quest for unification in easy to understand non-technical terms. If you are hoping for Hawking to make some grand insight (he does) AND clearly connect it to his supporting materials (I feel he does not), you can skip this one."
152,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/765496-katharine,1,"Regurgitated Science, Anti-religious RantingsTo pick up a book by Stephen Hawkings, a reader probably already has an interest in science, and in the universe in particular. For someone like me, a high school physics and math teacher and a student of space science my entire life, I found this book to merely repeat much of the material on a ""Theory of Everything"" that I have read elsewhere. Unlike other books I have read, I felt like, for the derogatory ""general"" reader to which this book refers as its audience, it does a paultry job of explaning the theories on which the authors' new assertion are based. I was even more disappointed to discover that the new material I read in this book constituted only 10 out of a 180 pages (and I feel I am being generous in giving the authors that many). In those 10 pages, much of what the authors discussed I have read in Scientific American articles. The authors also spend an inordinate amount of time bashing religion. This is unnecessary in a science book and degrades from the validity of the authors' message. If the science is good, it will address the religious asssertions without wasting ink- for the mere 180 pages in this book, I would have preferred more science and less atheist propaganda. SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME: BUY THE SEPTEMBER 2010 ISSUE OF SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN AND READ THE AUTHORS' ASSERTIONS. Unless you're a science teacher who could use some of the additional illustrations in class, the book isn't worth the money. A better book for pictures is Hawking's ""The Illustrated Universe in a Nutshell."""
153,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,3,"First, to my physics friends, apologies for the likely sophomoric butchery that follows. The book's about quantum mechanics, some relativity, some cosmology with lots of frosting and little cake. Nonetheless it's very filling and satisfying. That's because this book is written at a good level for me, namely simplistic, lots of analogies, smells of over-simplistic explanations. Reading this, I'm made to think that my preferred mechanism for learning is successive passes through material, with ever greater granularity or ""pressure"" leaving big voids and bumps at first, but eventually smashing everything into flat comprehensibility at the end. Will I ever get there with quantum mechanics? Doubtful, frankly. I loved the description of the interference experiment, and the implication that, for small scales, it's the past we can control, while the future is unknowable; exactly the opposite of macroscopic causality. Can I have that right? It's mind bending.Re-cracking this book (just because I had nothing else to read last night) coincided with a SciAm article on string theory that drew inductive conclusions from linear, imaginary and then quaternion mathematics, citing 16 dimensional numbers as the next step, and infinite universes as a consequence if it's true. Since I believe in the manifest and miraculous fact that mathematics actually works to describe the universe in which we find ourselves, I accept the inference, and expect & hope that someday we'll prove these universes are out there. That's really cool. "

This book has been lying on the desk in my living room for a little while and I was curious about what was in it.There was information in this book that I found very interesting.... I was fascinated to learn a little of the 'history' of the origins of the universe. I found it very interesting that civilizations tend to go in patterns.There have been times when the belief is that a god or gods are at the center of creation. Then there are periods of time where scientific thought has taken over. It seemed amazing to me that after thousands of years,the same struggle seems to be occurring. I have to admit that I did not understand much of the quantum physics which Dr. Hawking tried to explain but the photos he used were very interesting and were somewhat helpful. The thought that continued to surface in my mind while reading this book was that although we may be able to explain everything in the universe at some point and that is a marvelous thing; it seems to me that those explanations somewhat take the 'magic' out of life. We ARE human beings after all. I think I would prefer to perhaps just EXPERIENCE my humanity without needing to know all the chemical and physical reactions that occur which makes me human.I admire Dr. Hawking and his intelligence and I am certainly a big proponent of science. I think though, that I will leave the science to others and try to just appreciate the mysteries of life."

One of these subjects happen to be Physics. Physics is the science that encompasses many of my favorite subjects of this 'universe'; be it cosmology, astronomy, particles or quantum physics, it has become apparent that I cannot get enough of the world of Physics.Stephen Hawking, a man who has been a hero of mine ever since that first time 10 years ago when I looked up at the sky with a slightly higher awareness than I usually did and fell absolutely in love with our universe, is this time around the author of the pop-science book I decided to pick up, and as was expected I enjoyed it very much.Swallowing up the book in a matter of one day in complete Black Hole fashion, I cannot honestly say that I learned a lot because I was already familiar with most of what was discussed in the book, but as Physics is an enormous science of such gigantic proportions there is always something new to learn in every book you read and it is this fact that continues to keep me amazed and entertained with child-like manner.Informative, occasionally humorous and vigorously atheistic, the book is, as I assume all books written by this man are, a perfect reflection of the character of Dr. Stephen Hawking. I would definitely recommend the book to both fans of the hero and those who are generally interested in our universe but I would probably hide the book from those offended by god being spelled with a lowercase 'g'."

When reading to hawking you should keep in mind that he is an atheist cosmologist, so everything he tries to explain through this book is not governed by god, it's made by the laws of nature, he believes that few physical theories explains it all, and god has no hand in quantum theories nor Newtonian's theories, therefore we are infinite and can't be ruled by a god.I disagree with This Scientific mind of him that didn't introduce him to god,so at the beginning of each chapter he clarifies more and more that the universe is self created and the big bang was the beginning of time, therefor god has no time to really create itThe book isn't written for scientists, so you as a normal reader will understand each and every single word, you might slow a bit while reading the chapter called ""the theory of everything"", much of information there which I found it really interestingNow I highly recommend you watch ""the theory of everything"" movie which travels through Stephan Hawking's interesting life, you'll get a brief look to his mind which helps a lot during this bookFor further understanding you should watch this documentary as well:https://youtu.be/VuyYGVDCdN0"

Certainly I won't be able to list everything Hawking explained in this book, but I must point out one fascinating concept that was, to my understanding, created by Hawking himself, which he called 'Model-dependent realism', in which Hawking defines what is reality, and how we are prisoners of our own brains, and yeah if you're thinking of #TheDress, I think model-dependent realism explains it, well, to some extent at least. Needless to say that I recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy one of its kind challenge to get their head around some of the most complex human knowledge. "

More clearly written than most of his books, but only if you're familiar with most of what he's talking about (IMO). While he's at it, it seems he wants to weigh in on why we don't need God as an explanation for the beginning of the universe. That may be true, but the thing is, parts of M theory are testable -- by observation, by math, and in the future with the LHC -- but it's certainly not yet proven. I say, attack the God explanation when you have the answers. Otherwise, stick to science, and let people draw their own conclusions.If you like reading Hawking and usually find his books helpful and explanatory, you will find this one moreso. If you don't, perhaps get this from the library and see if it's more clear, or skip it altogether for other explainers of science. The visuals are artsy first, and helpful second. Some are not too helpful at all. Glossy and glitzy, a nice read if you already know a few things about modern physics and cosmology from other sources.

Bohr replied by saying ""Einstein, stop telling God what to do!""Yes!! Einstein got into a discussion with Neils Bohr over the validity of Quantum Mechanics.

But after reading how the world's most notorious atheist Anthony Flew changed his mind and reached the conclusion of the need of the existence of a God in his book There is a God,I thought I should see how Stephen Hawking changed his mind too and started believing that there isn't a need of a God and the universe can explain itself by itself. But as much as I was disappointed after reading Flew's, Hawking's disappointed me too. Neither of them convinced me of their claims. However, this book was extremely informative.The first chapter gives an overview on philosophy and thought in a neat way. In the following chapters, Hawking takes on the concept of reality and perception, then classical physics, electromagnetism, and the quantum theory. After that, he takes all that he established and tries to show you that if we can link all these concepts of physics, along with the missing links, we'll be able to create the Theory of Everything, a tool that will help us answer all the ultimate questions of life, which in order will lead us to uncover the truth behind the universe's Grand Design."

On the other hand, at first I was super excited to read it, the 1st few chapters were super easy to go through and read quickly; I was like ohhh I took this principle in school ohh of course it's Galileo's law and ohh gosh that was super fun to learn in school, love physics! But it gets way more complicated than I thought, to the point I couldn't understand as much as at the beginning of the book. It took me a lot of time to be able to understand everything in this book from ancient history to the modern theories and not just by reading the book, I literally studied the book from A-Z , highlighted lines, side notes, and tried to study physics and philosophy from scratch. I have to mention Stephen Hawking took me on a beautiful science journey or I should say adventure. At the end I'd love to re-read it again and it will be much easier.

He got deep enough to prove his point and so that you felt like you learned a lot about the subject, but not too deep that it got boring. At one point he seemed to give an overview of the history of physics while simultaneously getting deeper and deeper inside the atom. Good stuff. I also learned from a clear source the difference between Newtonian physics and quantum physics as well as where and why the divide between them occurs.Ultimately, the purpose of the book was for Hawking to prove that the creation and the mechanics (or the ""how"") of the universe does not require some god character to make it all happen. At this, I feel like that he did pretty well. More and more of my hand-wavy ""God did it"" arguments seem to be settled by this book, but I don't think he put the final nail in the coffin either.

The Spectator thought that the authors should have provided some answers instead of just introducing mathematical concepts with ""such reckless abandon,"" while the New York Times Book Review called the book condescending and, more seriously, M-theory ""somewhat disappointing... a patchwork quilt rather than a fine, seamless garment."" Yet other critics felt that the authors did a fine job of clearly explaining why modern science may soon provide answers to large philosophical questions. As one critic, a professor of physics said, ""Deep stuff, indeed. Maybe in the end the whole multiverse idea will actually turn out to be right!"" (Washington Post). Or, as physicist Fred Bortz claims, possibly wrong. Only time may tell. This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
164,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076961-scotchneat,4,"Hawking and Mlodinow take on the big questions: Why are we here? How did we get here? What is the nature of reality? Do we need a god to explain how it all happened?This is one of the best ""state of physics"" for regular people books I've read. Really clear writing and some great illustrations that help with mental models of what's being described. The publisher must have had some money to spare too - we're talking high gloss paper, full-colour images... the works.The chapters build up to M-Theory and how that might answer the big questions. But along the way, there's easy-to-understand information about the process of scientific thinking and some good storytelling about the pieces of the Grand Unified Theory and quantum physics. I think they do a pretty good job of making strings sound reasonable and of explaining how the multiverse is really a most likely explanation. They think Feynman is cool (as do we all)...Anyway - great gift idea. Great read. Oh, and the answer to those big questions? Not 42."
165,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"Hawking claims on the first page that ""philosophy is dead."" This has caused some consternation among those people who consider themselves philosophers. However, if they read on, I believe that Hawking makes his case for this statement very well. A philosopher searches for the truth. Any philosopher who does not learn science in his search for the truth is not much of a philosopher. All ultimate truths will be found in science and not in philosophy. Hawking discusses how religious people often point out that life on earth could not be if everything weren't exactly like it is. But what they forget is that there are billions of stars in this galaxy and billions of galaxies in the universe. How many planets around all those stars? No one knows. The possibility of other life is quite possible and the odds of there being a planet with life like ours is not as remote as first thought. Hawking also discusses the possibility of many universes. How cool is that. "
166,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8076824-geoff,2,"I was so disappointed in this book. The earlier works by Stephen Hawking were written with much more clarity. This one, however, is a muddled mess. Each theory that it presents is explained much better in one of the many other physics books written by other authors for the layperson. This one however, glosses over so many things in order to try and give it a feeling of lightness. It is almost as if he was trying to say, ""See, you can understand all this theory too, with only a page and a half description."" Most of the topics covered though require several pages, and whole chapters in order to understand.The one saving grace of the book is that it has nice illustrations. Unfortunately, even with the nice pictures, you will still most likely end up just scratching your head and re-reading whole paragraphs, because the text is incoherent. Do yourself a favor, skip this one, and just re-read Mr. Hawking's A Brief History of Time instead. "
167,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"I believe this will be seen as some kind of watershed document regarding the physics of the universe. The authors have gone out of their way to represent their understanding of the current rules and laws of physics in comparatively simple language, explaining many issues relating to quantum physics; more significantly, they go beyond the basic scientific and mathematical information scientists have arrived at (most of which most of us would not understand anyway) and discuss what the implications and consequences of this approach are for our understanding of the universe (which we can more easily understand). In a sense, then, this is a philosophical work stemming from the science of quantum physics. The conclusion of the authors should put paid to those authors who wish to retain some kind of mystical or spiritual understanding of the universe."
168,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3573856-tee-jay,3,"This book is okay, albeit a tad bit complex. The authors try to explain really complex and intricate topics very lightly and, dare I say, superficially. Nothing is clear-cut or simple in this book. The language is easy enough to read; however, it is the ideas behind the language that are a real challenge. Unfortunately, because the authors do not spend very much time fleshing out these ideas (the whole book is less than 200 pages in length), the whole thing comes across as vague and permeated with a sense of being unfinished. And maybe that's okay. The authors, after all, are striving to get the point across that there is, out there to be discovered, one overarching and all-encompassing theory that is yet to be discovered but that will explain everything. That is, of course, if humans are ever able to ""get it"" all. "
169,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4519991-kate,4,"As someone who hardly knows anything about quantum physics, this book was incredibly approachable. Somehow they explained complex theories using simple visual analogies (the soccer ball going through slits in a wall like buckyballs). Very well written, interesting and intelligent discussion. However a couple things irked me: 1)their very condescending tone towards religion without having much to back it up, IMHO (at the most critical point, they summarized their findings in 1 paragraph argument against intelligent design, even though the whole previous chapter pointed out how incredibly improbably it is that we even exist). Then again, maybe the multiverse theory just wasn't convincing enough. 2)The most compelling mathematical equation and theory was in the last chapter. Like 10 pages of something they should have written a whole book about. Odd."
170,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8143362-shehreyar,3,"The only reason I'm giving this a 3-star is because I've read a dozen books by other authors covering about every question asked here. Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, (Stephen Hawking himself), Jared Diamond and Richard Dawkins. Between them, these guys have a metric buttload of literature concerning ""what the hell brought us here"" and ""how the hell did we become like this"", with some bad-ass physics thrown into the mix.Forgive me if you don't agree, but The Grand Design is just a resurrection of established principles and a re-asking of questions that've already been answered. I'm being liberal with my rating only because this my home-boy Stephen we're talking about (yeah, you heard me). He has a unique spin to everything, and I like grand designs of every manner since they rarely have a single explanation."
171,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27493200-joel-murray,3,"It's a good book and I like Stephen Hawking's style but after reading 3 of his books it seems like it's the same information each time, just with a different order and different emphasis. This one was more emphasising how the world around us can be explained purely in a scientific way without any need for divine intervention. I was interested to see what his take was on how the universe could come into existence by itself. However, the whole book is basically build up and he doesn't really get to this until the second last page, when he just skims over it. I felt that it was arguing more for a Creator than the atheistic approach he was trying to come from. An interesting read that was relatively short and had nice pictures but I'd recommend the illustrated Brief History of Time instead. I don't think there's a need to read both."
172,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10760120-ahmed-amin,3,"Hawking tried to answer existential questions in this book. He spends most of the chapters explaining different scientific theories right until the epitome of the book to propose his view of ""The grand design"", where he argues that the existence of all matter, from particles, atoms, time, universe and ultimately human beings is a random event that, though it has a very small probability, has occurred, without the intervention of a divine being. I personally was not convinced of his argument which is supposed to conform to M-Theory, a theory which he himself claims is a work in progress. However, I thought the book was avery useful and simple in explaining quantum physics (and many other physical theories), and provides a good historical account of how scientists philosophized about such existential questions, ranging from Aristotle, Newton and all the way to Einstein."
173,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412448-daniel-toker,4,"THE GRAND DESIGN is a remarkably accessible book. It's incredible how Hawking and Mlodinow manage to convey so much complicated information in such a short and even somewhat easy text. THE GRAND DESIGN definitely covers what I was missing from other works on theoretical physics: a discussion about the metaphysics/epistemology of choosing this particular model of reality, and a COMPREHENSIBLE explanation of quantum physics and Feynman's sum-over-histories. Also, it was of course enjoyable to see how the authors directly address the ""God issue,"" especially after Hawking's being labeled ""religious"" by those who want to claim that some brilliant scientists believe in God. (And the irony of the religious-sounding title is genius.)"
174,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7124746-david-press,3,"At its best, this book was fascinating, and it helped me wrap my mind in astonishment around some trippy quantum theories about the universe, and grasp the relationships between a Euclidean-Newtonian universe and a Schrodinger-Heisenberg-Feynman universe and the search for an M-theory, a a hypothetical theory of everything. When I look at my own writing, it seems that my characters have Euclidean heads, but they live in a world of multiple realities. I never realized that. And the Fibonacci illustrations of conch shell, Milky Way, maybe the entire universe, are archetypically awesome. But it's not always at its best. The last 40 pages seemed to peter out, rush toward conclusion without taking the same care as the first 3/4th of the book. "
175,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35457272-matthews,3,"This novel is a short, quick read to read when you have nothing better to do. Although it did clarify a number of things for me, it lacked to state what he said he would state ""When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? What is the nature of reality?"". All Steven does in this novel is restate what many other novels have brought up, the double slit experiment and even gave a 5th grade history lesson on how science began. Now I know that you may be thinking that I'm being too hard on this book, and that may be true. This book is simply not for those who know the perils of early science, who have never heard quantum physics or string theory or, well, you get the point. That's the bottom line, this book is simply for those who are new to these concepts."

What I liked, I really liked: the ideas about model-dependent reality, the discussion of the nature of time and space, the descriptions of paradoxes and experiments that were interesting for their strangeness. What I didn’t like, I really didn’t like: the needless history of all scientific observation, the corny jokes that came just when the cosmos were getting weirdly complex (as if I’d lose focus without a punchline), and a general way of glossing over key ideas. But on the whole it was not a bad book to have read. It probably works as a primer for something more detailed and carefully articulated."
178,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1748650-timothy-green,1,"This is the worst book I've read since I read the first page of The Da Vinci Code. The humor is patronizingly corny, and worse, what should be mesmerizing science turns dull with flat prose and shoddy metaphors. The authors go into too much detail where it's unnecessary, and reveal too little where it would be interesting. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs out of boredom or confusion alternately. If you want to read compelling science-writing about the evolution of modern cosmology, read Michio Kaku's Hyperspace. If you want to read about M-theory, read his Parallel Worlds. But there are numerous physicists who do a better job than Hawking -- just pick one."

This book is a very rudimentary introduction to basic physics, from the ancient Greeks to relativity to quantum theory, which is very scant on detail and full of useless and distracting anecdotes.Even worse, the book does nothing to illuminate its supposed subject: M-theory and how it provides some unification of the disparate theories of gravity, particle physics and quantum theory."

How rude of me! I am deeply sorry. It made the book a good 40 pages less! People are really clever, they figure out how the universe works for us plebs who have difficulty remembering their 8 times table (...me).

Puts together the accumulated knowledge of centuries of speculation and scientific growth and inquiry and recent decades of technology-enabled testing. The conclusions are bold and well reasoned and, no doubt to many, unsettling. A very solid argument that our key to moving forward in our understanding of the universe must involve more creative, out-of-box thinking. He leads by example and shows us the many thought pioneers who have led us to where we are today. Awesome book for people who ask questions of their world and aren't satisfied with the disrespectful and repetitive answer 'because'. "
182,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,4,It is a good book to stay relatively up to date on what current physicists and cosmologists are working on. It answers a lot of questions but leaves some weakly answered or unverified. Will wait some more years for more verification before I can fully accept it as a package of theories (though some seem to hold according to current observation). I just honestly hope that observations are verified and never manipulated. A lot of the theories or aspects seem to be impossible to verify or deny which is both a strong and weak point. I guess this model will remain in use as long as it serves its purpose.

I like some tangible examples, like the ""straw"" example when explaining M-Theory. I am encouraged to read other books, from other authors, probably ""Our mathematical universe"" by Max Tegmark.cons: It is not well written for most parts. Some sentences are very long and hyphenated; Very confusing! I believe a good editor could have made a big difference. It feels like the book was written in rush. I am particularly unsatisfied with the the last few pages. The arguments on why universe as a whole can appear from nothing are very brief and vague to me."

This book is all muddled together though. It familiarized me with some of the theory and terminology behind the physics of the universe (or multiverse). The theories were poorly discussed though. This book introduces complex theories that claim to explain the nature and origin of everything, yet the theories are pretty poorly explained. They make claims to refute God, while never really giving good evidence to prove their case. At least the book looks nice on my book shelf with my other sciencey books. "

But unfortunately, that's not the case with this book. For some bizarre reason, the authors repeatedly interject silly humor into their arguments against the universe being created by God as we know him. These are two men of proven brilliance, writing for a general audience. But if this is their idea of the best way to reach a mass audience well, all I have to say is ; I'm insulted."

Ajmal Shabbir is forcing me to go, so i cant complete my review now. But I'll tell in short latter what is the crux of the book. Hmmm.. so this is the book humans waiting for centuries... more books like it should come to the market. But I think it'll take time, because the answers with which the book dealt with are not easy ones. The most important question ""why there is something rather than nothing"" is at last answered.

This is very interesting, but I can't help but feel that Hawkings, who on the first page in this book declares philosophy dead, miss out on a lot of philosophical discussions the thoughts and theories in this book points at."

It is concise, straight to the point and answers the questions of anyone who is curious about physics and hasn't yet delved into the depths of quantum mechanics. It is a very well written book, and I enjoyed the random humorous infusions in various sentences. For example a paragraph about the interference of light might contain words such as football or croissant. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in theoretical physics and modern day researches that sometimes verge on the sci-fi, but that I personally find to be the most interesting part of science.

It seemed like it was trying to be profound, but it fell far short of that mark.If you've never learned a thing about science in your life, perhaps you might get more out of it. Even as a dilettante of science, it didn't flesh out ideas enough for me, and just went over the very basics as if it was a 5th grade explanation of the overall big picture of science.That doesn't mean in anyway that I think any less of Stephen Hawking.

237,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5991278-marc,3,"For my full review: http://wp.me/pS9A9-9AOverview: Well, this book certainly tackles some tough physics subjects and presents them so the lay person (e.g. someone like me) can get their head around it. I asked a real-live theoretical physicist some questions about the book, and since I was able to articulate the theories reasonably well, I’d say the authors did a pretty good job.The authors take the reader step-by-step (more or less) from how physicists look at the universe, to how they model theories about the universe, to how the idea of multiple realities (and universes) fit into “M-theory” (the current reigning champ of physics), to how all of this points to a “grand design” that can be explained by science.I’ll briefly attempt to hit the main points of the book (wish me luck), informed by my talk with the physicist (let’s call him T-dogg), and then I’ll give my reaction to some of the theories described.The Meat & Potatoes:(You'll get it later).So basically physicists have been trying to figure out models and theories that explain the workings of the universe. The Newtonian way of looking at things has worked pretty well for bigger things, but does not work so well on the quantum (really, really tiny) scale—that’s what quantum theories are for. The physics “holy grail” is to find a single model/theory that encompasses both scales in one unified theory.Before we begin with the difficult stuff, they lay out that there are four known forces governing our universe: Gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force (what binds neutrons and protons together in the cores of atoms), and the weak force (something that causes radioactivity and formed important stuff in the early universe). Physicists have tried to find quantum theories of all these forces to explain workings at the scale.It seems they (by “they” I mean the physics community in aggregate) have mostly given up on this quest. Instead, they have what is called “M-theory” (with no agreement on what the “M” stands for). But the gist of this theory is that it encompasses a whole range of models that are used in specific situations in the universe—basically the Swiss-army knife of physics. Or it might become one big fundamental model as it gets refined. Part of the issue is our technological ineptitude; however far we seem to have come, there’s always some things out of reach that just can’t be verified through direct observation (too small or too big). [T-dogg says that the CERN supercollider will help cull some of these theories with its experiments, thereby making M-theory even leaner].But, even in the things that are observable, some results were just difficult to make sense of (like how shooting molecules through two slits results in patterns that don’t make intuitive sense). In a sort of chicken or egg situation (as far as IRelax Tyra, you wouldn't even notice. Gosh, you're such a diva!understood it), a physicist (Feynman) came up with some math to explain these counter-intuitive findings, and they trust the math. The authors wish to point out, however, that the same math that makes sense of this odd pattern, also allows for the molecules traveling through the slits to take all the infinite paths available (e.g. the molecule traveling straight through the slit or the molecule looping around Jupiter twice before going through the slit) and at the same time. The probabilities of what path the molecules take is what’s important; i.e. it’s more probable that the molecules will go through the slits rather than through Tyra Bank’s underwear first.Toss in the assertion that observation alters what you’re observing (Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle and quantum physics), and at the quantum level, even though one could observe a particle at any point along its path, in-between those observations that particle is still taking every path imaginable and simultaneously. This leads to the conclusion that the observations one makes on a thing in the present affects its past (and hence, there is no single past (or history) of that thing.[T-dogg says most physicists understand that extrapolation, but don’t care about all those other paths since it doesn’t really help with their work].With me so far?Don't buy real estate in these dimensions!The authors then go on to say a similar thing about our universe(s); i.e. there are an infinite number of universes (well, 10500 of them) with 11 space/time dimensions each, and each of those dimensions are present in various forms in all the different universes. In our universe, all but 3 dimensions (plus time) are wound so infinitely tight and small, that they’re unobservable. And, according to the authors, all physicists care about is our universe, not what occurs in the other universes since we’re operating within the parameters of our particular universe (i.e. those 4 dimensions we live in). Further, since particles are made up of patterns of vibration (or “strings”—hence String Theory), those curled up dimensions determine the “laws of nature” (e.g. the charge of an electron or how particles interact with each other) in any particular universe (and are constrained by the math making all of this possible).Still with me? (Don’t worry, I’m not sure I’m even with me at this point).Let’s take a step back; at first scientists explained everything they could observe with their own eyes or early scientific tools, using mathematical models. As our technological advances allowed us to observe more, things got complicated. “Then came quantum uncertainty, curved space, quarks, strings, and extra dimensions, and the net result of their labor is 10500 universes, each with different laws, only one of which corresponds to the universe as we know it” (p. 119).Okay, so what does this mean for the origin of our universe and where it’s going? Well, the authors argue that the Big Bang (BB) is pretty well supported through observation and mathematical models. (The BB theory, if you recall, is that all matter was condensed into a singularity (a point with infinite mass) that expanded and gave birth to galaxies, stars, and us. It’s also a really good TV show). That theory qualifies the origin of the universe as a quantum event, and, being such, “the universe appeared spontaneously, starting off in every possible way” (p.136). And, given the current theories and math, time began with the beginning of the universe since it functions differently at the quantum level: “the question of what happened before the beginning of the universe is rendered meaningless” (p.135).But where it the universe going? Well, it’s stretching out, and they use the analogy of the surface of an expanding balloon. If we (and other galaxies) are all at different points on the surface of a balloon that is blowing up (i.e. stretching), then things are getting further apart while their relative position to each other remains the same. A few solutions to the mathematics reveals that the universe will either a) contract back on itself; b) expand forever; or c) the expansion will slow to near zero but never quite reach stalling.The authors conclude: “For these reasons M-theory is the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe. If it is finite—and this has yet to be proved—it will be a model of a universe that creates itself” (p.181).Issues RaisedWell, if you got this far, and if I did a reasonable job summing the book up as objectively as I could, perhaps their description of the universe raised some questions for you. It certainly did for me!1. Much of their modeling depends on math—a man-made device. Sure there is some universality to it, but I’ve always viewed math as an incomplete, albeit sophisticated tool. Why? One question: what is any number divided by zero? (Answer: “undefined” or “meaningless.”) What? One of the most fundamental numbers in mathematics has undefined/meaningless attached to it? Riiiight.2. Several times throughout the book, the authors seem to dismiss a fundamental question as “meaningless” simply because…well, I’m not sure why. I think it’s because their mathematical model doesn’t support it (e.g. what existed before the beginning of the universe). Or how about the balloon analogy? My question is: what is the “balloon universe” expanding into? (T-dogg said it doesn’t matter because we can’t observe it—it’s outside the realm of our understanding).3. The authors tend to take digs at religion throughout the whole book. (Miracles, intelligent design, etc.). While I’m not religious myself, it seems a little funny for them to denigrate a set of beliefs when they have essentially invented dimensions and universes to “make the math work” in their own description of the universe. Of course, I’m sure to most lay people, the idea that a particle traveling through a slit to a detection board takes every possible path at the same time is equally superstitious-sounding. They dismiss things they can’t explain (beginning of time and what is outside the expanding balloon), and yet it is tenets in religion that try to provide an explanation for these very things. I’m not saying one side is right, I’m just saying that both sides are suspect on issues that the human mind has trouble comprehending, and both sides have found a safe haven to ease that cognitive dissonance (i.e. faith or math).4. And, if things at the particle level are so infinitely possible, why isn’t it possible for things to happen at the quantum scale that could result in observable “miracles?” If all paths/histories are viable, why couldn’t water molecules change just enough to allow someone to walk on them for a brief time? Sure the probability might be incredibly low, but not impossible—and that makes all the difference in the universe.5. There often seems to be some sort of exception made whenever something doesn’t agree with a well-established theory. For example, Einstein’s relativity postulate that nothing can move faster than the speed of light has been a staple ever since he stuck his tongue out to decorate college dorm rooms and t-shirts. Yet, in order for the expansion of the Big Bang to have taken place, things had to have moved faster than the speed of light. Their answer? That speed limit does not apply to the expansion of space itself (even though we could not have—and currently cannot—observe such a thing; it’s all in the math).In the end, I gave the book a 6/10 because, although a lot of it seemed funky to me, it did present some awfully complicated theories in a way that even I could understand it (given my conversation with T-dogg). But in the end, it merely opened up more questions for me about science rather than impressing me that we’re on the verge of really understanding the universe and all its mysteries."

239,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2887291-paul-donahue,4,"If my knowledge of quantum physics before this was 0 out of 100, I'm now, I think, at about a generous 2. So forewarning -- this is likely to be one or more of the following: boring, completely wrong, and the most asinine and laughable goodreads review I have ever written. I can already feel it. GET JUICED. Also, I don't know the difference between a theory and a hypothesis so I'll probably use one or both of them incorrectly. F'ing sue me.In a very amateur way I'm a big fan of reading about space, but I usually get annoyed and...space out...during the physics parts to focus on the mind blowing awesomeness of outer space. It's just so big! I really enjoyed A Brief History of Time (the parts I understood anyway) a number of years ago and was mesmerized by Hawking's recent 3-part thingamabob on the universe (which you can find on Netflix, highly recommended). So you can imagine how easy it was for me, as I perused the Books on CD at the local mom and pop bookstore, to not think twice about dropping 40 bucks on something called THE GRAND DESIGN by Stephen Hawking. I need some material for my commute to work this summer, and ""Stephen Hawking writing and fortunately having someone else narrate his musings on space"" was right on point.Then you can imagine my initial dismay to realize, upon scouring the back of the box after the purchase, that this thing is physics-heavy. All I wanted was 4 CDs worth of mind blowing statistics about how big and far away celestial bodies are from each other. So it was with the let-down version of sadness that I hit the road the other day and popped in disc one.Side note that might soon make sense: I wasn't a philosophy major in college or anything but I took a few classes and have often wondered, like Fukuyama's the ""end of history,"" if we're at the ""end of philosophy."" Is there ever going to be another Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Descarte, Nietzsche, Hume? Or have we reasoned what there is to reason? Then in about the 2nd minute of this book, Hawking hits with this: ""Philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge."" A little self-serving, but isn't he right? What is philosophy other than asking questions to which we don't know the answers? And what remains to ask other than how our universe is constructed and works? So bravo, Stephen Hawking, for hooking me in from the get go.My most common reaction as I drove through the four discs was, ""Wait...what?"" followed by a 30-second rewind, to only be slightly less confused but to continue on anyway. Part of the reason why I'm actually re-listening to maybe get to a 3 instead of a 2. But Hawking and his co-writer do a good job, or at least as best they can, of trying to explain things that generally require high-level physics degrees to an uneducated dork driving from Lincoln to Omaha. The first part of the book gives a brief history of scientific philosophy, beginning with the Ionian Greeks and culminating in recent experiments in quantum physics. I don't really care that I didn't get a lot of the intricate arguments in quantum physics...it was a cool history lesson.What I did do is pick up at least what I think is the basic premise of quantum physics: that physical matter at the quantum level behaves differently than matter readily and commonly observable by humans (such as experiments once conducted by Newton), and that this has huge implications for our understanding of ourselves, our world, and our universe. For example, Hawking says quantum physics demonstrates that objects do not have definite and objective states and histories -- they have, given our limited ability to observe them, ALL possible states and histories. He admits this obviously goes against common sense, but he also notes that common sense doesn't necessarily follow laws of nature. Two of his big arguments stuck out to me: One, that humans do not have free will. If you break us down far enough, each particle we're made of evidently obeys the laws of nature, and if we were somehow able to know about the state of each particle and had the time for complicated calculations for each one, we could predict with specificity what we as macro organisms will do in the future; thus free will is an illusion. Two, that God plays, and played, no role in the creation, history, or current state of the universe. I've read that some are quick to point out that he never explicitly states that God doesn't exist, just that everything about our physical universe, including its creation, can be explained without God. He does, however, write somewhat snidely about the belief in God.Which brings me at last to my two main problems with what I think he's saying. (Side note: My issues that follow shouldn't be confused with me taking some kind of offense to the argument that God didn't have a hand in creating the world or universe. I have no idea if he did or didn't, or if he is or isn't. My issues are with the nature of Hawking's arguments.)Nebulous, unstructured, long-winded problem #1: Hawking's (and apparently those of many physicists) arguments admit that we have no way of knowing whether what we observe is reality, or whether an objective reality exists at all. So we make arguments based not on what is objectively real, but what appears subjectively real to us as observers. ""Model Dependent Realism,"" so it goes, merely creates models that the version of reality we observe does not contradict. An example given is the world of The Matrix -- as far as proving a point goes, it doesn't matter if our world as we know it is ""real,"" what matters is it's possible to make Hypothesis A and in this world, it will accurately predict Observation B. Another example is that of a fish in a bowl. To us, a doorframe has straight lines. To a fish in a bowl, it has curved lines. Which is real? Who cares. If we were in the bowl with the fish, we could talk about the doorframe with curved lines, it would all be relative, and it would all make sense to us. Since we're outside the bowl, we talk about it in straight lines, and it makes equal sense. Maybe neither is actual reality, but since this is the one we're in, we might as well roll with it. My problem, finally, is that while the issue of reality can be dismissed for the purposes of creating theories that predict what we can observe, if we're really trying to find the ""answer for everything,"" we'd kind of need to know about things that are unobservable and possibly incomprehensible to us. You know...like God, or what we understand to be God. Let's say we're the fish, and reality is actually outside the bowl. We see everything in curved lines, reality is straight. Hawking says this is possible, but it doesn't matter because any argument that's wrong would be disproven by our observations. But what if we can't observe what's proving us wrong? His arguments already creep toward that range -- apparently physicists believe not only is there a fourth dimension, but eleven (or thirteen?) dimensions. Seems incomprehensible enough? I'm not trying to disagree with Stephen Hawking. He's brilliant, I'm an idiot. Ok. I'm just saying that IF something unobservable exists that alters what we perceive as reality, then an approach that trusts only what we can observe and then accurately predict is flawed. I think. If you're still actually reading this, what is wrong with you?Nebulous, unstructured, long-winded problem #2: I read in college about a dude named Anselm and his argument proving the existence of God. It begins by assuming that God DOESN'T exist, then builds valid premises upon that assumption, which naturally arrive at conclusions that contradict each other. Since contradictions are logically impossible, Anselm ultimately concludes the assumption that God doesn't exist must be false. (You can look up this argument on the internet, believe it or not.)Part of this argument involves calling God a ""perfect being"" (since if anything was more perfect, God could not then be God as we understand him). But our professor then demonstrated a fallacy in this argument by simply substituting any word for ""being."" The subject matter changed; the argument remained the same. Thus it would seem that there exists a perfect being, a perfect island, a perfect unicorn, a perfect Nickelback song.Why this long-winded tangent at the end of a long-winded review? BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE FREE WILL HELP Because it shows to me that no matter how valid the words of your theory are, they don't unequivocally prove anything that isn't actually observable. Hawking even mentions Anselm in this book, but doesn't address how it might apply to his arguments. He (and others) apparently argue that everything has every possible state and every possible history; that the universe was created from nothing through a physical process, etc. Obviously we have never observed these things. But they are predictions based upon theories that have yet to be contradicted by anything we've ever observed. Which is great. If we can observe it, I believe it. It just seems kind of like a Dhalsim-like stretch to get to everything else. But then again I'm not a quantum physicist. Or a physicist. Or a guy who took a math class after freshman year of college. Or a guy who would get anything above a zero on my high school pre-calc tests today. I'm just sayin. And if there's ever been a foolproof way to prove a point, it's to finish it by sayin...""just sayin."""
240,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9791152-phil,5,"This is a very small book about a very complex subject. Astronomy is one of those subjects I never had a class on in college. Geology is another subject I missed out on.I am trying to rectify my ignorance in these two fields by reading books on them and watching lectures on DVD.This book has helped a great deal even though I must admit I only understood 10% of what I read but that 10% was a great deal more than what I knew before reading the book.Hawking starts with the ancients who studied the skies beginning with the Ionian scientists who were looking for the basic substances of space to help them understand and explain the astronomical phenomena as well as the everyday celestial events. They based their scientific inquiry on observations and speculation.From the Ionians we move to Aristotle and speculation became front and center. The earthcentric theory that the earth was the center of the universe and all other plants circled it was the accepted theory and wholly adopted by the Church. Ironically the math worked with this view though the math was complicated and filled with the need for adjustments. Eclipses, tides and celestial events could be predicted accurately though the theory itself was flawed.In the 1500’s comes Copernicus who at the end of his life theorized the earth was not the center of the universe but rather another planet like the others and like the others revolved around the sun 93 million miles away. A century later Galileo came to the same conclusion and it almost cost him his life. He was forced to recant but is said to have whispered under his breath “It moves.”Newton developed the math and mechanics to explain gravity and for quite some time Newtonian mechanics ruled science as discovery after discovery was made.Here Hawking takes a pause to give the four characteristics that make up a good theory.First, it is elegant.Second, it needs few or no adjustments.Third, it can be verified through experiment and observation.Fourth, and most importantly, it can be used to predict events and do so accurately.In the German patent office was a young man who unleashed a new theory on the world that would challenge the beloved and cherished set of Newtonian mechanics. It was the theory of general relativity.Enter quantum physics. Now all bets are off. The world as we knew it is not the world that exists any more than the earthcentric world actually existed.The world is now filled with atoms, quarks, bosons, photons, electrons, the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg, the Big Bang theory, M theory, string theory and a world of ten or more dimensions.Subsequent experiments and observations proved him right and continue to do so today. The world he saw and described was one of chaos out which comes structure, verifiable and observable structure.The last section of the book is the most intriguing as the authors look at all the things that make the earth inhabitable and human beings possible and show the slightest deviance in any of them and it all falls apart. Everything had to be absolutely perfect for us to exist. How could such a world as ours exist without a divine creator, an intelligent designer if you will?Their explanation is complex but is built on a very few simple rules being followed. Each rule creates a new set of circumstances that also follow simple rules. The rules stem from the structure and do not exist without it. They were able to show that an explanation for the Big Bang and our subsequent existence does not require and Intelligent Designer.All that is needed is time; 14 billion years should about do it."
241,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4751055-marilyn-fontane,2,"The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow is not usually classified as sci-fi, but given that their ""final"" word on the design is hardly provable or in any major way capable of duplication, that is how I feel it should be designated. Yes, a lot of it is based on complicated physics, but a lot of it is based on philosophy, even though they claim to deny it.Basically, (a lot of the details escape me, and even the two authors themselves ignore presenting much proof, saying trust me on this [doesn't our dearly beloved President Donald Trump say the same thing?]), they claim M-theory covers everything and consequently replaces a need for a God. M-theory is actually a lot of smaller theories (some of which can actually be tested) each covering a portion of reality, which supposedly, when they cover identical parts of reality, do not contradict one another. Thus you end up with a quilt of theories which appear to be sewn together with no gaps or holes and which when sewn together cover the whole bed. This is the Grand Design.Having presented their Grand Design, they feel there is no longer a need for a God to set the whole thing in motion. Well, he may not be ""needed"" to study everything we can know of the universe, but they did not convince me that therefore he is not the Grand Designer, especially since they are talking about a universe consisting of eleven dimensions (Yes, I admit I only get four of them, the other seven are folded up somehow), one of which is time, and even religious believers claim God is in eternity which is outside of time--unlike the little spec which exploded in a big bang and created time and the other ten dimensions. Other parts of the book (and some of the more interesting parts) talk about the apparent miracle of our Goldilocks position. They begin by positing a multiverse (many universes appearing spontaneously out of nothing each with different laws of nature) and claim that most of them would not spew enough carbon and other heavier elements across the spectrum to create a universe like ours, so even as a universe we are in a Goldilocks situation. Then once created, given the billions of stars in the universe (by size, heat, gravity, etc.) and their relationship to the paths of their planets, very few are capable of creating the correct consistent temperature to support consistently liquid water which is necessary for carbon-based life. (Some sci-fi writers talk about silicon-based life forms, but they seem to dismiss that.) Rather than a universe teeming with life supporting planets, the view I get from this book is that we are, if not in a unique situation for development (as many religious believers would claim), certainly we are in a very rare group. But, as the authors also claim, we create history by observing it, rather than history creating us. Apparently Hawking, Mlodinow and I create differently. But although they did not convince me that they have proven god doesn't exist (although for scientific research I am convinced, and have been before reading this book, we do not need God to understand the world around us), it offers a fairly interesting conclusion, if at times the slogging through the text to get there is grueling. I find it hard to believe that this is really a ""best seller"" in the sense that many people who read it encourage others to buy and read it. It certainly is not simple enough to ""popularize"" science, and as I pointed out earlier, I was not convinced of their conclusion, nor do I think many people would be. But I did get some ideas from it, and do not think the time I put in on it was wasted."

243,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89631279-jon-harris,1,"Stephen Hawking's new book The Grand Design certainly has caused quite a stir in the ""pop-science"" community. Newspaper and online profiles presented Hawking's work as "" new answers"" to the ""ultimate questions of life."" Unfortunately for both Hawking and Mlodinow, their work is hardly new. What we are left with after reading Hawking's words is a theoretical atheistic framework that claims to explain the secrets of the universe without any real substance. In fact, the very first page of the book undercuts the very branch the rest of Hawking and Mlodinow's thoughts are resting on. After listing a number of ultimate questions such as, ""What is the nature of reality?"" etc., the authors write:Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead. Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.I see two problems with this statement. Firstly, science is not self-authenticating. Science relies on philosophy to justify its procedures. In other words, science cannot certify itself, it must appeal to something outside itself to be valid. There is no scientific experiment that can give credence to the preconditions of intelligibility (i.e. the uniformity of nature, reliability of sensory perception, reality of a moral law, etc.). On the contrary, an individual must first have a philosophical reason for believing these things to be true in order for science to even make sense. The second problem I see is a gross inconsistency. Hawking starts his book by bashing philosophy- ironically however- the rest of the book is pure philosophy. The arena of theoretical physics is not an exact science. Hawking himself admits he's dealing with theories, not proven facts. Making the case that there are multiple universes is not something proven at all, yet Hawking relies on this principle to explain God away from His creation.In the chapter The Apparent Miracle, the authors wax eloquent about ""M-Theory,"" a competing model of string theory which Hawking deems the ""theory of everything."" Basically, Hawking and Mlodinow believe that every action that can possibly take place, does takes place. There is a universe in which the Confederacy won the War Between the States. There is a universe in which Marin Luther never nailed the 95 theses to the castle church in Wittenburg. There is a unvierse in which life cannot be supported. This is used to explain away any sense of ""special design"" in our universe. If there are an infinite number of possible environments, we shouldn't be surprised that we happen to live in one which can support life and there exists an appearance of design. It should be noted however, this doesn't alleviate the problem at all, it merely ""moves it back one step."" There still must be a designer to produce the mechanism producing these imaginary universes. Also, M-Theory does not explain how something came from nothing. Hawking believes the big bang is the starting point, but if there was nothing before the bang, where did the matter come from?Far from explaining God away, M-Theory- if it ever could be demonstrated to be true- would require the supernatural just as much as a strict Newtonian world. The Grand Design belongs to the Grand designer ultimately, and if anything, Hawking demonstrates the fact that God was right when He said that men ""suppress the truth"" even when it's obvious."
244,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969312-shireen,3,"In The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking along with his co-writer Leonard Mlodinow go beyond A Briefer History of Time, which I reviewed recently, and enter the territory of philosophers. They claim that philosophy is the domain of physicists because philosophers have abdicated their role in society by not keeping up with scientific developments and knowledge. In this book, he and Leonard attempt to answer the question of if there is a God, if there is a Grand Design, and what it is.I got this book out of the library, but it had such a long hold period that when it became available to me, I was in the throes of wrapping up some work and didn't have the time I would have liked to read it. By the time I started it properly I had three days and a bit to finish. But it repeats some of the same ground as A Briefer History of Time, and it wasn't too long, making it easier to read. I finished it before Overdrive went boing, time's up.Only the pressure of time got me to read it and to finish it.It isn't that bad a book. It's just not as good as A Briefer History of Time. What Hawking forgets is that though philosophy may've abdicated the sciences -- and I think a few philosophers would disagree vehemently on that point -- science alone cannot answer these questions of being and grand design.I had not noticed particularly in A Briefer History of Time that Hawking seems to believe that human beings do not have free will until I read it again in The Grand Design.He writes: ""Though we feel that we can choose what we do, our understanding of the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets.""He goes on to talk of the well-known situation wherein a neurosurgeon electrically stimulates the brain of an awake patient and lo and behold they move a hand or their mouth. Thus, according to Hawking, speaking and moving hands are not by free will but by electrical impulses from the brain to the mouth or hand. Yes, well, we know about the impulses. But last time I checked there aren't neurosurgeons with electrical probes hanging over the heads of each of us, poking this neuron and that to get us to speak...or maybe there are, and we just don't know it...yet.The point is that outside of the operating room what stimulates those nerves to fire to get us to speak? Is it only external stimuli? Are internal stimuli only external ones in disguise? To go further, what gets one depressed person to hide and not seek help and another equally depressed person to hightail it to the doctor's office? Is it just a lack of external stimuli in the former situation? Is it the upbringing that makes seeking help a bad thing for the former patient and a good thing for the latter? But if so how do the laws of nature that govern matter and energy and our biological processes account for culture and attitudes? Do we say it's simply a matter of entraining the neurons to fire in a certain way, yet things like birth order, peer groups, health, talent, skills, and luck will create people with different attitudes and even different cultural expression in the same family. So then do we say, well, their external stimuli were different and thus entrained their neurons differently. But we are still left with the idea that the act of seeking help comes from within and not from the neurosurgeon poking his probe into the brain.Hawking believes that there is no God. Yet many of his arguments line up neatly with religious thinking. Free will is a prime example. I'm apparently told (probably for the umpteenth time, as I'm obstinate in my disbelief) that in my Christian tradition, our lives are preordained, that is, we have free will, but we don't. While Hawking says it's just our biological processes governed by laws of physics, religion says it's our humanity governed by laws of God. It is like two people arguing heatedly when they agree on the result and only disagree on the method.One of the ideas he is at pains to disprove, in order to prove that there is no God, is that people are at the centre of the universe, people are not special. I realise the Church had a problem with the idea that the Earth is not the centre of the universe, but it is very clear in the Creation story that human beings were not created to be the centre of the universe but to serve God's Creation. Since people were rather thick on this concept, Jesus hammered it home in his teachings. To serve is a rather different idea than to be the centre.Furthermore, I don't understand how multiverses make us less unique in the universe. I get that what he's saying is that we simply exist because of statistical probabilities. Still, the laws of physics or nature that gave rise to us are extremely fine tuned, so fine tuned that an error one way or the other and poof we boil away or freeze into oblivion. We are rare. Period.And the discoveries of time confirm what many who have followed one God have known for millennia -- God is outside of time, thus time cannot be strictly a linear construct. It is difficult for many of us to comprehend that in an experienced way, tis true. But the story of Abraham and Sarah clarifies how differently God views time than we do. The story Zarathustra told is partly about time and how human beings see time as linear and the present time as important, but God doesn't. Experiments on prayer have shown how past time has been changed in the present (my head is starting to hurt). Again physics is lining up with ancient teachings.Since he began the book with incomplete arguments I can poke holes in, I'm afraid I was not so impressed with his other arguments either.He makes sense when he talks about looking at the cosmos from the top down, but he forgets that just as our current state influences the way we understand the Big Bang, so too do our observations and interpretations colour our views on life, past, present, and future. Two people can look at the same event and see completely different things because of their backgrounds, personalities, talents, age, experiences, etc., etc. Their observations show different histories -- Feynman's sum over histories effect, if you will. Thus he has not seemed to take into account the effect of his own life, upbringing, and having ALS have had on his interpretations in the top-down view of the cosmos, multiverses, and so on.And at the end of the day, he has not explained the Big Bang satisfactorily to me, specifically, what came before. He writes that it was a spontaneous combustion in which time was space (thus why time did not exist before) and because of its spontaneity, there was nothing before. Yet he also states that empty space is not actually empty. So why would it be emptier or be a complete void (to use a Creation term) prior to the Big Bang? And as far as I know, spontaneous combustions don't happen in the complete absence of matter and energy. So what elements existed that created the explosion? What were the conditions in the seconds before the Big Bang? A spontaneous combustion out of nothing makes no logical sense to me.The brevity of the book is its downfall. These are deep arguments that have many entries to them -- science, arts, literal, metaphor, evidence, myth. They require more space-time in a book to delve into them properly.In the end, to me, Hawking is essentially saying that the laws of physics and nature correspond to the stories of Creation. That is not a very effective refutation of the existence of God in my humble opinion. At the end of the day, like so many writers, it comes down to this is my belief. And yours is wrong.(I am posting this review but won't be online to see and answer any comments for about a week or two, time in my present being a bit elastic.)"
245,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6463881-l,4,"This exciting cosmological read presents new answers to the ultimate questions on life. When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the true nature of reality? And, the most important question of all, is the apparent ‘grand design’ of our universe evidence for a benevolent creator who set things in motion? Does science offer us an alternative explanation, or can religion and philosophy stand in firm stead with their ideas and principles. This book delves into the very heart of our existence and bravely, boldly endeavours to answer some of the greatest questions with science.  Marked by brilliance and simplicity, this informative and highly illuminating read unlocks the mysteries of the universe. The grand design explains the latest thoughts about model-dependant realism (with many versions of reality explored). There is also a new top-down theory on cosmology, stating how multiple theories of possible histories of the universe can exist. Also, ideas by Einstein are explored, as well as a scientific ‘game’ that’s similar to the Turing machine in concept. After a decade one of the world’s greatest thinkers presents us with a new body of work, which as a fan (who has read ‘the universe in a nutshell’ amongst others), I was pleased to read. The beautiful diagrams of this illustrated guide are spectacular, of a book about new discoveries that are altering our understanding and challenging some of our most beloved belief systems. This book provokes conjecture, informs and juxtaposes the norm in its genre like no other. Unlocking the mystery of being, exploring the laws of science and nature, and a brief encounter with the theory of everything makes this book so highly readable, enlightening and interesting. From Viking mythology, to Aristotle, Sir Isaac Newton and advanced mathematics the scope and breadth of this book is vast. A bit of geography and theology is also included for good measure. “The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible” –Albert Einstein The grand design is a terrific read and one that I would definitely recommend to Hawking fans, and those who love to delve a little bit deeper into the beginning of life itself. I found the grand design to be a fascinating read that really opened up my eyes to science and its possibilities. "
246,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92258174-zachary-horn,3,"Brilliantly written, yet also unconvincing and deeply flawed. Hawking begins the book by announcing ""philosophy is dead"" and yet spends much of the book philosophizing about the origins of the universe and postulating about the ontological necessity of a first cause. The note on which Hawking ends--that M theory is quite possible, in fact likely, to be as close to a unified theory as science is likely to achieve is problematic, not least because M theory remains incredibly enigmatic and ill-defined and lacking in the elegance classic physics has always demanded of such a hypothetical theory. Hawking's presuppositional commitments (philosophy again, but I digress) also cause him to dismiss the concept of a divine designer or the ""unmoved mover"" but his arguments, here again, fall short of the mark, for three principal reasons.1) He critiques the concept of God from outside the system, meaning that he imposes his naturalistic assumptions on his consideration of divine design, and then finds it invalid. Thus he argues that since natural laws are, in his view, fixed and unbreakable realities, ""miracles"" (divine intervention) cannot occur. That is neither a scientific statement nor a philosophically valid form of argument. A valid critique must assume the arguments within a system, and then determine if the framework is self-consistent and in keeping with the nature of reality.2) His argument that the origin of the universe may not have required God does not, in itself, disprove the existence or creative acts of God.3) The argument that the universe does not require the existence of God is not provable. Hawking admits that science depends on projections based on sets of initial conditions. Lacking knowledge of the initial conditions, we can reverse engineer the process, starting from the universe we have, and working backward to determine what the initial conditions must have been to arrive at the universe we have. The only problem is that requires a whole set of assumptions about our universe that are impossible to correctly answer without knowing how it started. Thus, Hawking's argument for the initial conditions that make spontaneous self-creation possible are predicated on assumptions about current conditions he observes viewed through the lens of the initial conditions he anticipates (spontaneous self-creation). That, my friends, is the fallacy of begging the question.Interesting read--provoking and understandable. Just not believable."
247,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,4,"The PhysicsHawking and Mlodinow do a pretty good job of presenting an intuitive overview of particle physics and cosmology. They focus mainly on quantum physics (and in particular, Feynman's ""multiple histories"" formulation), but address relativity, touch on inflation, and give a bird's-eye overview of string theory, to name a few. It's pretty easy reading - there are plenty of insightful analogies, and over two dozen pictures, to boot. The coverage is a bit superficial - see either of Brian Greene's books for much deeper but equally intuitive and non-technical coverage of these topics.The PhilosophyThe interesting part of the book, however, lies not in it's scientific explication, but in its philosophical musings. The first and last couple of chapters are devoted to discussing some of the philosophical and theological implications modern physics. These discussions set this book apart from other offerings of ""physics for the masses.""Model Dependent RealismThe authors present 'model dependent realism' as a 'theory of reality'. The main idea of model dependent realism is that there are many ways you could model the same situation. In brief, if two models accurately predict the same events, we cannot say that one is more 'true' than the other. According to model dependent realism, such a question is meaningless.As an example of this philosophy in action, consider wave-particle duality. In certain circumstances, we need to postulate that light is made of particles (photons) to explain the phenomena we observe; in other circumstances, we need to think of of light as a wave. This begs the question: what is light really? Is it a wave, or is it a particle? According to model dependent realism, the answer is ""it depends what phenomenon you're trying to explain."" Model dependent realism doesn't try to ascribe to light a ""reality"" - in essence, this amounts to saying that there may - or may not! - be a ""true"" underlying reality. In any event, the best we can do is just use the best theory at our disposal.The above example isn't very interesting from a philosophical perspective - it's not clear why model dependent realism is any more interesting than just saying ""don't ask such questions, just apply the relevant equation!"" A more interesting application of this philosophy concerns M-theory (the current formulation of string theory). The authors' argue that M-theory might very well be physics' ""final theory"" (in contrast to, say, the 'non-final' theory of Newtonian gravity, which seemed to work pretty well until it turned out to be an approximation of the better theory of general relativity). In other words, it might be the case that there is no theory that's ""better"" than M-theory.M-TheoryWhat does this have to do with model dependent realism? Well, the ""problem"" with M-theory is that it makes different prediction on different scales (for instance, cosmic vs. atomic). Similarly to how ""wave particle duality"" says ""think of light as a wave here, but as a particle there"", M-theory says you should apply different equations in different situations. A nice analogy is to think about mapping our 3D planet onto a bunch of pieces of paper. Each piece of paper is very accurate for the region it maps out. But if you try to ""patch"" all the pieces together to get a single 2D map of the entire globe, the various patches don't overlap very nicely. In other words, although each piece of our final 2D map is very accurate, we don't exactly have a single consistent map. At the places the patches meet, there are some slight disagreements. Similarly, we can think of M-theory as a ""patchwork"" of theories that don't quite mesh at the edges.The point is that model dependent realism says, ""this is OK. This might just be the way it is."" In other words, there might not be such a think a single, elegant, final theory that applies everywhere. In some sense, this means there isn't a single underlying ""reality"": ""reality"" depends on where we're looking.Is our the only ""possible"" universe?Another interesting implication of M-theory is that it states there are approximately 10^500 possible universes. Just like in quantum physics, where a particle's location is given by a probability distribution until you observe it, the universe we're in can be thought of as one of 10^500 universes that could have been. Why is this interesting? For one, it explains why the standard model of particle physics is so ""inelegant"". The standard model has a dozen physical constants that seem pretty arbitrary. But according to M-Theory, the values of these constants are arbitrary, in that there are 10^500 possibly values these constants could have had. Just as there's no ""reason"" an electron is just over here when we observe it - other than that there was a non-zero probability it would be there - there's no ""reason"" our universe is just like this, now that we're observing it, other than that there was a non-zero probability it would be.Why did the universe ""begin""?One argument the author's make is that, under M-theory, there is no need to invoke a ""creator"" to instantiate the universe. If the laws of physics operate the way M-theory says they do, then the universe can spontaneously ""begin."" In other words, the answer to the question ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" doesn't have to be ""because God made something."" That only pushes the questions back, for you can then ask, ""who made God?"" Rather, the reason there is something rather than nothing is that the laws of physics are just so, and they predict the spontaneous creation of energy out of nothingness.But in my opinion, this also pushes the question back, exactly the same way the invocation of a creator did. For now we can ask, ""why are the laws of physics this way? Why are there laws of physics?"" I can't pretend to understand why M-theory allows for the spontaneous generation of a universe. But even if I allow that it does, I still don't see that it helps us escape an infinite regress.Escaping the infinite regressIn my opinion, the very notion of a God is an attempt to stop an infinite regress. The notion of a creator is an appeal to faith in a situation where reason enters into an infinite loop. Perhaps it is meaningless to ask ""who created this this deity,"" just as it is meaningless to ask ""what was there before time began."" For me, the invocation of a creator amounts to saying ""when it comes to the explaining existence, I'm bound to enter an infinite loop. Thus, I'll appeal to faith and say that there is something greater than me that that explains it, even if it's beyond rationality.""Of course, it is equally valid to say ""when it comes to the explaining existence, I'm bound to enter an infinite loop. Thus, thus just how it is. There an infinite loop I cannot explain, and it's beyond rationality."" When it comes to the origin of existence, at some point, we all have to admit ignorance. And at this point, it's as valid to invoke a creator as it is to deny one. Neither stance is defensible. In any event, I applaud Hawkings and Mlodinow for their efforts to leverage the laws of nature to defend their, even if they don't recognize the fact that the existence of these laws remains unaccounted for."
248,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49575307-rodney-harvill,3,"Many years ago, a roommate showed me a cartoon from a magazine (one I wouldn't read or be caught dead with) that he considered very funny. In it, the Grim Reaper was leaving a flower shop carrying a flower arrangement with the word ""Die!"" on it. The caption was, ""Say it with flowers."" The Grand Design is the second book by Hawking that I have read; A Brief History of Time was the first. In both books, Hawking wears his atheism on his sleeve, trying to use contemporary cosmological theory to eliminate the need for a creator by targeting the teleological and cosmological arguments for God's existence. However, unlike militant atheists like Richard Dawkins, he is much more gentlemanly about his assault on faith in God; he says it with flowers.I was disappointed to find this book to be more intellectually lightweight than A Brief History of Time. It had much of the same information, which was arranged and presented a little differently, and little new information, primarily the various finely tuned parameters of the universe which, if they were just slightly larger or smaller, would eliminate the potential for a life-supporting universe. Perhaps, I have read enough books on cosmology that they are beginning to look alike.I have read Christian apologetic books with a similar level of detail using these constants to argue for the Anthropic Principle, that such fine tuning and apparent design present a persuasive argument for a designer, God. Hawking hangs his hat on multiverse theory and an open boundary condition for the Big Bang. In other words, if enough universes, only one of them being observable by us, are formed by different Big Bangs, statistically there will be some universes that evolve physical laws allowing for conditions hospitable for the evolution of life. We just happen to live in one such universe on a planet ideally suited for life that just happened to come into existence by random processes. In the early days of Darwinism, one attitude was that given enough time, life as we know it could evolve. Hawking's argument is reminiscent of that. Given enough universes, at least one will allow for life as we know it to evolve. That, in a nutshell, is Hawking's rebuttal of the teleological and cosmological arguments. I will stick with God."
249,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23636351-finn,1,"I don't recommend spending money or time on this book. Obviously way more effort was put into the design, and trying to make this book ""pretty"" for marketing purposes, which sadly worked. Adding a whopping ~45 colour images, that often don't add anything of value to the reader, as many are comic or meme-like. Those that are supposed to be of aid in understanding certain phenomena - like the results of the double-split experiment or wave interference in water - are poorly chosen and lack the clarity needed for such images. As for the actual content, to summarize: If you already know about modern physics this book provides nothing new - if you don't, I can imagine there are a lot more useful resources out there.It starts off by proposing that ""philosophy is dead"" when, at least to me, the entire book is a philosophical chinwag about model-dependant realism and how often humans created gods (which for some reason needs to be repeated like nearly every chapter). Further the author(s?) (I don't think Stephen Hawking was actually involved in much of the writing and his name was just slapped on for marketing) starts by stating that they will answer the following 3 questions: Why is there something rather than nothing?Why do we exist?Why is this particular set of laws and not some other?To which the answer to all of those is (spoiler alert) not as nearly as grand or mind-blowing as the it's made out to be; It is random. I don't have a problem with this statement, in fact I believed that before even starting this book. My problem lies within the fact that they gushed over M-theory, the Big Bang Theory and how clear everything will be once we reach the final chapter, only to not actually present anything. Not about what actually needs to be done in concrete terms to prove M-theory or advance it. It basically tried to cover everyhing, while simultaneously covering nothing at all. Oh, and those weird ""jokes"" or whatever they were, I haven't read humor so dull in a while it actually made me cringe. Sounded like some old guy trying to be hip & cool. All it did was throw me off. Anyway, maybe I gravely misunderstood everything, or maybe the author didn't do a great job at writing, maybe a bit of both. Regardless, I did not really enjoy it."
250,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32269173-peter-hoff,4,"Yeah, right! I'm going to review a book the content of which is beyond my understanding. Will say this. It is incredibly readable for such a book. And I plan to read it again, hopefully soon. And after that, maybe another time. Hawking and Mlowdinow trace the development of scientific thought from what we would call ancient superstitions to 21st century understanding about the nature of the cosmos. As they do, they get into concepts that are definitely current among scientists, but nevertheless mind-boggling. Such as the idea that the universe is somehow the sum of all the trillions and trillions of possible universes, and anything that has happened has happened in all possible ways. . . at the micro or quantum level, at least, since they tend to exclude larger objects (humans and hippopotami, for example). . . except they don't. I soon reached a point where I just had to accept that what they say is what they say, and they say it because science and reason leads them inexorably to their conclusions.OK. So I will read if it makes more sense the next time. If I may be permitted an opinion (No, I may not, since I don't know what I am talking about!) I believe contemporary science has shown itself to be in another transitional point between astonishing breakthroughs. There was a time when scientists, in order to rationalize something like an orbit, had to add crenalations to their theories in order to hang on to them--for example, by inventing epicycles to explain why the orbits didn't track the math. Eventually a better explanation (Newton's for example) eliminated the need for epicycles. I believe today's scientists are doing something similar--adding baroque curliques to things like subatomic particles. Sooner or later a simpler and more elegant theory will wipe away the need for such additions. For the time being, Hawkins and Mlowindow fall back on theb reasonable defense that (curliques and all) their theories meet the test of experimentation. OK, then."
251,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,2,"A joint review of:Cycles of TimeRoger PenroseThe Grand DesignStephen Hawking and Leonard MlodinowOnce upon a time, Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking collaborated on a seminal piece of work which proved that if the general theory of relativity is correct our Universe began from a state of infinite density – a singularity. The investigation of the implications of that work, now more than 40 years old, still reverberate, providing the basis for intense debate among cosmologists. Since the 1960s, Penrose and Hawking have each written best-selling books introducing the lay reader to arcane areas of science. Now, they have independently produced books which address some of the implications of their early discovery about the origins of the Universe. But it would be hard to imagine two more different approaches to the subject, both in terms of content and of style. Penrose addresses the question, “what came before the Big Bang?” But it is important to appreciate that the Big Bang was not the singularity. There is a well-established consensus that the Universe as we know it emerged from as superhot, superdense state – the evidence for this comes in particular from studies of the famous cosmic microwave background radiation. But “superdense” does not mean “infinitely dense,” and there is room to suggest, or even expect, that under the extreme conditions “before the Big Bang” the laws of physics are not quite as described by Einstein so there may not have been a singularity. The way Penrose tackles the problem is by combining what we know about the second law of thermodynamics and the arrow of time with what we know about the Big Bang and the general theory. If that thought makes your head hurt, his book is not for you. It contains many equations and pulls few punches, an archetypal example of what an Oxford don thinks is a simple exposition of his subject. But if you do not have a maths phobia, and you can live with language like “at this point, it is appropriate to mention . . . ”, Cycles of Time can be highly recommended as an example of how cosmologists are now thinking the unthinkable in trying to look back beyond the Big Bang and forward beyond the death of our Universe. A superficial summary of Penrose’s thesis is that as the expanding Universe thins out and all the stars die the conditions that result are just right to produce a new Big Bang, so that universes like ours follow one another in an endless chain, or perhaps in an eternal loop, reminiscent of the image of the worm Ourobouros swallowing its own tail. As a speculation, this is a very old idea; the difference is that Penrose has the mathematical and physical foundations to make what he calls “conformal cyclic cosmology” respectable. It is also an idea whose time has come. I know of at least one other recent scientific suggestion, based on the idea of inflation, which also leads to the rebirth of the Universe from what in thermodynamic terms is sometimes called the “heat death”. Penrose has universes following each other. Stephen Hawking, writing with the American physicist Leonard Mlodinow (who suffers the indignity of having his name in much smaller type on the cover, but is no doubt crying all the way to the bank), has universes lying side by side. This idea of the “multiverse” is also familiar from science fiction and other speculations, but like the cyclic universe idea it is now firmly based on scientific fact. The trouble is, you would be hard pressed to be sure of this after reading The Grand Design.  Hawking and Mlodinow favour cartoons rather than equations, and anecdote rather than exposition. If you knew nothing at all about science, the resulting book would make for a light read on a short journey, but the story has been told many times, by many people (Paul Davies and Martin Rees spring to mind), and it’s hard to imagine that it can have take more than a month to write, whereas it’s easy to believe that Cycles of Time took years. This is born out by the failure of either of the authors, both of whom know better, to pick up the error which refers to black holes as one of the “new effects” predicted by the general theory of relativity, when they are also predicted by Newton’s theory of gravity. All this is particularly disappointing because I have a great fondness for the multiverse idea, which I believe to be the best explanation of why the Universe we see around us is the way it is. As Hawking and Mlodinow put it, in this view “the universe appeared spontaneously, starting off in every possible way. [Universes] aren’t just different in details, such as whether Elvis really did die young or whether turnips are a dessert food, but rather they differ even in their apparent laws of nature. In fact, many universes exist with many different sets of physical laws.” Where do those other universes exist? Penrose’s universes follow one another, in a sense separated by time. But the universes of Hawking and Mlodinow exist side by side in different dimensions, separated by space. This array of universes is what is known as the Multiverse. Part of the attraction of this idea is that it explains the many apparent coincidences that allow the existence of life forms like ourselves in the Universe we inhabit. To take just one example, more than half a century ago the physicist Fred Hoyle pointed out that the ability of stars to manufacture elements such as carbon and oxygen, which are essential for life as we know it, depends on a particular property of the nucleus of the carbon atom. If this and other parameters were not “just right” (and there is no a priori reason why they should have the properties they have) life as we know it would not exist. At one extreme, the existence of these cosmic coincidences suggests to some people that the Universe was designed for our benefit. But the multiverse idea says that there is a multitude of universes in which all possible combinations of the laws of physics are played out and that life forms like us will only be found in the ones where conditions are suitable, just as it is no surprise that polar bears live in the Arctic. Martin Rees, the outgoing President of the Royal Society, has used the analogy of the difference between a bespoke suit, made to measure for a particular customer, and an off-the-peg suit, chosen from as vast variety in a chain store, where one of them is bound to fit whoever walks in the door. In each case, it is no surprise that the suit fits. And this brings us back to Penrose’s conformal cyclic cosmology, since on that picture each universe in the chain, or cycle, may have a different set of physical laws. Whichever way you look at it, the multiverse explains our existence without the need to invoke a designer.This review first appeared in the Literary Review."

Almost all the material is simple to understand, but it will still make you think and reflect. The part about Quantum Physics is naturally very hard, but not because particle Physics is weird and counterintuitive, but because the core mathematical properties are introduced en passant, being impossible to explain it for the target audience (I don't know the mathematics myself, that's the impression I had about it). The problem with this approach is that it makes it very hard to understand the consequences of the theories clearly, and, by the end of the book, it became very obvious that such understanding is essential for the final conclusion.The main issue with this book is that it starts with a very bold statement that ""Philosophy is dead"" and Science can answer the deepest questions we have about life, the universe and everything. And then it becomes clear that the very same book is actually a Philosophy treatise. It makes a very good job of explaining the Science (at least such complicated Science) in lay terms, and then, when it comes to the conclusion (spoiler alert!), it briefly claims that the Universe came into existence *out of nothing* as a consequence of the scientific laws, specifically the fact that gravity contributes with negative energy and, thus it's possible fot the total energy of the universe to be zero and still there be variance. That's it. No elaboration, no clarification, no more details.Of course I'll read this again and again, to make sure I'm not missing anything, but right now I'm very disappointed."

Now, I don't really think this book is *his* voice/thoughts 100%... but of course he'd agree with everything in it, unless he wanted a quick buck or something. The thing that irritates me the most with books like that is that everything could be proven with science and yet, there's so so so so SO many theoretical shit and would've beens and could've beens and all that imaginative shit that make me doubt many of that. Assuming shit is not proof. What I WOULD love to see is for a book like that, that would have added inside a creationist to answer and debate all that stuff. And yet, I do agree with most of the stuff they say, in this one and on many other books and essays or whatever.I totally agree how most of things work, but I can't agree on every little bit of detail that how the universe was created because you, me, or Stephen Hawking wasn't motherfucking THERE. I cannot accept an idea as a fact and I won't. You weren't there. Me neither. I also don't agree with the part that humans have no free will. And you can't say that without being specific, if you specifically tell me in which themes if you will, humans have no free will I may have to agree with you but to generalise it like that and being strict about it, that's a big no no.Other than that is a great read covering nice topics but a bit too ""this is fact, but theoretically."""

Hawking and Mlodinow can claim that philosophy is dead and can no longer contribute to humanity's understanding of the universe, then commit a fallacy of misplaced concreteness and run with it for nearly 200 pages. I think a modification IS in order for Messrs. Hawking and Mlodinow: Philosophy isn't dead, you're just working with bad metaphysics. The system of theories (the authors refer to it as M-Theory) that collectively may be used to describe reality are a reasonable attempt at unifying the disparate findings in macro and micro cosmology. The authors have made the mistake of confusing the map for the territory, with their grand claim that - here I paraphrase - there is no model-independent understanding of reality. (The authors also make some dubious claims, such as their state belief in the illusory nature of Time) And yet, and yet, and yet, our eyes can see and our hands can touch. We can sense the primacy of Time and its continual unfolding. And we intuitively sense that we can directly prehend what is real. This book, no doubt, is a vast simplification of difficult mathematics and ideas that I will never be able to comprehend fully. And I am under no illusions that Messrs. Hawking and Mlodinow possess an IQ far higher than my own. And yet this book is living proof that clever people can make dangerous errors, errors made all the more dangerous because their intelligence convinces them they can do no wrong. One fears that a generation of young impressionable thinkers will walk from the book accepting there is only one model for investigating reality. In a way, this is a cultural hegemony. Some epistemic humility is in order. One hopes that their next joint venture will correct some of the assumptions they have made here. "

This book talks about many topics, It talks about the creation of our universe and theories about it, it talks about the natural Laws of physics, quantum mechanics, and more. This book is also very into some mathematical concepts and theories about other universes(Multiverse).This book starts off by informing you about what you would learn while reading this book. The beginning teaches the reader of some minor terms that would be used in the book, that help the reader make sense of the book. Then the book talks about quantum physics, Mythology leading back to the creation of our universe and how it differs from what really happened. Next, the book goes on to talk about phenomena, big and small, and famous scientists such as; Galileo, Issac Newton, and Einstein. Although throughout the entire book, no matter what the subject, the Universe is always being mentioned and referenced. Finally, the book ends talking about the idea of extraterrestrial life on other planets, in other solar systems, galaxies, and or maybe even universes.I would make a strong recommendation of this book to anyone who enjoys learning facts and hidden truths about our universe/ space, and/or physics. I think that this book is targeted for people that are looking to learn while reading a book, and people that already have some background knowledge when it comes to space and physics. Personally, I liked the way that the book was structured and the way it displayed its information. I also liked learning about the information in this book. One of the only things I disliked was some of the terms in the book were not explained/defined well enough."

Stephen Hawking died a few days later. If we trust the authors with their mathematics, as there are no equations in the book, and if we furthermore trust their technical and summarization skills because this type of cutting edge theory goes beyond the basics of introductory physics/mathematics education, then this is certainly a clearly written book. It covers gravity/relativity, electromagnetic/electroweak/strong forces of the standard model, the Feynman path integral approach to quantum mechanics, and the character of physical law, then drops the bombshell about there being multiple universes of eleven spacetime dimensions with various physical laws, which is called M-theory. All this in about 180 pages!Here is my favorite passage, about realism and the laws of nature, from page 47:""Another problem that model-dependent realism solves, or at least avoids, is the meaning of existence. How do I know that a table still exists if I go out of the room and can't see it? What does it mean to say that things we can't see, such as electrons or quarks--the particles that are said to make up the proton and neutron--exist? One could have a model in which the table disappears when I leave the room and reappears in the same position when I come back, but that would be awkward, and what if something happened when I was out, like the ceiling falling in? How, under the table-disappears-when-I-leave-the-room model, could I account for the fact that the next time I enter, the table reappears broken, under the debris of the ceiling? The model in which the table stays put is much simpler and agrees with observation. That is all one can ask."""
258,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30038458-nikolaos,4,"This is an excellent work by Prof. Hawking aiming to update the general public on the advancements of Physics. The book narrates the evolution of Physics and Cosmology over the last few hundred years, focusing on the transition from a theological perception of Creation to a paradigm that does not necessarily need a conscious higher power for life to exist. Without providing definitive answers to the questions torturing the casual existentialist, the author explains how our comprehension of reality is inherently anchored on our own, refined-by-evolution ""model"", i.e., our internal mental process to interpret the all stimuli and combine them so as to form our version of reality. The counter-intuitive lessons of quantum physics suggest that our world, the one we experience through our senses, does not follow the well-known Newtonian rules at the atomic and subatomic level. There may even be an infinite number of alternative universes with a materially different set of ""laws of nature"" in effect. The scientific community aspires to create a unifying theory, an umbrella theory that will reconcile the four fundamental forces (electromagnetic, gravitational, weak/strong nuclear). The latest attempt, called M-theory, allows for a total of 10 dimensions (1 for time and 10 for space), although the specifics remain an unsolved riddle for most of them (as of the time of the book).I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys thinking about cosmology from a scientific standpoint. The book does not go into details or formulas and, for the non-specialist like myself, may need repetition and additional reading."

How or why? They don´t know, so they leave it in the hands of God.And that´s OK, I mean it´s OK not to know. We´re not omniscient, we still have a cosmos of stuff to discover and learn. That´s good, this gives us a purpose, a goal; the need to learn and the immense body of things that exist to satisfy that need with keep us in our toes. It´s OK not to know, what it is not OK is to pretend or act as if we do and judge others as poor fools lost in space.Scientist and religious people should be more honest with themselves and others and stop pretending to be the cream in the cheese. Science and religion are two approaches to get to the same thing, the ultimate meaning of our existence, the purpose of life and the direction of our voyage. It would be a lot better to anyone if science and religion find a way to travel hand on hand, supporting and learning from each other. I believe it can be done. Do you remember the spontaneous generation of life theory? It said that a filthy rag left all crumbled in a dark corner will produce spontaneously flies and a rat.

Hawking makes some intuitive leaps of faith that I don't feel are warranted. He builds a portion of his argument off of the multiverse theory which is entirely hypothetical. I see no point in positing other universes except as a science fiction thought experiment. Ultimately this leap of faith just makes our position seem more random and irrelevant in terms of the cosmic picture, much more so than can be reasonably assumed by an atheist. He goes further though, in saying that we create our history by our observation rather than history (i.e. the past) creating us. Not only is this fundamentally absurd, but if true it would invalidate his entire argument because we would have no reason to trust one result over any other because we would be creating the result by seeking to observe it. Can observation influence results? Yes. But it does not create them.Hawking also makes unnecessary off-putting remarks about philosophy and religion, saying that philosophy is dead (without offering any evidence for this stance) and portraying all conceptions of God as essentially the same so that he can easily write them off as primitive superstitions. There are plenty of authors out there who are diving into riveting discussions about the overlap between quantum physics, philosophy, religion, and other fields as well.

The writing itself was a feat; Having to capture the completely un-intuitive nature of quantum mechanics through mere writing will forever be a complex task, but the way it is explained in this book truly guides the reader through this extraordinarily complex field of science. As someone who enjoys science, I had a small amount of knowledge on the subject of Quantum Mechanics before reading this book. After reading this, however, a reader comes away with such an intimate view of the universe that is happening and composing them, that it is a surprise this book isn't a required title of every science class. Even in as deep a reading as this, the authors still throw in comedically simple lines to end certain topics of Quantum Mechanics; An almost metaphoric way of referencing the eccentricity of the universe and how it is made. Throughout the book, there are many concepts that are baffling, but Stephen Hawking explains them, provides evidence for them, and helps the reader even with basic definitions of scientific terms: Natural Laws, M-Theory, etc. Throughout this book, the reader comes away with an expansive amount of knowledge and concepts that show how the universe is almost magical in its very existence. Most importantly of all, however, is the fact that even through these immense concepts, ones which scientists have worked centuries on formulating, the reader is able to understand the accessible descriptions provided by this book.

Quantum physics tells us that no matter how thorough our observation of the present, the (unobserved past), like the failure is indefinite and exists only a spectrum of possibilities.For me, this book is not for everyone even thought i had some background information about few of the concepts in this book, i still found it very hard to comprehend the explanation of some theories or principles and at one point i had to google everything in order to understand, this process was tiring and somewhat left me feeling that this book is boring and not informative in the way i expected it to be. I honestly expected it to be like a Dan Brown  book where he inserts so much information but it doesn't feel dumped or difficult to understand.Also, it felt at certain point that the authors were trying to enforce their idea that there was no God based on their scientific researches, i understand and respect their point of view but it felt like they were insulting everyone who wants to believe that the universe was not created on its own. The laws of nature tells us how the universe behaves, but they don't answer the why ? questions that we posed at the start of this book :Why is there something rather than nothing ?why do we exist ?why is this particular set of laws and not some other ?On a lighter note, i really enjoyed the process of how the two authors answered the questions they posed about the creation of the universe and its matters."
263,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360651-joseph-d-walch,3,"The title of this book hooked me because I was slightly incredulous that a scientist would invoke the dreaded D word, but after reading it I realized it was simply Hawking being cheeky. The book starts off with a “Story” of the philosophical progression from theology to metaphysics to ‘pure’ science. This Story presents us with a world dominated by animism and the capriciousness of the gods where people would bang pots and pans whenever an eclipse presented itself to scare away the wolf that was swallowing the sun. From here he explained how people through positivistic empirical observation were able to discover that an eclipse was the result of the moon interposing itself between the earth and the sun. From here, Hawking springboards into the science of quantum mechanics with the quote: “Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.” This is all quite accurate, scientifically speaking, however it is interesting that Hawking never explicitly rejects the existence of the Abrahamic God but like Auguste Comte he simply concludes that God does not figure into the equation. This is quite astute, of course, for somebody who in the past has rejected the notion of a personal God, but it sets up a sort of straw-man premise that is easy to knock over with the slightest effort. There were animist 2,000 years B.C. just as there remain in parts of Africa, Australia, South America, and Indonesia, but the more sophisticated understanding of the monotheistic Abrahamic tradition is thrown out like the baby in the bathwater. Of course, Atheist like Richard Dawkins would cheer this final death knell of theistic metaphysics, but since people like that have been doing that for centuries I think the rumors of God’s death are being slightly overhyped.But, back to The Grand Design; Hawking seems to be attacking what some agnostics, positivist, or atheist call (sometimes derisively) the “god-of-the-gaps” that is sometimes used by religious people to plug gaps in scientific knowledge. He does this by explaining the unified theory of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, or “M-Theory”. From this lofty perch, Hawking states in godlike fashion that one can explain life, the Universe and Everything! Hawking goes on to explain that based on current mathematical models of the universe, we can explain ex-nihilo spontaneous creation. From M-Theory we learn that there is an infinite number of universes and an infinite possibilities, and thus the anthropic principle is made null based on the mathematical certainty of M-Theory. The problem with Hawking’s assertions, however, is that there is no way to prove M-Theory and thus, Hawking the physicist becomes Hawking the metaphysician. These meta-laws presented in M-Theory may well be mathematically sound, but science has a way of opening up an ever expanding understanding of our knowledge gaps. It seems a little pretentious to clap the chalk off one’s hands and proclaim “It is finished!” regarding humankind’s knowledge of the origin and destiny of our universe. It is almost a declaration that one has ‘come to know the mind of god for he is me.’Furthermore, Hawkings metaphysical rejection of anthropic cosmology because of the infinite possibilities of multiverse formations—some which inevitably have life—still doesn’t account for the fact that our universe does have life and intelligence and rational beings capable of discerning their place in the Universe. It’s simply just an extension of the gambler’s fallacy that sooner or later, that monkey will type out Shakespeare’s Hamlet given just enough time. Given the nearly infinitesimal probability of life in the Cosmos, and the fact that we indeed exist, isn’t an appeal to some kind of god-of-the-gap argument, but rather a recognition of the probability that we could exist by design instead of by chance (not to mention the non-materialistic properties of information or intelligence in biology—e.g., DNA information accumulation and human reason). Furthermore, if we were pure ex-nihilo spontaneous ‘beings’ then our reason would be the result of non-rational materialistic forces which have an equally probable outcome such that the products of our ‘reason’ would be no more reliable an interpreter of empirical evidence than the quantum mechanics that govern the wet chemical properties of our neurons (e.g., electrons moving back and forth across membranes, electrical conduction, stochastic release of neurotransmitters, graded excitatory and inhibitory voltage potentials at synaptic junctions, etc.). Like Schrodinger’s cat, M-theory as a product of our Quantum Mechanical mind is equally probable to be true and false, alive or dead until such time as we draw back the veil on the multiverse and are able to directly observe the truth about life, the universe and everything. So, despite Hawking’s metaphysical prescriptions we are left where we started with, at best, enough evidence to not rule the Abrahamic God out of our physical and metaphysical calculations. It is surprising to me that despite the amazing advances in human knowledge and scientific techne, the brilliant words of King David written almost 3,000 years ago remain unvanquished by the learning of men and as bright as ever:1 THE heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.  2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.  3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.  4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,  5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.  6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.  7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the dtestimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.  8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.  9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.  10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

This was clearly written for a more general audience and does not require much regarding higher knowledge of math/science/physics. So if you're just a regular person who usually finds the depths behind physics confusing (or you just don't want to think too hard about it), Hawking and Mlodinow do an excellent job painting the broad strokes of the bigger picture that I guarantee you will understand. There are A LOT of topics they don't touch, but they do give you the general idea of the fundamentals.That said, I like when Hawking gets very technical and detailed, and this book doesn't have a lot of that. It is very much a ""here's the general idea of our theories using a neat metaphor to reality you'll understand,"" and lacks the sort of ""here's all the nitty-gritty details of exactly how we believe these things to function. Confused? Good."" that were in A Brief History of Time. They do dig much deeper into the philosophy of science, as well as the history of thinking that evolved into science as we know it, however, which I find almost as interesting as the science itself.Still a fantastic book. I highly recommend it for a more casual consumer and/or someone who's just getting started in this realm. If you already have the groundwork set and are looking to dig a bit deeper, this book probably isn't going to help you out much. It is a great stepping stone, though."
265,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18101897-omarove,3,"This book was in the shelf for a long time until I picked it up last month. I’ve recently finished a graduate course in advanced thermodynamics where I was exposed to some basics and applications of quantum mechanics, which gave me a deeper understanding and I was following to a good extent what’s being discussed. The Grand Design is a great book and Hawking laid out the evolution of some scientific conceptions in a very simple yet comprehensive way. The controversy arises when it comes to discuss the existence of God when the rigorous scientific thinking leads to a gap or yet, unexplained phenomenon. Hawking starts refuting different concepts of super powers “Gods” in old civilizations and touches upon Christianity. He would then argue that no need to assume a creator by adding some assumptions to the theory/model. He never discussed God in the Islamic perspective, where he’ll find many signs in the Quran describing cosmological phenomena, more than 1400 years ago. I would’ve liked if he touched into that and see how he’d reject it. This is the only part where I found the book sketchy about.The author broke himself into a logic that seemingly refutes his belief of nonexistent God with one sentence in the acknowledgments: “Unlike the universe, this book needs a creator”. The whole universe with the never-ending complexity and how precise the conditions ought to be for the existence of the earth is thrown under the serendipity umbrella, and the book, some pieces of paper and words inscribed within, would need a creator! "
266,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88861837-vidit-sharma,3,"The Grand Design book written by well known famous cosmologist Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow. The book tries to answer some of the interesting questions that bugs almost every curious mind at least once in their life. Why do we exist? Why this particular set of laws and not some other? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is reality? How did the universe begin? Is it created by a creator?The writer succeeds in making the readers curious and keep them engage in the book. Scientific concepts are explained in simple and interesting manner. Even someone who is not a science person can understand this book. There is also a bit of humor element in the book. There is a lot of interesting stuff mentioned in the book which may make you start seeing the world with completely different lenses.The book has a lot of informative info too, the writers has described a lot of stories about some age old superstitious myths, about the history of western scientific thought(Ionian Enlightenment) , some interesting scientific theories (quantum physics, M theory, big bang) which will boggle your mind and the beliefs, personality and works of some earlier and notable scientists. As a guy who is interested in knowing about history and works of unsung forgotten scientists I loved this book. But the book ends with a weak conclusion I believe. The book also covers just basics of scientific theories and don’t go in details. So if you are a science person and already upto date with well known scientific theories then you won’t find anything new in this book and if you are not interested in history then this book may look boring to you.But it’s a very interesting and informative book and may create an interest towards science in those people’s mind who are not very much interested in science."
267,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46550827-danielle,4,"I took Physics up to Year 13, and because I studied the Astronomy chapter, I could readily comprehend most of the content of this book. The parts on general relativity and string theory, however, are areas which I have not learnt before - these knowledge gaps is the reason I took longer than expected to understand and to finish the book. As a person who has prior knowledge in physics, I could see Hawking and Mlodinow’s attempt to explain the scientific laws and phenomena using layman’s terms. Nonetheless, without referencing to formulae, reading the texts alone is perhaps insufficient for a person who knows zero background and contextual knowledge to decipher the concepts attempted to be conveyed by the authors. The extent of theology involved in this science book is contextual but might have worked against the authors’ favour this time. This book is concise and beautifully written, yet it is also a condensed version of centuries of thoughts, experiments, and findings. For those who have some level of physics knowledge and are genuinely interested in the laws of nature, this book would be useful in consolidating your understandings of many areas of physics. It is not one to be read lightly. A common theme between this book and The Millennium Problem by Keith Devlin is the seeking of a Single Unified Theory, or a Grand Unified Theory, or in the case if this book, the M-theory. It is already a wonder that electricity, magnetism, and light are all linked, yet there is no reason why we shall be complacent in our pursuit to come up with a fundamental theory of everything."
268,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18785335-laszlo-hopp,5,"This is a review by a layman grappling with the not so self-evident laws of the incredibly small and large physical reality.I read and very much enjoyed Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell although have not come across any of L. Mlodinow’s several popular books on physics and quantum physics.This book is very different from the previous two Hawking books and several other readings on cosmology, all of which attempt to familiarize the lay audience with the intricate principles of modern physics, i.e. the theory of general relativity (GR), quantum mechanics (QM), various flavors of string theory complete with M-theory, and multiverses. Here, most of this knowledge is taken for granted at least on an elementary level. The authors focus instead on the philosophical aspects of the immense new knowledge that has been gained since Maxwell’s formalization of electro-magnetism and Einstein’s concept of space-time fabric. Ancient philosophers, legends of various religious worldviews, and respectful dispute with creationist beliefs make their appearances throughout the engaging narration. On the way to the “theory of everything,” that in the writers’ opinion seems to be the hard-to-swallow concept of M-theory with its 10 spatial dimensions, we meet a few modern principles of acquiring knowledge. One of them is the “top down approach” which makes conclusions about the past based on the present using probability calculations instead of describing universal history as a linear event with a fixed beginning and predetermined outcome. Another is the “anthropic principle” which uses the very existence of humans as an argument in the interpretation of the Universe.The story we are presented with is an unapologetic utilization of the still poorly understood and even less readily imaginable principles of quantum mechanics. According to this worldview, our very existence is due to nothing else but quantum fluctuation in the primordial Universe, when its size was in the range of the Planck length (length of 10 to the negative 35 meters). In the randomness of temperature variations of multiple (10 to the 500!?) imaginable early universes one had just the right conditions, i.e. temperature differences, to be able to form clumps of material, the birthplace of present day galaxies, following the inflation. In fact the small but well documented temperature variation in the cosmic microwave background radiation is thought to be the thumbprint of this primordial quantum fluctuation.It seems to me that by the time galaxies formed, the laws of GR that apparently govern today’s cosmos on a grand scale, overshadowed the principles of QM that dominated the “baby” Universe. Although this “changing of the guards” of the physical laws from QM to GR clearly had to be a continuum, until today even the smartest minds among us have not been able to find a theory that can describe a smooth transition between the two. QM and GR simply do not seem to coexist very well together: using QM laws, the GR equations invariably result in infinite results, the mathematical equivalence of “garbage.” The book however ends on a positive note: M-theory.Although M-theory itself, like all other major concepts of physics in this fairly short book, is only briefly presented, the authors leave little doubt about their current conviction that the theory is a major candidate for Einstein’s unfulfilled dream, the unified theory. To illustrate what the real meaning of a “unified theory” may be, the authors discuss the Game of Life in full seven pages. The essence of the game is to build various structures based on three simple basic laws. These structures – one may look at them as multiverses – will evolve very differently despite the uniformity of the three rules depending on the initial conditions, i.e. how one places the two building blocks (life or death) on the checkered board at the beginning of the game. In the process, various formations are produced that seem to follow certain rules (think of the laws of thermodynamics, Newton’s three laws of motion, etc.) while the underlying three basic rules never change.Of course, M-theory is not without controversies due to the mathematical complexities required to model it and the extremely small size of strings that are thought to be the theory’s building blocks. In fact, the energy necessary to dissect matter to the infinitesimal size of strings and thus make them observable seems to be unattainable. Viewed in this way, the difference between a supernatural creator (God) and M-theory seems to be almost negligible at first glimpse. Although the authors don’t explicitly get tangled in the emotional battle between spirituality and materialism, they provide sufficient circumstantial evidence in the form of reproducible observational data to make a strong intellectual argument that God is not necessary to answer mankind’s ever recurring questions: ‘Why do we exist? Why is there something rather than nothing?’ and the one question for which you have to be a physicist to ask: “Why this particular set of laws and not some other?”The book is a well-narrated, mostly enjoyable read even for a lay person like myself – someone not involved in the field of physics in any way. I think however that without a basic understanding of GR and QM much of the book’s main premises will fly over a potential reader’s head. The two books by Hawking mentioned at the beginning of this review will certainly be sufficient to appreciate the magical world revealed in The Grand Design: the world of theoretical physics and cosmology hidden from most of us who grew up on Euclidean geometry and Newtonian physics. There were only very few places where I felt a touch of too much technicality – e.g. “renormalization” –, or not sufficient clarity – e.g. brief references to “super symmetry”, or the Feynman diagrams. Many of the pictures were intuitive and helpful, although I wish a few of them had more detailed captions – e.g. the figure of Quarks or the Triple Alpha Process. The cartoons were sufficiently witty to contribute to the overall entertaining mood of the book.I would recommend the book to all those interested in cosmology and particle physics, but most of all to those tickled by a natural scientific approach to life’s great philosophical questions and the unquenchable thirst of humans to acquire knowledge."
269,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71023848-ana,2,"As a layman with a stubborn interest in astrophysics, I was looking forward to reading this book and learning something new. I'm sad to say that it turned out to be a 180-page tribulation which took longer than it should have due to my googling things I didn't understand until I stopped caring and just wanted to finish it.After claiming that philosophy is dead (?), the authors deliver an incomprehensible philosophical (??) oration interspersed with bland jokes that make the whole ordeal even worse. When it comes to science itself, the buckyball experiment, for example, was explained *so well* that I didn't understand what it was until searching for it on Wikipedia and realizing that I actually know it from high school. I also had a problem with new notions and ideas being introduced literally to the very last page (Conway's Game of Life), instead of using the final few pages to draw a conclusion.I also feel that the choice of experiments and concepts used to illustrate the ""grand design"" was very random and made the whole thing sound incredibly incoherent. M-theory, string theory and QED are just some of the things mentioned in the book and I can honestly say I am none the wiser.Finally, I would have given the book 3 stars (because I still appreciate and respect the effort to spark an interest in physics among people) however, the 15 renditions of the Fibonnaci spiral that appear in the book annoyed me into giving it only 2 stars."

The book introduces to a variety of concepts in modern physics while also taking the readers to a journey through the history of scientific development.The language used is easy to understand. Beautiful coloured illustrations make the reading enjoyable. The book provides a deep insight to the functioning of the universe and the nature of physical laws. The explanations of concepts like the quantum theory, relativity, big bang and many others were highly informative and helpful. Authors deserve an applause for that. There are many negatives to the book too. If you are new to and have had no background in physics, put it down right now. This is not a book for beginners. If this book was meant for laymen (absence of equations might suggest so), undoubtedly it is a failure. I have studied physics up to intermediate level and I faced difficulties grasping the concepts more frequently than I expected. I had to call my friends who have studies physics at higher levels to help me out very often, sometimes on every other page. Most of the concepts they were able to help me out with, but there were concepts even they were unaware of and helpless with. If you are new to the world of physics-centred popular-science, this is not the book for you."

Definitely not vivid if the reader cannot recollect all the classical and quantum physics learnt during college days. Requires at the minimum some introduction to quantum physics to enjoy this book :)I personally was not in touch with particle physics for more than a decade so felt little harder to comprehend the concept of multiverse theory. But recollecting the concepts of particle wave duality and double slit experiment kind of helped a bit in understanding the concept though not fully. I am introduced to new models like string theory and M theory which of course are highly esoteric and escaped my limited intuition. What I like more about reading this kind of books is that it reminds me again how insignificant as a physical entity we are in this cosmos but highly imaginative to probe the annals of universe and its creation.After finishing this book, I am still left with the question, what is the first first...'the' first most event. Till I get an answer for it, I am forced to believe in some supreme power that started the FIRST event. May be multiple reads of this book are required or should I meet Dr. Hawking in person!!ps: there are instances of mockery on all kinds of religious myths over creation and the creator. So not recommended for a deeply religious person who believes in the God as a creator of universe."

The name “Stephen Hawking” is enough to deter many, suggesting dry science and confusing theories.. basically, not a book you’d take to unwind.But that’s absolutely wrong ; I speak from experience. The authors of this book clearly had in mind that a small fraction of the general public would be genuinely interested in purchasing their work, and they did everything to break free of that principle and make the content accessible to a wider audience. Many illustrations, artistic renderings and recurrent lighthearted comics make reading this book a honestly comfortable experience. Besides all that, the physics theories and observations written about in this book are true eye-openers; they stretch your mind and thoughts beyond their limits, to unforeseen horizons that Hawking’s genius has somehow been able to fathom. I wasn’t necessarily an all-science enthusiast, but I now find myself forced to reconsider.Don’t let yourself get led away from books that seem too daunting or that don’t conform to your personal norms, because the exercise that is reading such works will only stretch the boundaries of your mind, making you more tolerant to difference and to complexity in the future."

I enjoyed the little cheeky add ins about if our universe did have so many suns it might be good for tanning, but not sustaining life; that chocolate icing on a donut might not be the best example of symmetry, but it makes for good eating; and so on. I listened to this as an audiobook and the narrator did a fantastic job. This is the most I have ever heard the word particle in the four hours it took to listen to this entire book though. To provide some background, I respect immensely those who have anything to do with science because we never clicked. I enjoy math and more defined answers than what philosophy and science provides, where everything depends and nothing is certain. I was actually recommended this book at an Apologetics conference as a great way to learn the evolution of ideas in understanding the scientific accomplishments in proving how we all got started. I will say I learned a tremendous amount and had to take notes to keep things straight. It was written well in the sense that an background should be able to understand the explanations and the development in the different hypotheses of our creation. It was excellent for a newbie because of the first seven chapters explaining the evolution that lead up to their new theory, but I'm wondering how someone would view this book that had any background at all on this subject. I learned what this entire book was about in one chapter, the last one. It introduced his idea, supported and explained it all in one chapter. I was wondering why I read an entire book about the Grand Design when in fact the only new theory of the Grand Design was in one chapter. I don't claim to know anything about science, and the above review is purely a personal opinion."

In this book, they have explained the human capacity and extent of the scientific laws to delineate the nature and universe. The Book revolves around three basic points: Origin of the scientific laws, Exceptions to the laws (miracles) and the possibility of other laws in place of the existing ones. In the quest, to find the laws that govern the universe, humans have formulated a number of theories and mathematical models. But, how close they are to the reality? A gold-fish in curved goldfish-bowl would have a distorted view of reality. Might not we ourselves also be inside some big gold-fish bowl? In that scenario, do the theories we formulate contain the valid picture of reality? The book encompassed many such thought-provoking ideas and arguments. However, authors put their genius attempt to elucidate the complex laws in a simplistic way. They have also drawn various analogies to scientific theories from the real-life examples.In conclusion, I would say that often human mind raises intriguing questions about own existence, the role of the God in creating the universe and applicability range of governing scientific laws. If these questions bother someone then this book may help to some extent.	"

The double-slit experiment, Schrödinger's cat (which isn't explicitly mentioned in this book), the theory of general relativity, and a few other minor points that I was aware of, but did not completely grasp (e.g. multiverses). While also wanting to, hopefully, learn the areas which were completely unknown to me.Mr. Hawking speaks to the physics of all of everything in an easy to understand manner, lengthy in an expected and helpful way, and sometimes with illustrations. Imagine finally being able to understand and also explain how the eleven dimensions described in M-theory can actually exist!There are many examples referencing great minds throughout history as well, their contributions, and why they changed the way people saw reality itself. Einstein, Feynman, Newton, to name a few. In the same vein, the first chapter or so, focusing on the history of philosophy, read like a dry essay, but once the actual descriptions of physics laws begins, that's when the writing truly shines.If you're looking for something similar to The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch, this is not it, but if you're looking to understand the entire breadth of physics from it's philosophical beginnings to its semi-current iteration of quantum theory, this is the spot."

It gets into a lot of history of the development of various physics theories to explain where theoretical physics is today. It does a particularly good job of making the jump (no pun intended) from classical to quantum physics. From this standpoint, then, anyone who's taken college-level physics (or read ABHOT) should be able to understand the science of this book.Unfortunately, Hawking and Mlodinow seem bent on subordinating all other disciplines of learning to science. They claim in the second paragraph of the book that ""philosophy is dead"" - only to posit a philosophical theory in Chapter 2 on which the rest of the book rests! Each chapter is introduced by mythological stories of ancient cultures that are then contrasted by later scientific discoveries, in order to show that any supernatural reasoning behind our world is superfluous. They 'take on' the cosmological and teleological arguments for God's existence, but dismiss them out of hand. Much of the antagonism towards religion and supernatural causation could have been left out of this book without taking away from the science Hawking and Mlodinow do such a nice job describing."

I choose to read this book because I wanted to see the world, the universe through his eyes, and it was quite a journey. In this book he asks, and tries to answer, the question of how and why this world happened to be this way, and whether it is the act of God or could be explained differently. Throughout this book, Hawking try to explain how physics started since early ages till current time, and how our understanding of the universe evolved with each new iteration, then he tries to link different theories to create a more complex yet comprehensible way of viewing the universe. It wasn't an easy ride, but with his wit and wisdom, he made sure it was fun and informative all the way. The fact that he is an atheist trying to scientifically prove that the universe existed by itself as one possible version that we are observing out of many other (maybe infinite) possible versions, and me being a muslim believing in creationism didn't affect the enjoyment of reading about his theory and seeing things from his position, which was quite interesting!

As such there is very little use of maths in it at all; however, don't be fooled - you will have to have your thinking cap switched on if you want to make it through this. I haven't read his previous book 'A Brief History of Time' but I'm sure some of the content of this book overlaps. Hawking does go a little into the history of science, beginning with the ancient philosophers and their ideas of astronomy and motion before moving onto the works of Copernicus, Galileo and Newton (hardly in depth). Then the difficult ideas of relativity and QM. The chapter near the end of the beginning about Feynman's work on QM motion was a headache for me, but after reading it five or six times I sort of understood it. The book does bring up some fascinating ideas about parallel universes which for me was the highlight of it. I don't know which order Hawking's books should be read (chronologically perhaps) but you could certainly start with this one. It is not an easy book, so if you think difficult concepts can be simplified to the point where they are easy to grasp you are wrong. However, Hawking clearly did his best and he deserves credit for this as well as Mlodinow."

Sometimes information piled and I needed to stop to take a break from all the information but the writing in itself is very accessible.Regarding the topic, I don't know if it's possible to prove this theory, I need to read more about it, but I understood the logic behind it, the book perfectly explains how this theory came to be.In the beginning, the book claims 
""philosophy is dead""
 but ironically this reads a great deal like a philosophy book and I loved every philosophical moment in here, the chapter ""What is reality?"" was my favorite and the model-dependent realism has now become my new answer to the question. This mix of philosophy with physics is ideal for me, I felt fascinated by everything I learned and now I have an urge to annoy people by telling them about it."

That was not the same for this book. This was a really tough read for me. It was really difficult to wrap my mind around some of the concepts (like how there are two additional dimensions in our universe, they are just curled up into themselves - wtf? - or the one that was REALLY tough for me, particles having every history rather than one). However, this was still a great book and I'm glad I read it because I am very interested in the universe and how it functions. Maybe this just isn't a good book for a beginner like myself - I think if you go into this with a good foundation of physics/astronomy it will probably be an easier time. I, however, haven't learned anything about astronomy or physics since high school, and most of that was dumped pretty much as soon as I graduated. So maybe put this one off until after you've read some others. While this book really just does an overview, it's still a rough time without solid background knowledge. "
282,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78342970-nina,4,"This was waaaay more accessible than I thought it would be. I remember the embolism I had trying to read A Brief History of Time years ago (still need to finish that), so it was quite a pleasant surprise to be able to read this and not cry (the extent of my scientific knowledge is that Caesium does groovy things in a bowl of water and makes science teachers nervous when children instantly become incredibly feral on noticing this wonderful attribute). Also, this was a very short and quick read, so I wonder if I actually read it at all...I suppose, the gist of it is that the universe is filled with many things that can't be seen, are hard to measure and might not actually exist at all, but in order to theorise about our universe, we need to believe they are there and can be found wherever they are hiding...Maybe I was reading a book on another subject...In any case, it's a small mind that isn't completely blown away by the fact that we exist at all, for what seems to be no real reason. Somewhere a spark was lit, a chain reaction happened and like mould on an orange, here we are. It's as amazing as it is terrifying. Mostly amazing."
283,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62163362-felipe-cz,4,"Interesting book about how humans came into being, and how the quest to explain everything has taken us from the mythological to the scientific, and pops out the question of whether humans have free will or is it just scientific determinism, even taking into account Descartes' distinction between body explained by scientific law and soul as a source of free will. But do other animals have free will? there are scientific laws that explain many of our actions. The book also showcases how reality is not fully independent from the observer, and a good model of reality should be elegant, should fit reality, and should predict the future. A highlight point is quantum theory, which provides us with a different conception of the world, for example, if we open a refrigerator to see what's inside, we're changing the temperature of the contents and exposing them to photoms of light, but shooting photons (light particles) will affect the movement and direction of other particles. It also mentions Einstein's theories and how they revolutionized our understanding of time and space. So basically, more than being whims of gods, occurrences in the universe can be understood by physical laws."

When and how did the universe begin? The Grand Design by Stephan Hawking and Lonnard Mlodinow answers and explores these questions.Most of the concepts in the book have been already covered in Brief History of Time, Brief Answers to the Big Questions and it’s a repetition. I much more enjoyed reading these books. Still it’s a fascinating book and further enriches our understanding of the grand design of the universe, laws of the nature.Did the Universe have a beginning? How did it all begin? Long ago, the answer to almost anything like lightening, storms or eclipses was God. God made everything. The world must have seemed pretty arbitrary. Disasters such as floods, plagues, earthquakes or volcanoes must have seemed to happen without warning or apparent reason. The people attributed such phenomena to God. There was no way to determine the laws governing the universe, and its grand design. The Grand Design by Stephan Hawking enriches understanding about the grand design of the universe, the laws and patterns governing it. "

It is more brief and compact than other such books, which helps lay readers as it elides the wonkier calculations and instead explains complex concepts with simple metaphors and thought experiments. They authors’ tone is dry and analytical, though laced with subtle humor that makes it fresh and highly readable. I followed it well enough until the second to last page, where the authors attempt to answer the book’s fundamental question, “Why is there something rather than nothing?” This was answered in a glib and perfunctory way, requiring reference to a concept of “positive” and “negative” energy that hadn’t been mentioned earlier and that I couldn’t follow -- the discussion of it seemed, to me, logically inconsistent. (For example, gravity is “negative” energy but a black hole’s energy is “positive” -- huh?) This is no fatal flaw if, like me, you didn’t read the book expecting an actual answer. However, it is somewhat out of place in a book otherwise so lucid and methodical, and leaves a bit of an aftertaste."
286,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"Why is there a universe, and why is it as it is? This is the question addressed by “The Grand Design.” These questions have been taken up in many ways by many disciplines in addition to science (e.g. mythology, religion, and philosophy), and science, itself, is continuously attempting to hone in on an explanation that is consistent with observed reality. Hawking and Mlodinow suggest that, for now, the leading contender is M-theory. The authors advocate for M-theory, but also for the [relevant] notion of model-dependent realism. M-theory predicts that quantum fluctuations are causing a continuous spawning of new universes—each with its own laws of nature (or lack thereof.) Most of the bubble universes in this frothy multiverse don’t have staying power, but a few—like ours—are governed by laws that not only allow them to blossom, but also to spawn life. Besides the existence of a multiverse of universes governed by differing sets of laws, there are some other predictions of the M-theory model that remain to be proven. These include the existence of eleven dimensions, most of which are curled up and must be curled up in a certain way according to a set of laws and conditions. The theory also predicts that there will exist “objects” of various dimensionality up to nine. [Whether we will ever be able to test any of these predictions remains unclear.] What’s this model-dependent realism bit? This is the idea that what we know of reality exists through models that connect observations to a set of rules. Within the limited space for which we have observations, there is no requirement that there be a solitary model or mapping between rules and observations. Because of this, there may be multiple theories. Physics has been long looking for a grand unified theory (GUT) or a Theory of Everything (TOE) that explains all the laws of the universe in one fell swoop. Hawking suggests that such a solitary theory may not be found given our limitations, and that we may have to exploit different theories for different situations. This belief is important because M-theory isn’t a unified theory but a grouping of theories that each work well in certain domains. Needless to say, this isn’t a particularly satisfying notion for the many physicists who are hoping for a more satisfying level of elegance. The book consists of eight chapters. The first, entitled “The Mystery of Being,” is a brief description of the central question and an outline of why M-theory is proposed as the answer. Chapter two gives an overview of our evolving understanding of the laws that govern the universe, and sets up the important idea that the configuration of the universe is contingent upon the form of the laws governing it. The third chapter is where the authors argue for model-dependent realism, while discussing the arguments of realists and anti-realists as well. Chapter four describes alternate histories and the idea that the probability of an observation is dependent upon all possible histories that could have led to said observations. This bit of quantum strangeness is crucial to reconciling the central question. The next chapter describes the forces seen in our universe and considers attempts to unify the four forces (i.e. gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force) in a single theory that explains it all—a ToE. Chapter six discusses our universe with particular respect to its steady expansion that has allowed galaxies and solar systems to form. Chapter seven goes further, exploring the nature of a universe that could support the development and evolution of life. There are a wide variety of precise conditions needed to produce intelligent life. We live in a narrow band with respect to our distance from our star in which our type of life could be created. If the orbit of the sun was more elliptical or our axis wasn’t stabilized by a moon, we couldn’t be—and those features require laws that support them. The authors also examine how the chemistry of our universe is conducive to the development of complex life. The final chapter uses a discussion of a primitive computer game called “the game of life” to show how a model shapes reality as we know it. This grid-based game has only a few rules, and yet if there are more than a few pixels at the beginning, it becomes impossible for us to predict an outcome. With the complexity we see in our universe, this situation is vastly greater. The book contains many graphics, mostly color, to clarify ideas that are difficult to comprehend via verbal description, or sometimes just to add levity. The only ancillary matter is a brief glossary of terms that come up in the book. There are no notes and no bibliography.I found this book to be thought-provoking. However, I don’t know why it had the feel of a sales pitch. It repeats the theme of “M-theory is the best game in town” ad nauseam. This repetition draws attention to itself because the book fails to directly challenge those who critique M-theory in any depth or detail. It also fails to take on the question of how it is that M-theory might be taken from a purely theoretical construct to one that can be tested. (It makes falsifiable claims, but does that matter if we may never have a capacity to test those claims?) Those aspects wouldn’t be necessary if the book wasn’t making a pitch. [It felt like the book may have wanted to convince its pop-sci readers that--while they would only have a foggy idea of the why M-theory might have merit at the end of the book--they should remember that it’s the best--so that no funding gets cut from M-theory research and delivered to other lines of inquiry. In other words, the take-away sometimes feels like: “Stephen Hawking is super-smart, and he says ‘vote M-theory.’”] I would recommend this book for those interested in the big picture of our universe’s existence, but as a neophyte it has made me want to read Woit’s “Not Even Wrong” or Smolin’s “The Trouble with Physics” just so that I’ll know what the critics are saying. "
287,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16371850-talal,3,"Overall, a very entertaining read. And the M-theory part is quite interesting. But with all due respect to the doctors, philosophy is not dead! I find the Model Dependent Realism framework a bit unreasonable and that Hawking is using it to express his own theological beliefs. There are some contradictions in the book along with other misleading statements (i.e., the comprehensibility of the universe, the positive potential energy of blackholes, etc). And where is this theory of everything that he keeps discussing? I believe that Dr. Hawking's main goal was to erase God out of the equation and he does it perfectly by killing the fine tuning argument. But either way, the fine tuning of the universe is not theologically sound. If a creator did really create, he has done it for himself. The continual quest for knowledge is admirable in humans, but maybe we should start considering that we are not meant to discover the Grand Design with our limited minds, maybe it would be catastrophic if we do!"
288,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76067293-justin,4,"The first page claims flatly that “philosophy is dead,” and goes on to say that science can answer the ultimate questions. The authors really call themselves out with this and have a lot of work to do to explain why this isn’t just another philosophy itself. Maybe ironically, they seemed to be pushing philosophy throughout the book. There are very frequent references to beliefs that God is the answer to questions that science can address, as if to say “isn’t this so much better than ‘God did it?’” Elbow nudge. It feels like they’re trying to shift readers’ philosophy from “I don’t know, therefore God,” to “I don’t know, therefore I’ll latch on to this current scientific theory.”In the end, I wasn’t convinced that “M-theory” isn’t just another round of Ptolemy’s planetary epicycles or phlogiston theory, but I doubt I’d be able to understand a theory of everything anyway. That’s not to say I didn’t enjoy the historical recapitulation, well-written quantum theory, the multiverse, and universe-level theorizing, which were very interesting and thought-provoking. "
289,0553805371,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95322952-emmanuel,5,"As I read more astronomy books, I realize that there isn't much to learn, well that's what I personally believe, to the world of the celestial design. For me, which my insight was provided and catered by Stephen Hawking himself, the celestial design isn't as renowned in complexity as the world perceives astronomy and its celestial ""Mystery"". From what I was ""told"", it's just a cover up. Which is amazingly exceptional to ensure proper security of the community's safety and social integrity. As for the book's content. Same old physics, mathematical concepts, and standard (which is the only reality), Astronomy. Quite honestly, the Glossary section on the back, is literary ""ASTRONOMY"" at Ph.D level.Anyway, I've learned that Astronomers cannot do anything ""productive"" in developing space because for the obvious reason - ""Their not God"". Also, their main purpose, currently is to further understand the realm of celestial living. Other than that, continue on with your equations and cycling astronomy theory of ""the Big Bang"". "

If observing the photon selects its history, what about humans observing the universe? I don't know whether these are sensible questions to ask but I'm sure I'm not the only reader who wondered about them.)"

While I found The Grand Design to have considerable congruence with Rees' book concerning the quantification of the forces governing the universe and the form that a unifying theory might take, I didn't find as much progress as I expected. However, it was fun to read. I mean, who could resist a paragraph such as this one: ""In the double-slit experiment Feynman’s ideas mean the particles take paths that go through only one slit or only the other; paths that thread through the first slit, back out through the second slit, and then through the first again; paths that visit the restaurant that serves that great curried shrimp, and then circle Jupiter a few times before heading home; even paths that go across the universe and back."""

Dense in the amount of material it covers, in a short book, basic in the depth at which it covered the subjects. That said, it’s not so basic that someone with little familiarity of science would enjoy this. Some exposure, whether it be from college physics days, or at least enjoying shows like How the Universe was Made, some exposure would probably help taking this in. Early on philosophy is declared dead, science is now responsible. Then there’s a pretty great history of scientific discoveries, leading up to discussion of M-theory. Despite the declared death of philosophy, there ends up being quite a bit of philosophizing. M-Theory is a theory of everything (and would nullify God, so of course that’s where drama hits at) but like I said, it still ends up being a lot of philosophy. It was interesting, sometimes muddled, mostly I enjoyed the historic recap. Depth on any subject would require a different book."

They might have known this if they had any acquaintance with the field, or regard for their philosopher colleagues; the hubris and condescension is palpable. Perhaps worse, the last three chapters mash scientific speculation and established fact in such a way to totally mislead the lay-reader.Unfortunately, I am not sure Hawking and Mlodinow do anybody any good with this book."

""The Brief History of Time"" was no doubt a master piece. The descriptions of physical concepts in that book were very comprehensive. I would say, The Grand Design stands a level below. I love Stephen Hawking's style of explaining things, especially with one or two jokes interspersed. With this, the book has made the concept of M-theory quite clear. From quantum mechanics to the question of why there is a Universe, the book explains the fundamental challenges of contemporary world of Physicists with easy reading. I personally took support of online videos to get a few of the concepts clear in my mind. This book definitely has a lot of material to start exploring more as per one’s will."

I think everyone should give this book a shot, especially those who support intelligent design or creationism. The authors do an excellent job of showing us, as simply as possible (which is not easy to do), a uni(multi?)verse that far exceeds anything that a religious text could account for.

Apparently my brain isn't yet capable of grasping the big concept... I still see the spoon!! So, what I'm hoping for is that all this will act as a seed deep in my subconscious and someday flourish into a deeper understanding.

The age of philosophers pulling nonsense out of their behind has been demolished irreparably by Einstein and his gang and has been replaced by squads of theoretical scientists, i.e. modern day philosophers, trying to scout the way for the armies of experimental scientists waiting for new theories to validate in every corner of nature.This is a harder read than the brief history of time, as it seems Hawking lost some of his patience with age and became more demanding in our understanding of the universe.

The book not only tells about Hawkins opinion, but also tells a lot of stories of scientists, their theories, and their opinions. The book is a good book to reed, every time I read, it made me want to reed more, because you start to be more curious to know what is happening and what is the next thing it'll say. The book tells about the cosmos but it involves different theories, so it won't be boring, because it'll change all the time for something more fun. I think they did a good job explaining the theories, because they took something which could be hard to understand and transformed into something easy by using examples of our day lives. If you really want to reed a book explaining how and why things are, and the story of the scientists to get evidences for their theories, this is the book for you. "

I liked that Hawking and Mlodinow took their time to start with the scientific method (model-dependent realism) and later expounded on several proposed theories about the beginning of the universe and why and how it came to be exactly the way it is, thus helping non-scientists navigate the content better. I cannot speak for how definitive are the claims about the M-theory potentially being the ultimate unified theory of everything, but as a biologist, it made me curious to know more of how the physics of M-theory might hold up with predicting primordial life and further evolution on Earth (and elsewhere?!) although they did touch upon it a little bit.Above all, it reignites a sense of awe and wonderment..! As Neil deGrasse Tyson says, gotta “keep looking up!”"
