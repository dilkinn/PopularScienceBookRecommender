0,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"This is one of those books that you pick up in the hope that it lives up to its title but is likely not to because it was written by someone from marketing. Every now and then it pays off, and this is one of those times.This book spoke volumes to me. I have studied math, and I love math especially applying it to scientific problems. But I have never looked into algorithms, nor have I been taught algorithms. What a shame! I took to the ideas instantly and it all made complete sense - not only the algorithms, but the living by them. I guess it all ties into how our brains work and how Turing likened computers to our brains. It all makes sense because our brains are computers that work by algorithms. Messy algorithms that clash and battle against each other, but predictable in some ways.So embracing how algorithms work and some of the solutions they suggest and applying them to your everyday life may seem like a stretch, but you're already doing it, you just don't realise it. And you may not be solving your problems in the most effective manner, but the authors explore the reasons for that too.So if you view reality like I do, pick this book up. It has more revelations in it than any holy text. It gives me frameworks to work on problems that I already think about. It helped me make even more sense of this crazy place.As soon as I finished the audiobook I started right back at the beginning again. The narrator is one of the authors and he does a brilliant job. I'm going to get a physical copy of this too when it is out in paperback. It's a keeper. It's a treasure. So much bliss!"
1,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"I was captivated by much of this book. It's the perfect antidote to the argument you often hear from young maths students - 'What's the point? I'll never use this in real life!' This often comes up with algebra (which often is useful), but reflects the way that we rarely cover the most applicable bits of maths to everyday life at high school. Although this book is subtitled 'the computer science of human decisions', it's really about the maths of human decision making (which is often supported by computers) - I suspect the 'computer science' label is to make it more sexy than boring old mathematics.If there is any danger that the 'M' word would turn you off, the book tends to skip over the mathematical workings, concentrating on the outcomes and how they're relevant to the kind of decisions we make in everyday life - and it's that application side that makes it particularly interesting (helped by a good, readable style from the co-authors). So, for instance, one of the earliest areas covered is the kind of decision where you are selecting between a number of options that arrive sequentially and where you have to make a decision on which is best for you part way through the sequence, even though there may be better options in the future. The classic examples for this are some kinds of job interviews, house buying and finding a partner for life.It might seem there can be no sensible advice, but mathematically it's very clear. You wait until you've got through 37% of the choices, then pick the next one that's better than any you've seen before. It's not that this will necessarily deliver your best of all possible worlds. More often than not it won't. But it will give you a better result than any other mechanism for deciding when to go for a particular option. Of course it's not always easy to apply. For example, unless it's something like an interview with closed applications, how do you know when you are 37% of the way through the available options? Luckily, the authors point out that there are approximations to get around this, which include that the approach can also apply to the amount of time available for the process.And that's just the start. Along the way you will discover the best way to sort the books on your shelves into alphabetic order (something I confess I did last year, using a sub-optimal mechanism), how to balance exploration (for example, trying out new restaurants) with exploitation (for example, returning to tried and tested restaurants), how the concept of caching can revolutionise your filing system (and make that pile of papers on your desk that everyone mocks the sensible approach), why Bayes theorem is so important and much more. I absolutely revelled in this book.The content only fades a bit when the applications aren't about real world decisions. So, for instance, there's some material about how the internet works that is very interesting if you like that kind of thing (I do), but hasn't got the same feeling of personal utility to it, so lacks some of the bite of the other chapters. This is even more obvious in the section on randomness. I would also have liked to see more acknowledgement that most of the content was really from the area of study called operational (operations in the US) research, a discipline that happens to make use of computers, rather than true computer science - but that's a specialist moan.Realistically speaking, I don't think much of the content of this book will truly change how any of us do things. Interestingly, the authors reveal than an expert in the field pretty much consciously ignored the mathematical approach in a particular case, opting for more of a 'feels right' choice. But that doesn't stop the whole business, whether it's the relative simplicity of the 37% rule or the mind twisting possibilities of game theory, from being both potentially practical and highly enjoyable as presented here. Recommended."
2,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"I enjoy thinking about algorithms as they are applied to technical problems. So, when I saw this book, I thought, ""This is a book written just for me."" And, that assessment was absolutely correct. It is a fascinating book, all about how sophisticated algorithms are applicable to everyday problems.The book starts out describing the ""optimal stopping problem."" It is also sometimes called the ""secretary hiring problem"", and I have seen it applied to dating to find a romantic partner, and this book points out that it can also be applied to looking for an apartment in a seller's market, or searching for a parking space. It can be summed up by the phrase, ""Quit while you're ahead."" Basically, you have a finite amount of time to complete a search for the ""best"" item or person. What do you do? It can be shown, mathematically, that you should conduct a search for 37% of your total available time, without making any decisions. Then, at the very next time you find an item or person that is better than all of the previous ones, you should jump on it! I read about this, beforehand, but I didn't realize that 37% comes from 1/e, where ""e"" is the natural exponent. The next topic in the book is the dichotomy between explore and exploit. That is to say, when you are looking for something to do, will you try something new (explore), or repeat something that has pleased you in the past (exploit). The answer has to do with how much more time you have in this situation. Movie sequels are all about exploiting, because movie revenues are decreasing. If you are new to an area, you will explore restaurants, but if you are moving away soon, you will return to restaurants you have previously visited. I enjoyed how this issue is related to the ""multi-armed bandit"" problem. This is a mathematical problem that has lots of applications; choosing the best slot machine in a casino, for example, or designing a web site that will maximize profits for a company.Sorting is a big topic in the book. It turns out that top poker players sort themselves out, and don't want to play with players they think are better. Libraries use an inefficient caching system, putting recent acquisitions in front. Instead, they should put the most popular books in front. The Naguchi filing system involves returning all files to the extreme left. This goes against the recommendations of efficiency experts, who recommend sorting by topic. Leaving a pile of papers on top of a desk is an example of the MOST efficient filing system! I enjoyed reading an anecdote about Barack Obama visiting Google, before he became president. At Google, he was treated to a pretend job interview. He was asked, ""if you had to design an algorithm to sort a million 32-bit integers, what would you do?"" He replied that he would not use a bubble-sort algorithm, and all the people in the audience applauded his correct answer!I enjoyed reading about human memory from an algorithmic point of view. Memory recall is a problem of organization. It was fascinating to read that a graph of the probability of remembering something as a function of elapsed time exactly mimics the probability that a word appears in a newspaper headline twice in a row!Knowing more makes it harder to remember things; what we call memory decline is actually just learning. A brain fart is actually just a cache miss!Related to sorting are various problems of scheduling. Examples from the book include multiple laundry loads to minimize total washing plus drying time, and minimizing the rotting of food from a CSA (Community-Supported Agriculture).No book on everyday applications of algorithms should bypass Bayesian reasoning, and this is an important subject in this book. Our memories of images of plane crashes and car crashes are roughly the same; as a result, we are surprised that there are orders of magnitude more deaths in car crashes, than in plane crashes.The dangers of over-fitting are discussed at length. As an example, police and FBI agents sometimes over-train; they sometimes use good gun-training etiquette during a shoot-out, with fatal consequences. I really appreciated the discussion of how over-fitting is avoided in biological evolution. It is dangerous for organisms to evolve to over-fit an ecological niche, because the species might not be able to rapidly adapt to an uncertain future environment.I also thought that the description of ""exponential backoff"" was very well treated in the book. This esoteric-sounding algorithm is used in all computer networks, but is also used by many of us in treating flaky friends, and in punishment for probation violations.The last chapter in the book was about game theory. It is helpful, in reading this book, to have some previous background, an understanding of a ""Nash equilibrium"". The following quote sums it up nicely: 
Love is like organized crime. It changes the structure of the marriage game so that the equilibrium becomes the outcome that works best for everybody.
 I highly recommend this book. Regardless of your mathematics background, it will intrigue you and amaze you, to see how math permeates our everyday lives."
3,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,4,"Okay, I loved this book. So what is it about?The big pictureWe encounter many problems in our daily life, for instance, should I park my car here or proceed with the hope of finding a free spot a bit further? Should I try new restaurants or just stick to good old ones I know? How can I find my life's purpose? What is the fastest way I can sort out my books, hmmm, should I even try sorting out my shelves? How can I best schedule my tasks for maximum productivity and many more routine problems like these. These problems have a mathematical and computer science basis to which the scientific community has found optimum or near to optimum answers and this book teaches us how we can apply these solutions to our daily life problems. Amazing, isn't it? :DThe book itself: Well, the idea of the book is just marvelous. In addition, the writers are profoundly knowledgeable and educated both from academic and non-academic perspectives; hence, they've woven perfectly selected anecdotes, philosophical, economical or psychological facts, literary phrases into the fabric of their stories which makes the book superb. This book is not an easy read at all, and it's a good thing in contrast with common belief since it challenges and stretches your mind and expands your thoughts horizons. Part of this difficulty stems from the fact that authors are having a hard time simplifying mathematical and computer science facts. The material sometimes gets a bit tough to comprehend. On the other hand, It seems to me that authors are trying hard to make the text complex. :| Final wordThis book definitely is amongst the richest books I've ever consumed, lots of knowledge and insights are compiled in an applicable manner. I would whole-hardheartedly recommend this books to all the nerds and geeks out there and everyone who enjoys improving efficiency and productivity of his/her day-to-day life."
4,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Even though I'm a computer programmer, I have to say when I saw the title I was a bit put off. Algorithms are what I use for telling a computer what to do, but I'm not sure I feel comfortable with using them to tell myself what to do. Real life is less tidy and binary than the data in a computer.But, perhaps out of train-wreck curiousity, I picked it up and took a look. The first thing I noticed is that Alison Gopnik gave it a dust jacket endorsement. Ok, you have my full attention now.Once I started reading, I understood a bit better what the authors were getting at. A lot of what ought to be called philosophy, is nowadays most often carefully looked at by computer scientists. Questions like:1) how do you balance finding new, vs. getting satisfaction from what you already know is good enough? Should I eat at my favourite restaurant, or give a new one a try? Should I move to a new city or stay where I know where the best bookstore/coffeeshop/bar/restaurants are? Should I try out a new career or employer, or stay with the job I've got?2) how do you balance keeping things orderly, and keeping them handy?3) how do I balance the risk of missing out on some important news, vs. the problem of spending my life endlessly checking email and texts?4) how do I balance the risk of not thinking deeply enough about something, vs. the risk of overthinking something that is actually simple?We have spent over half a century looking at these questions in detail, in order to make computer programs work more efficiently when they sort, analyse, or store and retrieve data. Our lives are rarely so tidy and binary as a computer's data, but all of these questions are highly relevant to questions we face in our own messy, analogue lives.This isn't, I think, a reason to decide that you should spend 37% of your expected adult lives dating, and then propose to the next person you date who is better than anyone you've dated so far (as one information theory algorithm might suggest). But, there are a lot of situations in life where we have to choose between deciding how picky to be vs. it's time to make our pick. For example, the amount of time to look for a house, or a parking spot, or a new job, are places where I think it's ok to use a bit of algorithmic logic instead of just going with your gut impulse (which is a lot easier for people to sway with savvy salesmanship).For me, though, more likely than that I will actually use the quicksort algorithm for my socks (see chapter 3) is that I will think more clearly about the issues involved when I do have a large sorting project to do. Just reading about the tradeoffs involved, helps to think more clearly about them. In sorting, what are the chances you are ever going to need to search through the stuff you're sorting anyway? If there's a good chance you won't, just do a rough bucket sort and call it done. In searching, are you needing the best chance of getting the absolute best, or the best chance of getting something above average? If you pass on an opportunity and then go back, what is the chance that opportunity will still be there (in the crowded parking lot, not much; in job search, depends on the labour market).The fun thing about this kind of book, is that it is not about any particular topic per se, it is about all topics and none. It is a book for thinking about thinking, and thinking about better ways to think. It is fun in the same way that solving puzzles or playing games is fun; it's not that the puzzle or game is important in itself, it's that it's fun to feel your brain working effectively on a hard task (which is why the puzzle or game can't be too easy, or it won't be fun). Reading this book is an opportunity to think well about a lot of topics from your everyday life, and who knows, it may make you think slightly better about them after you're done. I probably won't really live by these algorithms, but it is more fun to live with them (i.e. having them available when I feel like it), and this book is a pain-free and enjoyable way to get introduced."
5,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"A simple algorithm to conceive of literary plots could be to slot them as belonging to one of these categories: Man vs. Nature, Man vs. Self, Man vs. Man & Man vs. Society. Brian & Tom enlists findings from computer science to guide us through these. Algorithms here are the shortcuts or even the intuitions that guide us through problems that are intractable at first glance. We, apparently, use them everyday. Brian & Tom are here to document this and to show how exactly we can make them more efficient, by exploring the idea of human algorithm design—searching for better solutions to the challenges people encounter every day. The central thesis is that it’s best to use shortcuts to improve your probability of success and remember that “perfection is the enemy of the good.” The book’s algorithms are intended to reduce time spent puzzling, conserve energy for the things that matter.When it comes to the first two categories, computer science is shown to be a good guide to problems created by the fundamental structure of the world, and by our limited capacities for processing information. As with all the sciences before it, computer science and data science are pretty effective in dealing with these issues. And the computational approach seems to be a remarkably useful improvement in dealing with areas like self-control or complex everyday decisions.In this part of the book, when we deal with Man vs. Nature & Man vs. Self, we mostly encounter well-defined problems and potential algorithms to deal with them. We have a nice variety of approaches here:First, we are given a taste of the “Optimal stopping problems” which spring from the irreversibility and irrevocability of time - How do you decide when to stop searching, be it for a the perfect mate, the perfect employee, the perfect job or the perfect weekend movie? The answer seems to be simple: 37% - you stop once 37% of your options have been checked out. Much more useful than it sounds, this number is the output of an algorithm. Whether it’s an apartment, a parking space, or a spouse, the right moment to stop searching and start choosing falls under the umbrella of problems called “optimal stopping.” The general solution to optimal stopping problems reveals that you should spend 37 percent of your time gaining an impression of what’s out there and the rest of the time selecting anything better than the average of what you observed thus far. Need to rent an apartment in three weeks? Simply take one week to observe and two weeks to pounce on the next best thing. This means that you have a good sample of the options you have so you don’t jump to early decision and miss out on the good choices that were just around the corner, and at the same time, you don’t waste all your time only searching! Then we are introduced to “the explore/exploit dilemma”, springing from time’s limited supply - should we revisit favourite restaurants and places and ensure a good time (exploit) or should we explore bravely out to new experiences and places (explore) in the hope that we might stumble on something incredible? If we don’t explore, we might miss out on a lot of YOLO stuff , but if we only explore and do not exploit the good stuff we have already discovered (a favourite dish, a cared-for home, spouse, close friends, etc.) then we might me missing out on even more. SO how do we figure out an optimal ration between Explore/Exploit? Turns out computer scientists have been working on finding this balance for more than fifty years. They even have a name for it: the explore/exploit tradeoff. The explore/exploit tradeoff tells us how to find the balance between trying new things and enjoying our favourites. The answer is to think about the time you have left - the more time you have the more your strategy should shift. So the young should explore more and the elderly should exploit more and wherever you are in that continuum, you should ration the Es accordingly. YOLO, after all.There are more: Relaxation and randomization emerge as vital and necessary strategies for dealing with the ineluctable complexity of challenges like trip planning and vaccinations, Sorting theory tells us how (and whether) to arrange our offices, Caching theory tells us how to fill our closets, Scheduling theory tells us how to fill the unforgiving minute well, etc.Then comes the next two categories: Man vs. Man and Man vs. Society problems - these are, in effect, the problems that we pose and cause each other. Here the authors move away from computer science and enlists mathematics as well, specifically and predictably, game theory, to help us out. And the cross-pollination between game theory and computer science gives us algorithmic game theory for tackling issues like investing, bubble and even plain arguments. The solutions are much less rigorous here, with 1) the advice to “change the game” if the game threatens to go into less than optimal equilibriums and 2) an exhortation to be “computationally kind” to reduce the cognitive load of the participants, emerging as the main “algorithms to live by” when it comes to living in society. So as always, the book would seem to be teaching us again that no matter how computationally adept we are, dealing with each other is something that just can’t be fitted into any algorithm, formula or thumb-rule. We gotta wing it."
6,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3925186-bill,5,"I really enjoyed this book. It's a nice popular review of research, in a style similar to Malcolm Gladwell. It was fascinating to see the wide-reaching applications of classic algorithms from computer science and also humbling to see how many problems are essentially impossible to truly optimize. However, as luck would have it, there are often simple approximations that give a pretty good solution with very little effort. The authors do a good job giving interesting backstory on the algorithms and relating them in ways that are hopefully accessible to readers who aren't familiar with computer science.My favorite chapters were the ones that were the most strongly anchored in the mundane, especially ""Optimal Stopping"" (parking space/househunting), ""Explore/Exploit"" (should I try a new restaurant or go to my old favorite?) and ""Scheduling"" (what to do with your to-do list). Some of the others, such as ""Networking"" and ""Overfitting"" were more theoretical and less memorable, but still had nice historical vignettes of the people behind famous names like Bayes.If you have a technical/analytical inclination and have ever wondered what the ideal way to solve an everyday problem, I think you'll find a lot to like in this book."
7,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808339-kony,4,"An engaging conceptual tour of computational/networking concepts, how they apply in the computer world, and how we can use them to reframe, streamline, and manage a diverse array of real-life problems, both silly and serious. As a reader who knows little about computer science - but loves learning new frameworks, drawing analogies between disparate fields, and finding metaphors for life everywhere - I thoroughly enjoyed this. Some of my favorite principles/concepts: * 37% rule of ""optimal stopping"" (when to stop scouting prospects and just commit); * explore/exploit tradeoff (chance of finding a new gem vs. certainty of enjoying a known fave); * LRU (""last recently used"") sorting as an efficient prophylactic for searching; * layered caches as metaphor for human memory (""brain fart"" as ""cache miss""); * overfitting (when interpreting data: prefer simple accuracy to complex precision); * constraint relaxation as a technique to address knotty problems; * buffer-bloat (when backlog is bad, best to reject all incoming requests until it clears); * exponential back-off (when head-butts recur, double your wait time before trying again); * computational kindness (by reducing the options on the table, we do people's brains a favor). "
8,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,4,"So many great one-liners in this book.Stop on Tinder at 37%.Use thick markers in brainstorming.All things being equal, it'll last as long as it's lasted.But lest you think this is another fluffy brain book, it's actually hard computer programming with the occasional laugh-out-loud line. The team behind it are serious academics who have thought deeply about how computers think and how we can use those algorithms to make our lives easier. Which, when you think about it, isn't so crazy, because who taught the computers to think in the first place? We're just reclaiming tactics that are ours to begin with."

10,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22622029-shayan-kh,5,"یه سری توضیح فارسی بعد از این ریویو ی انگلیسی هست.Wow. I did not expect this book to be this good. Algorithms to live by is aptly named. The authors use computer science problems to tackle everyday problems that every one of us encounters on a daily basis. How should I schedule my day? How should I organize my files? When I found a parking spot, should I park or should I search a bit more? All of these problems have a right answer, and people mostly don't know the answer. This book has been sent from mathematical heaven to show us the correct way of tackling these kinds of problem. So it is a must read for everyone. If you are a computer scientist, this book would be a beautiful bridge that connects your beliefs to your life. And if you don't even know what the hell computer science is, well as long as you are alive, this book can help you.خیلی خیلی کتاب خوبی بود.من معمولا این ریویو ها رو برای خودم می نویسم. برای همینه که همیشه انگلیسی می نویسم. به عنوان تمرین زبان. اما این کتاب اونقدر خوب بود که به نظرم باید معرفی شه به همه. برای همین خواستم به فارسی هم یه چیزی راجع بهش بگم که به همه معرفی شه. این کتاب از بهترین کتاب های ""کمک به خود"" هست که تا الان خوندم. حتما دیدین، کتاب هایی که خیلی هم زیادن و همیشه بخش های خیلی زیادی از کتاب فروشی ها رو شامل می شن. مثل روش های متفاوتی که برای مقابله با تنبلی هست و روش های مدیریت زمان و از این چرندیات. اکثر این کتابا، یه ویژگی مشترکشون اینه که دلبخواهی نوشته شدن. بر اساس سلیقه ی نویسنده.اما یه سری از این کتابا هستن که بر اساس تحقیقات علمی نوشته می شن. اینا برای خودشون یه سطح دیگه ای دارن.توی همین سطح، بهترین کتابی که خوندم تا الان این کتاب بوده، که بعضی جاهاش از تحقیقات علمی استفاده کرده و بعضی جاهاش از نتایج علوم پایه! در حقیقت علوم کامپیوتر. خیلی از مشکلاتی که ما روزانه باهاش دست و پنجه نرم می کنیم، مشکلاتی هستن که قبلا مدل سازی هاش انجام شده و راه حل های بهینه اش پیدا شده. یا اصن ثابت شده که راه حلی که توی زمان مناسب به جواب برسیم وجود نداره. این کتاب یه تعدادی از این مشکلات رو لیست کرده و جوابشون رو هم داده. مشکلاتی مثل این که وقتی یه جای پارک پیدا می کنید، بهتره همونجا پارک کنید یا بهتره بازم بگردین. یا این که زمانبندی رو چه شکلی بهتره انجام بدیم. این مساله ها رو قبلا آدمای خیلی باهوش تر از من و شما بهش فکر کردن. توی این زمینه بد نیست ببینیم به چه نتیجه ای رسیدن.برای همین، خوندن این کتاب رو به همه پیشنهاد می کنم."
11,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52763346-farhana,4,"It was quite interesting, intriguing ! Once I had an argument with somebody who believed in using ""steepest ascent hill climbing approach"" while decision making. I personally don't favor hill climbing algorithm. I think the following two lines matter:neighbor <---a highest valued successor of the current.if value(neighbor)> value(current) then replace current with neighbor.Now, whether people would execute these two lines or not depends on many things. Sometimes they may, sometimes they may comment out them. Next, what heuristic functions they use while evaluating options !Obviously the heuristic differs from people to people - reflecting their stands, morality, values & judgements. And why would people feel the need of replacement in the first place! I rarely like the idea of replacements because ""Bests are not gonna remain best always."" As for the hill climbing, it balances by hooking on the local maxima & depriving of the global maxima! Maybe that's the price one needs to pay for his/her covetousness! :p (for the time being thinking philosophically not computationally :p ) So, why every time replace whatever you have! However, it's people's personal choice. The writers of the book drew analogy from computer science algorithms into daily lives. Being a computer science student I think any CS student is gonna enjoy it! Many topics, concepts that we've learnt through different courses have been put here in a different light. It offers a different frame to look back at those concepts, review them & creates an understanding & thoughtfulness to stretch their usefulness! :)"
12,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Even as a lover of cerebral non-fiction, Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions sounded mentally taxing enough that I put off listening to it for quite some time (I had acquired the Audible version, read by Brian Christian, in a 2-for-1 deal). I hope that others will not be similarly dissuaded: there's a lot of great, applicable information to be had here. It kept occurring to me that those who could benefit the most from this book's message of better-living-through-data would be the least likely to read it, and that those of us already familiar with Bayesian inference and the traveling salesman problem would just gather new data points. For sure, there are a lot of numbers, statistics and data tables. Christian (science writer) and co-author Tom Griffiths (professor of psychology and cognitive science) present these as cogently, patiently and genially as one can expect, and my exhortation to the reader would be to listen for the takeaways without getting too hung up on specific numbers.Christian and Griffiths examine human problems that, often surprisingly, are settled issues with real answers (thanks, data scientists and computer programmers!). The numbers can speak to decisions like making offers on a house, hiring a secretary, finding a parking spot, or even knowing when to settle down with a life partner. For questions that haven't been settled, at least we get a good handle on the probabilities involved and when close-enough answers are actually optimal. So many aspects of life are random, or simply out of our control. This is a helpful and sobering reminder to rely on available data in a world filled with offers of false certainty.A thorough recounting of the topics would make this a long review indeed, so I'll highlight some of the chapter titles and examples that leap to mind:- Optimal stopping is all about when to give up on a search that could conceivably go on forever, such as the aforementioned dating and hiring.- Explore/exploit looks at when to try new things versus sticking with the familiar, as when balancing new restaurants with old favorites.- Sorting examines how we glean order from chaos, and the crazy math behind library catalogs and March Madness lineups.- Caching asks what information is worth holding onto, how computers shuffle data, and whether all that time spent organizing files is well spent (FIFO FTW!).- Scheduling particularly spoke to me, with insights on being productive, tackling meaningful work, and why inbox zero is a such a crushing, losing battle.- ""Baye's rules"" communicates a sensible strategy for gauging your expectations and then revising them as new information comes in.- Overfitting warns us about isolated factors that can get out of hand, such as our evolutionary propensity to eat salty, sugary and fatty foods. Or websites that, in an effort to maximize ad revenue, are rendered useless.- Relaxation teaches us to simplify problems to gain traction on them, to not let the perfect solution be the enemy of the good enough, and when to disobey the law.- Randomness encourages to lean into the role of uncertainty, and to latch onto small improvements and happy accidents.- Networking is a fun dive into the world of communication, and the algorithms that undergird our interactions online. You'll never watch Netflix the same way again.- Game theory is about the mind games we play when trying to anticipate the thoughts and actions of others, and how those mental models play out from poker to work schedules. The discussion about bidding strategies was particularly interesting: I'd never heard of Vickrey auctions, which are designed to make gaming the system pointless and honesty the best policy.Christian and Griffiths conclude with a pitch for ""computational kindness"". We can use our knowledge of algorithms to reduce the amount of mental work that others have to do. We can design a society with optimal laws and incentives that make the right thing the easiest thing to do. Even on an interpersonal level, something so simple as offering your top three food picks ends up being much kinder than offloading the work to the group by saying, ""I dunno, I'm fine with whatever.""Algorithms to Live By, in many small and surprising ways, will leave you with fascinating insights into how the world works, and will inspire you to optimize your own life in the process.

13,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,5,"One of the authors of this also produced The Most Human Human, a very good book about artificial intelligence that I probably didn't laud in enough detail in my review (although, to be fair, I read it on a Turkish beach and reviewed it well afterward). This book is an even more ambitious attempt to bring computer science concepts to a lay audience, and I thought it was excellent. Presenting common algorithms as a way of making decisions in ordinary human affairs seems a lot like the computer-science version of Everything I Ever Needed to Know about Economics I Learned from Online Dating and indeed, the first chapter is a bit like that. It discusses dating and marriage as an optimal stopping problem, which is a little silly. But unlike the ""economics"" book, this one swiftly leaves that kind of gimmick behind and talks about much more serious problems, like housing bubbles and transportation and how to assign subjects in medical studies when some will get the inefficacious treatment and die. I routinely criticize books for scope problems, so I have to be consistent here and point out that the authors sometimes stray from discussing immediate real-life applications of computer algorithms, and find themselves just discussing computer science. It's a chatty narrative, but you're reading about Bayesian priors and packet switching. However, this book's scope drift strikes me as a virtue because the writing is very lucid and they explain a large proportion of the types of algorithms you'd learn in a computer science class--a reader who doesn't know computer science would learn a lot without even noticing! In fact, my one complaint would be that this book comes so close to directly explaining the P vs. NP problem and leaving general readers with a significant understanding of something important to the academic field--but then they don't. They give you everything you need to understand it, but they never put it in those terms. It's a bit like seeing an ice-skater gearing up for a quadruple jump, and then they chicken out and just do that little half-turn and hop. Why didn't they go for it?Still, the people who notice that particular lack of reach aren't the primary audience for this work. If you are interested in what computer science is about (hint: not computer repair), this is--perhaps inadvertently--a great starting point. And if you do know the algorithms already, it's an entertaining review and discussion of everyday problems."
14,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11846811-deke,3,"Definitely valuable material here, but I can't fully recommend it... although I'm having trouble discerning why. Fact is, I read a lot of books of this ilk, and this one didn't strike the right balance between the hard math and the chatty anecdotal moments, as Freakonomics did. Moreover the real life application of these principles are in many cases strikes me as being about as real-world-useful as textbook economic models, with their perfectly logical actors, etc. Good food for thought, nonetheless."
15,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"Oy. This type of thinking is part of what is wrong with the world and gives nerds a bad reputation.These algorithms are very theoretical. It's impossible to apply them without making all kinds of assumptions that don't seem generally valid in the real world. And the proponents don't test them to see if they work. For example, they've got one on how to find a parking spot. They ask the guy who came up with it how it works for him. He answers ""Oh me, I ride a bike."" [rimshot] Also, the narrator talks very slowly, even on 2x playback speed."

Throughout the book, there are many moments that made me go: ""Wow, that explains a lot!"" I'm familiar with most the algorithms mentioned in the book, but I didn't see their application in real life until now. "
17,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,4,"This is the first book I’ve read that was recommended to me by a Goodreads friend I haven’t met irl. (Thanks, Darian!)Very interesting and readable book that goes through algorithms that are common in computer science and tech fields, gives a bit of history about them, and then shows ways that they could be applied to every day scenarios.Since I’ve worked in tech on products up and down the OSI stack, I was familiar with a lot of them though I certainly hadn’t sat down in a systematic way and thought, “Hmm how can I use these to optimize my life?”That’s okay though because algorithms are interesting enough to read about on their own. The application to every day life is a bonus.I feel like we’d be better off as a species if some of these concepts (O-notation, Bayes theorem, game theory to name a few off the top of my head) were more widely understood and added to common vocabulary.Some of the things that were new to me were the Secretary problem/stopping problem, explore/exploit trade off, some of the queuing theory. I really liked Laplace’s simple yet handy equation for estimating the odds of something given a few events.I was happy to see the formula for estimating pi from dropping needles on lined paper get a mention because that came up in the book I read last year about Claude Shannon. I don’t think people are going to be using this method for estimating pi, but it’s funny that when Prof. Shannon’s daughter dropped a box of toothpicks that’s the first thing he thought to mention to her.I thought that the chapter on game theory was really good, so skip directly to that if you want. [[[I also recommend reading Prisoners Dilemma by William Poundstone, which is a similar book to this one but focused entirely on game theory.]]] I never really thought of morality/religion as a way to limit the range of options so that human interaction doesn’t devolve into game theory hell. It’s a nice theory anyway.I really liked the tons of notes and citations in the back of the book, which took up 1/4th to 1/3rd of it. So there were plenty of links or sidebars with more details.However, at times the writing got to be a bit much. One author is a cognitive scientist and the other is a journalist, so I’m guessing the latter is the one who kept reaching for his thesaurus and Bartlett’s. And I’m also guessing he’s the one putting in all the hook anecdotes, hook quotes, and writing sections in “Christmas tree” and “pyramid” shapes that he learned in J-school. I don’t think I was supposed to notice that stuff.Highly recommended, especially for the non-technical. It could possibly change the way you look at the world, the way that Prisoners Dilemma did for me.(By the way, Amazon says that this book is frequently bought with Hillbilly Elegy. Something odd is afoot in Ohio.)"

We face a messy world with ill-defined problems such as trade-offs between things like whether to explore something new or exploit a tried and true method. There are also problems that are ill-defined or hard to formulate or maybe a problem has such a large search space that finding the one best solution is impossible. Computer scientists have had to take beautiful computation and mathematics and apply it to real-world problems which don't lend themselves to cut and dried textbook solutions. Algorithms developed in the field of computer science often mirror the real world algorithms and rule of thumbs people use to navigate their busy lives. Things like knowing when to stop a search and settle or how to schedule multiple conflicting goals in our day to day lives or ordering priorities or exploring networks in our social world. Algorithms developed by geeks can come in handy in ordinary life. Well presented and interesting material with some things even a technophobe can use.Update. 9/7/2019 Some of these tools used by computer scientists are developed to solve problems of curve-fitting, scheduling, sampling, prediction, ordering, explore or exploit, are dilemmas of limited time or resources and the need for shortcuts to solve problems that are good enough. Getting the perfect answer is often impossible then one has to find methods to get as good an answer as feasible. So messy shortcuts are needed and these algorithms developed in computer science have their analogs in our real world where the good must not be made the enemy of the perfect. This book shows some of the tricks of computer science look an awful lot like all too human hard-earned wisdom of limited creatures such as ourselves."

20,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,4,"3.5/5. I'm totally hooked and decided to buy the print version because it is actually that helpful. It could almost rival Thinking, Fast and Slow in terms of how much of (relative) new yet relevant things it taught me. However, the writing is not as neat and the authors try a bit too hard to sell to book to general audience, stretching the implications/applicability of some algorithms. They are not the original researchers, i.e. they didn't actually solve these mathematical/computational problems nor conducted experiences, which is not bad but that explains the limit of how much they can explain these works, compared to Kahneman's (I'm comparing them to a giant, maybe unfair here). Again due to this, much of the mathematical explanations are deferred to the appendix, which I dislike given that I'm reading an e-book, but even if I have a paper copy I would prefer the (simplified) math be done in main text. Instead, they do too much of summarizing and intuition. It would work for some, but just not for me, personally.Still, highly recommend."

This book uses some major algorithms that has been used in computer science and mathematics, and showed their implications for daily decisions. I enjoyed this book, though I would've loved it, if it had more of a structure, and maybe even exercises, for eager audience. "
22,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/994755-kathryn-bashaar,3,"This book was entertaining to me because I minored in Math & Computer Science in college and have made most of my career in information mangement. The premise is that computers are so fast and so smart now that they can solve problems that stymied mathematicians for centuries, and can even shed light on more everyday human problems. Such as, how many people should I interview before making a hiring decision? Or, should I finish my small tasks first or tackle the big ones? The main conclusion that I took from this book was that human beings, using what we often call common sense, on average will come pretty close to optimal on such decisions. As Shakespeare said, ""What a piece of work is man!"" Some of the math got a little overwhelming for me. The book could have been a little shorter. But I loved the enthusiasm these guys have for their subject, and the pace and language were sprightly enough that I never lost interest.Like my reviews?

When you read these kinds of books you understand why it's so important to know which kinds of algorithms already exists and which problems they solve.Real hackers (Read Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution) implement their own code just for the sake of learning something new or for the joy of programming. When you really need to deal with a complex problem, the tools will be already in your mind, just compose and create.This book helps understanding some interesting algorithms that we use (or should be using) in real life. You will understand the basics about them. In case you're a programmer, it will probably generate a list of new topics to study. :)"

(I’m not technical or educated in mathematics, and if you are, then the following may not apply to you at all.) This book did a great job explaining technical concepts like sorting or caching, and showing how these are applied in complex algorithms — or in everyday life. Writing and storytelling wasn’t perhaps quite as gladwellesque as it could have been, but the content was very illuminating."
25,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4371602-alex,5,"TL;DR I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who starts (or continues) to study computer science. It provides an important connection or grounding, between somewhat dry science and real life and shows how our everyday actions and decisions are described or affected by core CS algorithms.I listened to it as an audiobook and I'd say that's the only book with the word ""algorithm"" in its title so far, that is perfectly suitable for the audiobook format. It doesn't have formulas or source code. It just talks about algorithms in Plain English, explains their history and their practical applications.However, it doesn't limits itself to just a few basic algorithms that you expect in any book (like merge sort or traveling salesman) - it talks about ""multiarm bandits"", ""Bloom filters"" and many other ""advanced"" topics. However, I can almost guarantee that if you like the audio version, you will consider buying an ebook or hard copy, so you can re-read it more thorough and make notes. It's that good and I'm definitely going to do it."

In the first few chapters, there were fantastic parallels to real-life problems that are synchronized with computer and mathematical problems. Beyond these first few chapters, however, I felt like the majority of the book was spent telling us about the computational problems, without doing as good of a job as referencing back to everyday life as was done previously. Because of this, the latter half of the book (before the conclusion) spends most of its time talking about computational problems, formulas, and the history of where certain issues and solutions came from. The distancing from real-life applications made it feel more like a textbook for would-be computer science majors than a glimpse into how we are just another algorithmic machine.As I said, it was a very good read, but it didn't do what it advertised quite as well as I wished it would."

For those who are interested in maths, there is only some intuitive descriptions of the algorithms without any concrete proof, and most CS or stats students learn them in depth in their first year anyway. The part about ""to live by"" is where the authors use their power of hindsight to discuss the obvious. The whole book can be condensed to less than 20 pages and still preserves the same amount of information. The only good thing I got from this book is that now I know audible.com refunds even finished books."

I will remember to use in my office and personal life the exponential backoff algorithm for sure. I will also use technique of relaxing difficult problems (the method is used as a modeling strategy in mathematical optimization). This one is cute too: some problems are so complex, they are simply intractable (i. e. no algorithms that can solve them elegantly exist and the only solution -- brute-force search).

30,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39637934-randomdots,4,"The beauty of this book is that it will keep you engaged. Brian has done really well to present some of the staple algorithms used in computer science.Griffiths uses various facets of algorithmic problem-solving like sorting, caching, and optimal stopping to convince the reader that step-by-step methods that seem very mechanical in nature are actually extremely useful (or at least “good enough”) for making decisions amid uncertainty. This is a really great dive into intelligent decision-making, and it gives plenty of actionable advice for attacking all sorts of real-life problems. And while the writing isn’t anything special (would you expect much different from a computer scientist) and the narratives slightly dry, the usefulness and uniqueness of the book certainly win out in the end."
31,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71241901-j,2,"I am surprised by all the positive reviews of this book. Basically the authors start each chapter with a snippet of ""history,"" one that is oversimplified and completely removed from its historical context (and basically used as as filler). Then they talk about a computer science concept and relate it to math, which is the true focus of the book--a random walk with the authors through computer science algorithms and ideas. To close the chapter they *try* to relate it to human problems (like deciding who to sit where at your wedding reception). Rinse and repeat ad nauseam. It comes across as a book that tries too hard to make itself relevant and appealing to a broader audience. A few of the algorithms and discussions are broad enough to give some insight into how you might rethink your decision making and save time. But the bulk of the book is filler, and it lacks organization that would allow you to skim it if there are sections you find less relevant to you. In other words, it is more of an extended essay or stream-of-consciousness style of writing rather than one that makes clear points, explains them, then returns for a summary before moving on to a new idea or chapter.My training is in the humanities, and professionally I would say it lacks depth of analysis and often forces a square-peg-into-the-round-hole in an attempt to make computer science relatable to human activity. It also assumes that you want to live your life primarily (if not solely) to produce as much as possible as quickly as possible like a good little capitalist cog (a worldview that is never discussed let alone challenged, it's just assumed to be truth). Ultimatmely the book provides very little insight into human behavior, and only 2 or 3 algorithms that provide an alternative decision making model for your life toolkit. The sad thing is computer science has a lot to offer besides decision making trees and minimizing time on task. I think the book could have been the bridge between disciplines and the general population (one of its goals) if they had consulted a few History or English majors along the way to help give it better expression and context. I would have loved to see recent research into neuroscience as it relates to learning, for example, included and contextualized with parallel structures and functions in computing."
32,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20845662-sarthak-pranit,5,"Possibly my favorite non-fiction read for this year......till now. Why?1. It's almost ruthlessly practical. Having been based on algorithms that exist in tech systems around us, you can almost see the pragmatic aspect of this book. 2. It asks the questions we ask ourselves on a very subconscious level, sometimes not even answering them. E.g - How should I balance the old and the new? What should be the minimum I do today to not work extra tomorrow? How to schedule wisely?3. It's entertaining. Unlike most books which have the term 'Algorithm' in their title, this is truly an interesting read where you keep learning something outrageously new every few pages. 4. It focuses on working with personal systems and not personal goals. I believe the value of this advice cannot be underestimated in this book.Yep. 5 reasons why. "
33,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"Algorithms to Live By is fascinating and delightful. The subject works surprisingly well as an audiobook, and co-author Brian Christian is an engaging narrator. People who reason logically are algorithmic thinkers, whether they are writing computer code or making everyday decisions. The authors move back and forth between those worlds very effectively. A discussion of computer caching, for example, brings out strong analogies with the workings of libraries, filing systems, and the human brain.Highly recommended!"

37,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19505655-ragnar,3,"The book is divided to 11 chapters, every single one is dedicated to one computer science specific algorithm, explaining how it works and could be applied in everyday life. Some of those algorithms were new to me, but some of them are actually in use already, just haven’t put two-and-two together. The most captivating were:Optimal Stopping - When to Stop Looking?In the case of time or other resource constraint, one should make a decision after 37% of total time or options have been exercised, after what one should choose the best from the lot or which is better than the average of analyzed.Secretary example p.14.Explore/Exploit - The Latest vs the GreatestQuote - And it’s actually rational to emphasize exploration - the new rather than the best, the exciting rather than safe, the random rather than the considered - for many of those choices, particularly earlier in life.Why? To gather experience, but here lies a paradox - the more you explore the subject the harder it gets to find new fulfilling experiences.Restaurants example - when living in one city, one should explore different eating out places, to find the favorites, when leaving the city - one should go to favorite places for one last time.Quote - ...the elderly have fewer social relationships by choice, because as people approach the end of their lives, they want to focus more on the connections that are the most meaningful.P.57A/B testing - we could do it better, so we could use the superior option quicker for wider audience. Solution - the Zelen procedure of adaptive trials, starts as one red ball and one blue ball in the hat, the subject is given randomly one ball, let’s say blue one, if the experiment is successful two blue balls are put back into the hat, if it fails you put one red and one blue ball back into the hat.Sorting - Making OrderSometimes mess is a more than just the easy choice, it’s the optimal choice. For example - sorting email is more time consuming than searching for email, same applies when organizing a bookshelf, as we sort with slow hands but search with quick eyes.Caching - Forget About ItFun fact - CDN-s content distribution networks, servers around the world that maintain copies of popular websites. Largest service provider is Akamai. How it works - Australian opening BBC web-page will hit on Australian server not the original British.Our memory works as a cache. Our brains are tuned to keep in mind precisely the things most likely to be needed. Quote - The disproportionate occasional lags in information retrieval are a reminder of just how much we benefit the rest of the time by having what we need at the front of our minds. So as you age, and begin to experience these sporadic latencies, take heart: the length of a delay is partly an indicator of the extent of your experience. The effort of retrieval is a testament to how much you know. And the rarity of those lags is a testament to how well you’ve arranged it: keeping the most important things closest to hand.Scheduling - First Things FirstTime management aka scheduling problem hasn’t been solved yet with one single algorithm, different approaches will work in different circumstances.Let’s take - Shortest Processing Time algorithm, it’s goal is to minimize the waiting times of the different tasks, meaning one should always do the quickest task first. For example - two tasks that take 1 day and 4 days of work-time, if you start with the last, then the summarized waiting time for the client would be 4+5 days, but in reverse order it would be just 1+4 days.To further enhance the algorithm would be to give importance weights to the tasks in addition to time variable, so one would get the most important and quickest things out of the way firstly.Every time you switch tasks, you pay a price, because switching tasks is not a real work, it’s a metawork. Every context switch is a wasted time. But one cannot get around it, there will always be metawork.Quote - ...anyone you interrupt more than a few times an hour is in danger of doing no work at all.Overfitting - When to Think LessQuote - If you don’t have clear read on how your work will be evaluated, and by whom, then it’s not worth the extra time to make it perfect with respect to your own (or anyone else’s) idiosyncratic guess at what perfection might be.Relaxation - Let it SlideOne does not have to do anything, one could let it slide, you just have to understand the consequences and decide whether you want to face those consequences or avoid them by doing the task.Quote - ...in a hierarchical organization anyone doing job proficiently will be rewarded with a promotion into a new job that may involve more complex/or different challenges. When the employee finally reaches a role in which they don’t perform well, their march up the ranks will stall, and they remain in that role for the rest of their career. Meaning eventually every spot in an organization will come to be filled by someone doing that job badly.Game TheoryEvernote CEO initiative to give 1000$ for going to vacation, misses the point as in organization employees are measuring themselves against each other, so they could better promotional prospects and therefore won’t go to vacation.The famous prisoner’s dilemma - it’s always better for you to defect than cooperate, regardless of what your accomplice decides. Here we come to paradox - for a set of players all acting rationally in their own interest, may not be the outcome that is actually best for those players. Meaning the strategy is not working.But if we bring in the ‘Godfather’ figure to prisoner’s dilemma - meaning we change the game, then we could apply new strategy.Quote - If changing strategies doesn’t help, you can try to change the game. And if that’s not possible, you can at least choose what games you are playing. Seek out games where honesty is the dominant strategy. Then just be yourself."

At its heart, ""Algorithms to Live By' is an exploration of the various fundamental algorithms out there with a practical perspective on how these apply to solve day to day problems. 'Algorithms to Live By' covers a wide gamut of domains. These range from apartment hunting to urban planning; from minimizing regret to philosphy. The book shows us how algorithms are useful in our daily lives. It also demonstrates the pervasiveness of these algorithms across all walks of life.Structure'Algorithms to Live By' has 11 chapters, each dealing with a unique set of problems. Every chapter starts off by introducing the problem . Then it delves into the history behind the theory and the theoretical solution. We then see the usage of the algorithm and its practical limitations. This is seamless.Every chapter is also self-contained in itself. We can choose the read the chapters in any order we like.Optimal Stopping Explore/ExploitSortingCachingSchedulingBayes's RuleOverfittingRelaxationRandomnessNetworkingGame TheoryRecommendationI found it hard to put down this book. Each chapter was engrossing. In fact, thinking about it, this book is like playing the game ""Civilization"". The reader always has the urge to read a little more ('One more turn' in Civilization). There were a couple of examples which made me wish that I had known about those in college. In fact, this book answers the question that most people have when they learn mathematics - 'how is this useful?"". There are great tips for us in our lives.'Algorithms to Live By' has a brilliant mix of the theory as well as the practical limitations of these algorithms. This book has the right proportion of humour too. If there is one nitpick that I have, it is that people who know the mathematics are more likely to love it.My recommendation - everybody should read this book."
39,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17165074-pooja-n-babu,4,"As the name says it, the book is a collection of all the real life instances where computer algorithms can be applied. It covers myriad of computer science topics like sorting, caching, scheduling, networking, optimal stopping, and a few mathematically biased ones like Bayes's rule, overfitting, game theory and the like.Every chapter starts with what the concept is as the computer scientists see it, explain the possible algorithms that are used, and go on to provide real-life examples where they are applied. It also gives tips on how to improve or, say, optimize for a better outcome. And, all these explanations are simple and can be read and understood by anyone not having a computer science background.Few of the instances that the book covers are:- when to stop looking/interviewing to hire an employee in a company- how do you order your wardrobe such that you spend less time looking for stuff from it- various sorting techniques that can be used in libraries where physical sorting of books cannot be avoided- use of randomness when no solution yields an optimal result- an optimal strategy for auctioning etcThe book can get as interesting as you might imagine, although some parts may also get complex and baffling. I felt some topics had information or facts more than necessary which led to confusing explanations. This might make one lose track of the concept art hand.Finally, the authors suggest to follow a principle of computational kindness - which creates a bridge between computer science and ethics - while making any decision. No algorithm might provide the best solution, it's always good to look for an optimal one. Incorporating computational kindness can also improve behaviour in terms of making any decision in groups. They claim that making assumptions, taking chances, biases towards simpler solutions are those that lead to rational decisions."

This book beautifully combines computer science, psychology, behavioral and applied economics, statistics and several other fields into one compelling and insightful book.It is rich in examples and doesn't bog the reader down with mathematical detail. I found it fascinating that simply using algorithms to make every day decisions will not only reduce your stress, it will genuinely make you a happier person and free up more time to do productive things. I really enjoyed the flow of the chapters. Talking about the problem, the solutions, the consequences, and the elaborate real-life examples. Additionally, it's great that you can freely jump around chapters and skip over what it's as interesting and re-read the stuff you're drawn to. My favorite chapters were the ones on Baye's Rule, Optimal Stopping, Explore/Exploit, and Game Theory.I think having this book as a text for a college class would be an incredibly fun course.To date, this is the most enjoyable book I've received as a Goodreads Giveaway. Thank you very much!"
41,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67628778-martynas-petkevi-ius,4,"Algorithms to Live By is a collection of various techniques from mathematics and computer science (e. g. caching, game theory, scheduling) with an attempt to apply them to everyday life. I wasn't convinced of the practicality of such approach though – the solutions to mathematical problems or the algorithms described in the book work only in very specific circumstances, given numerous assumptions. Most of the time, real life problems are much less clearly defined or have too many variables to be reasoned in a mathematical sense. Nonetheless, I've found the technical part of the book extremely interesting, covering a wide range of topics and lots of trivia.I must add that the book is well researched and you can find all the references at the end of it. However, the notes, which also supplement the text with more detail and provide some further reading recommendations, is a pain to read. There is no way to know which parts of text have a note about them. If you find notes interesting or useful, you basically need to read text and notes in parallel."

It was a very interesting read (and you might think - why, whyyyyyy does it get only three stars then, my love??????) but some of the topics didn't interest me at all. It was very hard to concentrate on them because they were described in a very technical manner, which I think should actually be displayed mathematically. And I think some bits required knowledge I don't have. Nevertheless, I liked quite a big chunk of this book and I gained a lot. You know how some people say that Marie Kondo changed their life (she changed mine too, not trying to be special, you know) - this book changed my life as well.It was written quite skillfully and had a lot of solid facts. I actually noticed that I could use some of those facts in my conversations with friends and pretend to be very educated, smart, and funny. :))) The only thing they could have done better is made me interested in topics I wasn't interested in."

It's a book about being efficient in a capitalist world, but the author never says so. In the end, the ethical views of the author are clear but he never expresses them, so you never know for sure who's talking and with what moral agenda. Moreover, the 'tips' for achieving a better live are too simplistic. If the author says that, for example, organizing your email is not worthwhile in terms of the time spent doing so, he never mentions that psychologically it may have benefits or, putting it more plainly, the reason people like to have things organized is not always about efficiency but most of the time is about having pleasure in control. Because most of the time the author never mentions the other side of the coin, this book falls short in giving any useful advice. "

As an IT professional, I found it a good refresher, the book provides valid content and meaningful real world examples. Although I appreciate the authors’ intent and effort to explain these methods outside the computer science community, I doubt the general public would be persuaded to adopt the formulas presented here in their day-to-day decision making. It’s the difference between knowing what it is logical/efficient and actually doing it. The writing style is also on the dry side, so I am not sure that the average reader would enjoy this book.As the saying goes, “the most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not ‘Eureka!’ but ‘That’s funny.’”"

In other words, my kind of nerdy. :)It's all very good and interesting, but the conclusion on computational kindness takes the cake. It is exceptional and would make a great intro to any class diving into related topics. A few other tidbits to jog my memory:- the Peter principle: rising to the level of incompetence- precedence constraints: ""if you're flammable and have legs, you are never blocking a fire exit."" - Hedberg- ""The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That;s funny.'""- the price of anarchy: the difference between a perfectly organized centralized system and letting things happen by chance.

If you followed the best possible process, then you've done all you can, and you shouldn't blame yourself if things didn't go your way. Outcomes make news headlines ... so it's easy to become fixated on them. But processes are what we have control over. ... We can hope to be fortunate - but we should strive to be wise."" p. 324 ""One of the implicit principles of computer science, as odd as it may sound, is that computation is bad: the underlying directive of any good algorithm is to minimize the labor of thought. When we interact with other people, we present them with computational problems - not just explicit requests and demands, but implicit challenges such as interpreting our intentions, our beliefs, and our preferences. ... We can be 'computationally kind' to others by framing issues in terms that make the underlying computational problem easier. This matters because many problems - especially social ones - are intrinsically and inextricably hard.""p. 325 ""The intuitive standard for rational decision-making is carefully considering all available options and taking the best one. At first glance, computers look like the paragons of this approach, grinding their way through complex computations for as long as it takes to get perfect answers. But that is an outdated picture of what computers do: it's a luxury afforded by an easy problem. ... Up against such hard cases, effective algorithms make assumptions, show a bias toard simpler solutions, trade off the costs of error against the costs of delay, and take chances. These aren't the concessions we make when we can't be rational. They're what being rational means."""
51,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14972518-vijai,4,"Erm...not sure how I feel about this book. The premise - problems faced by humans are no different from those faced by computers and here's how science helped solve those problems, let's learn from them, shall we? - is interesting.However, I am afraid if the authors had given into the sweet trap of confirmation bias. You see, much like computer science, there are other fields that could, say, like library science that could use its academic literature and give it a twist for us commoners to learn and emulate in our daily lives. Why science? Even a mechanic could take a few best practices from his day to day work and tell us how monogamy is very similar to servicing a 2005 Maruti Alto - vague & useless. Now, I am no academic and cannot critique some algorithm and statistics related theories in this book but I have spent a better part of the decade working in the IT sweatshops doing everything related to networking and trust me when I say this that TCP is a significant but still a cog in a much larger behemoth of a monstrosity that it is this networking. It's all interconnected and not. Depending on who you speak to. What is important to a developer is not to a network field tech and what is important to server admin is something a storage admin couldn't be bothered to be disturbed from his bathroom break for. TCP is sexy but UDP is useful for various other tasks. TCP/ IP is the way to go for some but FCP fanboys will tell you otherwise while the iFCP commandos laugh from a distance. To convince oneself about the absoluteness of anyone school of thought is dangerous is all I am saying.Still, 4 stars for the effort. Totally recommend it.

That is this book. Using simple relatable analogies, Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths explain important topics in computer science and propose some interesting conjectures about human behaviour. Decisions that seem irrational or lazy might actually be the optimal solution to an intractable problem under time and computational constraints.To some people including me, the beauty of mathematics is… obvious and self-explanatory. But to many others, it is a dry, challenging subject with little connection to daily life. It is hard to make math fun. That’s why the world needs more Brian Christians.What’s the optimal strategy of finding the best candidate in a pool of unknown quality? How does an objective yardstick change the strategy? How about the possibility of rejection or second chances? How do you pick a restaurant to minimise your regret? How can clinical trials minimise risk to patients?

How can an auction be designed to incentivise bidders to put in an honest bid?You might recognise the questions above are related to the Optimal Stopping Problem, the Exploitation vs Exploration dilemma, Sorting, Caching and Game Theory.

It was not until deep into the book (basically at the end of the book) that it set itself apart from other books by providing an exceptional description of Game Theory, Nash Equilibrium, and more importantly, Mechanism Design (Reverse Game Theory). Other than that tiny bit, this book was a bunch of recycled information that has been told better by other authors. I am trying to understand how this book received so many reviews, and so many good reviews at that.

Secondly it discusses a number of famous mathematical problems (i.e. the hiring of the secretary problem, the travelling salesman problem... ), what are their optimal solutions and in which everyday situations those approaches would be beneficial. It also suggests how to approach optimization problems for which there is no straightforward computational solution (brute force approach would take unrealistically much time or computing resource) and what methods to use to find a good enough answer with much less effort. Final third focuses mainly on game theory from different aspects (the classic prisoner's dilemma, tragedy of commons, information cascade, Vickrey auction which can also be found from several other books on game theory. The book also builds a lot on cognitive fallacies (read: ""thinking fast and slow"").A random selection of the ideas:*Optimal stopping (observing for 37.5%)*Over-fitting (you get what you measure)*Penalizing complexity in to simplify solutions . Occam's Razor Principle*Avoiding cognitive fallacies in investing (conservative bias in favor of history can buffer against boom and bust cycle of fads)*Lagrangian relaxation - ""you don't have to obey the law. There are consequences to everything and you get to decide whether you want to face those.""*Random sampling - Miller Rabin Primality Test*Simulated Annealing - Random restart hill climbing (i.e. finding cheapest flight path for world travel).“Don’t always consider all your options. Don’t necessarily go for the outcome that seems best every time. Make a mess on occasion. Travel light. Let things wait. Trust your instincts and don’t think too long. Relax. Toss a coin. Forgive, but don’t forget. To thine own self be true.”“Even the best strategy sometimes yields bad results—which is why computer scientists take care to distinguish between “process” and “outcome.” If you followed the best possible process, then you’ve done all you can, and you shouldn’t blame yourself if things didn’t go your way.” “If changing strategies doesn’t help, you can try to change the game. And if that’s not possible, you can at least exercise some control about which games you choose to play. The road to hell is paved with intractable recursions, bad equilibria, and information cascades. Seek out games where honesty is the dominant strategy. Then just be yourself.” “No choice recurs. We may get similar choices again, but never that exact one. Hesitation—inaction—is just as irrevocable as action. What the motorist, locked on the one-way road, is to space, we are to the fourth dimension: we truly pass this way but once.”“When Charles Darwin was trying to decide whether he should propose to his cousin Emma Wedgwood, he got out a pencil and paper and weighed every possible consequence. In favor of marriage he listed children, companionship, and the 'charms of music and female chit-chat.' Against marriage he listed the 'terrible loss of time,' lack of freedom to go where he wished, the burden of visiting relatives, the expense and anxiety provoked by children, the concern that 'perhaps my wife won't like London,' and having less money to spend on books. Weighing one column against the other produced a narrow margin of victory, and at the bottom Darwin scrawled, 'Marry—Marry—Marry Q.E.D.' Quod erat demonstrandum, the mathematical sign-off that Darwin himself restated in English: 'It being proved necessary to Marry.” “It’s fairly intuitive that never exploring is no way to live. But it’s also worth mentioning that never exploiting can be every bit as bad. In the computer science definition, exploitation actually comes to characterize many of what we consider to be life’s best moments. A family gathering together on the holidays is exploitation. So is a bookworm settling into a reading chair with a hot cup of coffee and a beloved favorite, or a band playing their greatest hits to a crowd of adoring fans, or a couple that has stood the test of time dancing to “their song.” “So explore when you will have time to use the resulting knowledge, exploit when you’re ready to cash in. The interval makes the strategy.” “Sorting something that you will never search is a complete waste; searching something you never sorted is merely inefficient.” “We say “brain fart” when we should really say “cache miss.” “The greater the uncertainty, the bigger the gap between what you can measure and what matters, the more you should watch out for overfitting - that is, the more you should prefer simplicity” “Learning self-control is important, but it’s equally important to grow up in an environment where adults are consistently present and trustworthy.” (next level beyond the marshmallow test).

61,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12690693-jim-goodrich,5,"I have been writing code for a living for a long time and one of the most enjoyable experiences I get to have in my profession is approaching a new problem with a clean slate and then coming up with the best solution I can devise. This process is both a creative outlet and an intellectually stimulating exercise. I love coming up with different designs and weighing their merits, then once I've honed in on one in particular, trying to fine tune and optimize it. It's a great feeling when, after wading through some complex alternatives, you suddenly come up with something delightfully simple and elegant. When working on a larger project, often there will be some aspect that is particularly tricky and difficult to find an efficient solution to. Sometimes I'll brain storm through these issues at the white board with my coworkers. This whole process is really fulfilling, second only to the joy of seeing the finished result in action for the first time. I mention all this because reading this book is like taking a trip through the history of some of the classic thorny issues encountered in computer science. The discussions of these issues and the evolution of their solutions, along with the development of the algorithms used to deal with intractable problems, was like music to my ears (I listened to the audio book). The authors then take these algorithms and see how they can be applied to everyday life. For example, applying the LRU (least recently used) caching algorithm to your filing drawer entails that anytime you take out a folder, you simply replace it back as the left most folder. Any time you search for a folder, you start at the left and search towards the right. This works because, in general, the likelihood of your needing a given folder is higher for folders you've recently used. That's just a simple example, and probably not one I'd actually implement in my own life, but it's still interesting. This book is filled with discussions of lots of things like this. Topics range from sorting techniques to optimal stopping problems, the classic traveling salesman problem, packet switching vs. circuit switching networks, multi-armed bandits and much more. If thinking about algorithms is your cup of tea, then you'll dig this book."

Saying that, (despite the title of the book) it's more maths based than anything else.It deals with some interesting ideas, and genuinely raises great discussion topics to think on. For example, the sorting vs. searching dilemma, the dangers of over-fitting (a personal highlight), and balancing exploring with exploiting (e.g. go to a new spot for lunch, or buy the meal you know you like from the regular place).The only issue with all this is that, whilst the core content is certainly thought provoking and something that can shape the way you work on a day-to-day basis, the books sluggish pace means it just isn’t engaging or all that entertaining. For me, this is made worse by the audio-book narration, and the dry delivery it offers. Anecdotes, jokes, facts, figures, and opinions, all blend into one long lecture, rather than being engaging and (at least a tiny bit) energetic.I feel like my enjoyment of Algorithms to Live By would’ve increased had I read this, rather than listened to it.

64,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13656797-rosario-http-rosario-blogspot-com,5,"Algorithms are basically a set of rules that tell you how you can solve a type of problem. We're most familiar with their use in computer science, and the intriguing idea behind this book is to look at how algorithms are used in that area and see if they can be used to solve similar kinds of problems in everyday life.I always say that I became an economist not because I was particularly interested in the topic, but because I discovered that the economics logic (such as optimisation, cost-benefit analysis) chimed really well with the way my mind already worked and the way I tended to make decisions even about private matters. So the topic of this book was extremely attractive to me.The best way to explain what the book is like is probably to give you an example. So, one of the first issues they look at is the problem of optimal stopping. Say you are looking for an X, and there are many candidates available for you to choose. You want to choose as good an X as possible. You know what a good X looks like, but you have no idea what level of quality you might expect from the field of candidates available to you. They might all be excellent X, or there might be 1 or 2 that are ok, and all the rest crap. Furthermore, you have to examine each potential candidate before you know their quality -that is, you can't deduce what they'll be like beforehand. So all you can do is choose candidates in random order and examine them to see how good an X they might be. In the purest version of the problem, you have to decide right after you've seen each candidate whether you'll chose it or not, and if you decide to keep on examining further candidates, you can't go back to the one you've rejected. So there clearly is a conflict here between needing to see enough candidates to have an idea of the quality of the field (and whether it's worth holding out for an outstanding candidate or just settling for an ok one) and needing to nab a good candidate before it becomes unavailable to you. If you choose too soon, you miss out on a potentially excellent candidate. If you keep examining more and more, you run the risk that you'll have to end up settling for a mediocre one, just because it's the only one left.This is a classic problem which is often called the Secretary Problem. As in hiring secretaries (can you tell this issue was originally popularised in the 1950s?). And the problem actually has a mathematical solution. It can be proved that the best strategy is to examine the first 37% of the available candidates without making a choice (even if you find one that seems to you to be the perfect secretary). Once that is done, you continue examining candidates until you find one that is better than the ones you've seen. As soon as you do, you hire them.Not a wholly realistic situation, of course, but close enough to one I found myself facing when moving to Helsinki. I needed to find somewhere to live. Completely new city and country, so I had very little idea of what the field of available flats was like. Yes, I did have some indication of quality from the online listings, but it's surprising how deceptive those photos can be. And of course, flats didn't magically become unavailable as soon as I'd visited them if I didn't decide straight away, but the good ones do have a tendency to be snapped up really quickly by someone else if you dawdle!So I decided to apply the algorithm in my search. There wasn't a limited field of candidates, but the book suggested that the 37% figure can be applied either to the number of candidates or to the time available to search. Bingo. I had booked myself a studio flat on airbnb for the first month, with an aspiration to move into a new place on March 1st. So that gave me 11 days to just look, holding back from making any decisions, after which I'd either go for the best I had seen if it was still available (bending the rules slightly), or for the first one I found that was better than the ones I'd seen. So I did just that. It was hard. The first flat I saw, only on day 2 of the search, I really liked. Good location, excellent layout, bright, with high ceilings, and just within my price range. But I held my nerve, even while I didn't really find anything that great for a while. Even when I saw that nice flat from cay 2 disappear from the online listings, clearly taken by someone else. After day 11, I went on decision mode, and still nothing. Until on day 19, I found the right place and went for it straight away, with zero doubts. My 'wait and see' period had given me the assurance that I knew what the field was like, and so I could be confident that I was making a good choice and that there was little chance that I was missing out on something better. I moved in on March 1st, and I love the place.Anyway, this is just one chapter of the book. There are quite a few more, and pretty much all of them were just as fascinating and illuminating. In many cases, the point was no so much the algorithm that solved the problem, but the setting out of the problem itself. I kept going ""huh, I never thought of that in quite that way!"". Although not all chapters were as useful to me in a practical sense as the one on optimal stopping, several of them made me look at things in a different way. In some cases they made sense of something I was intuitively doing, in others they made me adjust my behaviour (when I went back to visit friends in Liverpool a couple of weeks ago I decided to go to my favourite restaurants there, rather than to try the intriguing-sounding new place, based on the chapter on explore/exploit decisions). The authors have an excellent, accessible way of explaining quite complex topics, and their extrapolations from the abstract into everyday life situations made sense. Yes, some do work better than others and are more intuitively applicable, but on the whole, they really worked.I loved this book. I'd recommend it to anyone, even if you don't have an interest or background in computer science or maths. MY GRADE: An A-."

Everybody knows bubble sort, even Obama knows bubble sort...oh yeah they just said that. Pffft! I already know that algorithm....seriously! doesn't everyone know that? And then I calmed my nerdness down. Sure I knew all(most) of these algorithms and applied them to 1s and 0s every day but the beauty of the book is in seeing them in the real world. The authors really did do a good job of showing how our society of high level ants are constrained by the efficiency of the algorithm. Now of course when I am waiting in line at Starbucks, I can start thinking that it is a good think we aren't all ordering at once or we will get a buffer overflow or I can mutter about least recently used when I look at all the heavily processed, unspoilable food in my fridge and possibly, just possibly someone will join me in my geekdom."
66,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8331026-antti-v-rt,4,"A book about computer science, using examples familiar to most of us: how to choose when to sell your house, how to order your kitchen cabinets, etc.From another angle, this is a self-help book using proofs from mathematics and computer science to help people with different aspects of their life.Either way, Algorithms to Live By was pretty good. It taught me some key concepts of computer science, such as Big-O notation and intractability. The self-help aspect was pretty good as well, although I'm old enough to have learned the hard way pretty much everything this book tries to teach. The most interesting topics are in the first chapters: how long to look before you leap, how much time to spend looking for new things vs. enjoying the familiar things, how to manage your schedule. Since the writers use insights from CS to formulate their advice, it is presented differently from other self-help books - and thus more interesting and impressionable to young geeks. This would've been a useful book when I was 20 or so."
67,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71117759-murilo-queiroz,5,"I didn't think I would like this book, because I was already very familiar with almost algorithms and concepts mentioned in it (the only exception is the Vickrey auction) - I've been programming computers since I was 9, and have a Computer Science degree and a Masters on machine learning. But I was quite wrong: the books is very entertaining, easy to read but not condescending, and works both as a quick introduction to many important CS concepts and as a collection of tips and ideas very useful in everyday life. But I wonder if I like this book so much because I was already familiar with the ideas in it - I don't know if readers without some background knowledge would find it as interesting as I did... "
68,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54678769-chris-choy,5,"As a student in the interdisciplinary area of AI and CS, I find this to be very delightful to read as well as insightful. The book covers basic or some of obscure algorithms and applies them to real world problems. Although, I knew many of the algorithms and implemented for my work, I never thought about applying them to my daily problems. We, as a human, evolutionary adapted to many of the non-trivial problems that have no optimal solution, solving those problems in an abstract format definitely gives more insight that can be applied to a lot of fields and this is exactly what the author did. I highly recommend it to everyone who are familiar or even not familiar to CS."
69,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28220038-krzysztof-leszczy-ski,4,"I really enjoyed this one. If you’re into statistics or computer science, you’ll find out how a lot of already known to you algorithms, are used in real life. Few of them were so insightful that I was profoundly upset that I’m not using them yet in my life.I listened to this book in an audiobook version and while the performance of the author was great, I think this will be better enjoyed in a text version. I found myself wanting to go back to certain numbers or concepts many times throughout the book.Great read, solid recommendation."
70,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67018549-sumit-kumar,5,"This book is about how we use (or rather we should use) algorithms in our day-to-day life. It tries to draw parallel between classical computer science problems and human life. There are quite a few interesting results from academia that can be applied to common tasks like finding parking, scheduling jobs, being efficient at work, etc. This books is full of some really great lines like: ""Value of a stock is not what people think it's worth but what people think people think it's worth""."

The major element that they highlighted that I found important was how often we don't evaluate what assumptions we make when making decisions. That has to be explicit with computers, and I felt the authors highlighted how that can be beneficial for us making real decisions as well."
72,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14826533-andreea-lucau,4,"I would call this book 'Algorithms for non-IT PEOPLE'. The book has dedicated chapters for several types of algorithms, like sorting, selection, networking. For each one it explains the most important algorithms and how they were developer. There are very few references on how they related to the day to day life - and this was the part I was looking forward to the most."

77,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57340357-roger-grobler,5,One of the best books I’ve “read” this year (listened to the audio book). The algorithms from computer science applied to human decision making are highly appealing and I find myself seeing examples each day. From the buffer bloat in my email inbox to exploiting vs exploring when choosing a restaurant. Highly recommended. 
78,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58890815-andrii-zakharov,5,"When I first heard of this book, I thought it would be computer scientists going ""hey, here are a bunch of algorithms we developed and you can use them at home with your brain!"" - basically fishing for everyday problems those algorithms could be a fit for. Well, in fact, it's the opposite of that. The book is all about taking common real-world problems and showing how they show up in many domains, with computer science sometimes managing to provide an optimal solution, and other times getting at its limits. It's very well-written, witty, and genuinely useful - a delightful read for anyone interested in decision-making, problem-solving, and optimization in general. "
79,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51660475-emily,5,"I LOVED this. It might not be for everyone, but if you're intrigued by how computers do things and would like to look at your own decision making in a different way, you must must read it. I frequently gasped out loud and yelled ""WOW"" while reading it. I will be rereading it for sure. "
80,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78032391-timothy-deng,3,"As someone who studies computer science, it was fascinating to see how the algorithms I have learned could be applied to real life situations: using explore/exploit to choose which restaurant you go to, LRU to keep track of your files, and optimal stopping to find an apartment (something I might be trying in the coming months). Perhaps I am not the audience for the book, but I was disappointed by lack of deeper explanations into the math (I was hoping for an intuitive explanation on upper confidence intervals). I don’t think that’s it though—I enjoyed the final chapters on game theory and the conclusion on computational kindness. I think I was let down because of my high expectations after reading Brian Christian’s excellent “The Most Human Human.” I suspect someone less familiar with the algorithms discussed in the book will find it invaluable in expanding their worldview on their usefulness in their lives."
81,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11041240-zarathustra-goertzel,5,"Marvelous book. I particularly recommend this book for STEM-minded folk. Algorithms to Live By connects mathematical theory with real-world problems from most wakes of life. Where does Computer Science provide answers to questions we debate daily? And where does Computer Science say ""that's a hard problem, yo"" (bad big-O -- or undecidable)?The Conclusion is aptly titled ""Computational Kindness"": Brian challenges the reader to, using their newfound knowledge, frame things for others as simple problems. The simple example is: ""Where would you like to eat?"" vs ""Would you like to eat at Thai or Italian?"" One requires the queried to recall all feasible restaurants and then to do many comparisons in response to the current mood. The latter requires one comparison. Sure, decisive people already have efficient mental data-structures for choosing restaurants easily, but the complexity of the former is at least O(n) versus the constant time O(1) of the latter. The book starts with Optimal Stopping: when to stop looking for something. Seems the math has been fairly worked out. There are clear guidelines, even in nuanced cases more mirroring human reality. The punchline: humans seem to do pretty decently already. What about Explore vs Exploit? Humans do all-right. Upper-confidence bound methods imply some degree of optimism?Sorting is fun. The chapter implies that humans often oversort things: retrieval time is not so high anyway. The book touches caching, scheduling, bayes rule, overfitting, relaxation (of problems), randomness, networking, and game theory. We see what TCP based networking has in common with human networking, how to make problems easier, what to keep close. The combination of chapters on scheduling and scheduling hits home hard :'(. Scheduling is one of those areas where some basic heuristic strategies perform pretty well, yet getting things just right is quite hard (have fun solving your mini traveling salesmen problems all day long ;'D). Especially when various real-world constraints are thrown into the picture. I'm guilty of often spending at least as much time on planning and scheduling throughout the day as I save thanks to my superior plans. Ok, sometimes it pays off. Other times I spend 5 minutes finding the exact moment to go and risk rushing a bit to be just on time: when the worst case scenario is 5 minutes spent waiting for the metro. Weeeelp. Average case wait time is even better. The game theory chapter is interesting. It's a case where the problem can be undecidable, such as finding the Nash equilibrium. However there are cases like ""taking vacation days"" or ""not working on Sunday"" where the equilibrium is known, yet the current socioeconomic mechanism has a bad equilibrium: no days off. Boo-hoo-hoo. So how does one play games with win-win equilibria rather than lose-lose equilibria?One way is to follow the design of second-price auctions where the dominant strategy is to bid honestly (just gotta solve that 'what's my honest price valuation' problem, erhem). Another is presented by the solution to the Prisoner's Dilemma. It has a well-known lose-lose equilibrium. BUT If God(father) the don says he'll kill anyone who snitches, the equilibrium becomes win-win-win (you, your bro, and the don). Hail religion! Hail government! Hail the mob. A lot of game-theory problems are hard because one needs to recursively second-guess (triple-guess, quadruple-guess, ...) one's opponent up to higher levels. At least one level higher and you can play better. Combining this idea with computational kindness: one arrives at being consistently and transparently honest. Many win-win outcomes rely on cooperation. By being consistently honest and preferring to cooperate and aim for win-win outcomes, you enable anyone else in your groups to rely on you. w00t. The likelihood of a winning situation rises. Basically ""be the change"" :PIs this why we like predictable people? (Except for the fact they're boring.)... M'kay, that's enough. Great book that has changed how I see the world. "

Not only is a lot of knowledge put together in a very very digestible style, the manner of writing is one of the best I've encountered. One could argue that characters are not well fleshed and they are just there as isolated incidents who happen to take the narrative forward. My argument is that is exactly the point. I must admit that I've already enjoyed computer science and the mechanics of thinking to quite a degree already. So it is likely that this book presented a specifically heady mix for me compelling me to enjoy itself.  I am going to re read this one several times."

85,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36657293-jaikish-nunna,3,"The caption The Computer Science of Human Decisions describes the book better than the misleading Algorithms to Live By. Would've give 4 stars- translates to 'really liked it' - if there was a strong disclaimer that it is a collection of observations from multiple perspectives but not a set of advices. I learned a few things from bits and pieces across the book and I disagree with the style or confidence used to explain some of the concepts(Copernican principle, Optimal Stopping... ). Especially after reading books like Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking and others alike which bash the absence of disclaimers in research, the two lost stars in my review are influenced by them. But, I might have overfitted my conscience(according to one of the chapters) and am not able to appreciate application of large scale algorithms to small data(another chapter). Saying that, some contrasts drawn between philosophies and algorithms makes it an entertaining book for both Computer Science and non-CS people. It also adds a bucket of examples for us technical people to help talk to non technical ones about the work we do. The read also created some interest in me to revisit Computer Science fundamentals which I ignored when I had a chance to learn. I plan to re-read this book and put some time to revisit those topics."
86,1627790365,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6429894-jayson-virissimo,5,"This isn't the cutesy algorithms applied to oversimplified representations of trivial social problems book I was anticipating. The problems are weighty, and when the formal version of the problems that are considered by computer scientists don't map in important ways to the real problems for which they are supposed to be analogous, they authors admit so and give some helpful suggestions about how the 'optimal solution' might not be optimal after all.The algorithms are described at a very high level, as you'd expect, but the gist of them is communicated effectively (although, as a computer programmer, I'm just guessing how much of this is their skill at communicating and me filling in gaps with my own prior knowledge).In many ways, this book is a counter-point to Thinking: Fast and Slow (another of my recent favorites), and to a certain extent a much more optimistic assessment of humans minds than that work. But in the ways that it is more optimistic, it is also more realistic. Rather than comparing humans in artificial, one-shot situations, to normative decision-theoretic solutions arrived at by academics over the course of years, this work compares them to computers which have their own limitations of memory, computational speed, and imperfect access to relevant data. These comparisons are not only more fair, they are also more practical.Anyway, if you are in any way interesting in the intersection between computer and cognitive science, you'll probably enjoy this book."

My algorithm of curiosity kicked in directly, and I was into this book immediately. There are many concepts in the book I am very well aware of already from the similar readings. Prisoners dilemma, the marshmallows test, the secretary rule, game theory, etc. -- you are going to find much of this kind stuff in the book. However, the authors came up with another perspective about many of those well-know concepts, and how they come into being in the algorithmic word. This perspective is really interesting.The book has a good structure. Sometimes the examples for proving a point are a bit jumpy and overloaded. However I really liked many passages in the book, some of them got me thinking really deep. When this happens I really appreciate it, because the more we read, the more diminishing this feature becomes.When I read this kind of book and think about how to rate it, I always struggle with the dilemma of not knowing what others already know. It might well be a five-star hit for many readers. Among other interesting findings, I learned an important lesson about rationality and how this comes into being in the algorithmic world."
