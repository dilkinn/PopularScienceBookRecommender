0,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6163905-knig,5,"Stop Press: this should be compulsory reading for anyone…with a pulse, really. I can’t think of a single person who should be excused from the reading rota here. This is the MOST appalling, horrific, mind-numbing expose on the current state of medicine I had never hoped to see, or know, or be a part of. Ever.You ever go to the doctor? You a doctor? No? Maybe you expect the doctor, as the specialist, to be able to diagnose and treat you accordingly. I know I do: I go in with my ailments and I like to come out with prescriptions, even better, prescriptions that work. But what exactly is going on behind the scenes? And how do I even begin? Your doctor has no accurate knowledge AT ALL of any drugs coming into the market, especially any that come on after he’s left medical school. You might as well prescribe your own medicines: you might even have a better success rate, based on probability theory!The reasons he has no real accurate knowledge are many, but here are the best: drug companies, when applying for a patent, or submitting articles to a medical journal, have to perform medical trials in order to ascertain the efficacy of the drugs. However, they are not required to submit the results of ALL the trials they undertake. Basically, a pharma company can submit ANY result it chooses. So, if 7 out of 10 trials show adverse effects, one shows neutral and two show a slight positive effect (how these anomalies happen is another matter, but by manipulating the type of trial patients you get anomalies in readings), the drug company then submits only the two ‘rigged’ positives, and hey presto, we’re in business. What are the regulators doing in all of this? Nothing, they are on the side of the pharmacological industry. More on that later. A new product is licensed. So, how good is it? Well, no one knows because, you see, drugs are not tested against best in breed, but against placebo, or, in other words, the litmus test is is this drug better than nothing at all? So fine, it might be better than nothing at all, but how does it compare against other drugs on the market for the same condition? No one knows. It might actually be worse than every other drug on the market, but no one, not even the doctors know. It might not even be better than nothing at all, even be killing people, literally, but no one knows: because trial data is withheld (legitimately!). (Remember the seven adverse trials that were swept under the carpet?)has this happened before? Sure, Goldacre gives several examples. Paroxetine prescribed off label for children, and antiarithmic drugs amongst others. So what exactly does the doctor know? Whatever the pharma company reps decide to tell him. Its as simple as that. How accurate are the reps? Well, I feel physically sick just thinking about it. The chapter is very explicit. Not very.Where are the regulators in all of this? Secretive and collusive. Various reasons are proffered for this: the regulators themselves quote the MMR debacle and how the public can’t be trusted with the information (unfortunately this seems to include doctors as well!). Goldacre speaks of ‘regulation capture’, or the ‘Stockholm’ syndrome as the rest of us may know it. Honestly I can go on forever, but the bottom line is this: I’m just surprised we’re not all dead, really. I might have to re-write this review later, I’m jibbering just now, but first I may want to join an action group. Or something. "
1,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1923147-scott,1,"Currently reading this but not so sure how much more I can take. There is some decent information here. The title is absolutely true. Drug companies are businesses and multibillion dollar corporations are not ethical paragons. They do not publish studies that make their drug look bad or even ""as good as."" There are sponsored journals that are sponsor biased. Sometimes legit journals want the most interesting ""this changes everything"" articles rather than another ""dog bites man"" article to boost readership. That's the media. The problem with this book is that it is a combination of fact, hyperbole, and omission, not unlike the drug companies themselves. Every other page is ""HOW MANY PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED"" or ""if this makes you as angry as it does me and I'm sure it does, my buddy"" (he says that in some manner several times a chapter) that it becomes irritating, pandering, and insulting to any self-respecting critical thinker. Why such overuse of superlatives when simply presenting and explaining the data should be convincing enough. The omissions are that most if not all physicians heavily distrust any pharmaceutical-sponsored or presented paper. Research that is used as evidence-based treatment is peer-reviewed by other researchers and physicians and statisticians for any possible flaws or oversights in conclusions. There are few things physicians enjoy more than disproving other physicians when it comes to the Truth, as far as science and data are concerned. It's practically the second commandment. Most docs are well versed and tested in statistics. They look at sample size (1000s of people in your study is better than you and grandma), sample location (cultural lifestyles are not alike), as well as outside interests or sponsorships and the number-crunching itself. From this book, it would seem that ONLY drug companies publish research on drugs because it is PROFITABLE otherwise why do research. Any self-respecting researcher or physician can answer that question - because we want to find the BEST treatment for a patient regardless of which drug company it hurts. FUCK the drug companies and all the stat-fudgers and quacks.It's far from a perfect system. There are always charlatans and opportunists when money is involved. The system does indeed need to change, I just wonder if it can with so many hands in the pot. But for this author to give the constant impression that EVERY drug is a scam, EVERY paper out there is bought and paid for, is disingenuous at best, and the exact charlatanry the author purports to expose at worst, and he's making quite the profit himself. I honestly want to like this book more. I want the facts sifted from the subjective miasma in its pages, so I can tell my patients the facts and not just ""read Ben Goldacre's book.""By the way, I have no outside sponsorships to any pharmaceutical companies but I do appreciate the fact that stores like Walgreens, CVS, Kroger, Walmart and others have $4 drug lists to help my patients afford their pills sometimes. "
2,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I read Goldacre's book Bad Science very recently, and I enjoyed it so much that I decided to not go for my usual buffer period between very similar books and just jump right into Bad Pharma. And they are very similar books, though this one is actually longer, for all that it is more specialized in one area of badness. There was a lot of overlap between the two, which is to be expected, I guess, because Goldacre IS a doctor, and lives in this world. I didn't really mind the rehash though, because it gave me a second chance to think about it and absorb the info. I listened to both of these books on audio, and this almost felt like a continuation of the first book, especially because the reader was the same for both. One thing that I did appreciate was, during his section on bad trials, he mentioned outright fraud, one area where I felt was overlooked in Bad Science. It's a brief mention, but it is its own section, as it should be. Because fraud is everywhere, and even in peer-reviewed science, and systematically reviewed science, it still happens. I also liked how this book got into some of the non-science badness of the pharmacological industry - advertising and politics and bribery and ultimatums and the like. What I was surprised about though, was that all of this affected the UK, which I (stupidly, I guess) thought wouldn't have that issue because of their National Health Service. We don't have government run healthcare here in the US (and no, the Affordable Care Act doesn't count) and there's so much bullshit surrounding this industry that it boggles the mind. (I'm still waiting on those Death Panels though. I have a few suggestions for useless people who could go on the list.)Anyway, I'm not trying to go into a political ramblerant here because I am the first one to admit that I don't know nearly enough about it. I just brought that up because I thought that America, with its allowing advertising and its lack of enforced regulations would be the exception, but it seems like this shit goes on all over. Which... makes me feel better? No. Not really. There go my plans of moving to Europe if I get sick. Or if certain other nightmare events come to pass next year. So. I can't say that this is a very light-hearted set of books, but I think that they are absolutely worth reading. I like that Goldacre provides some ways that things could be improved, though it seems very unlikely that any of his recommendations would actually be put into place, because then that would mean that some people would lose a whole lot of money, and that's just not how this shit works. Disappointing, but hey... what isn't these days? "
3,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1251066-andy,3,"I appreciate how Ben Goldacre is trying to open the eyes of the people to many of the issues relating to science reporting. I check his blog every now and then, but this is the first time I've read his books. As background, I'm a GP in NZ, British by birth and training, closer to the start of my career than the end and I don't see drug reps or attend drug sponsored CME (consciously at least; sometimes it can be difficult to tell). I'm also fairly clued up on the issues he presents here so in someways it was preaching to the converted. He makes many good points and exposes the day to day manipulative and deceitful practices of the drug companies and particularly highlights just how hard it is to be a doctor and make truly informed decisions. Something that worries myself and most of my colleagues on a day to day basis - am I doing the right thing? I would imagine this book could be quite worrying for the general population and the medicated. For anyone who takes a medicine, this should be required reading.His style though, after a while, becomes a little much. His passion runs through and starts to take over which distracts from his intent. I felt the early chapters were more straightforward in laying out the facts and more crucially why these facts are important. The later chapters felt like he was just labouring the point and I found my attention starting to wane. Still, despite these issues it's still a worthwhile read.I think every med/nursing/pharmacy/name your healthcare specialty student should read this during the early stages of their training, firstly to open their eyes, to see what they're going to be up against, but also to promote a fight for change, as Ben so admirably and clearly sets out. An important book, if nothing else it should open your eyes and set you on the path to learn more.Oh, as an aside, the book is lovingly designed like a pill packet, Braille and everything. Annoyingly though the title on the spine is upside down, in the French manner. Now, I know I can (and indeed have) turned the book upside down to make it fit in, and sure, no-one else is going to know unless they pull it off the shelves to look, but I will know. Every time I see it I'll know. That bugs me. That probably says a lot about me as well."
4,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"Goldacre has a way of making complex science subjects accessible to the wider public. His first book, Bad Science, highlighted the way that the media dealt with reporting science, and in this book he concentrates his ire onto the $600 billion global pharmacy industry, now dominated by a handful of behemoths.And what he reveals is frankly terrifying. He details the way that the industry hides a large majority of the trial data, the way that the legislation requiring data to be published is ignored by companies, and in the EU it is still secret in some cases. There is loads of detail on the way that the data is cherry picked to demonstrate that a particular drug is so much better than the competition. There is lots of detail on the appalling way that the industry is regulated, even though it is very heavily regulated, most of it is ineffective and not enforced, and where the regulation could be improved to help patients and save lives these are not enforced or are not enacted on after lobbying from the industry.The biggest chapter though is on the marketing that these companies employ. Their budgets for marketing are normally twice the R&D budgets, which gives you some idea of where their priorities lie. He explains how they sponsor various ‘conferences’ and provided sweeteners to medical professionals at all levels, from lunches to flights to what most people would consider bribes. The nefarious dealings of the drugs rep are dealt with too, from the pressure that they put onto doctors to use their medicines and the way that they collect data directly from surgeries and pharmacies. A lot of academic papers are ghost written, and a leading figure puts their name to it, shocking really.There is some details on NICE, but not a huge amount. He looks at the way that they select the drugs for use in treatment, noting that even they do not have access to all the trail data for each medicine that they consider.He also writes about how a lot of the drug companies fund patient groups either overtly with cash donations or covertly by funding particular conferences and so on. They have been proven to use them to exert pressure on national agencies (FDA and NICE) to supply the latest drugs regardless of the cost; i.e. £50K spent with a group means that they get their £21k per patient drug treatment approved, even though the trial evidence is not there or is at best not proven to be any more effective than the current items on the market. A real scandal.Throughout the book he does give suggestions on how the situation can be improved but he does realise that they is an endemic problem and powerful vested interests do hold sway. Even just enforcing the current rules would make a difference, but it seems unlikely at the moment.The phrase for illegal drugs used to be: Just Say No. Perhaps it should apply to legal drugs too..."

This Affects You
I'm glad I stopped and read the short (no less impactful) essay The Corporation by Joel Bakan midway through this book, it definitely helped in coping with the subject. I feel like Ben Goldacre has simply stumbled across a more specific problem in a larger mess our world faces today. What the reader will have introduced to themselves during the 400+ pages of Bad Pharma, is a consistently horrifying expose of the corruption and bad practices that have taken place in a deregulated environment, fostered by corporations - within the pharmaceutical industry - over the last few decades. Goldacre writes in laymen terms, which I appreciated as someone who knows next to nothing about the industry, and provides plenty of background information to keep you in 'the know'. So there really is NO excuse not to read this (especially if you're from the USA and the UK) as it directly affects you and your loved ones. The bottom line really is the issue that Bakan raises in the above mentioned Corporation; in that there are certain areas of public life the simply SHOULN'T be monetarily driven. It's a big problem, and anyone with half a brain cell should know how corporations are practically infesting the political / public landscape of the USA (especially since Trumps Kleptocracy has come to power), so it's no surprise what's been seen here in Bad Pharma. People are seen as consumers and commodities, and therefore are in service to profit.My only criticism is how Goldcare seems to still believe in the system, and despite making such a heroic book, makes no mention of how certain governments utterly support these companies in getting away with it. He even goes as far as to mention at time how he doesn't want to get ""too political'. Perhaps I'm an old nihilist (I'm really in my mid twenties, I swear), but I don't believe corporations, who's incentive is profit, will change unless they're reigned in by government. Despite this, he's brought real change with the book, and the final section regarding what came after it was released (this is a fourth edition copy I read) brings some glimmer of hope.Maybe you'll decide for yourself. Either way, read this."
6,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5925863-bastian-greshake-tzovaras,5,"Okay, somehow Goodreads didn't save the last review I tried to write. So I'll try again: If I only had read this book a day earlier I could have flagged it as the most depressing read of 2012. It made me cry out loud and swear a lot (just ask my girlfriend who had to listen to it for the most time). Bad Pharma gives a great overview on how medicine is failing patients (aka each of us) all the time. Publication bias, missing access to raw data and all the other nuisances which might be familiar to you from other fields of science also apply to medicine. The only catch being: In medicine this lack of knowledge, often facilitated by lacking access to data, is killing people, virtually every day. We don't know how drugs compare to each other, serious side effects are not as well known as they should be, organisations which approve drugs feel it's their job to protect pharmaceutical companies and MDs get most (if not all) of their post-graduation training delivered from drug companies. Are you already feeling depressed? Goldacre does a great job of describing all those broken parts, even if you're not too familiar with the health system in the UK or the EU. And he makes clear: It's not that our medicine is controlled by mind-bending lizard-alien-conspiracies but that it's simply an effect of a system full of idiosyncrasies and normal people, with all their failures. His british humour often saves you from more serious depressions and he helpfully gives lots of ideas how the system could be fixed. "
7,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2621788-john,5,"This is an outstanding book and everyone should read it. It took me about 3 sittings to get through it as I found rage slowly building as I read it and had to get up and pace around the house a bit.The book systematically works through all the ways in which the practice of evidence based medicine is being distorted by the big pharmaceutical companies. It identifies all of the perverse incentives that make those distortions an unavoidable part of doing business, and then helpfully identifies ways to fix things.My only problem with the book is it gives ammunition to ""alternative medicine"" proponents, as it highlights a lot of problems with ""western medicine"". To that I say - evidence based medicine is still the best method we've got. This book highlights how big pharma can distort the way evidence based practice works, alternative medicine can't even muster enough evidence to sit at the table."
8,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35434974-kevin,5,"The flesh-and-bones of Big Pharma’s R&D and marketing... The Good:--While there may be some unsettling notions of Big Pharma, such feelings can easily be diverted to anti-vax and other media sensationalism given the liberal black-hole in critical analysis of political economy. Unlike his previous books that deal with broader topics like media manipulation (Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks, I Think You'll Find it's a Bit More Complicated Than That), in this book Goldacre picks through the flesh and bones of Big Pharma malpractice (or rather, practice for short-term shareholder profit).--Highlights:1) Missing data from publication bias: bad results? No problem, just don’t publish it. Who is going to stop you, when you’ve accumulated so much wealth (power) that you can lobby against actual enforcement of trial registers? But what about evidence-based medicine? Pffft, morality is for losers; there can only be one bottom line in business. 2) Bad trials: so how do you even get good results? Well, there are many tricks you can play before resorting to outright falsification:a) Compare with something useless, like a placebo, even though doctors are interested in how well your drug does against other drug options.b) If you compare with another drug, you can give that other drug in sub-optimal manners. c) Test on unrepresentative patients. Ignore dropouts. d) Stop your trial early once your results start looking good, or keep it going longer to wait for that (random) good news. e) Test for surrogate outcomes (ex. blood pressure) and extrapolate from that (ex. prevents heart attacks, saves lives). f) Switch the study’s primary outcome; subgroup cherry-picking.g) Heck, who needs good results? Just write a good conclusion in your study.3) Marketing = distorting information (and paying for it!): what a strange system, high drug prices are deemed necessary to cover costs, where marketing is a major cost (marketing/admin twice as much as R&D). So, we are paying a premium for Big Pharma to distort evidence-based decision-making in medicine! Besides marketing to patients, there is marketing to doctors via drug reps, medicalization of complex social issues, Pharma-directed continued education, seeding trials (“trials” just to get doctors using the drug), ghost-writing studies, etc. 4) Global: patent property rights preventing production of generic drugs for poor countries; priority of R&D on 1st world problems; how drugs are trialed on poor “volunteers”, and on poor countries with weak regulations.5) The potential for bigger, better trials using randomized trials integrated into clinical practice via health information technology to fulfill the potential of evidence-based medical decision-making, since large samples + long timescales are much superior to trials to rush a drug onto the market. The Missing:--From a political economy perspective, we should expect any industry built on short-term profits for shareholders to have predatory outcomes. The exact manners may be different between say the tobacco industry and the pharmaceutical industry, but common incentive structures bring common behavioral patterns. We are not talking about “drugs are baaaad”; we are considering issues in evidence, pricing, distribution, etc., and for this we must consider the power relations between government, Big Pharma, and the public. This gets into social values and imagination, which is why so much corporate money is poured into public relations, media, think tanks, politics, and higher education. Only great businessmen and private enterprise can command the hordes of workers to drive innovation and bring about optimal social outcomes, we are told…--While Goldacre touches on the consequences of First World drug companies and global south consequences (neglect from less profitable markets, patent property rights forbidding life-saving affordable generic drugs, testing drugs in poor countries with open markets who will not benefit from them, etc.), this deserves an entire book. --Overall, this book has a more serious tone than Goldacre's other books/articles as it seems more geared towards healthcare professionals. Lots of touchy doctors out there; let’s not forget that it wasn’t long ago (before the '70s) when Western medicine was predominantly eminence-based medicine!"
9,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9362670-duncan,5,"Here Ben Goldacre follows up on his previous book, Bad Science, by turning his spotlight solely on the pharmaceuticals industry. This is a terrifying book because it argues in great detail that our understanding of the efficacy of many drugs and the extent of their side effects is fundamentally flawed.Goldacre starts with the criticism he finds most damning: namely, when drug companies conduct a trial and the results don't support their own medecine, they frequently fail to publish the results - or they use dishonest tricks - there's a chapter on ways that trials are intentionally flawed by design to yield positive results for the sponsoring company - like re-analysing the data until they find some random subset that can be written up as positive, and then pretending that was what they were testing for all along. From the perspective of the pharmaceutical companies, their goal is simply to make money. The problem is that when the published literature on virtually all of our medicines is dominated by one-sided information, it is impossible for anyone in the medical profession to practice based on the evidence - and as Ben Goldacre details, this has caused unnecessary pain and suffering, and even death, to enormous numbers of real people. One example is of a heart drug estimated to have killed around 100,000 people before proper trial data revealed the dangers. Missing data badly analysed means doctors cannot possibly make the best decisions when prescribing drugs. In many cases, your doctor has no true idea which drug would likely be the best for you because the literature they study is full of disinformation. Think about that the next time your doctor prescribes you any medicine, as mine did yesterday. The remainder of the book is dedicated to examining how this situation is possible. Goldacre writes about medical journals that fail to act in the interests of patients, as well as highly secretive regulators who neither hold drugs companies to account nor allow the data to reach the public domain so independent researchers can analyse the findings.In the last chapter, Goldacre discusses marketing and the techniques pharmaceuticals companies use, spending tens of billions of dollars each year, to make their drugs look better than they are in order to increase sales. This is a deeply worrying book because it argues that the whole system for approving and regulating drugs, and disseminating accurate information on them, is broken. There have been some attempts to address these issues as researchers unveil the depths of these problems, but all of these attempts have been 'fake fixes' in the words of the author.Crucially, although Goldacre discusses individual cases of specific drugs throughout this book, most of the arguments are built on systematic reviews of the literature, which involve researchers collecting evidence from large numbers of trials to avoid the bias produced by collecting only small samples. This shows that the problems described in this book are not one-off cases, exceptions to the norm, but rather the norm itself. The enormous fines levied on many of the world's largest drugs companies (e.g. $3 billion for GSK in July 2012, $2.3 billion for Pfizer in Sept 2009, etc.) also bear out the argument that all of this wrongdoing is standard practice in the industry, and their recency shows that the fixes have indeed been fake.The book is a little repetitive in places. I think Goldacre wrote it this way to keep reminding lay people of the full range and gravity of his arguments. Overall, it wasn't quite as enjoyable a read as Bad Science - but it is a far more important work. This should be considered essential reading."
10,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"I really liked another book by Goldacre, Bad Science, & his web site so I read this even though I'm not much for taking any medications. Woah, what a mess. Between this & Rigor Mortis: How Sloppy Science Creates Worthless Cures, Crushes Hope, and Wastes Billions, I'm really discouraged by the state of affairs. I've heard a lot of people denigrate Big Pharma for a variety of reasons. A lot of it sounds like a conspiracy theory, so I discounted it. The truth isn't somewhere in between as I'd thought though. It's definitely on the conspiracy theory side & it's not just a problem in the US, but all over. Norway gets kudos, but even they are victims of a poorly managed system. They can't help it.The system is broken from the start. Industry is too involved in every step, there's very little transparency, too much money, too little & toothless oversight. Goldacre points out the flaws very well, if in more repetitive detail than I wanted, but he also provides his ideas on how the problems can be fixed every step of the way. I REALLY appreciated that. It's easy to complain, but a complaint without a solution is just whining. Goldacre is not a whiner. I think he's a little optimistic & overreaching at times with his suggestions, but at least he has them. They're not bad ideas, just very unlikely to be implemented.I highly recommend this to everyone, but especially if you're regularly taking a medication that's new & expensive. You'll find out what facts to go looking for & you'll see that even though it is new & shiny, it might not be better - It may be a hell of a lot worse - than the existing generic brand. I know I have a lot of questions for my health professionals.My edition was very well narrated, but make sure you get the PDF with it & or an ebook. It really helps."
11,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/304492-darrell,5,"""The story of the serotonin hypothesis for depression, and its enthusiastic promotion by drug companies, is part of a wide process that has been called 'disease-mongering' or 'medicalisation', where diagnostic categories are widened, whole new diagnoses are invented, and normal variants of human experience are pathologised, so they can be treated with pills.""Ben Goldacre touched on the evils of the pharmaceutical industry in his previous book, Bad Science, and this book greatly expands upon those chapters. Unlike Bad Science, which read like a series of blog posts, Bad Pharma is much more cohesive and better written. The biggest surprise for me was that the theory that depression is a chemical imbalance caused by low levels of serotonin isn't true. It's a myth spread by marketing companies.There are major problems with the pharmaceutical industry from misleading or missing data, testing dangerous drugs on prisoners or the homeless, regulators with conflicts of interest, academic journals not being proper gate keepers, patient groups being funded by the pharmaceutical industry, deceptive marketing, drug reps who bribe doctors, and more.GlaxoSmithKline knew from trials that their antidepressant paroxetine caused increased suicide in children, and they knew the drug was being prescribed to children, yet they kept these trials hidden to increase their profits.Roche has refused to share its trail data on Tamiflu. It appears Tamiflu does help you recover from the flu a few hours sooner than you would on your own, but there's no evidence it reduces cases of pneumonia or death, which is the reason countries are currently stockpiling it.During a clinical trial that took place in Nigeria, Pfizer withheld the effective dose of an antibiotic known to work so they could test their new antibiotic. Eleven children died as a result. When Pfizer was brought to court, it ran a smear campaign against one of the Nigerian officials to try to make the court case go away.Nexium is almost exactly the same as omeprazole, but it costs much more because the patent ran out on omeprazole. AstraZeneca changed the drug slightly to get a new patent, not because Nexium is any more effective than omeprazole, but because they wanted to make more money.A drug called Midodrine was approved by the FDA despite the fact it performed no better than a placebo in trials. The FDA did eventually threaten to take the ineffective drug off the market, but a special interest patient's group demanded the drug remain available because they claimed it worked for them, not realizing they were simply experiencing the placebo effect.Nobody knows for sure which drug is the best one for any given condition. This is because when industry tests their own drugs, they test it against a placebo or a different dose of their competitor's drug. They have no incentive to test their drug fairly against their competitors. How to solve this problem? Government needs to step in and perform the head to head trials. This is a win for everybody. Even the CEOs of big pharmaceutical companies presumably want to know which treatment is the most effective for themselves and their families. Bizarrely, when President Obama proposed that the US government do just this, Republicans were opposed. Apparently, Republicans do not want to know which drug is the best medical care available.With all these problems in the pharmaceutical industry should we all switch to alternative medicine? No. As we saw in Ben Goldacre's previous book, Bad Science, alternative medicine is guilty of these same crimes and more, not to mention that the pharmaceutical industry owns most of the alternative medicine companies anyway. As bad as drug companies can be, they still do more good than harm. Merck's drug Vioxx was taken off the market due to increasing the risk of heart attack, but taking Vioxx is still safer than driving a car."
12,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55771094-janel,4,"The first thing you need to know about this book is Goldacre doesn’t shy away from the fact that it is an attack on the pharmaceutical industry, he’s here to tell the reader some home truths: problems, fixes, and suggestions on what we can do. The issues Goldacre is addressing have evolved over time, and now it’s fair to say:“Medicine is broken.”Medicine is one of those topics that you may know bits and pieces about, may have heard rumours and chatter, but, unless you’re in the field of medicine, it’s really hard to know where to begin when it comes to separating the facts from the myths. Bad Pharma is a great place to begin!Expect to be shocked and outraged! Let me give you an example: there were seven studies conducted into the effectiveness of an antidepressant drug – five had negative outcomes, only two had positive outcomes, and those were the two which were published. Those two positive studies form the research that is influencing prescribing, but the true effects of said antidepressant are unknown because the other five studies never saw the light of day! These are the practices that exist. Also, it cannot be overlooked that drug companies own some major journals so it’s hard to establish what’s reputable and trustworthy data to begin with. These, and so much more, are the topics Goldacre breaks down in an easily understandable way.What’s really good about this book is Goldacre doesn’t just tear the industry apart, he offers solutions and fixes. Solutions and fixes that are realistic, and quite frankly baffling as to why they are not already in practice. Reading this book, you’ll come across subject specific terminology, and acronyms; Goldacre explains these where necessary. Where not knowing the acronym or terminology will have no impact on your understanding, it is not explained, and this may be frustrating to those who are easily annoyed if they don’t know the meaning of specific jargon . As a trainee mental health nurse, a lot of the terminology was familiar, and the subject itself is of great interest me. To read, or listen, to this book in its entirety, I believe you have to have an interest in the subject beyond a casual chat with friends where you put the ‘world to rights’. You have to want to know and understand, and have a strong interest in the flaws of the industry, or I fear you’ll lose interest in this book once the shock-factor wears off.Goldacre raises so many valid points in this book, it is extremely well researched. It doesn’t read like the ramblings of a conspiracy theorist – you just know it’s rooted in truth; it makes too much sense not to be. In book form, while the topic interests me, I don’t know if I’d have picked it up for fear of it being too dense, and statistical. I’m glad I listened to it – Jot Davies is an excellent narrator – it wasn’t as dense as I thought it’d be (but that might be because I listened to it, rather than read it), it was detail-heavy, but in an accessible way, and it’s an audiobook I absolutely recommend if the topic interests you."

And this is no small thing. Because in medicine doctors and patients use abstract data to make decisions in the very real world of flesh and blood. If those decisions are misguided they can result in death and suffering and pain.""The whole book is written to defend the following paragraph:Drugs are tested by the people who manufacture them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, in such a way that they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don’t like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug’s true effects.Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in its life, and even then they don’t give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.In their forty years of practice after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues can be in the pay of drug companies – often undisclosed – and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups.And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company.Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, we have no idea what the best treatment is, because it’s not in anyone’s financial interest to conduct any trials at all. These are ongoing problems, and although people have claimed to fix many of them, for the most part, they have failed; so all these problems persist, but worse than ever, because now people can pretend that everything is fine after all.""It's possible for good people in perversely designed systems to casually perpetrate acts of great harm on strangers - sometimes without ever realizing it.""The book is for everyone. This is pop science, so it will not contain fine details.Systematic reviews highest quality.Chapter 1: Missing Data.Company funded studies produce more positive results than independent (or government funded) ones. 22% more likely to be positive. For their own drugs 78%.Systematic reviews show companies give positive results 4 times more likely for their drugs.Hiding negative results.Tricks to make all company sponsored studies positive.Why missing data is important. Rebocsatine for depression. Even when you're doing your best as a doctor reading the data and critically appraising it, you can still be mislead, because much data -often negative/bad results- is not published.This is still happening, all over the world, for all drugs, and it's entirely legal!TGN1214 trial on humans. Disastrous side effects. Not published data could have prevented it.80% of first on human studies are not published even after 8 years.This is about real people who die due to not publishing (e.g anti arrhythmatic for MI patients killed ~100k people, while publishing a study could have prevented this).Importance of systematic reviews. Steroids for premature births. Meta-analysis. Blobbogram (aka Forest plot). Cochrane reviews.iStudy on anti-depressants in 2008 about drugs from 1987 to 2004 showed there were 38 positive results and 37 negative. In the Academic journals these translated to 48 positive and 3 negative results! Such distortion..The evidence is overwhelming that negative trials are published less often or changed to appear positive. This is a systematic problem for all drug companies. This can cause unnecessary harm, suffering and death. Also it fools governments into oaying more money for expensive drugs that may be just as good as the old cheap ones.Even in other branches of science, nefative results are less likely to published than positive results.Journals are not to blame.Not publishing negative results is unethical. Universities ans wthical committees have failed us.Companies have the right to stop some studies at anytime for any reason. This introduces huye amount of bias and is not mentioned in the literature. They also can choose not to publish studies. And who can see the data; they can even prevent researchers working in the trial from analyzing and sharing data.Researchers who try to fight the system are intimidated.Patients are lied to by consent forms since if data is not published this does not lead to increase in our knowledge. Recruitment is already hard, this only makes it worse.Suggests many solutions for the problem including setting trial registers.Pre-registration as a condition for publishing in well known journals. Didn't work. Wasn't applied on ground.EU register kept secret. Why call it a register if it's not public?Lists many solutions by EMA EU and FDA that didn't work. Fake assurances.Problems faced when trying to get data from regulators:1. Information is held from regulators. Done legally. Prescription for other uses with no separate market approval as formally required (i.e. off label). Patent extention. (GSK paroxatine for children. Ineffective and leads to increase in suicide. Prescribed off label).2. Regulators make it hard to access the data they do have. Messy websites. Documents with no title or table or contents.3. Regulators withhold study records that they do have. Protection of commercial interests of companies, or personal data. Really? The EMA (EU regulator) was complicit with the companies and withheld data under fake excuses.Regulators don't understand the difference in decision making they have to do (wether the drug should be in the market at all) and that done by doctors (is this drug suitable for this specific patient in front of me). They paternalisticly think they made the checking for doctors who don't need to get all the data.Summary at end of chapter. This us research misconduct on a grand universal scale.Tamflue case. Chochrine makes a mistake in their systematic review. Because their methods are transparent, this mistake is picked up by a Japanese doctor. They started working to fix this. Rosh, the company manufacturing tamflue held back the needed data. Discrepancies in data given to different regulators. The trials were designed to give favorable results.Regulators are fallible. Rosey Glitazone for DM causing increased risk of heart problems.Benifits of data sharing and how it leads to great results. Suggestions to increase public sharing of data.Chapter 2: Where do new drugs come from3 phases then regulator.Ethical problems for trial participants. People who earn living from participating in trials (Genie Pigs). Abuses they endure and intimidations.Commercialization of trials (CROs). Moving trials to low cost countries: e.g. India, China, Romania and Argentina.This raises ethical (abuse, fairness) and scientific questions (quality, applicability etc). The Helsinki Declaration is not respected and recent changes made it ok to violate it while outside US and EU.Chapter 3: Bad Regulators, getting your drug approved.Pressures on regulators. Sociology of regulators. Regulatory Capture. Free movement of staff. Conflicts of Interest (in FDA etc who have commercial conflicts of interest). Corruption evidence very hard to gather in these situations.The FDA has become an agent of the industry!?Drugs in trials on patients should be compared to the current best treatment of the condition, and not to placebos. The Helsinki Declaration was amended in 2000 to specifically emphasize this point.The parameters taken into account are sometimes not mortality and MI rate, but blood cholesterol levels (LDH etc). This can be misleading as surrogate outcomes don't always lead to the results we want. Example of CAST trial on anti-arrhythmatics for MI patients such an example. The rhythm was fixed, but mortality rate increased!Accelerated approvals. FDA performance was assessed for decades by number of drugs approved per year which led to the ""December Effect"" with many drugs rushed in last weeks of year. Companies of course push for fast approvals for more profits. Urgent approval policy created after HIV epidemic. Abused by companies for drugs such Milidrum. Patient advocacy groups pressure. Post-approval trial promises are usually not fulfilled. Case of Iressa for small cell cancer.Effects on innovation. If companies don't have to produce drugs better than those already available, they simply won't. This keads ti the ""me too"" phenomenon where instead of developing new drugs companies just manufacture their own drug of the same class e.g. SSRIs. Leads to waste of money time etc instead of developing new good drugs.""Me again"" phenomenon, changing enantima from right handedness to left handedness e.g. omeprazole and S omeprazole (Nexium).Comparative effectiveness research. Vital.Government should fund research. The price of overpriced medications outweights the price of doing research (to prevent it). e.g. treatment of hypertension amlodipine vs chlortalidone (cheap as effective and with no serious side effects).Monitoring side effects. Spontaneous reporting. Database studies.Regulators have a big duty to report side effects. A separate organization should be set with powers to withdraw drugs from market. Suggests solutions.Chapter 4: Bad TrialsTricks:1. Outright fraud.2. Test your drugs on ideal patients.3. Test your drug against something useless (wrong dose, rotue, freq etc).4. Make trials too short (surrogate measures).5. Stop trials early (peeking, major side effects).6. Stop trials late.7. Small trials8. Packaging/mixing findings9. Per protocol vs intention to treat analysis.10. Switching the primary outcome after the study ends. Drawing the target after you throw the dart.11. Dodgy subgroup analysis (patients). Cherry picking among false positives.12. Selective use of trials.13. Seeding trials. To advertise drugs to doctors under the guise of research.14. Pretend it's all positive regardless. Relative risk and absolute risk. Numbers needed to treat.15. Industry funded systematic reviews!Chapter 5: Bigger Simpler trials.Observational studies. Take data from doctor notes without needing to make big costly trials. Statins (simvastatin and atolvastatin). What if this becomes the normal state of affairs, trial as a routine continuous activity in all clinical practice.Ethical committees being an ass sometimes and putting unnecessary barriers for useful studies (20 mins consent form).Chapter 6: MarketingDoctors can read all papers. We need ways of communicating new information to doctors to save costs and increase efficiency.Companies teach doctors aftet they graduate. Hold conferences. Many covert ways of advertisement. They spend twice on marketing and promotion than on R&D. Marketing is used to pervert the evidence-based practice.Ads to patients directly. Only few countries allow this. Changes patient behavior to the worse. People are turned into patients. News drugs get more ads. It is people and patients who pay for the ad campaigns as the cost of drugs goes up due to ads.Celebrity endorsement. Use of individual stories to market it. Depression-serotonin relationship has little support in academia. Pathologizing of normal human experiences, disease mongering. SSRIs and depression checklist.Social anxiety disorder. Female sexual disfunction.Patient groups. Drug reps. Free meals. Dealing with doctors based on their type. Gifts. Tricks. Flights. Entertainment. IMS data show to drug companies what doctors prescribe and so they double check on their promises. There are other ways to get the data too.Don't see deugs reps and ban them from your faculty. Drug rep ban stand. Other advices.Ghost writers of journal academic articles.Academic journals. Their income from advertisement is mainly from pharmaceutical companies. Reprint orders. Conferences as trade fairs. CME teaching most sponsored by big pharma and used to promote drugs including those to be used off label and other tricks/transgressions.We need proper regulations on Big Pharma and not an outright ban. Conflic of Interest should be declared. Other conflicts of interest not related to Big Pharma.Afterward: Better DataMissing data is biggest problem. All distortions can be corrected by check systematic reviews, but missing data cannot; it poisons the well for everyone, rich and poor.Defends the book against predictable replies & criticisms and moves to the attack!Many parts contain Bombardment of information, even for me. Too much details. It's on the borderline between pop science and science.At end of each chapter suggestions to what to do. Book is partly written to doctors and partly to normal people/patients."
14,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,3,"A very interesting read about how medicine is developed, released and distributed. It suffers mostly from being dry and detailed. This is not a conspiracy book. It's about facts, some of them quite complicated, particularly if you are unfamiliar with scientific methodolgy. One of the problems is missing data. Most of the trials that are negative, that do not have the result the sponsor (the pharmaceutical industry, usually) hoped for, are never published. The data is extremely difficult to get at, protected by the very regulators who should protect the public.Another problem is bad trials. Trials that change what they are looking for along the way, where results are peeked at, that are too short, too long or otherwise badly constructed. Then there is the marketing. I thought that the pharmaceutical industry spent most of their money developing new drugs because the process from finding a new active molecule to an approved medicine is so long. I was wrong! Apparently the pharmaceutical companies spend most of their budget on advertising! Some of this is done in such a way that it is not very obvious, such as celebrities dropping names and hints. The industry also sends around drug representatives to hosptials and doctor's offices to push their drugs. They pay for dinners, educations and other perks.Wait a minute, they do WHAT? They BRIBE doctors to prescribe the drugs made by the company the reps work for and this is okay?! This is truly reprehensible and it is something that is forbidden by law in other segments of industry. I am not allowed to give as much as pen to a person working for a state-owned company because it might influence their decision in my favor. Most doctors work for the state, so I don't understand this dichtomy. So yes, there are definitely problems. The book has many examples and suggestions on how to improve things. Let me remind you that although there are multitude of problems with traditional medicine, they do not even approach the issues that ""alternative"" medicine have, so don't even go there. Homeopathic ""medicine"" by definition has no active ingredients. Here in Norway you can advertise for alternative medicine or treatments and they do not have to have any proven result at all. That is still worse than the regular industry, for all its faults. For the safety of all of us, things should be improved though. The ethics are certainly questionable to say the least."
15,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"I didn't quite know what to expect with this book. After I read the title, I wondered if it might be driven by conspiracy theory. It was anything but. Goldacre focuses mainly on missing data-- how it gets lost, how its absence affects how trustworthy the findings are, and what that means for the subsequent care recommendations made from incomplete data. I remember learning about the file drawer affect in which papers that do not include a strong finding are never published, and thus kept out of meta data. Far from insignificant, a lack of finding is important information when trying to understand treatment for various issues. The file drawer affect is not the only problem at hand when trying to get a full understanding of the issue of concern. Goldacre does a great job of highlighting that many concerns we need to be aware of, and take measures to correct, if we are to have any real understanding of any medical concerns we attempt to study. "
16,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10099677-bill,4,"This book is not unbiased, but it is largely fair. The ""bad"" examples really happened, and some of the behaviors are still widespread - like failure to publish clinical trial results even years after the trial has been completed. As someone who's worked for two of the biggest firms, I'm still unhappy by the lack of transparency. But I do see signs of improvement. No company wants to have a reputation of being the lowest of the low. More people should read this book, and demand better accountability from their own doctors, and the companies and regulatory agencies too."
17,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5860800-malcolm,5,"This is a great instance of science not standing up to scrutiny by its own methods.One of the great crimes of health care is that it is dominated by companies whose primary concern is profit, not necessarily our health; these are not the private health providers but drug companies. I have been around this area for years, from my days as a trade union campaign organiser in the public health sector and now in a university School of Sport and Exercise with a strong strand dealing with public health; I though I knew how the drug companies worked and their shenanigans….. how wrong was I?Ben Goldacre takes us through the life cycle of drug development, from development to testing to trials to marketing revealing the ways drug companies conceal data that shows their drugs in a bad light, how they develop replicas of other drugs rather than new ones to treat new conditions, how they tweak their existing drugs to keep them in patent and therefore maintain profits and how they corrupt the health care sector in their interests, not the interests of patients or public health. Along the way see the extent to which drug trials (most of which are industry funded) are skewed toward the positive – good for marketing, not good for science. We also find ourselves in the middle of the revolving door between industry and the regulators. We see the ways drug reps use non-medical incentives to get their products prescribed, and the way drug companies hire academics for their names only on ghost written (by the company) scholarly papers and in some cases publish their own journals masquerading as scholarly, scientific journals. I’ve been watching this industry for years – the case is thoroughly believable.Goldacre’s real strength is two-fold. First, he brings the methods of scholarly scientific research to his critique of the drug companies – that is, he uses the methods they claim to use to test their claims, and finds them wanting. Second, he writes well (some of the faux chumminess/jokiness of Bad Science has gone) and can explain quite complex medical and scientific procedures (as well as the statistical analyses underpinning his work) in clear, accessible language.It is likely to be slightly less accessible or read than Bad Science but to my mind it is a much more important book and should bring to the public debate a more informed tone that allows us as lay, non-scientists, non-medics to challenge the power of big pharma. Read it, dammit! And then demand that your legislators control this industry. And check out Goldacre’s on-going work at http://www.badscience.net/ "
18,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3663280-donna-brown,0,"Bad Pharma is actually a fairly scary book to pick up when you’ve just collected a prescription from the chemist but I’d heard a lot about Bad Science (which I’ve since read) and thought Bad Pharma would be incredibly interesting. I certainly wasn’t wrong.This is pretty much a damaging expose of the pharmaceutical industry’s involvement in modern medicine. Not necessarily their manufacture and distribution of tablets that do improve people’s lives every day but more the unnecessary peddling of drugs that either do very little or are no more effective than drugs already on the market. We’ve all seen the washing powder ads for something ‘new and improved’, only to find out two months later that it’s got one slight miniscule change. How ludicrous would it be if the drug companies did something similar and then got it under patent for 10 years so they could charge incredibly high prices for it? Well, they do.Delving into issues such as pricing, drug trials, suppression of research and trial reports, Goldacre uncovers how strong the hold over our medication is and calls for changes across the board, citing things that patients, doctors, governments, researchers and the drug companies can do.I’m sure Goldacre didn’t make any drug rep friends via this book – and I’m quite sure he doesn’t care. It’s refreshing to read something that is so focussed on what’s right, regardless of the waves it makes. That said, having now gone back and read Bad Science, it’s not really a surprise. This is an absolutely fascinating read for anyone who has had any involvement with our health system or ever taken any medication whatsoever. So, that’s pretty much everyone!This review was originally published on Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dave"
19,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15284685-zach,4,"This is a great overview into one of the largest health and economic problems today. As someone with experience in both the world of research and clinical medicine, I can say that the information in this book is accurate. The information is presented in a surprisingly non-biased and non 'conspiracy theory' way. The organization is such that there is wonderful flow and each idea builds on itself. I appreciate the fact that there are proposed solutions to the problems, many of which have the potential to be revolutionary. I would recommend this read to anyone even remotely involved with medicine: from practicing physicians or scientists to someone interested in working in health; concerned patients to patients' family members.

21,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8886218-jeff,5,"At first sight this might be seen as another piece of new-age anti-pharma ranting: Big Pharma is Bad and therefore we should not trust it or use its products, turning our backs on the knowledge that has extended life-spans and improved our health during our lives.To make such an assumption would be to do this book a grave injustice; Ben Goldacre is himself a doctor and believes whole-heartedly in the benefits that modern medicine has brought to humankind. What he objects to is, as shown in his columns for The Guardian and his previous book, Bad Science, is the distortion or abandonment of scientific evidence. In that earlier book, much of his wrath was targeted at the so-called complimentary practitioners who all too often make claims that are completely unsupported by anything akin to objective evidence. Now he's turned his gaze at the mainstream medical-profession and it's not at all pretty.Goldacre believes in evidence-based medicine: the use of all the collected evidence to guide doctors as to the best possible treatment for each patient. Unfortunately, he finds systemic evidence that the entire chain from the pharmaceutical companies through the regulators to many of the doctors themselves conspires against sound practice. Even those who are of good will and above personal reproach are working in a system that prevents them from consistently providing the best service to patients which is, after all, supposed to be the aim of the pharmaceutical-medical industry.In many cases, the problems appear to be at least in part unwitting (GPs not realising how much their prescribing patterns are affected by contact with suppliers), in others understandable (of course pharmaceutical companies will try to influence GPs to prescribe their profitable products) but in other cases they definitely appear to be deliberate, from the obfuscation and secrecy of so many regulatory agencies to the withholding of and manipulation of research studies.Occasionally I felt that too much was, perhaps, being made of small parts of the whole and yet it is because each small part contributes to a system that is demonstrably flawed that they have the importance that they do; I would agree with Goldacre's contention that each of the flaws needs to be tackled from the smallest to the largest.This is not an uplifting book. It will not give you confidence in your GP nor make you happier about the way that medicine is practised today. In that sense, it galls me to have to award the book five stars yet I feel obliged to do so: it is, for the most part, an easy read that sets out clearly and with reams of supporting evidence a real problem and this book should be recommended reading for everyone ... and compulsory reading for those involved in regulating our healthcare."
22,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,4,"Very well researched muckraking about the corruption of medical information. This is what serious non-fiction/journalism is supposed to do. Some negative reviews here of this book implied that the author is making this stuff up or exaggerating, because even if Big Pharma lies that doesn't have any impact on doctors, who are trained to see through those lies. Goldacre goes over some of the research showing how that's not true: most doctors believe what they're told by experts, or even drug reps. Moreover, Goldacre is not some lone crank saying this. An editor of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote a similar book about how the NEJM, as the main gatekeeper of medical information in the U.S., can't keep the phony baloney out of its own pages. 

 In any case, probably the main point Goldacre is trying to make is how the drug companies hide bad results, so even if you are a super nerd doctor and critically read the primary literature, it doesn't matter because the relevant studies were never published in the first place."
23,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"Excellent book that people need to read. It will make you angry about the pharmaceutical industry, which is rather the point. Goldacre's style is calm and rational leavened with just a touch of humor. He provides plenty of data to support his arguments. He points out the flaws in the current system and suggests some reasonable changes. This book should really be more of a topic for discussion than it currently is."

Only a week before I'd remembered seeing this book in a book store and immediately decided to order it. An extra 2013 update chapter posted on the author's website: http://www.badscience.net/2013/12/fre..."
25,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073465-carlos-martinez,4,"A very useful, important book, explaining (in gritty detail) how pharmaceutical companies - sometimes in collaboration with regulators, governments and doctors - take shortcuts and sometimes engage in outright fraud in order to get their medicines on the market and into patients throughout the world. Thankfully the book isn't anti-science or anti-medicine, and is therefore not a nutty vitalist rant about the entire pharmaceutical industry being a scam; it correctly notes that drug development has saved and improved many millions of lives.The information - scrupulously researched - about how drug companies suppress negative trials; how they quietly bribe academic journals; how they use every manner of marketing doublespeak; how they use drug reps to skew the information available to doctors, and so on: all this is essential for people to know. We should understand it and act on it.Where I think Bad Pharma is lacking is in terms of its proposed solutions. Goldacre proposes sweeping changes to the regulatory framework around the pharmaceutical industry. I agree these are essential, but I think we also need more fundamental changes - to the _economic_ framework around the pharmaceutical industry. Private companies have a role to play in innovating, for sure, but the whole area is too fundamental to human life to be run in the interests of shareholders. The work of developing and testing pharmaceuticals would be much better managed at the national and international levels. It should be carried out primarily by publicly-funded and publicly-accountable research institutions and organisations, with this work supplemented by private companies (indeed many important medicines have come out of startups working in collaboration with the university deparments they were spun out of). Development, research, regulation, ongoing testing and doctor/patient education would then be coordinated by the same overriding bodies - ideally connected to the UN and the World Health Organisation. Goldacre doesn't get as radical as this, but I think the book would be better if he did."
26,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,3,"Bad Pharma is a sequel of sorts from the author of Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks an original piece about poor scientific process, across a variety of fields.Pharma on the other hand lampoons the pharmaceutical industry (I bet you didn't guess from the name) targeting biased publishing trends, dodgy marketing tactics, and misinformed regulators (amongst other concerns) including his own ideas on solutions and prevention. Unlike many polemics Goldacre's solutions are well thought out and mostly doable (mostly!) and this is certainly a strength of the book.In content the book is mostly frightening in the revelations of so much bias and poor science in the medicine industry. Although it is worth noting that many of the concerns outlined, while important are more looking at the refining of medication not gross negligence (for example its not like big pharma are throwing deadly drugs at us for huge prices, simply not putting as much effort into securing 1-2% differences in drug effects, or working hard to reduce side effects as much as they could.)So: Important message, solid evidence and useful advice, why do I rate this book so low?I confess that underneath the facts, this book is boring. Even though this stuff is really important, ultimately the presentation feels like an author indulging in their special interest rather than trying to entertain (Goldacre assured us this was 'pop' science!) After the first 100 or so pages the examples began to blend into one, and the arguments while compelling in content, wilted in writing.So ultimately this book is for the brave and interested, I think most people in this day and age have a fair amount of cynicism towards the pharma industry in general so specifics may not have as much appeal as Bad Science had in dissolving our eager beliefs in hackery."

You won't find any stories about evil corporate execs laughing as they poison children in Africa for fat medicine contracts. You will find real and shocking stories of how lax regulations and lop-sided reward systems allow very human people to create very unpleasant situations, often without realising the harm they are causing.Reading this book is important, because it informs us of the real problems in medicine, rather than the manufactured problems, like vaccine scares and bird flu panics, that get all the attention."

By understanding how new drugs are tested, approved, and marketed, you increase your chances of avoiding damage to your health and pocketbook. Big Pharma does develop useful medicines that save lives, but the main goal is to make money. Read this book to learn how to better avoid dangerous and not-worth-the-money drugs. I had read most of this book before the library wanted it back for another patron so consider this a full review even though it is marked ""did-not-finish""."

He argues his case in detail and backs it up scrupulously by reference to specific tests and products, but he writes for the general reader not the specialist. The effect of the book is seriously disturbing, making me realise how much money determines the medecines we are given rather than scientific proof, even when this is readily available. Goldacre writes in a lively way and the book is entertaining if you can forget that your life may depend on the decisions he shows being made on such inadequate grounds."

36,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18185192-athan-tolis,5,"I was walking around Notting Hill with my buddy Elias, who runs a biotech company. “How’s work?” I asked, as one does. He disappeared for a second in the famous bookstore from the Hugh Grant movie and emerged with this thick tome.“Read this and then we can talk,” he said.The book is a full-on attack on the pharmaceutical industry. No part of it escapesThe author starts with testing. In short, negative trials (the kind that say a new treatment did not work) disappear more often than they don’t. This is horrible on a number of levels: 1. It’s like rolling the dice a thousand times but only discussing the five hundred best outcomes. The result won’t be representative. 2. People who participate in trials and risk their health to do so deserve better. 3. People who might participate in a similar trial in the future really really deserve better. Ben Goldacre was not the first to think that this is a problem, and manifold “cures” have been sought/recommended to the problem: medical journals have committed to only publish papers if they can prove they did not “gag” negative results; patients could be warned ahead of participation that the results of the experiment conducted on them might be gagged (though this avenue has not been pursued); professional bodies and regulators have committed to the dissemination of data. The author proves that in practice none of the promises are being kept. He gives names and addresses. If he was wrong about the slightest fact he’d be in jail now. The bottom line is that the pharmaceutical companies carry on with this practice because “he who pays the piper calls the tune” but also because the regulators are both “captured” and highly secretive by nature. He leaves out a further reason I once read about in another book called “Reasonable Rx,” namely that pharmaceutical companies would not under any circumstances want to prevent their competition from going down the same blind alley they just did. But of course, given how combative the author is and given how many times he points the finger at specific companies he cannot include this criticism, since it is an unprovable allegation.From the “gagging of negative results” problem he then moves on to the horror of the “Stage 1,” “Stage 2” and “Stage 3” trials that bring a molecule from its discovery to the point where regulatory approval (FDA approval in the US) is first sought. Stage 1 is the business of trying a new drug on people who get paid something like twice the minimum wage to subject themselves to the new molecule. At this stage the point is merely to find if the drug is harmful, not to see if it cures anything. The book describes these awful communities of people for whom this can be their sole profession, who more often than not have no medical cover if something goes wrong and who sign their life away before participating, though this is still an improvement on the previous prevalent practice of conducting these tests in jails. Famous criminal Whitey Bulger was exposed to LSD this way, I seem to recall...The next two stages are about finding out about how the body absorbs the drug, if it does what it’s meant to do with sensible dosage, and of course if it is effective. Oh, and increasingly many of these trials now take place in super-poor countries around the world, among populations that not only should never be our guinea pigs, but might actually differ significantly in how they absorb drugs. My wife’s from Japan and I’ll tell you her body absorbs alcohol very differently than mine does. CROs (Clinical Research Organizations) are described in some detail too. These are the companies that conduct the trials. Once upon a time it was universities, but these days it’s private companies, who are in the business of selling the results to the pharmaceutical industry. No bonus points for guessing what their incentives are. The laundry list of dirty tricks used in trials by these industry-dependent CROs is breathtaking. Outright fraud aside (which happens a lot) the tools of the trade include 1. testing on ideal, super-healthy patients, rather than real-world patients who will be often carrying other ailments 2. benchmarking against wrong dosage in the alternative treatment 3. benchmarking against invasive procedures such as surgery over too short a period of time, which will always favour the drug 4. carrying on with catastrophic trials in case they turn 5. trials that are merely large enough to prove something is better than placebo masquerading as trials that are big enough to prove a drug is better than another existing drug, 6. again, typically small trials that are not truly trialling anything and are just marketing ploys to get doctors to prescribe a drug, 7. bundling of outcomes in a way that highlights improvements in the extreme rather than the average 8. scratching from the outcome what happened to patients who dropped out of the trial (when in reality this behaviour can be a good predictor of patients subsequently dropping a drug) if that makes the result look better 9. fishing in the data of failed trials to find out if the drug worked on a (by definition, not statistically big enough) subgroup and, most insidiously, 10. changing your mind ex-post on what you were looking to cure. Every trick comes with an example from real life. This is a veritable catalogue of largely legal but ethically highly objectionable behaviour, and if you are remotely human you will be enraged to read about it. And if one small detail was wrong, Ben Goldacre would be serving hard time.Regulators also come under the microscope and they don’t scrub up too good either. Quite often, the burden of proof they impose on new drugs is that they must merely beat a placebo rather than the currently “best in class” drug. Head-to-head tests are as rare as hen’s teeth. Mankind today actually has no idea what the best statin is, for example; no pharmaceutical company has an incentive to run one and no regulator has ever done the work to find out, a fact that statistically speaking has led to millions of premature deaths. That is not to say there’s no room for multiple drugs. There is, since the statistically most effective drug may have side effects that don’t work for all patients. Regardless, you would have thought there’s a duty to establish what the most effective drug is. It’s clearly not how the regulators see it. Not only that, but regulators allow most new drugs to come to market after proving they can improve a “surrogate outcome” like the cholesterol count, rather than the outcomes that matter like smaller likelihood of heart attack, for example. In many situations that’s the best we can do, of course, but there are circumstances and illnesses where the burden of proof should be much higher. We also find out about the abusive practices of the industry, which drives drugs through the “accelerated approval” loophole that was carved out for very specific situations. Again, all of these arguments are made with concrete examples of drugs. The discussion in this book is NEVER theoretical, it’s always via example. Names and addresses. And the accusation against the regulators can be summed up as follows: on every issue they are happy with relentless drift toward the lowest common denominator: placebo vs. head-to-head, surrogate outcomes vs. real outcomes and accelerated approval for drugs where we really ought to wait.The least surprising but longest and most salacious part of the book is to do with marketing. The author goes quickly over the horrors of direct advertising of drugs to consumers, the websites and fake surveys that invite us to click on to discover if we’re suffering, for example, from anxiety etc. etc. and lists tons of studies that prove direct marketing is financially effective and fundamentally wrong, but saves himself for two biggies: the armies of sales reps who have woven themselves into the fabric of the medical industry and the fabrication of company sponsored “research.” The sales reps bit is easy to understand. It’s a bit how bond brokers take me out to dinner, and I love it. Though of course I would never dream of dealing with them more next morning , needless to say. It’s just the other guys who do that. My mom believes me, even if you don’t. The research bit is chilling. Bottom line, pharmaceutical companies plant most research in periodicals. They employ armies of authors to write the stuff ahead of the launch of new drugs (first a barrage of articles about some new ailment that affects tons of people, then a barrage of articles about promising new medicines) and then literally hire academics to put their name on the ghostwritten research. This is more insidious than it sounds, because academics benefit doubly from having their name attached to research. If you only ever sign stuff you wrote you are in unfair competition for promotion, recognition etc. with other doctors who are happy to sign stuff that was ghostwritten for them by a pharmaceutical company. You obviously miss out on the money too, but that’s the lesser of your problems. Journals turn a blind eye to this, because all the ads they carry are for drugs, of course. There’s nobody watching out here. Again, Ben Goldacre lists names and addresses, none of this stuff has come off the top of his head.Bottom line, marketing is 25% of the costs of a pharmaceutical company, research is half of that and the rest is to do with actually making and distributing the drugs! The author complains that marketing not only is unethical; it also adds a 33% to the price of medicine!The book closes with a long list of proposals; summarising solutions the author has been proposing to the specific problems in every chapter. For example, the NHS has the means to tarck true-world outcomes (not surrogate outcomes) on true-world (non-ideal, superhealthy) patients and has a moral duty to do so, though obviously it needs to overcome the issue of personal data.He even suggests we start with a South-African style general amnesty, subsequent to which we need to go back and find all the missing studies, find out what data we can collect from existing sources and figure out what tests we urgently need to run. And since it’s the second edition I read, the proposals are followed by a long afterword that lists progress on the proposals which actually sounds quite heartening.That said, it’s INCENTIVES people respond to, and this Ben Goldacre does not address. The world of pharmaceuticals and medicine needs its incentives to be restructured, or else it’s difficult to see how we don’t drift back to where we started, and all this after the miscreants have bagged the amnesty!I must say that after reading this book I can see where the authors of “Reasonable Rx” were coming from when they recommended that the industry be split in two, namely companies that only develop drugs and companies that only market them. But I still hate their recommendation that a government-supported agency should stand in the middle. It’s not easy, that’s for sure.And now I know a tiny bit more about what was on my friend Elias’ mind that day in Notting Hill…"
37,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109790330-ak-nephtali,5,"It's miraculous we live as long we do. Drugs are amazing, as is the NHS, as are the doctors and nurses who dedicate their lives to the saving of others, but the system is burnt baloney on a stick.Industry funded trials are 4 times as likely to find a positive result, trials which say 'hey this drug looks a bit sucky' are usually left unpublished to wallow in dusty archives, and the few trials which are published are often incomplete, cut off short to hide side effects, use ideal patients who were likely to improve anyway, the new drug is compared against a placebo instead of the most effective competing drug, and designed to rig a positive outcome. That is, if you can even access the trials. Most drug companies have full jurisdiction over their information, and the patient who swallows their pill has as much right to the trial's outcome as a rock.Depression can in fact be treated by tianeptine, a drug which reduces seratonin levels, though this fact goes against the 'knowledge' that most drug companies mechanically pump into the net.We live in the age of misinformation, and we don't need more input, we need the right input.Our world is undergoing a process of medicalisation: where normal human behaviour is made pathological so that companies can prescribe drugs for things that are not problems. In 2010, WebMD launched a quiz called ""Rate your risk for depression: could you be depressed?""The quiz included questions like: ""I feel sad or down most of the time"" and ""I feel tired almost every day"" and ""I feel worthless or hopeless"" and so on. If you answered 'no' to every ten of these types of questions, and clicked submit, you would receive the message: //You may be at risk for major depression.It's almost laughable until you realise tests like this drain the already strained medical system and bleed gouts of public money into the treatment of non-problems.""... The greatest risk is that we fail to notice that our models of personhood and what is normal, are being quietly engineered by a $700 billion industry.""And the drug Clomicalm exists: ""the first medication approved for the treatment of separation anxiety in dogs"".No further comment.I could pitch a drug called RainAway -- a medication for the slight despondent feeling you get when it's stormy! --Some might find the emotional language Goldacre uses off-putting, indications that this book wallows in the shallows of the maudlin and sentimental, but that couldn't be further from the truth. It is a rallying cry against the dry indifference permeating pharma, the belief that better than nothing is good enough (even though a two percent increase in effectiveness means millions of lives are saved) and a thoroughly researched cry at that. It's easer to critique than create, but after decimating the industry, Goldacre offers well-though-out suggestions to mold the world into a kinder one. How the NHS's group medical database could be used to perform accurate, large scale standardized trials, the results available to all. How doctors can ban KOLs (key opinion leaders) from preaching misinformation in their hospitals and how Academic Journals can ban ghostwritten pieces from oublication. (And a minimum of 7 percent of supposedly stringently researched trials are written by journalists who have as much medical knowledge as a person who's only watched a few drug adverts while browsing Instagram and eating toast.)The bibliography is as long as my TBR list (which could serve as a space elevator to the moon), citations pepper the pages, and he invites us to critique his message, assured but never arrogant and happy to implement any of our suggestions.I don't believe in required reading (just read what you want and have fun!) but if you've ever popped a pill into your mouth or breathed in vicinity to a doctor, I'm more than happy to shove this book into your arms and scamper up a tree before you can attempt to return it.Worth your time, worth your thoughts, and worth losing sleep over. (P.S If anyone has a ladder, I'd really appreciate it. This tree is on the tall side.)"
38,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35205135-alopexin,5,"Ben Goldacre is one of the first non-fiction author that I read and to be honest, he set the bar really high. His books are always:- Well-organized. It's exactly like the model dissertation in college. There is always an introduction announcing how he will dissects the problem and the approach taken. After every chapter there's a summary, after every part there's a reminder of its place within the whole book. - Considerate of the readers, especially the lay people. He gives warning that this book is 'difficult stuffs' but encourages you to read on, explaining what you will gain if you make the effort. He makes sure to leave out the too technical parts but still mentioning them so that you can research more if you're interested. He always mentions what he omitted and explains how it will impact your understanding - that is transparency at its best.- Passionate. The tone of the entire book is so honestly pissed and he spares no-one's feelings as he spills the tea and calls out people left and right. This is the kind of ""I"" that I like to hear in non-fiction: when the author's opinionated and to the point, and not like ""I met with the marketing execs on a crisp autumn day."" Reading this book you realize that as a single consumer you have no power against the big pharma. So every news articles telling you to become a 'savant consumer' are bullshit. The entire system is broken, as Ben Goldacre demonstrated very thoroughly, and the only way you can protect yourself is to figure out just how much your doctor is influenced by big pharma. The only way you can make a change is straight up activism and lobbying. This is a situation where carefully reading the labels or even doing researches will do nothing to help you and frankly it's depressing.I probably didn't pick the greatest time to start listening to this book because my mind is too frazzled and I kept getting interrupted by long work trips. But it's enough to get the gist and I do say this book deserves a second, closer read, preferably on print. "
39,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57560734-esther-king,3,"I do see what this book was trying to do with its information, and there's certainly a lot of untoward happenings in the pharmaceutical industry that make people go ""Hmm"" but realistically, this book relied on a little too heavily on the hard data and statistics, as well as government documentation, and completely missed the more human side of this story that was really needed to balance it out. There's a lot to be said for the bravery of the author in outing the behaviours of drug reps and the doctors who trust them, as well as the fallibility of studies, but this book really needed more in the way of anecdotes from lived experience.

41,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5884823-luis,5,"After reading Bad Science, I knew I had to find more about Ben Goldacre. I discovered ""Bad Pharma"" on Amazon and a few days before I receiving this book looking as a drug. Regarding to the advice that ""Pharmaceutical industry has serious side effects"" you are far from predicting how serious this sentence can be.It is really important to keep in mind that everything which is going to be described along these pages ends in causing fatal harm to patients (including deaths, yeah). No matters how strong this may sound: all what is described here is perfectly documented with dozens of references at the end of the book, meaning nothing new to Goldacre readers. In this volume, you can find lots of information that describes several processes holding a lack of transparency, especially concerning to clinical trials.Clinical trials are used to find out all kind of valuable information about the drugs we use routinely: efficacy, adverse effects and so on. We need these trials to be performed because there are millions of patients that get benefit or harm from them. However, industry seems to show a flawed pattern on the data they give us. In order to resume the contents of this book, I will focus on the different chapters it contains:-Missing data: this is undoubtedly the most worrying fact presented in this book. A high number of trials are being withdrawn from the public view because they contain information that does not benefit the industry, and mostly of the good ones are published.-Where do new drugs come from? Let’s check how new drugs come to the market, taking into account the flaws that can arise in these steps.-Bad regulators: regulators have Access to all the information, but they decide not to give away all the trials. If they act the same way as the industry does, what happens with these organisms?-Bad trials: every mistake that can happen during the design, realization or analysis of trials. Here you can find all you need to know about how to make your drug look much better than it really is.-Better trials: Goldacre offers a good and cheap solution to make good trials, although it needs some support from several people.-Marketing: This book would not be complete without this amazing tour through the gifts, perks, trips and many more ways used by industries to manipulate doctors’ prescription. In every chapter, Goldacre brings some solutions to fix all these troubles. But maybe the most shocking thought is that, even we were able to establish a solution from now on, it would not be enough. We need all the data from trials that companies are keeping to know the truth about the drug we currently use. If you are particularly worried about this bad behaviour from companies, please do not hesitate to sign this: www.alltrials.netThank you Ben for writing about this amazing world of chaos! This is a great step towards transparency around the drugs we need so much."
42,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,4,"Ben Goldacre's previous book, Bad Science, was effectively an adaptation of his Guardian columns of the same name, and although it wasn't a straightforward compilation, it had something of the same character: a bit of a grab-bag of subjects, held together by the broad theme of bad science and bad science journalism, with a emphasis on trying to entertain as well as inform.This is a more focussed book. And a drier one, which you may or may not think is a good thing, depending on your tolerance for the occasionally clunky attempts at wackiness and humour that characterise a lot of popular science writing. Personally I thought Bad Pharma did a good job of taking a potentially tough subject and presenting it in a clear, engaging way. It's not, btw, a tough subject because it is full of difficult science or complicated statistics, but because it's a book about institutional and bureaucratic failings within the healthcare industry. Institutional structures, bureaucracy, regulation, professional standards: this is not the sexiest subject matter. But Goldacre did a good job of convincing me that it was important enough that I should keep reading, and making it readable enough that I was able to do so.The book follows all aspects of the life of a drug — the way it is developed, tested, licensed, marketed, prescribed — and talks through all the ways that biases get into the system and distort medical practice. There is plenty of evidence that these distortions make healthcare worse and more expensive; the only question is how badly. But the same processes that distort the science make it impossible to accurately judge the damage.The pharmaceutical companies are the major villains of the piece, unsurprisingly; they are the ones doing badly designed trials, hiding the results of trials with flattering outcomes, paying academics to put their names to ghostwritten articles, and spending twice as much on marketing as they do on R&D. But as Goldacre points out, they are only able to get away with it because of repeated failures by everyone else involved: regulators, governments, journals, professional bodies, patient groups, and so on. All of whom have been at the very least complacent, and often suffer from deep conflicts of interest, since the drug companies seem to be the only people in the whole system who actually have a lot of money to throw around. So they spend a lot of money advertising in the medical journals, they donate money to patient groups, they sponsor conferences and training for doctors.It's a worrying book, which deserves to be widely read."
43,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4782050-blair,5,"Disclosure time! I work in the pharma industry, specifically for a regulatory agency. I read this book as much for professional interest as personal, but I'm recommending it for everyone from a personal perspective. I am not speaking as a regulator! I never am, on a site like this, but some people are idiots and need it spelled out in black and white (or whatever colour your text appears).When I say I recommend this for everyone, I really do mean for everyone. Everyone will, at some point in their lives, make use of a health product, whether it's the vaccines one gets as a child or the pharmacopeial cornucopia many need to stay alive in old age. Just as it's important to know where our food, water, clothing, etc. comes from, so too should we all know where our health products come from. And it's especially important to know what kinds of bad behaviours show up along the way.The heart of the message is that, for a whole host of reasons, we aren't working with a complete set of data for the products we rely on to stay alive and healthy. If evidence-based medicine is to progress in ways that benefit us, this needs to change. Not only are the bad behaviours highlighted and explained, but the author also offers tangible solutions and concrete actions which everyone involved in the industry - including patients! - can use as a way to help build a culture of good behaviour. Make no mistake; the book is neither a screed nor a call to arms, but a systematic overview of what's going wrong and suggestions on how it can be changed for the better.Not everyone is going to glean the same kinds of insights from this book. At times it seems written for a very specific audience. Sometimes it seems aimed at someone like me, with my industry and regulatory background. Other times, it's written for people in front-line health care, specifically doctors or others who prescribe medication. Regardless of the target audience, it's written in a way that everyone can find accessible, though at points it is going to be challenging. For instance, I know exactly what's being talked about in most of this book and I found myself grinding through it at points. Take however much time is needed to read and understand - it's worth the challenge."
44,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14290486-donna-riley-lein,3,"Bad PharmaBen GoldacreBen Goldacre is a young physician who has made a second career for himself trying to make science understandable to the lay person.His first book, Bad Science, was a fun, intelligent but accessible read that should have made one more aware of how scientists (at least the bad ones) skew and obfuscate results. Why is this bad? Well, read the book. Or check out his blog, http://www.badscience.net/That works for science in general, but getting the point across when the subject is statistics, especially the statistics of medical tests, is tricky. You either simplify so much that you bore readers or leave in so much that those same readers have their eyes glaze over.Bad Pharma has both faults.Goldacre tries his best to make statistics understandable to the average reader, but this reviewer took statistics and classes dealing with experimental science in college (years ago) and was lost. And occasionally bored. Most readers do not have that base of knowledge to draw on. It may be because Goldacre is British, and this reader American. Two countries separated by a common language and all that . . . It is a pity, because Goldacre is passionately (he tries to be dispassionate, but the emotion leaks out) writing about a subject that all of us deal with daily – the medicines we take. Because the subject is so dense, most of us have left the subject to people who should know about it, out doctors.Wait a minute.Thinks of all the studies out there. And the new medicines that come out. Does your average doctor have the time or inclination to carefully read and evaluate them him or herself?No. She/he is too busy tending to patients and has a life (I hope.)So your average physician relies on experts and studies that more knowledgeable (at least she/he thinks are more knowledgeable) physicians endorse.But what if those experts and knowledgeable doctors are in the pay of the drug companies? What if researchers get their papers from that source? Yes, very scary. That’s why everyone who can should read Bad Pharma. It can be a slog, but it is worthwhile."
45,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13941767-sherafgan-khan,5,"This book tells a dismal tail of the true realities in the medical world. Regardless of your occupation or field of industry, you should read this, because one day you will become sick, and more than likely, you will be prescribed medication. This book will make you question: why brand name drugs are still being prescribed after they are out of patent, how easy it is for companies to extend or create new patents by simply making a mirror molecule of the same exact drug (enantiomers), how a ""60% improvement"" can mean absolutely nothing, why you see all of the ""good"" research (positive findings) and very little of the ""bad"" (negative findings), how doctors can be bought out at your expense, and much more.Bad Pharma goes beyond simple pharma talk, and goes on to educate readers about the quantitative aspects of medical research and the huge lack of transparency. The big picture shows how the entire system is corrupt because of greed and special interest funding not only to doctors, but also politicians who theoretically work for ""us"". The same politicians who allocate funding to the FDA (or similar department depending on the country) who in turn, are to regulate this market. It is a sad reality. Many in the industry will claim that these are problems of the past, and new regulations are in place to prevent this. The truth is though, every time new regulations are enacted, new loopholes will emerge.Ben goes on to mention at the end of each segment what we as consumers can do to alleviate this corruption, but I want to add one bit and say the root of this corruption lies in unlimited campaign finance for politicians. Particularly, donations from large corporations, not necessarily just the pharmaceutical. I believe if this problem is addressed first, many of the current problems can be fixed (though not necessarily all, due to the complex nature of medical research).Overall, a must read, and not just one to put back on the shelf after you are done, but to continuously bring up and educate the public about."
46,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27903529-abi-nottingham,5,"This book centres around a simple concept that takes a whole lot of explaining: the pharmaceutical industry has been hiding data for almost as long as it has existed, and this long-standing failure harms patients and costs us money every single day.Ben Goldacre does a fantastic job of explaining the complexity of this issue in layman's terms, and although I had previously been aware of a few dubious practices, throughout reading this book I have learnt how much more there is left to fix. The book is not all doom and gloom, and littered throughout are sections titled ""What can you do?"", focusing on actions that you can take - things as simple as sending an email, or having a conversation.For me, the main flaw of the book was how lengthy some of the sections were - it is, of course, non-fiction, so it's not so much a pacing issue - but for someone coming into this subject with only basic knowledge, the information overload is a little tiring at times, particularly as I was eager to process and understand it all. To get the most out of it, I would recommend aiming to read this book in large chunks, when you have a lot of mental energy to spare (rather than as a night time read, for example).However, the stand out thing for me (and what kept me coming back to the book) was Goldacre's passion for change, for our ability to make things better, and his faith in collaboration (from industry, doctors and patients too) as the way forward. I'm not going to go into the nitty gritty of the arguments here, but if you have any interest in the subject I would highly recommend this book. Every argument made is backed up studies, statistical reviews, and articles. Every one of these can be looked up in the Notes at the back of the book, and the author encourages you to check out at least a few, because an argument is only as good as the data that backs it up. This book will encourage you to question in the most wonderful way."
47,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269814-carolyn,4,"We all know that big drug companies try to influence doctors to prescribe their drugs with gifts from attractive sales reps and free travel to supposedly-educational conferences in lovely places. But did you know that those conferences are biased? A majority of their drug studies (the ones whose conclusions reveal ineffectiveness or bad side-effects or are otherwise undesirable to their sponsors) are never published, and nobody keeps track? That most study results are ghostwritten by specialized companies employed by the drug manufacturers? That drug companies spend twice as much on marketing as on R&D? The author is an angry young British doctor who points out the details of unethical conduct by the drug companies and the agencies that supposedly regulate them. It's an ugly story. Drugs are named, including a couple that I take, making me uneasy. Goldacre makes many suggestions re what can be done; ultimately, he thinks, it's up to an outraged public, demanding to know what data has been withheld about the pills we swallow, and whistleblowers in the drug industry and regulatory agencies. The devil is in the details, and the book includes things you should ask your doctor(s), where to report misconduct you observe, and websites where you can look up data about your doctor(s). Goldacre advocates strict enforcement of usually-ignored requirements to register drug trials before they begin, and match them with their results, all to be published and available to anyone who wants to read them. These publications should include the results of all studies of all drugs currently on the market. Requiring accountability by drug companies is long past due, and this book is well worth the time it takes to read. "
48,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8108009-tim,3,"Well, who'd have guessed it? The big pharmaceutical companies aren't altruistic, transparent purveyors of the unbiased and complete truth.Actually this is an important and useful book, but one that struggles between its need to inform the casual reader and the necessity of ensuring all the arguments that a multi-billion dollar industry can throw at it can be rebutted. At time this makes it a bit slow and hard going.The key points I took away were:1) The results of many drugs trials aren't published. Since the drugs companies choose which results to publish this almost certainly means the data about the effectiveness of drugs is distorted2)Trials can be conducted in a way that improves the chances of favourable results3)The data that is published can be misrepresented4)Drugs companies anonymously ""ghost write"" many apparently independent academic papers5)Drugs companies sponsor conferences and doctors' ongoing training, using special chosen ""key opinion leaders""6) Medical and academic journals are largely funded by drugs companies, and studies have shown they are less likely to publish articles criticising major funders' products.7) Regulators are toothlessMany of these things wouldn't really matter if we were talking about breakfast cereals, but not knowing which heart disease drug is most effective could be costing thousands of unnecessary deaths every year.Two pieces of data that are quoted and surprised me were that pharmaceutical companies spend twice as much on marketing as R&D and (most shockingly) that 66% of fraud cases in the US involve the pharmaceutical industry.Worth reading, albeit a bit of a hard read at times."
49,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7916772-silent-count,4,"The author of this book, Ben Goldacre, is a senior research fellow at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (which is exactly what it sounds like). He isn't some crank who believes in homoeopathy, the healing power of crystals, or that giving your child the MMR vaccine will make them grow gills.It is important to lay out the author's credentials because it is his credibility that makes this book all the more scary.Mr Goldacre paints a picture of regulatory, and indeed whole-industry, capture by the big pharmaceutical companies. They've got nearly endless piles of money and, being businesses, use their financial muscle to make their horde even bigger.No regard appears to be given to whether the drugs are better for the patient than existing treatments, or if a drug is even 'safe', for any reasonable meaning of the word. The name of the game is to patient a drug, get governmental approval to sell it, and get as many doctors prescribing it as is possible. By any means, fair or foul.The sheer breadth of the problem leaves me speechless.My only complaint of this book is that Mr Goldacre occasionally comes across as too emotionally involved with his subject matter. While this is understandable, his work would have been more compelling with a dispassionate presentation of evidence. Is it bad that drug companies perform multiple trials but only publish the ones which are favourable to their drug? You bet'cha! But an intelligent reader doesn't need to be told that this practice is bad, and that it will lead to a dangerously distorted picture of whether the drug in question is safe or effective."

We blithely assume our doctors are doing the best for us and yet they are actively and routinely misled by the pharmaceutical industry. But you can't blame big business for this - these large companies are doing what they were made for - creating wealth for their shareholders. It is our fault for naively assuming that they will act like benevolent Victorian philanthropists and will have our best interests at heart. Without proper regulation, governance, monitoring and transparency it is no wonder these international companies spend more on marketing as they do on research and development of new and innovative treatments. And it's not just the pharmaceutical industry that falls foul of this - while we continue to sell off our public services to the highest bidder, we can expect no better.So in many respects this is a depressing albeit eye-opening read. I am lucky enough not to have any illness requiring me to take drugs on a regular basis, but if ever I do, I will be asking my doctor some serious questions.Fortunately I read the kindle version of this which includes a final chapter updating the story from a year after the book's first publication. It's a heartening read - progress is being made and one of the industry leaders has signed up to making more data on its drug testing freely available.Thank heaven for people like Ben Goldacre who care enough to research issues like this and more importantly make change happen (rather than just read about it and get cross like me!)."
51,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1632550-barbm1020,5,"This is a very important book that every doctor and every patient should read. The author explains the drug trials that result in medicines (often of no or doubtful use) being approved for prescription and sale, in the USA and elsewhere. The pharmaceutical industry often pays for tests and then hides any negative results, picking and choosing which trials should be published in order to make their new products look good, and doctors are only told what the manufacturers want them to hear. Many research papers by reputable scientists are routinely buried in the no-man's-land of unpublished documents. Attempts by scientists to provide better access to more complete information about products, such as establishing a registry of trials to be run on a product, are often circumvented by the industry. Results from contracted trials, and university trials, paid for by Big Pharma, become proprietary and unfavorable data are hidden from doctors and from the public. This is all about money and patents, and about getting doctors to prescribe an expensive new drug even when it's no better than, or inferior to, and existing drug whose patent has run out and is now cheaper for the patient. It's scary. I recommend it. Not for fun, but because we need to know."

As with Bad Science, it is punchy, very readable, but clear and without (too much) exaggeration: while many of the claims are astonishing, this is more scholarly than most pop science books, with complete references provided. Goldacre neatly summarises each section with 'what you can do' bullet points, which serve to off-set, somewhat, the generally depressing nature of the subject. However, despite the evident pleasure Goldacre takes in his iconoclastic take-down of the pharma industry, and the necessity of it, the book remains uncomfortable reading for anyone that has already completed most or all of their medical training, as it makes a mockery of any attempt our tutors and lecturers have made at teaching 'evidence-based' medicine. Sadly, this is the reality - that the evidence base on which modern medicine is founded is rotten to the core, skewed by the cynical efforts of the pharma industry and blind apathy of academia."
53,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/606959-meera,3,"This is an important book about a topic that affects us all, but I feel like the author doesn't do himself any favours with his angry and hectoring style, as I felt quite annoyed with him (as well as the pharma industry) after reading it. Although a lot of people said they felt it was too data heavy and they became bogged down in it, I feel that the data is necessary to support the author's arguments and I did like that he had done this, but I get that this would make it heavy going for the average 'pop' reader this is targeted at. What I didn't like was the endless repetition of some arguments that he had throughout, and I felt like the arguments would have had much more impact had he not done this, as well as making the book shorter and punchy. As its so long, he loses your interest a bit as it goes through, which is a shame as the last bit on marketing by pharma is truly shocking and one of the best parts of the books. But he has done his research really thoroughly and I think that this should spur academics, doctors, people working in the industry, regulators to really think about the issues at the heart of current healthcare system, particularly missing and hidden sata.

54,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15646727-alex,5,"It's hard to fault Ben Goldacre. This is a complicated subject and most people aren't looking for explanations of statistical data analysis in their bedtime read. But this is both his job and his passion and even the dry stuff is compelling. It's also frightening because if you believe half of what he exposes here you just won't bother taking a GPs advice ever again. I work in R&D and have seen first hand the discomfort that is caused when marketing meets scientific fact and I can understand what drives people down the slippery slope towards unfair data selection to support their years of hard work on a project. But what Goldacre exposes is an endemic culture of something many scientists would consider lying in one of the largest business sectors in existence and it directly affects people's health. Goldacre has put an enormous amount of time and effort into collecting evidence and its well worth it. I was sensitive to and on the look out for reverse bias from Goldacre. As I said this is his job and he obviously has a vested interest in the subject, but I didn't see it, and indeed he refers to that at several points and explains his position openly. "

I'm sure most of you would say yes because your doctor prescribed them. Well you may think again after reading this book wich pulls the veil of the $600 billion pharmaceutical industry, revealing the shocking truth about the one's who provide your medicines.Author Ben Goldacre, a physician descibes in detail how the industry has made a mockery of the scientific process and co-opted national health systems, professional medical organisations and medical journals that are supposed to protect us. It's a story of hypocrisy, greed and decisions that put profit before human life.Goldacre thoughtful account is honest and very well documented but he does not stop there; he also outline's solutions that if implemented could save countless lives and save billions in taxpayer money that is so important with the spiralling cost of healthcare. To put it mildly this is a scary book to were you may never look at your meds the same way again. "

What really stands out are the fact that it's very readable and doesn't skimp from going into details about statistics and things like meta-analysis. This lays a good foundation for understanding the how and why.The revelations were not that revealing to me, having seen some documentaries on the topics the author writes about. One documentary was about testing medicines in India and another one on Eastern Germany and involuntary testing being performed there.The only thing keeping me from giving this book 5 stars, is that the author is somewhat naive when it comes to a solution. I really don't think this industry will clean up it's act. There will have to be strong penalties for any type of misbehavior and we're not going to see that given the current way of doing business in politics."

The later effect comes before the former and when someone is motivated, but still depressed, it could sometimes lead to suicide. This isn't a secret, but a well-known fact. However, this book will only tell you that antidepressants increase suicide rate among patients without explanation. It serves the purpose of misleading and misinforming readers. Even all the confusing and unnecessary terminology can't hide the fact the book is but a cheap sensation exploiting people's lack of basic understanding on drugs and pharmacy."

63,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7510654-phillip,5,This book provides perspective on understanding the healthcare industry. It provides plenty to think about in regard to medical decision making.
64,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478144-john,5,"This is one of the most frightening books I've ever read.I'm pretty familiar with the whole mechanism of publication, peer review and so on in the sciences and, while I'm well acquainted with all the ways in which it's imperfect (negative results have a hard time getting published, replication is rarely done because academic and corporate funders want new research the whole time rather than checking the existing stuff, etc., etc., etc.), I've been assuming that, at least in general, the scientific enterprise is relatively healthy. I've spent enough of my life defending it from pseudoscientists, cranks, science deniers, ""climate skeptics"" and the like, after all.But, to go by Goldacre's account, the same is very far from true in the medical sciences -- or, at least, in that wing of the medical sciences reliant upon drug therapy.Again, obviously, I've always been uneasy -- as I'm sure everyone is -- about the fact that almost all the trials run to test new drugs are funded by the manufacturers of those drugs, the pharmaceutical companies themselves. In an ideal world these trials would be mounted and funded by nations or even international bodies, to ensure that their results would be independent and unbiased. We don't have that world because our politicians would rather campaign on a platform of cutting taxes than one of reducing the chances that the medicines our doctors in all innocence prescribe for us will actually do the job they're supposed to, and won't kill us. We can't blame just the politicians for this, however: ask any roomful of people if they'd like lower taxes and the chorus of ""you bet!"" will drown out any more nuanced argument. We vote to keep the system broken.Similarly, governments should be funding the continuing education of doctors -- some of whom may still be in practice fifty or more years after leaving medical school, where they learned much that is now entirely obsolete and didn't learn much that has been discovered since. Good doctors do their best to keep up with things, but doing so in any comprehensive manner is both theoretically and practicably impossible -- besides, they have patients to treat. But governments are reluctant to spend any money on this continuing education (""Save the taxpayer's dime!"") and so, guess what, it's left to the pharma companies to do it. And, again guess what, it seems that their own products just happen to be the drugs of choice for all manner of ailments, no matter the reality.Goldacre spells out the various ways in which, without the people in Big Pharma or anyone else involved being actually evil (although, by simple statistics, obviously some of them must be), the system that has evolved in the medical sciences has become corrupted from root to topmost twig simply because of the way it's funded. To take a few examples:[] Drug companies own the results of the trials they fund. If a trial shows that their new favorite baby, WundadrugTM, is a stinker, they can simply embargo those results. More to the point, if five trials show that WundadrugTM is a stinker and one shows that it may have some marginal benefit, the company can let the single trial be published . . . thus giving a grossly misleading impression of the truth.[] As has been shown time and time again, teams whose research has been funded by the manufacturers of WundadrugTM (and of all the other WundadrugsTM!) are more likely to find positives when they analyze their results. This generally isn't a question of deliberate corruption and it may not even be conscious, just a matter of looking on the bright side, so to speak. And such matters of funding often go undeclared, or are tucked away in the tiny print, whatever the ethics guidelines might say.[] By the nature of things, WundadrugTM, if determined to be effective and therefore licensed, is going to be used to help sick people in a particular demographic -- elderly sufferers from high blood pressure, shall we say. Yet the recruits who sign up as subject for medical trials need not belong to this demographic at all -- often they're young people in need of the money, to get them through college, perhaps. The fact that WundadrugTM lowers their blood pressure might be encouraging, but it doesn't really tell us much about how the drug will act on the elderly.[] Very often WundadrugTM will be tested in trials against a placebo. It's always exciting that a new drug works better than nothing at all, but that isn't really what we want the trials to find out. The useful knowledge is how WundadrugTM does against its competitors -- not just the obvious matter of whether it's as good as or better than they are in the matter of reducing blood pressure but also in what the side-effects are. As Goldacre points out, doctors are in real life prescribing drugs not to trial subjects but to human beings, so that for a particular patient a doctor may prefer to use a less effective drug because, once you take its other effects into account, it's better for that patient.[] Looking beyond trials, the manufacturers of WundadrugTM buy ads in medical journals. The editors of those journals should be immune to such considerations as where their ad revenue is coming from, and I'm sure many of them indeed are, but . . .There's more, there's more, there's more. This is quite a long book and, although Goldacre's telling is breezy and relaxed (on occasion borderline irritatingly so), there's not a lot of wasted space. Despite the fact that there are some chuckles to be had, the overall picture he paints is profoundly depressing. No matter how good or assiduous medical practitioners might be, they're often essentially prescribing blind, because the knowledge they should have is either hidden (those unpublished negative trial results) or has been hopelessly distorted by the time it reaches them. Goldacre produces, often amusingly, account after account of real-life instances to demonstrate how this situation has come about; he also offers quite a few possible solutions in specific instances, but really, as he acknowledges, the system needs a comprehensive overhaul, starting with each of us thinking about whether we want to pay through high drug prices for substandard medical science or if we'd rather face up to a relatively tiny tax increase in order to have a system that, while it'd inevitably still have its imperfections, would work better and in so doing save lives.This book isn't soothing bedtime reading, but I think it's important reading."
65,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,3,"Look, this book convinced me, with its wave after wave of carefully marshalled evidence, but I'm not sure I retained enough to persuade somebody at a cocktail party (my sole and superior test of all books). Simply because while the work Goldacre is doing is really important, it doesn't make for the most interesting reading. He tries to leave out some of the boring stuff, but also relishes making the strongest possible case and pre-empting possible objections. I fully realise that by writing this I'm part of the problem: the public just doesn't care enough about these critical issues, and the system - with paternalistic, inefficient regulators and avaricious drug companies gaming the system in manifold ways - doesn't work. Just put this guy in charge of everything!In a nutshell, the case is that it's impossible for even the smartest, best-intentioned doctors to read all papers in their field, so they have to skim them. But much research is (and has to be - Goldacre doesn't dispute this) funded by the drug companies, who have terrible incentives to distort and fudge the data. Goldacre, by day a doctor and fellow at Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, cites many statistical tricks, badly constructed studies, ghostwritten papers with an academic's name slapped on, and sometimes entire journals published only to promote a company's drugs (undisclosed). And no-one has time to review, so the tricks go on. Goldacre notes that were he in charge of all medical research, he'd happily freeze all studies for a year in place of metastudies like the Cochrane Collaboration. And this is even before the murky world of direct-to-patient advertising and pharmaceutical reps. While the pharma industry keeps apologising and claiming that now things have been fixed, after so many fake fixes and with so much incentive to lie, it's hard to believe them. (Goldacre suggests an amnesty for past ghostwritten or secretly sponsored papers, just so that they're no longer polluting the data!)It feels to me like a lot people used to think the FDA unnecessarily strict: why delay potentially life-saving drugs with cumbersome bureaucracy, rather than releasing them with caveats and letting the public decide the appropriate amount of caution needed? But lately I've encountered a lot of arguments in the other direction, a sort of medical conservatism or nihilism: actual breakthroughs are extremely rare, drug companies continually push new drugs as patents lapse, which have incremental and questionable improvements and less certainty about side effects; doctors (responding to patients' desires) overprescribe instead of letting natural processes work their way, or just accepting that some things can't be treated.Goldacre ends with a plea for Big Pharma whistleblowers, and a reminder that he's not anti-pharma or science (his other book I Think You'll Find it's a Bit More Complicated Than That is about quacks and alternative medicine) - he just wants more transparency and fairness. Given the economic incentives in the industry, though, it's hard to see how anything will change."
66,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5793303-alyssia-cooke,5,"This should undoubtedly be required reading for all people of all ages from adulthood on; patients, professionals, students - all. It is deeply concerning and scarily educational all in one. Written clearly and at a level that is understandable to any who are willing to spare a few brain cells yet are not professionals, this is an eye opener into common academic, medical and pharmaceutical practice. I had a few issues with the book, largely with the early presentation of the first chapter which was repetitive. Another issue I had was aspects that the author spends very little time on such as the reasons a trial can be pulled early and indeed on the methodology of trials in general. He talks about bad trials in general but largely from a statistical view. There was little coverage of the day to day methodical work, the actual data collection, entry or cleansing or indeed why eligibility criteria have to be so strict, why ‘perfect patients’ I.e patients who aren’t on deaths door have to be used for safety reasons. Likewise the variations in trial design and randomisation or stratification variables and the reasons behind these decisions, the deviations and the differences between the academic and the pharmaceutical trial are all glossed over.Regardless of that, this has to be a five star book simply due to the depth Goldacre devolves into, which keeping the book at an accessible level for the many rather than the few. Split into six fairly manageable sections and a summary chapter, with the exception of the roundabout route the first chapter periodically takes, it is generally easy to follow and proceeds down a logical pathway. The text includes plenty of examples, written in such a way that you can’t help but feel outraged despite the fact that the author tends to avoid obviously inflammatory language at such points. But when faced with missing data on arrhythmia drugs that cost over 10,000 lives a decade later, it’s difficult not to be stunned and horrified.I particularly liked the ideas expressed in Bigger, Simpler Trials; the idea of using the existing GP network for consistent and constantly running trials on already approved and currently used drugs is a stunning one. The points the author makes on the unnecessary red tape that is actively stopping Doctors from making progress in research and filling in gaps in data are dead on the nail.At the end of each chapter Goldacre clearly sets out a series of ‘what can you do about this’ which is good; it shows that he has taken time to think of solutions rather than just problems. There are also a variety of different ideas for different groups of people; Doctors, patients, students, pharmaceutical professionals. Many of these are common sense things that would be relatively easy to do and wouldn’t even take a vast amount of an effort. Obviously as a patient there is less you can do than the GP, but there are still actions you can do and conversations you can have.All in all, this is a well written, coherent and cohesive look that educates and terrifies in equal measure. I would recommend it to everyone."
67,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"In order to weed out fact from fiction scientists utilize the scientific method, a body of techniques that serves to produce an unbiased, objective set of results. In addition to providing the methodological framework for creating experiments, the scientific method also requires that experimenter’s perform extensive documentation and share all data so that others are able to review it and verify that the conclusions are indeed correct. Although the process is sometimes slow and tedious, it is the best means that humans have come up with to determine what is true and what is not. It should therefore come as a surprise that when it comes to our healthcare (an area where you’d think both doctors and patients would be highly motivated to utilize the best medicines available), that pharmaceutical companies, drug testing firms and regulators commonly engage in practices that, while legal, make it very difficult, if not impossible, to determine the effectiveness of prescription drugs. This obfuscation is, for the most part, a deliberate strategy designed to allow drug companies to make as much money as possible, regardless of whether their product is effective (or even, in some cases, in spite of the fact that it is actually harmful). In Bad Pharma, British physician, academic, and science writer Ben Goldacre documents the ways in which the evidence from drug trials is skewed and obscured and how these practices harm the public. This is one reason for the estimated 44,000 to 98,000 preventable deaths and 1,000,000 injuries that occur each year in U.S. hospitals due to preventable medical errors. How do they get away with it?• The pharmaceutical industry tests their own drugs and are far more likely to produce favorable results than an independent lab. This can only be explained by researcher bias.• Researchers often hide unfavorable data. If they perform multiple trials, current laws allow them to hide the data from those produced negative results and only publish the trials that support their product. • Drug companies also often place gag orders on researchers, prohibiting them from publishing results without the company’s prior approval (allowing them to bury unfavorable studies).• They choose trial subjects that are most likely to give them a positive result. Young, healthy individuals are better test subjects than older individuals who are suffering from multiple health problems since they’re more likely to improve regardless of a drug’s effectiveness. Unfortunately, this is not representative of the real world conditions in which the drug will be used. • Drug companies and researchers perform statistical manipulation to produce favorable results. For example, if a test produces a moderately favorable result in the first few weeks, but no long term benefit, the company might simply choose to throw out the later data in order to capture the initial positive response. In other cases they engage in tricks that are the statistical equivalent of shooting an arrow, then drawing a bulls eye around the spot where it landed.• They behave unethically, hiding mounting evidence of harm (think Viox and Fen-Phen) in order to continue to sell their product. • In order to make it to market, drugs are only required to perform better than placebo (i.e. better than nothing). They are not required to outperform other drugs on the market. This can result in doctors prescribing inferior treatments that are usually more expensive as well.• Due in part to the revolving door between government and industry, regulators collude with drug companies to withhold data and rush unproven medicines to market. Regulators are also reluctant to take drugs off the shelf once approved, even when evidence of harm exists. • The pharmaceutical industry spends huge sums of money (far more than on drug research) on massive marketing campaigns to influence doctors and patients to use their products (""ask your doctor about … ""), even when evidence shows that it is not the best treatment. This distortion of the science inevitably produces worse outcomes. • Doctors are often the recipients of gifts, free industry sponsored training (usually located in desirable vacation destinations) and money (for paid speaking engagements and consulting fees) that create conflicts of interest when it comes to prescribing medication. Goldacre does a careful and extensive job of documenting each of these failings using real-world examples to illustrate his points. Though this, at times, becomes a bit tedious for the reader as he hammers his point home with the diligent obsession of a vampire hunter who’s driving the umpteenth stake into the heart of his prey … just to make sure it’s dead. It can perhaps be forgiven given the fact that Goldacre is taking on a powerful industry that raked in more than 84 billion in profits in 2012. Goldacre also provides a list of practical solutions to the problems discussed. Given that everyone becomes ill at some time during their lives, this should be a non-partisan issue that doctors, the public and lawmakers can solve.The pharmaceutical industry performs an essential function that benefits society by creating products that can cure disease and alleviate suffering. Drug research, experiments and trials are complicated and expensive and so companies should be fairly rewarded in the marketplace for developing a successful product. However, we all have a vested interest in receiving the best treatments available as determined by the scientific evidence. Drug companies should compete based on the effectiveness of their treatments, not on their ability to hide, obfuscate or distort the evidence to grow marketshare."

The book is written so you don't need a science background, but I found some of the concepts and usage of biotech/pharmaceutical coporations and organisations and drug names would be hard to follow without prior knowlede. The book highlights the underlying flaws with how drugs are discovered, made and sold in the UK and USA (mainly). It's actually a very depressing read, as you realise how corrupt the system is. Ben Goldacre is a doctor himself, so has first hand experience with the industry, and he never uses examples or words them in such a way to make it biased to his point of view. Some of the cases he talks about are freak cases, however, the fact that they can still happen and there aren't regulations in place to prevent these preventable cases is more than terrifying!"
69,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25355313-syed-gilani,5,"Common sense about the relationship between pharmaceutical companies, medical practitioners, medical scholars and genii, regulators and medical journals is that pharma offers them “gifts” to seek favorable treatment over their competitors, and now we have the book that exposes the subterfuge, stratagem, deviousness, evasion, intrigue, hugger-mugger, and trickery of Pharmaceutical industry, effectively turning modern healthcare system into quackery. The celebrated Author, Ben Goldacre is an English physician, scholar and scientific research author, and he is editor of the blog the BadScience and regular contributor to the Guardian. What this book is about, here are a few things, I found in this book, are the fabrication of Test and Medical Trials, Ghost Medical Journalism, Falsified publications, Complicit Regulatory Framework well presented to the world in Simplified language for common reader.I do not recommend this book to the people with serious medical conditions of any sort."
70,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7868634-candi,5,"I learned a lot from this book! I think it gives a pretty comprehensive overview of the process of how medicines are created and how they get to the point where they are prescribed to patients. The book does paint a very bleak picture, and even though Ben gives suggestions about how things could be improved, when compared to the resources that the pharma industry has at its disposal it's hard not to feel disheartened. However, learning about these practices in the first place is a good first step to take, so I would recommend this book to anyone, as you are bound at some point to develop medical problems - the more you understand about how the information about treatments is distorted, the more you will be in a position to make good choices."
71,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72372247-thorkell-ottarsson,5,"This is a really scary book which shows how the pharmaceutical industry constantly lies, cheats, misrepresents, lobbies and bribe to make more money. They sell new drugs that are worse than the ones we already have but make it look like they are better. This does not only harm patients but has often lead to their death. If there is one thing I have learned from this book it is that one should be skeptical of new medicines. Many of them are way worse than what was discovered 60 years ago.A must read!"
72,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Bad Pharma: How Drug Companies Mislead Doctors and Harm Patients by Ben Goldacre“Bad Pharma"" is the eye-opening expose of the pharmaceutical industry. British physician, academic and science writer, Ben Goldacre follows up his international bestselling book “Bad Science” with yet another enraging investigative book of medical journalism. This insightful book takes you inside a secretive industry that relies on problematic practices for financial gain. This blood raising 448-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. Missing Data, 2. Where Do New Drugs Come From?, 3. Bad Regulators, 4. Bad Trials, 5. Bigger, Simpler Trials, and 6. Marketing.Positives:1.	Accessible, well-researched book that takes you inside the pharmaceutical industry.2.	Doctor Goldacre has great command over a fascinating topic.3.	Excellent format. The author lays out his critical arguments of the pharmaceutical industry by sections and provides pragmatic solutions. He is consistent throughout the book.4.	Does a great job of explaining key medical terms, and provides a glossary of terms for quick reference.5.	Exposes the conflict of interests within the industry…starting with industry-funded trials. Negative results that go missing in action and the danger of exposing people to unnecessary risks. “Because researchers are free to bury any result they please, patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine, from research to practice”.6.	The book provides countless examples involving well known drugs. Interesting stories behind them.7.	How the pharmaceutical industry influences doctors through false or misleading marketing, flawed trial designs and how regulators fail to regulate. 8.	Fascinating facts interspersed throughout book, “We’re very complicated animals, but we only have about 20,000 genes, so lots of the building blocks of the human body are used several times over, meaning that something which interferes with one target in the body might also affect another, to a greater or lesser extent, at a higher dose”.9.	Interesting look at the drug-producing process. The phases of the clinical trials. 10.	Inside the job of a drug regulator. The process and pressures of the job. “Research reviewing a long series of FDA votes found that experts are slightly more likely to vote in a company’s interest if they have a financial tie to that company”.11.	The reality behind accelerated approval for drugs.12.	Exposing fraud. ""There are all sorts of things we should be doing to catch outright fraud: better investigations, better routine monitoring, better communication from journal editors on suspicions about papers they reject, etc...""13.	How journals overstate results. Manipulating the data. ""if you chop up your data in lots of different ways, you can pull out lumpy subgroups with weird findings at will"".14.	Makes the compelling case for evidence-based medicine. 15.	The real purpose of drug reps. ""This is a huge business: the overwhelming majority of the industry’s promotional budget goes on influencing doctors, rather than patients, and about half of that gets spent on drug reps"".16.	The power of marketing, ""when you take a step back from pharmaceutical industry marketing, it is simply a process whereby patients pay money to drug companies, in order for them to produce biased information, which then distorts treatment decisions, making them less effective"".17.	The author explains what you can do as a consumer. Excellent advice.18.	The use of ghostwriters to influence the public.""Lilly set a goal of making Zyprexa ‘the number one selling psychotropic in history’, and its emails discuss using ghostwriters to present it in a positive light..."".19.	How the pharmaceutical industry uses money to buy influence and what is being done around the world to counter. The need for full disclosure.20.	Links worked great! Negatives:1.	The book repeats many of the same points almost to a fault. 2.	The author could have done a better job of espousing some of the great science that resulted in quality of life medication. The focus and tone of the book is almost exclusively critical. “Although this book is about problems, my goal is that pharma should be adequately regulated and transparent, to the extent that academics can feel positive and enthusiastic about collaboration with it”.3.	No formal bibliography, must sort through notes.In summary, a real eye-opening book worth reading. Doctor Goldacre exposes an industry that needs to be reformed for the well being of humanity. The focus of the book is to identify problems within the pharmaceutical industry and to provide pragmatic solutions with the ultimate goal of serving humanity. The book’s main ideas are repeated almost to a fault but the book is an invaluable expose of an industry that risks the well being of humans for financial gain. I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: ""Bad Science"" by same author, ""Deadly Spin"" by Wendell Potter, ""The Panic Virus"" by Seth Mnookin, ""The Emperor of all Maladies"" by Siddhartha Mukherjee, ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" by Rebecca Skloot, ""Merchants of Doubt"" by Erik M.

73,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69081633-hareth-al-maskari,4,"Ben Goldacre takes no prisoners in this book, giving criticism of every possible aspect of the pharmaceutical industry he seems to be able to find. He seems to not be interested in accepting their current attempts of fixing things but rather envisions a complete overhaul of the methods used in the industry. Overall I found this book a tough read and at times struggled to keep interest in many examples of poor research and presentation of findings that the book goes into, but overall I would say that this is a strong book with a clear, albeit sometimes idealistic message."
74,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10507936-fares,5,"This book has said almost everything I want to say about the current state of affairs of medical practice and biomedical research with regards to medications and the pharmaceutical industry! Very well done, Ben. It was pleasant meeting him back in 2016 when he visited Mayo Clinic in MN. He talks with passion about this in person, and you can sense that from reading his writings too. Highly recommended book."
75,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75265158-jesse-coker,5,"Important and worthwhile reading, even many years after the original publication. These problems continue to persist, and Goldacre’s fight for evidence based medicine is heroic. Required reading, especially for those in biomedical science. "
76,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8807144-marc-faoite,5,"Let’s get this out of the way right from the start – this is not a pleasant book to read. There is reading for pleasure, reading for entertainment and then there is reading for knowledge or understanding. This book falls in the latter categories.Author Ben Goldacre is a well-known figure in the field of popular science. He is a medical doctor by training and regularly writes for The Guardian newspaper. His column on ‘Bad Science’ eventually became a book. I first came across Ben Goldacre a few months ago through his TED talk (and if you still aren’t watching Ted Talks you owe it to yourself to visit TED.com - and while you are at it, get your kids onto ed.ted.com) and much of that talk is replicated, almost word for word, in this book.Bad Pharma is sending shockwaves through the pharmaceutical industry. It has even led to issues being raised in the British parliament.Like many readers I first started to learn about the unethical practices that are almost routine in the pharmaceutical industry when I read John Le Carré’s book The Constant Gardener. In the book’s afterword Le Carré said “by comparison with the reality, my story [is] as tame as a holiday postcard.”Bad Pharma is certainly no holiday postcard, but neither is it an outright condemnation of the pharmaceutical industry. Author Ben Goldacre pays homage to the many dedicated scientists active in the field and credits their dedication and hard work to saving countless lives. Equally he points out that many drugs are improving people’s health and quality of life. But not all of them.He sets out his evidence in passionate but level-headed arguments. While Bad Pharma can be a little technical at times it is well written and meticulously researched. He doesn’t just point fingers at problems, but analyses their causes and then offers constructive suggestions to solve them.The pharmaceutical industry makes profits of tens of billions of US Dollars every year. Reactions from the industry to Goldacre’s book range from outright denial to unfounded claims that the issues raised in Bad Pharma are historic and have already been resolved. Perhaps most telling is that the industry has been using some of the considerable resources at their disposal to engage in an unpleasant smear campaign striking out against the book and its author. One example of these unresolved issues is how Roche still refuse to release trial information on the anti-viral drug Tamiflu – a drug on which governments worldwide spent billions of US Dollars. The UK alone spent 500 million pounds on the drug and the Malaysian Health Ministry ordered at least RM4 million worth of the Tamiflu, despite a conspicuous lack of evidence as to the efficacy of the treatment or information as to its possible side effects.The main crux of the book is the issue of publication bias. Goldacre shows the extent of the collusion between pharmaceutical companies and scientists conducting clinical trials. 100% of clinical trials sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry produce favourable results. A pharmaceutical company is well within its rights to stop trials midway if results are not looking favourable. The results of these trials will never be published or shared. Evidence that may be harmful to the drug companies is routinely hidden or ignored. This pays forward to new work based on previous evidence and researchers may be completely unaware that research has shown that a certain drug might not actually work, or might even have harmful side-effects - including death.Not all clinical trials are industry sponsored, but even so ‘Positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings. This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine,’ says Goldacre.Essentially there is no way of knowing how much of the data obtained through clinical trials is hidden. Doctors have no way of making informed decisions when prescribing medication, and of course neither do patients. The pharmaceutical industry employs doctors to network with other doctors to recommend their drugs, without revealing that they are being paid to do so. Doctors are unknowingly prescribing medication to their patients that might not help them at all and often might make their illnesses worse. Goldacre cites plenty of evidence of this including one case where an estimated 100,000 people died because trial data on a drug had been deliberately buried.Other victims are the trial volunteers, who act out of altruism and risk their own health for the betterment of humanity. They sacrifice their time, and often their health, to provide evidence that has a very good chance of being hidden if the trial results are not seen to enhance the drug companies’ position.Goldacre calls for systemic reviews of all trial results, whether published or unpublished, favourable or unfavourable. Only then will doctors and patients have the information necessary to make informed decisions.Bad Pharma is essential reading for all doctors, those in the medical field and anyone under long-term medication, but be warned, the truth is shocking and you might find yourself getting angry while you read this book.

77,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62932943-jeremy-burrows,4,"An interesting book with some hard hitting messages. There was too much repetition and ranting, as well as some areas in which I disagree with the author, so couldn't rate it 5 stars."
78,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47414899-martin-mcneill,4,"I love Ben Goldacre and this is a great book, but it's a tough read because it's fact and figure based (by necessity). Absolutely terrifying and really well written as ever."
79,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10200951-ken-baker,4,"Bad Pharma is a chilling account of the practises of the global drug companies. Goldacre, a doctor himself, paints the picture in large, easy-to-understand brush strokes, bringing to life a truth that has been kept hidden from the public eye for many years: our medical system is broken. Completely. Utterly. Entirely. For the most part, the book is easy to read. The text flows easily off the pages, but the revelations are heavy. There is a gravitas to the rather colloquial tone by which he addresses the reader, and as one delves deeper into the book, the make-up and rose-tinted lighting of the industry are removed, revealing a truth that is both horrifying and deeply disturbing. Where does one begin? From the drug approval processes and faking trial data, to the doctors, academics and ethical committees who are supposed to protect us, the drug companies have dipped into their deep purses and have created a web of corruption and blatant ethical violations that is truly staggering in its depth and breadth. The approval process of new drugs is a minefield. Drug companies create the trials for the approval of their drug, which the government medical body then approves (based on the trial's success of course). This could be akin to a student writing and passing his own exam, and a lazy lecturer unable (or unwilling) to fact-check the results. The irony of the drug approval process should not be lost to the reader here. If the trials are not favourable to the (expensive) designer drug, then the drug companies employ another careful trick. They bury it the outcome, disappearing the evidence like some key witness in a mafia trial. They then continue to hold drug trials until they receive a positive outcome. Even if this is a fluke, the medical boards do not know (or care), and the drug approval process can begin - with you, the patient, being the guinea pig. One drug company even marketed an antidepressant to children - KNOWING that it caused an increase in suicidal tendencies, but hiding the data until it was forced to reveal the truth by a court order. Unfortunately this is not a one-time mistake, as Goldacre continues to reveal the misdeeds of the industry as we move further into the book. Our academic journals are equally corrupt - publishing flawed, pro-industry trials (why wouldn't they when the journals derive more than half their income from drug company advertisements?) and distorting the literature read by doctors, academics and researchers. Even our own doctors are profiled by the drug company reps from as early as their intern years, targeted and wooed by the flashy platinum of corporate credit cards. Doubt this? Despite what drug companies say, their spend more than TWICE the amount of money on advertising and marketing than they do on R&D. Something to ponder the next time you walk into your GP's office and examine the advertising on the walls, stationary, notebooks etc. etc. etc. This is a system of disinformation, where Big Pharma advertises drug benefits that don't even exist, and this disinformation continues into our doctors' future education (as the majority of post-university education for doctors is paid for by the drug industry). This is like MacDonald's sponsoring the Dietitian's Society.... oh, wait, they already do this. Our universities have failed us as well. Academics calmly attach their name to industry-authored trials, as if putting your name on a paper you did not write and collecting large kickbacks from the drug company is somehow *not* some enormous breach of ethics. If researchers are indeed ethical and want to publish negative trial results, they are slapped with gag clauses - meaning, if they reveal trial data - especially bad data about the drug's effects - they can be sued by the drug company. And despite industry-sponsored trials typically resulting in favourable outcomes for the drug in question compared to independently-sponsored trials (surprise, surprise), our academics, deans, and ethics committees sit back and fail to take accountability over their shocking ethical violations and complicit support of the drug industry trial manipulation. These are just a few of the examples in Goldacre's book of the misdeeds of Big Pharma. There are no conspiracy theories, no baseless opinions here - every assertion Goldacre makes is carefully referenced, every detail pulled from a large pool of studies, and often, from the very leaked documents the drug companies have tried to suppress. Why do I recommended this book? Because if you have ever popped a pill, treated an ailment, or are currently on medication - the answer is simple. YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK. Whether you are a doctor, nurse or patient awaiting treatment, we need to understand the drug industry is not what we have been taught, and the truth goes far, far deeper than we suspect. Nothing is more dangerous when one's eyes are closed, and Goldacre does an excellent job of shining a light on the truths the drug industry so desperately wants kept hidden. "
80,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29639851-robert-cubitt,1,"This is a story that should be on the front page of every newspaper, every day, until the scandal of poor practices by pharmaceutical companies is finally eradicated. The fact that this isn’t the case is a reflection of the content of the book. Well, it’s also a reflection of the lack of political will by successive governments, but I’m not reviewing them. Dr Ben Goldacre has turned what should be a compelling subject into a dirge of statistics.Dr Goldacre is a writer on matters of medical science for The Guardian newspaper, but I came to know him from an earlier book, Bad Science. In that book Dr Goldacre told how science is used badly by a wide range of vested interests, the newspapers included and how we, the public, are badly served because of it. It was an extremely interesting book and I have since recommended it to others, If you haven’t read it then I now recommend it to you.Bad Pharma, on the other hand, has none of the qualities of readability that made the earlier work so accessible.I think we are all aware that pharmaceutical companies are somewhat less than lily-white in the way they test and market their drugs. What we may not be aware of, and I certainly wasn’t, was how complicit doctors, medical journals, professional journals, academics, the wider science community and regulatory agencies are in their bad practice. Some of the very people that we rely on to protect us from the big bad pharmaceutical companies are inadvertently helping them to do what they do. To point a finger at the pharmaceutical companies alone is to do them a minor injustice. Note the use of the word ‘minor’. They are still as guilty as hell, as Dr Goldacre explains.I am of an age where I need to take drugs for a range of minor ailments. My doctor is able to tell me what each one is for and how it helps me. He can even tell me what the side effects are likely to be, in most cases. However, he may not be able to tell me about some side effects, because these have been concealed by the pharmaceutical companies and this is just a part of the scandal. I won’t name any of the drugs or drug trials to which Dr Goldacre refers, it may worry you unnecessarily, but if you do have any concerns please consult your own doctor.What is very questionable is whether my doctor understands how my cocktail of drugs interact with each other and may, consequently, be doing me harm. This is information I would expect my doctor to have at his fingertips, but because of the way drugs trials are run, documented and the results shared this may not be the case. Dr Goldacre explains why this is so. He explains it at length. He explains it so much that I could read no further.This is the problem with this book and the reason I have given it only one star.I regard myself as being well educated but I’m not a scientist, I’m not a mathematician and I’m not a statistician. After starting off with a fairly easy to read introduction Dr Goldacre soon drifts into the level of all those subjects that leaves me yawning.To give you an idea of the depth and complexity that the book reaches, by the time I had reached a 20% of the way through, that’s almost one fifth (joke) the author had referenced 82 different documents, journals and studies. References such as this are the way authors credit the work of others and are essential to prevent accusations of plagiarism, however, this is also an author’s way of saying “If you don’t believe me, here, go and look it up for yourself”. But to tell me, the reader, about all this work is so laborious that it sent me to sleep (several times). At least the only side effect of this sedative is a stiff neck!Was it all necessary? I don’t know, I’m not a scientist or a doctor. All I can say is that a reader that loses interest in a book is going to close it and certainly isn’t going to recommend it.I would like my MP to read this book and start a political campaign based on its contents, but I can’t be sure he will be any more successful in reading it than I was. I would like the Secretary of State for Health to read this book, or at least have someone read it for him (that’s not a slight, he’s just a very busy man), and then get the law changed, but the same problems exist. In writing the book the way he did Dr Goldacre has probably defeated his own purpose. Instead of exposing a scandal I suspect he has buried it.I will still recommend this book. I may even go back and have another crack at it myself sometime in the future when I’m stuck in an airport departures lounge with no other reading matter. The subject is important and deserves to be more fully debated, but on this showing I doubt most people will get any further than I did. It will be one of those books that lots of people have heard of, but very few have ever finished reading."
81,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,5,"Absolutely astonishing. This is how you make real change happen. Kudos to Dr. Goldacre for being angry, rigorous, and right. His anger has probably saved lives, and it definitely illuminates my soul."
82,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5675365-simon-howard,4,"Perhaps the most important things to say at the start of a review of Bad Pharma is that I think that Goldacre argues convincingly for a sound central thesis. I accept the argument that there are serious flaws in the pharmaceutical industry’s approach to the research, discovery, production and marketing of drugs, and in the pharmaceutical industry’s relationship with doctors (and vice versa). Goldacre’s clear elucidation of many of the issues deserves praise, and makes this a worthy book.I also, for the most part, enjoyed the conversational tone which Goldacre employs throughout. Normally, I’m irritated by excessive informality in tone, but Goldcare seems to strike a well-judged balance between formality and informality which worked well for me.I hope, then, that it’s clear that I think this is an excellent book which is well worth reading, for both a general and specialist audience. This is an unambiguous recommendation. But there were a few niggles within that I felt I couldn’t ignore in the context of a review.Firstly, there are occasions when Goldacre uses slightly sensationalist language without a clear explanation as to why. For example, he repeatedly refers to things – particularly emails – as “secret”, which he seems to use as a synonym for “unpublished”. To me, there is an important difference between something being unpublished, and something being secret. The latter refers to something that has been deliberately hidden and guarded, whereas the former is something that has merely not been conducted in the public sphere. Perhaps Goldcare has a justification for calling things “secret” which isn’t made explicit on every occasion, or perhaps he doesn’t. I don’t know, but I think that use of the term should be openly justified. There are other similar examples where I’d quibble over the use of particular words, too. But these are minor, minor points.Goldacre argues that the drive for private profits lies behind much of the wrongdoing in the pharmaceutical industry. I think this is probably fair, but there were two points here that I don’t think he discussed in quite the detail I would have liked.Firstly, the fact that drug companies pursue profits is not really the fault of the drug companies: it is the way we have chosen to structure our society. It could be argued that the pharmaceutical industry should be brought into the public sector, which could serve to remove the drive for profit. I think this is probably unworkable, and could’ve been demolished as a suggestion in a couple of paragraphs, but to me, omitting this discussion meant that there was a bit of a mismatch between saying that profit is the root of all evil within the industry, and a bunch of solutions that don’t address that central point.Secondly, that motivation doesn’t (presumably) apply to the public sector. I think there are issues in public sector research that are not dissimilar to those seen in the pharmaceutical industry. In particular, there seems to be a frequent problem of publicly funded studies being underpowered. Granted, Goldacre talks a lot about public bodies like the MHRA, but I think that exploring the problems specifically with publicly funded research would have been an interesting exercise, and might have helped reduce criticism that Goldacre is unfairly singling out the pharmaceutical industry.I also have slight concerns about Goldacre’s demand that every study should be published. In principle, I agree with this completely, and can see the argument for it. But I worry that there are probably oodles of really bad quality trials that are unpublished. So firstly, where do these get published? No journal is going to want to publish a terrible study. And secondly, given that Goldacre also describes a paucity of the skills required to critically appraise studies, is there not at least some risk that bad trials will not be recognised as such? I’m not sure how we navigate around this problem. I suspect Goldacre would argue that if all trials are brought out into the open, then the wheat will separate itself from the chaff, but I’m not entirely convinced.Overall, I should emphasise again, this is a great read, and an important book. I think it is well worth reading, and I think the niggles I have with it are testament to the fact that the book was engaging and made me consider its arguments. It comes highly recommended.This review originally published on http://sjhoward.co.uk/archive/2013/03..."
83,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558206-eric,0,"A useful read, especially for those of us who express pro-Scientific views on contemporary health concerns like vaccination, GMO's, organic food, and so on. What invariably happens in these arguments is that Regressivist appeal to Big Pharma, something like “I bet all those studies showing uselessness of vitamins are funded by Big Pharma because they want to sell you more pills.” If you are going to express a pro-Scientific stance on anything online, you owe it to yourself to gain a clear understanding of our current system's shortcomings. To engage constructively with crunchies and individualists, you need to have an even better understanding than they do about what is wrong with the current system. They have these vague ideas on Big Pharma as some cohesive evil entity responsible for the all the ills of modern society… this you need to be able to do an end-run on with a crisp understanding what the wrongful practices are, and what biases, incentives, regulations [or lack thereof] enable them. I love what Ben Goldacre claims to be his preferred “working title” of this book: The Information Architecture of Medicine has Several Interesting Flaws, Many of Which Inflict Avoidable Harm on Patients, But All of Which are Amenable to Cost-Effective Change, Were There to be Adequate Public and Political Will. Sort of thing you need to read if you're trying to cultivate a more mature understanding of the world, one which goes beyond an angels and demons understanding of things, but which looks very closely at systems with good people doing bad things.He points out that isn't really a book about outright harms so much as shocking inefficiencies in our system. The wrongful practices he describes here are unlikely to result in products that cause more harm to their patients than good; however, the impact of these practices is that we end up killing people with inefficiency. Shoddy evidence and shady marketing practices that cause us to make wasteful or suboptimal health decisions, treating people with drugs that may be better than placebo but no better than cheaper already existing alternatives, or giving them medications that have underreported side effects, or using unnecessary treatment (which aside from potentially harming patients leads to the whole opportunity cost thing). It's kind of a boring conclusion in a way, the scandal results in a statistical blip… but one which represents a lot of avoidable suffering.Gulp. I hope I'm reading the book right. The sort of biases reported in this book (publication bias particularly) should be particularly familiar to academics of all stripes. What makes medicine particularly interesting is how much money there is sloshing around in the system and how all this money can be used to corrupt the system. The book is both shocking and not in a way. It's not-shocking because at the end of the day it's about waste and inefficiency; but it is shocking if you look at the practices themselves.Some other strengths of the book: written to be very accessible to lay audience, has action points at the every section pointing out a problem or bad practice, action points which are broken down by user group (if you are a patient, you should X; if you are a doctor, you should Y)I feel also quite fortunate to have not gotten around to reading this book until a followup edition where Goldacre talks about how the book was received. Surprisingly well, it seems! Interesting bits and pieces: how having a top-down system like the NHS creates these really wonderful opportunities for data collection, Goldacre's wish for massive cheap-and-cheerful ongoing trials on competing current practices (this seems like a good idea), and also how the litigation-heavy American private system has its benefits too (bit more transparency for one). One really disturbing thing for me personal is the collusion between patient advocacy groups and the pharma companies. Also worth watching out for is the ever-present danger of Clear-washing, of letting people get away with “ok, fixed now”.Anyway, would love to see what you make of it."
84,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,2,"I wanted to like this book. It's about an important issue, made clear in the title. My problem with this book is that it's one-sided and comes off more as fear mongering than justified skepticism. Goldacre seems to have embraced the conspiracy theory point of view so toxic to this real problem. In order to paint medical science in a scary light, Goldacre starts the book with a gory description of the TGN1412 incident, just to frighten his readers.He often argues from false dichotomy and paints an all-or-nothing black-and-white picture of some imaginary island of pure science, surrounded by a sea of corruption. This just isn't how science works.There really are problems with actual corruption, harmful wishful thinking, and problems with the system. These are the major points he brings up ordered, in my opinion, from worst to least problematic:* Pharmaceutical representatives promoting their drugs to doctors.* Direct advertising of drugs to consumers in the US and Australia.* Cherry picking from among published studies.* Publication bias whereby unfavorable industry-funded studies aren't published.* Serious weaknesses in experimental design like switching primary outcomes, reliance on dodgy sub-group analysis, and ending trials earlier (or even later) than originally planned.* Subtle weaknesses in experimental design, like reliance on markers and surrogate outcome, conducting study on unrepresentative populations, and choosing a placebo control, as opposed to direct comparison between competing drugs. Goldacre actually calls placebo control ""rubbish"" which I find strange, because on the one hand, placebo works, and on the other hand, it's the definition of a perfect experimental control. He really wants direct comparison between drugs. So do I. But that doesn't make placebo control ""rubbish"" at all. He loses a lot of credibility with me because it sounds like he's trying to fool his audience. Also, the scientific method makes markers and surrogate outcomes a valid measure for rejecting the null hypothesis. He just says poo-poo to markers and surrogate outcomes, like cholesterol or blood sugar, which is simply wrong, because they are important and relevant to disease. Sometimes our assumed markers don't really do what we think, but when the mechanism is well-understood, the surrogate outcome is just as good as the ultimate outcome. Because science. As for studies on unrepresentative population, this is valid science which, like any study, can be misinterpreted by anyone who forgets or wants us to forget the population doesn't represent a doctor's average patient. That's part of the challenge of interpretation, and no strong reason to dismiss a study outright. Yet Goldacre includes this as if it's some tool used by the evil conspirators to sell their drugs to people who don't need them. That's just a bit too paranoid of an accusation for my taste.* Lack of transparency in direct access to unpublished work and raw data. Goldacre is quick to point out the Cochrane Collaboration and the hurdles they face in persuading companies to hand over data. This strikes me as insolent whining. It would be awesome to setup special data systems to improve transparency. Demanding companies to conduct free investigative work for you in attempt to undermine confidence in their product is unreasonable. He calls this ""withholding"" which is just wrong. It's resistance to obnoxious, threatening harassment. Goldacre loses a lot of credibility by trying to hide the morality of this issue behind empty accusations of conspiracy theory.* Gag clauses on industry-funded research contracts, and their secrecy. Goldacre espouses a ""just label it"" policy for gag clauses. This makes him seem ignorant of some of the basics of contract law. It's also illogical. We can just assume that standard gag clauses are on all industry contracts. Forced labeling (gag-free, gluten-free, or fat-free, etc.) only serves as a phony badge of honor for any study which didn't include such a warning label.* Some PDF files on the FDA website aren't searchable. Is this really a serious problem? Really?"

The protagonist in this book, Mungo Warner, grows up unsure of his sexuality, receiving mixed messages from his body, his mind and the world around him. The book tells the story of the life of Mungo from his early years until his mid-twenties. It starts off in 1950s Chester with Mungo confined to the dark of a cellar by his domineering, bullying father, for some minor childish misdemeanour. His only comfort is his dog, Gyp, who is being similarly punished. The story then follows Mungo through his childhood at choir school, then adolescence and into his adulthood and his chosen career in the theatre.Throughout his developing years Mungo’s relationship with his father is fraught, to say the least. His father is a bully and his mother is cowed down him, able to do little to ease Mungo’s troubles. An adolescent adventure finds Mungo in a rather louche club frequented, but not exclusively, by gay people. When his father, a prominent surgeon, finds out he sends Mungo to see a colleague, a psychiatrist, to be administered some rather unpleasant aversion therapy. When Mungo decides to pursue a career in the Theatre, albeit backstage, his father disowns him.One of the problems that Mungo has is that he is very attractive. Meriel Brooke uses the term pretty rather than handsome. He becomes a target for attention not just from girls but also from boys, especially an older boy named Hilary. The confusion in Mungo’s mind is palpable and is a major theme throughout the story, especially as he is attracted to Hilary in return.To say more about what happens would be to spoil the story for the reader, but what I can tell you is that Mungo’s life doesn’t become any easier, in terms of his confusion, as he grows older.I have only awarded four stars to a story that might be worth five, and there are two reasons for this.Firstly, in many ways, life is too easy for Mungo. Whatever he decides to do turns out well for him and this reduces the tension within the story. When he decides to get work in the theatre he is given a job almost on the nod. When he applies to join the Royal Shakespeare Company his audition is successful even though he has had no formal training as an actor. When he talks to a film producer about getting a job he just happens to have a leading role as yet uncast and for which Mungo is ideally suited. I felt that it would have added to Mungo’s internal struggle for him to have to have also had to deal with a few more external struggles. Life just isn’t that easy, there are things we can’t control and plans don’t work out just because we want them to.The other problem I had with the story was a low level of emotional engagement at some points. There are at least two incidents described in the book which would have had a severe traumatic effect on Mungo and I didn’t really feel that trauma. They happened. He got over it. End of. There is an incident early in his life in particular that would have left some severe confusion in Mungo’s mind and possibly have affected his future choices. Today, assuming Mungo’s assailant was still alive, it could even have seen him making a complaint to the police about an historic sex crime.Notwithstanding those issues this is an interesting story and one that many readers may be familiar with on a personal level. Overall it is well told and well-paced, with likeable characters and a couple of interesting plot twists. When describing Mungo’s experiences in the theatre Meriel Brook artfully drops the names of contemporary actors into the plot, which helps to make it feel more authentic, as do her descriptions of Chester and its environs. In the end I really do feel for Mungo and hoped that he would make the right decisions and find true happiness."
86,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5847899-patrick,4,"It's not as funny as Bad Science, but the complex statistical fiddles pulled by, and the perverse incentives operating within, the international pharmaceutical industry are never going to produce as many laughs per minute as Gillian McKeith's claim that the chlorophyll in broccoli will oxygenate your blood, or the idiocy of 'Brain Gym'....It is, however, a very well put together piece of science journalism, which takes a complex cluster of problems surrouding how our medicines are developed, tested, marketed and monitored, and distilling them into a book which makes sense to the layman (or at least, it did to me and though I have some now very hazy background knowledge of statistics and probability, I suspect he's forgotten more than I ever knew about statistics, and I've forgotten most of what I did know...)He is good at getting across why such apparently arcane issues as why it is really important that trials are not abandoned half way through (unless, of course, the drug is killing the patients) and why trials with poorly defined hypotheses tilt matters in favour of a drug company trying to argue that its new drug is a great thing and the fact that a lot of this stuff simply never gets published all actually matter.The section on the collusion of those who are supposed to be acting as our watchdogs - the European Medicines Agency and the FDA, was rather shocking. I couldn't help wondering about their motives for refusing to release their own safety and efficacy testing data. Are they reluctant to have their decisions second-guessed by armchair experts? Are they in the pocket of those they are nominally meant to be policing? Or is it all driven by a fear of legal repercussions, whether from campaigners who get access to the raw data which could reveal mistakes which they have made, or from the pharmaceutical companies who gave them the data in the first place? Perhaps its a mix of all three.It seemed, to me at least, that the current state of affairs benefits nobody, not even the pharmaceutical companies themselves. After all, would they lose out, on aggregate, if information about which of their products are most effective for any given condition was much more widely available. These are, after all, vast, multinational businesses who will each have many drugs on their books. If MegaPharma's drug for condition X turns out not to be as effective as GlobalPharma's alternative product and they lose business to them, then the chances are, it will be balanced out when GlobalPharma's drug for condition Y turns out not to be as useful as MegaPharma's. I doubt that any one of the big players, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline or Novartis, is consistently producing all the duff medicines, after all.It does all beg that old leftie agitator's question: What is to be done? Goldacre has a go at answering this at the end of the book, but unfortunately, I couldn't help thinking his proposed solution assume the issue of drug regulation can be made rather more of a high-profile one than I can see it becoming. After all, we are all now quite aware of the failings of the banking industry, and this does not appear to have led to meaningful change. With medicine, the failures are much less obvious, and the problems less apparent to the outsider. To paraphrase Orwell, if there is hope, it probably lies with the doctors - those whose job it is to understand the question of what drugs are effective for treating what conditions.Now I'm off to go inject myself with beta-interferon, keeping my fingers crossed that the data on its effectiveness is solid, and it's not just a placebo..."
87,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12378947-sum,5,"Pharmaceuticals are probably this century's greatest gift to modern medicine, in that they increase a person's lifetime longevity and create incredible odds of survival against ailments that would have killed us much earlier. The industry capitalises on the most basic of instincts: the need to survive through good health. And it targets people who aid this process: nurses, doctors and academics. The most shocking revelation of this whole book is the disparity between the interests of the pharmaceutical company in genuinely treating diseases or symptoms, and making a profit. What's more shocking is how these companies (with apparent public health interests - like GSK advertises on its website) infiltrate regulating bodies, the lives of academics (via targeting of individuals who they believe would be likely to support them, or keeping extensive notes on the lives of a doctor gained from a sales rep so that this could be used to create a more fluid rapport, or treating doctors/ nurses to fancy dinners and holidays, etc) and wiggle their way around laws (for example, by delaying patents), in order to achieve the greatest revenue. Ben Goldacre does a brilliant job at marrying this together with the methods employed to increase the likelihood of positive results and make dubious findings seem like legitimate conclusions. To list a couple of these dubious methods that he mentions: - missing trials- following a 'per protocol' analysis over a more vigorous 'intention to treat'- reporting the relative risk over the absolute risk - which yields a higher percentage value than the actual figure, to create a psychological bias- bias within the recruiting sample by using ultra healthy controls who do not reflect people on a variety of medications- having 'ghost writers' who write in the best commercial interests of the company rather than producing a balanced account - to capitalise on the lack of time that clinicians have to write a paper that involves conceptualising the idea, writing it up, peer review, etc. - using a different statistical analysis from the one that was initially intended that can create bias- having a different primary outcome, once data has been collectedThe greatest strength of this comes from the fact that he uses many studies, and meta-analysis to support his arguments. His book is also very clear, lacking the convoluted, hard-to-read language that many academic papers can consist of. I would love to see some of the pragmatic solutions that he offers to be placed in practice, from the culture change offered (i.e., to embed clinical trials into a routine part of treatments) to regulatory change (for example, by greater transparency in all aspects, to the full publication of findings) - that can in the future, lead to industry & frontline healthcare striving together to attain goals that work in the best interests of the users. This can stimulate good, clean clinical trials that are transparent and truthful of the effects of the drugs, and help to stimulate innovation by ensuring: 1) R&D interests of the drugs companies are directed towards the areas or symptomalogy or side-effects of drugs that require investigation and 2) to produce honest marketing campaigns that are true to reality, rather than producing spin - that lead to a culture of open dissemination of findings. In sum, I think this book is an essential read for everyone who holds even the remotest curiosity or connection to pharmaceuticals, healthcare or public policy. "
88,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,4,"Ben Goldacre, author of Bad Science, media personality on The Infinite Monkey Cage and critic of alternative medicines, turns his eye towards those who give science a bad name and support bad science for a variety of reasons. He first hinted about writing this critique of the pharmaceutical companies in Bad Science but now he takes the bull completely by the horns.This book was published in 2012 at a time when the good doctor was using his column in The Guardian to call for more open access in science and publication of all research data, no matter how negative it is for each drug. Sadly, he hasn’t written for the newspaper since December 2014. I can only hope he is doing more work on projects like this in calling for more open access papers, the break down of the stranglehold by journal editors and too much private investment corrupting the scientific process. Good science is necessary and for too long, substandard medicines have made their way onto the market pushed by big companies that spend more on marketing than they do on research.This is a book that will educate, inform and anger you at the same time. Ben Goldacre is a GP and a public advocate of science. If you are looking for a book that points out the flaws of the pharmaceutical industry purely to reinforce your belief that ginseng infused green tea will cure your cancer, you should look elsewhere. That is not what this is about. It is important to reiterate that just because some pharmaceutical companies engage in bad practice, it doesn’t mean that medical science is useless. Pharmaceutical companies are not perfect and nobody is claiming they are. Some are engaging in bad scientific practice – it is that and only that which Goldacre wants to draw our attention.If anything, it points out how wonderful the scientific method is, how useful it is when done properly. It reinforces the importance of medical science and the lengths to which some go to bury bad data.At the start, he goes into detail about how science is supposed to work. Early on he explains what the peer review is for the benefit of those who do not know. He includes the necessary development of the Systematic Review including the use of highly functional yet simple “Blobbograms”. All of this, like his previous book, is nicely set out to cater to all audiences. There is succinct explanation for the interested observer without feeling overwhelmed and enough detail for medical professionals without feeling they are back at their very first lecture at the start of their medical degrees.There are few chapters and they are lengthy, but conveniently broken down into subsections. This is especially useful as the writing can sometimes be dense, particularly when he talks about statistics, research methodology, meta-analysis and so on. These are concepts about which I am familiar and even I felt bogged down. For those who do not have scientific background, it may be one of the hardest concepts to understand.Nevertheless, Goldacre is a phenomenal writer and he manages to pull of balancing the reader’s needs with style. As ever, just like his Guardian column, it is a pleasure and informative to read his work and come away feeling like you learnt something. It is not really light bedtime reading, but if you want a book to really get your teeth into, this is one that will certainly do that. The content is rather dry though. It’s certainly heavy going and it’s not the amusing page Turner that Bad Science was. Nevertheless, those with an interest in medical science should read this."
89,0865478007,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7492291-david-glad,5,"This was an interesting read, especially for mentioning pro publica's Dollars for Docs site (can web search it) to find out how much your doctor is being paid off by Big Pharma to promote their drugs. (Eli Lilly for instance being a popular result in the tens of thousands if we are talking a doctor prescribing diabetes medication.)Guess the only weakness was doing a web search on the topic of ""First-In Man Trials"" which have a heightened risk of being untested for consequences on humans where the experiment he mentions was done by a small biotech company (versus ""Big Pharma"") and claiming a test done 10 years earlier should have been a red flag to avoid doing this. (Found out about the inaccuracy by doing a web search on the term and a Forbes article criticizing that part of the book. Although it agreed the amount of people being tested on it should have been less given the risk, it otherwise claimed the trial ten years before was not quite the same and of course tiny biotech being different from the villains being targeted overall.)Otherwise this book does seem fairly consistent with arguments I have heard before, especially in that former Viagra salesman's autobiography Hard Sell on the industry's tactics to get ""unbiased"" and ""objective"" doctors to push often high-priced drugs even when cheaper alternatives are available. Plus goes deeper into other motivations, such as the clock immediately starting on patent protection expiring (even if that is over a decade away) to get the drug to market as quickly as possible and drug tests only being published if they are favorable (though in some cases not necessarily being proven to be better than generics, instead opting for a placebo which the author deems criminal in the case of life-threatening illnesses) rather than any requirement that all tests must be published. Obviously the other big one is having sunk a ton of money into R&D (which must be expensed immediately for purposes of a company's income statement) and wanting to see a quick payback, though not as stressed. Other great topic was how ""patient groups"" are often heavily funded and just a front for Big Pharma and doctors who insist they are not biased by getting paid trips and other perks by Big Pharma have been proven to in fact be influenced to push their drugs. Along with how pharmaceutical reps often compile the rolodex and learn about the personalities of doctors (how easy they can be influenced; avoiding ones who insist on indisputable objective facts and information) while they are still in medical school without them realizing it.In the audiobook version, author Ben Goldacre is also interviewed and talks about the reason why the Pharmaceutical lobby did not bother attacking his book is they hope he would fade quietly and the books turned to pulp rather than the book getting mention anywhere. (Do not believe it was mentioned, but probably also true that any discovery process in a lawsuit could turn up much more damaging facts than the author could have dreamed of mentioning in the book. As I am somewhat familiar with the McLibel story.)Although this book was by a UK author, he does frequently indicate the same is largely true of the US and EU markets."
