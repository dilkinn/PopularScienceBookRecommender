Addressing key topics in largely qualitative terms without formal mathematics, the six selections discuss atoms in motion, basic physics, the relation of physics to other sciences, conservation of energy, the theory of gravitation, and quantum behavior.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه نوامبر سال 2009 میلادی عنوان: شش قطعهٔ آسان؛ نویسنده: ریچارد فاینمن؛ مترجم محمدرضا بهاری؛ تهران، هرمس، 1387، در نه، 198ص؛ مصور؛ شابک 9789643635558؛ موضوع نوشتارهای علمی از دانشمندان امریکایی - مبانی فیزیک به روایت ریچارد فاینمن - سده 20متصور غلط و رایجی هست که علم مقوله ‌ای است فاقد جنبه‌ های شخصی، بی‌طرف و کاملاً واقع‌نگر اسن؛ فعالیت‌های انسانی‌ِ دیگر، بیشترشان متأثر از روندهای رایج، خواسته ها و اشخاص‌ هستند؛ اما فرض بر آن است که علم محدود به قواعد و روش‌های پذیرفته‌ شده و مقید به آزمون‌های بسیار دقیق‌ است؛ مهم نتایج هستند؛ نه کسانی که آنها را به دست می‌آورندعلم هم همچون همه‌ ی تلاش‌های انسان فعالیتی است انگیخته‌ ی آدمیزاد و به همین مناسبت تابع مد و هوس است؛ در این مورد آنچه مُد را تعیین می‌کند، بیش از آنکه موضوع بحث باشد، جهان‌ بینی دانشمندان است؛ هر دورانی به شیوه‌ ی ویژه ی خود با مسائل علمی رودررو می‌شود، و این رویکرد معمولاً پس از آن برگزیده می‌شود، که شخصیت‌های علمی‌ِ پیشگام، و با نفوذ، دستور کار را تعیین، و بهترین روش‌های رسیدن به نتیجه را شرح کرده‌ اند؛ گاهی دانشمندان آنقدر پرآوازه می‌شوند، که توجه‌ همگی مردمان را هم جلب می‌کنند، و اگر از موهبت استعداد شگرف هم بهره‌ مند باشند، ممکن است نماد تمامی جامعه‌ ی علمی شوند؛ ریچارد فاینمن، همچون نیوتون، و آینشتین، نماد فیزیک آخرین دهه‌ های سده ی بیستم میلادی شدند، و ایشان نخستین آمریکایی‌ ست، که به این جایگاه رسیده اند؛ نقل از متن پشت جلد: ...؛ اما مهم‌ترین کشف در کل نجوم این است که ستاره‌ ها هم از همان نوع اتم‌هایی که در زمین داریم درست شده‌ اند؛ وای که در هر جمله‌ ی این داستان مختصر چقدر مطلب هست...؛ شاعران گفته‌ اند که علم، زیبایی ستاره‌ ها را ضایع می‌کند، چون‌که آن‌ها را صرفاً کُره‌ هایی از اتم‌ها و مولکول‌های گاز می‌داند...؛ امّا من هم می‌توانم ستاره‌ ها را در آسمان شبِ کویر ببینم و شکوه و زیبایی‌شان را حس کنم...؛ شیفته و مبهوت این چرخ فلک، با چشم‌های کوچکم می‌توانم نورهایی به قدمت یک میلیون سال را هم ببینم؛ چه نقش و نگار عظیم و پر ابهتی است اینکه خود من هم جزئی از آنم. آنچه تنم را ساخته، شاید روزگاری شراره‌ ای بوده باشد که از ستاره‌ ی فراموش شده‌ ای بیرون زده است؛ یا می‌توانم این چرخِ فلک را با چشم‌ بزرگ تلسکوپ پالومار تماشا کنم و ببینم که ستاره‌ ها دارند از همدیگر، از نقطه‌ ی آغازی که شاید زمانی سرچشمه‌ ی همه‌گی‌شان بوده‌ است، دور می‌شوند؛ این نقش چگونه است، معنی این حرکت‌ها چیست؟ جست‌وجو برای فهمیدن این چیزها گمان نمی‌کنم لطمه‌ ای به رمز و راز و زیباییِ این چرخ فلک بزند؛ راستی شاعران امروزی چرا حرفی از این چیزها نمی‌زنند؟ چه‌ جور مردمانی هستند این شاعران که اگر ژوپیتر خدایی در هیئتِ انسان باشد چه شعرها که برایش نمی‌سرایند اما اگر در قالبِ کره‌ ی عظیم چرخانی از متان و آمونیاک باشد سکوت می‌کنند؛ پایان نقل از متن پشت جلد کتاب ا. شربیانی"
1,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/639407-tulpesh-patel,4,"There is not much more to be said about Richard Feynman’s impact on physics or science communication; the man is as bona-fide legend and as close to being a worshipable God as scientists can have. Six Easy Pieces is a collection of the ‘easiest’ six chapters from Richard Feynman’s most-celebrated text book The Feynman Lectures on Physics. The ‘easy’ in the title, is, like our sense of time, all relative. The lectures, delivered in the early 60’s, were aimed at “the most intelligent in the class [freshman and sophomore physics students at Caltech, one of the most prestigious institutions in the world] and to make sure, if possible, that even the most intelligent student was unable to encompass everything…” We, as the general reader, are more like the ‘secondary’ audience for the lectures, who for Feyman at the time were the students “for whom the extra fireworks are merely disquieting and who cannot be expected to learn the material in the lecture at all”. Such was Feynman’s power of exposition, however, you can follow the science, each chapter getting progressively more complicated and abstract, without ever feeling like you’re being left behind.The first three chapters, on Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, were so good I read them twice. Their broad remit means they touch on lots of different things, with one astonishing idea thrown in after the other. Mind-body dualism from a physicists perspective: “When an animal learns something, it can do something different than it could before, and its brain cells must have changed too, if it is made out of atoms. In what way is it different?”The final three chapters, on the Conservation of Energy, the Theory of Gravitation and Quantum behaviour are a little heavier, but no less interesting. There’s the occasional formula, which immediately starts the eyes glazing over, but, to the lay reader, they serve to remind you just how much of the book is mathematics translated into wonderful, approachable prose. I’ve read about things like Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle or the “double-slit” experiment, which showed that at the quantum level particles behave both waves and particles, many times before, but is actually the first time that I really *got it*. For that, I cannot recommend the book enough. For those looking for more pop-physics in a similar vein, I can really recommend Why Does E=MC2 by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, Quantum by Manjit Kumar and Black Holes, Worm Holes and Time Machines by Jim Al-Khalili. Having now read Six Easy Pieces, I can see the obvious influence of Feynman on the not just their content but their delivery and style.There are also three prefaces to the edition of the book I read. Paul Davies’ introduction and David Goldstein’s special preface set the backdrop to the book and the lectures. The most interesting preface is the one written by Feynman himself for the original edition, in which he talks about how he set about piecing the course together, who it was aimed at and why, and how ultimately he felt that he had let his students down in some way. It shows just how much thought he put into the lectures and just how much he cared about educating his students. In some way, as someone enjoys teaching and talking about science, I learnt a lot from these few pages as I did from the rest of the book. Its 50 years since The Feynman Lectures on Physics were published. Our understanding of the universe, and particularly quantum mechanics, has moved on in leaps and bounds but at no point did Six Easy Pieces feel like it was out of date because Feynman’s timeless ways of explaining complicated physics in uncomplicated ways. "
2,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655438-courtney-lindwall,3,"Note to reader: I am not within Feynman's target demographic...So if anyone is familiar with Feynman's ""claim to fame,"" it's basically the idea that he's the most brilliant Physicis teacher of the 20th century and his lectures are ingenius in both their presentation and method. Now, I'm not the most science-inclined person out there. I've never taken even a preliminary physics course (and these lectures were intended for his intro Caltech class, so...). But I'm also not dumb as a rock, either. With that said, I didn't understand much of this book. I could follow along vaguely and in general terms. But could I explain to someone else what gravitational energy is now? Definitely not. In fact, I can barely remember the different topics in the book now because of how little I actually retained about them.For people who think this is going to be a magical book that will teach what were once almost mysteriously complicated ideas with wonderful simplicity - think again. You would never become truly knowledgeable on any of these topics with only this small of an overview. But, if you are scientifically inclined, it might at least be interesting and prompt you to take your learning further. It does get more technical than I thought it would. Although nowhere near as technical as the topics actually go.All in all, I didn't really enjoy it. Which is why it's 3 stars. But I could see its merit for Physics students and it did bring to light various big questions about science in general, which is why it didn't get 2 or 1. "

"
4,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3742957-brent,4,Contains the best explanation for the uncertainty principle I have come across. Still trying to wrap my mind around quantum mechanics though.
5,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14129090-laoonatic,5,"I think that, when reading this book, you have to be familiar with physics and maths. There are a lot of books claiming to be for the neophytes in physics/maths/astrology etc. but, truth be told, there is little to be learned when in that position. Which is why people shouldn't consider this book as being no good just because they haven't reached the paradise of enlightment which was promised to them. Such a thing isn't possible. Not from a single book, as far as I know, and anyway, not from this one. I've been studying both maths and physics for quite some time, but in the manner of a poorly prepared educational system, meaning the focus was more on solving problems and ingesting pages of theory and less on really understanding them. And Feynman's lessons really shed some light on the mess in my head. I can't claim I thoroughly understood everything in this book, but I surely enjoyed Feynman's way of following gradually to smaller scales what happens in an apparently simple process, until he reaches the ""core"" of it.Also, you can't ignore his way of being even poetic at times, which is really why this book won my heart. I have a weakness for science being romanticized. And all ovations go to Richard Feynman for doing this so tactfully."
6,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53036232-rebecca,3,"so this book (if you were at all interested) is a collection of the six 'most basic' lectures delivered by richard feynman when he taught caltech 1st year physics undergrads in the early 1960s. feynman is famously an excellent communicator and very good at explaining physics-y things and coming up with analogies. honestly though, i was a little disappointed.admittedly, i thought the chapter on quantum behaviour (6) was *fantastic*, and probably the best and most thorough explanation i've come across. the maths was a little elusive and unexplained, but that didn't bother me too much as i'm sure i'll learn about it in time & it's not necessary to understand what's going on. but i would definitely recommend this chapter (which you can read online for free - http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.ed...) to anyone to wants to understand quantum behaviour. + i did also enjoy the first two chapters in the book as well, which were on atoms in motion and basic physics.the rest of the book, however, was quite meh. the chapter on the relationship between physics and other sciences (3) was often very vague and seemed to be stating the obvious a lot of the time, although i did find it quite interesting in places (for instance the section on geology and biology, even if the latter seemed to drag on a bit). chapter (4) which was on conservation of energy was pretty confusing sometimes and otherwise pretty unmemorable.so, pretty hit and miss... 2.5 stars? "
7,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11233506-christopher,4,A really lucid introduction to physics—lecture style. 
8,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"In these lectures, Feynman is very good at explaining some basic concepts for those fairly new to physics. For field theory, he uses the analogy of waves in a pool to show how motion in one place affects motion in a distant place. He says that matter goes straight unless acted upon by an external force, but we don't know why; that the earth is pulled toward the sun, as opposed to the earth moving around the sun; and that atoms are always in motion (""jigglings and wigglings of atoms"") and that such movement increases with the application of heat. Feynman stimulates some interesting issues and questions. Under the principle of conservation of energy, the overall amount of energy remains constant; only re-arrangement of energy/atoms occurs. Feynman states that in joining together, atoms ""like certain particular partners, certain particular directions, and so on."" In this way he explains why atom combinations (attraction) take particular forms and resist being something other than such forms. This 'integrity' at the quantum level suggests a 'social' context where atoms interact with each other for particular 'reasons' and that an 'inner character' lies at the heart of quantum physics, as opposed to randomness. Feynman also writes that atoms ""want"" and that ""It is the job of physics to analyze why each one wants what it wants."" ""Want"" is an interesting choice of words. He defines inertia by saying that ""If something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.)"" Does the reference to ""coasting"" mean that a body is passively carried along in space? If so, carried by what, and what is space? Feynman says we don't really know what energy is, but does it involve a 'power' differential where matter and energy move to states of equilibrium? If this is so, then is this one way that gravity (differences in mass and distance) might have a parallel at the quantum level (weight of atoms as they combine or recombine)? Feynman writes that ""all planets push and pull each other."" If ""pull"" is attraction of bodies to each other, it's not clear what push means. For that matter, it's also not clear how ""push and pull"" relate to Einstein's spacetime curvature (oddly, Feynman discusses Einstein's relativity only briefly). Regarding push-pull (attraction-resistance) Feynman makes some suggestive comments when he states that ""the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the law of gravitation...."" In describing the earth's movement around the sun, Feynman says that the earth impinges ""on more particles which are coming from its forward side than from its hind side."" Does this mean that the earth ""bunches up space"" (""particles"") as it moves through its orbit and is this related to the earth's gravity? Elsewhere, Feynman states that ""the earth can be understood to be round merely because everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself together as far as it can!"" Gravity is not some (mystical) force at the center of the earth, but a pulling of matter and energy inward, against itself, toward the center. While this is all fun stuff to think about, these Feynman lectures do not enlighten much a lay person's understanding of the uncertainty principle, annhilation and antimatter, and absolute time. His last lecture on quantum behavior is particularly difficult. Feynman is at his best discussing the role of doubt and uncertainty in science. When he differs with the theories of the past or of his contemporaries, he seems respectful enough, saying that they are not wrong, but ""a little wrong"" or ""incomplete."" His footnote at the bottom of p. 59 directly challenges those who say wonder and awe are the province of poetry and religion, not science. He also blends life and non-life together when he says that ""'Everything is made of atoms....there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics.'"" This is Feynman at his best, and a good challenge for those attempting to put philosophy on a solid materialistic foundation.  "
9,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,4,"Great book. Feynman is as enigmatic as usual and his descriptions are vivid and inspiring. He begins discussing atoms and shows us how we can understand the world around us using the simple concept of 'jiggling' atoms. I found this to be a profound and exiting way of understanding how things truly work, for example, why does tea cool down when we blow on it? Well, we cause some of the atoms (well molecules in reality) of the tea to get so excited and jiggly that they break away from the liquid and fly off into the air. The more jiggly they are to start with, the more likely they are to break off, thus the tea gets less jiggly and jigglyness is equivalent to heat. Hence the tea gets cooler. The sections on conversational energy, Gravitation and Quantum mechanics are a little basic but interesting nonetheless (after all these are the easy pieces)! "
10,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,I think it is very rare for someone to be not only brilliant but also a wonderful teacher. Feynman has a very clear and direct style of imparting information. I just love it. Not quite as good as his autobiographical one but still very good. 
11,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5413456-gina,3,"Apparently these are the 6 ""easiest to understand"" (despite the inclusion of quantum mechanics!"") of the Feynman lectures. Some of them flit too much from one thing to another; I'm sure they were interesting as lectures but they are not the ideal way to read about a topic. However, the way Feynman explains certain concrete idea is really interesting; in particular the chapter on quantum mechanics is good and easy to follow. I'm on the fence as to whether to read the full set of lectures."
12,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,4,"In the early 1960s the renown physicist, Richard Feynman, delivered introductory courses on physics to first and second year undergraduate students at Caltech, in the USA. His lectures were very popular at the time and whilst aimed at undergraduates, it wasn't uncommon for graduate physics students to infiltrate his classes; the one thing Feynman could be assured of was a full house each time he came to teach this course. The lectures, after some editing, were published in three large volumes. To provide a flavour of the overall series, this book extracts just six from the collection and, as the title of this book suggests, these are regarded as being six of the easier ones to understand. They're entitled ""Atoms in motion"", ""Basic physics, ""The relation of physics to other sciences"", ""Conservation of energy"", ""The theory of gravitation"" and ""Quantum behaviour"". (There is a companion volume published under the title ""Six not-so-easy pieces"" but I've not attempted to read that.) I was attracted to this book not so much by the subject matter, but more by my interest in Feynman himself. He has a solid reputation for being an inspirational teacher and I was keen to see how he managed to achieve this. I was expecting him to take a different strategy from the norm and I wasn't disappointed. To illustrate what I mean, in his lecture on the atom he didn't follow the conventional approach of describing the structure of atoms and building up from there, yet by the end of the talk his students would have heard a physicist's explanation of why blowing on a bowl of soup cools it down. His approach to teaching was so different to what is usually done.Understandably, given the date of the lectures, there have been major developments in physics, and science in general, since the lectures were first presented. For instance, the talk on nuclear physics is very out of date because the make-up of protons and neutrons was not understand at that time to the extent that it is now. Likewise, the lecture covering the links between physics and biology pre-dates the discovery of the genetic code. Therefore, it is pointless reading this book to gain an understanding of the latest theories. Nevertheless, not everything has changed in 50 years and some lectures are as relevant today as they were then. For example, the lecture on the conservation of energy was wonderfully presented, especially the section on potential energy where Feynman used illustrated examples to explain the conservation of potential energy in reversible machines. On the other hand, I felt he made heavy weather of his account of the two slit experiment in his lecture on quantum mechanics and I've read much better explanations elsewhere. To a marked extent Feynman did over complicate much of his material but this is to expected since his stated intention was to teach to slightly beyond the level of the brightest students in each class; of course, whether or not this was the best strategy is open to debate.Overall, this book of six ""easy"" lectures provides remarkable insight into Feynman's style of teaching. He comes across as someone who knew his subject matter inside out, who had boundless energy and complete self-confidence, and who wanted to stretch the minds of his students."
13,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/896694-mark,2,"If you have heard about the ""weirdness"" of quantum mechanics but don't know what the hype is all about, look no further than chapter six of this book. In chapter six, with his usual down-to-earth approach, Feynman describes one of the most famous experiments in physics (the double-slit experiment) and what it tells us about the way fundamental particles behave. He compares the behavior of ""lumps"" to the behavior of ""waves"" before moving on to the behavior of electrons... and the outcome might surprise you (it surprised early 20th-century physicists, too). This is a classic lesson in quantum mechanics taught by one of the classic teachers of physics. And there's no math required.I only gave this book two stars because the other five lectures in this book aren't overly memorable and come nowhere near to being Feynman's greatest lessons. But chapter six alone makes this book worth picking up, especially if you want an introduction to wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, and the conundrum of quantum measurement that is accessible to the layperson but that also demands that you stretch your mind. It's a brief introduction that cuts to the essence of what is going on and, while giving you a decent grounding, will leave you ready to dig deeper and learn more."
14,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104304660-elsie,1,"The thing that bothers me about this is that physics sounds interesting in a book like this but I did my high school physics and first year physics at university and the core of it, the thing you had to learn and understand want the fascinating results and conclusions, it was the collection of vast amounts of data and then the math. The formulas, the statistical analysis, the endless calculation. It's math (maths?). It's all math. And math is beautiful sometimes but it's also a huge amount of grunt learning. I could have recited everything in this book and completely failed every exam in first year university physics if I did. I didn't fail though. Instead I learn how to use the formulas and solve problem questions. That's how you pass. Maybe I'm just bitter but none of this was part of my first year physics 😜"
15,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"4.5/5 starsI picked up this book several months ago and then dropped it despite nearly finishing it due to the complexity of the last chapter: Quantum Behavior. This by no means implies that the book is difficult as a whole.I thoroughly enjoyed the first three chapters: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, and the Relations of Physics to Other Sciences. The method he chose to explain the concepts in these chapters was elegant and easy to understand. He compared our understanding the law of physics to watching a game of chess played by the gods (not personal gods) and we humans as observers knowing nothing about the chess rules. However, I have difficulty with understanding quantum mechanics when he started involving mathematic equation, which I particularly have no formal education. I might as well come back to this chapter once I have a better understanding of mathematics.Overall, I would recommend ""Six Easy Pieces"" to anyone who is interested in science, physics especially, to check it out. You might have already known the concepts, but you'll be amazed by his styles."
16,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,4,"Almost five-stars. For someone like me (i.e., a layperson that has no background in physics whatsoever), this is a great introduction to the mysterious world of physics—it is humorous and accessible and makes an effort to be ""approximately accurate"" about everything (while calling itself out on things that are simplified for the sake of the example or else ""unknown or unknowable""). However, to be ""approximately accurate about everything"" means a bunch of math and other fancy-pants equations that look like this:|ĥ₁ + ĥ₂|² = |ĥ₁|² + |ĥ₂|² + 2|ĥ₁||ĥ₂| cos δ...which despite my best efforts remain cloaked in physics' mysterious shroud.""Easy Pieces"", these are not.However, Feynman explains the subject matter well—and certainly better than most other folks that have tried to write this sort of thing.I'm adding him to my short list of heroes."
17,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1664750-connie-kuntz,5,"This book is truly mind-opening and I am convinced that Feynman was one enlightened dude. As I read the book, I felt myself opening up to the concept of atoms, amalgamations, energy, astronomy, gravity, light years, colliders and quantum physics. There was humor, history and simplified experiments in the book, too, which gave the field of Physics an ""inviting"" feeling, rather than a snooty one. The first five chapters were wonderful, but I struggled quite a bit with Chapter 6. To be clear: I still have no grasp on these difficult theories and concepts but now I feel like I have a genuine appreciation for the science and a new way of looking at our world. I learned something that is diffiuclt for me to articulate but I will try: I learned that Physics truly welcomes the connection between past and present, quantum leaps and forward thoughts, the galaxy and a glass of wine, a spiritual presence and Dennis the Menace and much, much more. "
18,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/567005-colleen,3,"Previously, I had read Richard Feynman's ""What Do You Care What They Think"" & absolutely loved it! It goes without saying that Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winner in Physics, is beyond brilliant....but I said it anyway. I enjoy his writing & his joy of discovery in all things scientific. If I'd had a Physics professor like him maybe I would've understood it or had more interest in physical sciences. That said, I found this book very interesting and informative but the formulas & concepts were sometimes a little foreign to me. He was aiming for the brightest of his CalTech first year Physics students & I think I'm missing a little bit of their experience/education in Physics. I found it illuminating; however, I don't think I could explain what I learned without re-reading some sections. I'll probably read some other books by him because I enjoy his ""joie de vivre"". For me, this was 3.5 stars."
19,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"I love this book. I wonder why I didn't study physics when I was younger. It is so fascinating. Physics is probably the most significant science of all time. It has had its impact already on many fronts. There'd be no transistors or cell phones without physics. If we don't apply Einstein's equations into the satellites we build, our GPS will render useless. Physics also has an intimate relationship with other scientific fields like astronomy, chemistry, biology, etc. I think this book is relatively easy to understand even if you have no background in physics. There are times though you may feel a bit out of your depth, especially as we get into the mystifying realm of quantum mechanics. Be that as it may, it is still a good source of knowledge for the physics majors as well as laypeople. You have to read the book with the caveat that it was written back in the 1960's and so a lot were not known back then. For instance, the strong nuclear force was not discovered yet. hope you enjoy."
20,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"I have read several other books by and about Richard Feynman: a man whose brilliance and oddness were well known within the Physics community, but sadly only his eccentricities were known by most of the wider world.This book is not really about Feynman, rather it is six chapters excised out of a two-year course of physics lectures he gave at CalTech in the mid 60s. The publisher created this volume (and a second one that I am just getting into called ""Six Not-So-Easy Pieces"") and a companion audio book in Feynman's own voice about 15 years ago.Although they are not biographical, and I took ""freshman physics"" a while ago, I picked up these two volumes to read how this man attempted to re-invent the teaching of introductory and intermediate physics. The approaches and ""patter"" are definitely Feynman's own. His thinking, humor, and enjoyment of ""natural philosophy"" shine through the pages.Granted the knowledge of cosmology and particle physics contained in this volume are dated (it was 45 years ago, give the guy a break!), but that only adds a patina of warmth to the presentation.The title is correct: there is virtually no math in this volume (except a bit near the end). Nothing that you need to fear: blowing over it will still get you the gist of the point(s).If you have read any of the other books relating Feynman's adventures as a young (20s) man working at Los Alamos, the pick this up and see how the man lived and breathed physics. You'll be happy you did!"
21,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13676431,3,"I liked 4 out of the 6 pieces, so technically it should be 3.3 stars. I didn't like some of them probably because I didn't understand them, and to be fair I didn't focus a lot while reading it, it was more of a leisure read. The gravitational piece was beautiful. It explained big complex ideas with simple analogies that made sense, some of the laws he discussed I knew already but after reading the lecture it all clicked and the picture was more clear. I didn't like the conservation of energy or quantum mechanics, which makes sense for quantum mechanics because, well. However I actually studied the conservation of energy and liked it, I was excited to get a new perspective on it and to get deeper intuition but the analogies did not make any sense and it all was just too confusing. Which is why I think rather than a book it would've been better if I just read lectures on the topics that interest me. I still enjoyed the book and I would probably read Feynman again in the future along with my physics courses. "
22,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216702-steve,3,"That subtitle may seem overwrought, but it's true. Hawking and Greene have done much to popularize (and fetishize) physics, but Feynman will help the layperson really start to understand it at its most conceptual, basic form. And if you haven't the ability to sustain fifteen years of advanced mathematics, these lessons can still illuminate the marvels of the ""mechanism.""To be fair, Hawking (astrophysics) and Greene (quantum mechanics) both do a lot for their respective fields as well, but they aren't Feynman.Oh, by the way, I can't perform the most basic algebraic equations. That is so embarassing."
23,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23258105-dileep-n,4,"This is a sampling from the legendary Feynman Lectures put together to introduce laypeople to physics. I'm not sure this short book succeeds in achieving that goal. It isn't thorough enough or organized well enough to teach people who haven't already been exposed to physics something useful about the subject. If you have dipped your toes in the fascinating world of physics, however, this is definitely worth reading. This book won't teach you anything new but it'll give you new eyes and a new way of looking at some of the central problems of physics. This is where Feynman really shines; he provides some unique and brilliant insights that sometimes change the way you think about a problem and make you go, Aha! The first three chapters explain what physics really is, what doing physics entails, and how physics relates to the other sciences. In the final three chapters, Feynman gets into real physics and discusses conservation of energy, theory of gravitation, and quantum behavior. In the chapter on the theory of gravity, Feynman provides a historic account of its development from Copernicus to Newton and shows us what particular problem each of them was trying to solve and what their contribution was which is really helpful. The other two chapters are also very interesting. There are some simple equations in there but nothing you wouldn't already have seen elsewhere. Feynman frequently surprises you with his refreshing attitude of saying, ""We don't know why that is"", thereby pointing out the limits of existing (during his time) scientific knowledge. I strongly recommend this book to those with a keen interest in physics, not to learn anything new but to get a Feynman-eye-view of basic physics. Also check out its sister volume, The Six Not-So-Easy Pieces."

I could only regret that my primary / high school physics teachers were not able to convey the messages in such a straightforward a compelling manner. The links between cornerstone concepts of physics, chemistry and biology reappeared in a completely different light. The author takes you on an exciting ""understanding tour"" starting with the atomic hypothesis, then placing all basic concepts in both historical and cross-science perspectives to consequently elaborate on the 6 conservations laws (energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, charge, baryons and leptons), gravitational and relativistic discussions to finally serve the quantum behaviour ""explanation"".All packaged in supercilious (100% deservedly!) wrapping of Feynman's unique style.That book should replace (or at least accompany) all first-year school physics lectures!"

It's not a surprise that the lectures that formed the basis for this book were initially attended by undergraduates who were gradually supplanted by post-graduates. True, my degree is in medieval English and history, but I do have an O-Level in physics, but I found most of this hard to absorb.If I had been given this as a 14-year old, I would have concluded that physics is not for me. It's just not pitched at that level. The chapter on gravity was easy, but conservation of energy was beyond my intellect.It's good, but it's not easy."

Thanks to you Sirs !!!Switch to Feynman, the teacher, who leaves no attempt to make the subject so simple , that even a non-technical person can understand it ( i mean most of it ). Best Teacher i have encountered ever for Physics.The book makes a very good reading .

When I started reading the first chapter, I was relived. There wasn’t any complex equations, just the central ideas of physics explained in a way that I could understand. Even though the title of Feynman’s book is Six Easy Pieces, it wasn’t easy in a dumbed down sort of way. This book made me think, or maybe I should say it allowed me to think, since the way Feynman explained physics gave me the information I needed to begin to understand how the laws of physics influence our world."

39,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8524944-ioannis-savvas,5,"Ο Richard Feynman (1918-1988) είναι ένας από τους μεγαλύτερους θεωρητικούς φυσικούς του 20ου αιώνα. Καθηγητής στο Cornell, δούλεψε μαζί με το Hans Bethe στο Los Alamos. Το 1965 βραβεύθηκε με το βραβείο Nobel για τη δουλειά του στη θεωρία της κβαντομηχανικής.Το Six Easy Pieces είναι μια συλλογή διαλλέξεων στους φοιτητές του. Ο Feynman διακρινόταν για την ικανότητά του να εξηγεί πολύπλοκα θέματα φυσικής με απλό τρόπο, χρησιμοποιώντας παραδείγματα από την καθημερινότητα. Το βιβλίο είναι απολαυστικό και διαβάζεται πολύ εύκολα.Το δυνατότερο σημείο του βιβλίο από το δεύτερο κεφάλαιο (Basic Physics):What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game are what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now. (Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we consider that we “understand” the world.How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking, three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces at work, and that we figure out exactly.)A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time, until all of a sudden we find that it is on a black square (what happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then some time we may discover a new rule. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work -not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game."

While the title says ""easy"" - it is keeping in mind that these were lectures for the best and brightest at Caltech...so yes, while they are not overly complex, they are also not designed for the novice either. Five of the lectures cover concepts in classical physics (energy, gravitation etc) and the role of physics in society. However, it is the final chapter on quantum which is the gold mine in this book (especially regarding the Uncertainty Principle).I am a massive Feynman fan and he is widely notes as one of the best (and most engaging) physics teachers of the 20th century and while this book was good and definitely worth picking up, I am not sure whether I would call it great as some of the magic of Feynman just didn't translate as well as I was hoping to the written page. Well worth the read."
42,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,"The way that Feynman goes by explaining the topics of this book reminded me of Stephen Hawking's books about the universe. I did enjoy the analogies the author uses to explain some principles that are not always easy to grasp, particularly about our our knowledge of the laws discussed.I found myself discovering new ideas and seeing things from a new perspective even after several years in engineering, having already read and studies most of the content of this book before, but never from this angle.Would definitely recommend it as an entry point to people who want more insight into modern day physics."
43,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1094533-mary-overton,0,"Lectures from a series given at Caltech in the early 60s - intended for freshmen, to stimulate their interest in physics. Special Preface: ""Through the distant veil of memory, many of the students and faculty attending the lectures have said that having two years of physics with Feynman was the experience of a lifetime. But that's not how it seemed at the time. Many of the students dreaded the class, and as the course wore on, attendance by the registered students started dropping alarmingly. But at the same time, more and more faculty and graduate students started attending. The room stayed full, and Feynman may never have known he was losing some of his intended audience."" pp. xxii-xxiii""'Quantum mechanics' is the description of the behavior of matter in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen."" pg. 116""Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it is very difficult to get used to and it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. Even the experts do not understand it the way they would like to, and it is perfectly reasonable that they should not, because all of direct, human experience and of human intuition applies to large objects. We know how large objects will act, but things on a small scale just do not act that way. So we have to learn about them in a sort of abstract or imaginative fashion and not by connection with our direct experience."" pg. 117 ""We would like to emphasize a very important difference between classical and quantum mechanics....We can only predict the odds!.... We do not know how to predict what would happen in a given circumstance, and we believe now that it is impossible, that the only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events."" pg. 135"
44,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30489708-alcatraz-dey,4,"This book is a brilliant way to broaden your knowledge of the key concepts of physics. Adapted from the undergraduate lectures delivered by Richard Feynman during his professorship at Caltech, the narrative is very talkative and easy to digest.Feynman himself contributed well to physics, receiving (jointly) the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for his work in quantum electrodynamics, developing pictorial representations of quantum interactions (now known as Feynman diagrams) and pioneering the field of quantum computing. He was a keen populariser of physics in his lifetime, and his legacy of books and lectures still remains.The six chapters included in this book, taken from Volumes I and III of the Feynman Lectures on Physics, are: Atoms in Motion, Basic Physics, The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences, Conservation of Energy, The Theory of Gravitation and Quantum Behaviour.Each chapter is full of coherent descriptions of the concepts at hand, using everyday analogies and clear diagrams to illustrate exactly how things work. Key experiments in the progression of modern physics are also included, their purpose and true significance explained. The simplicity and clarity in which the material in this book is delivered certainly sets it apart from others of similar genre – especially with its achievable thickness of merely 1cm.Receiving positive critical acclaim from major publications, Six Easy Pieces has become renowned as a work that serves two purposes – to explain important concepts to non-physicsts, and to give an insight into Feynman and his mannerisms. “With Feynman as a guide, you cant help wondering why everyone is not turning to science” – the Guardian.If you are considering studying physics at A-level or university, I would strongly recommend this book as it expands on what you already know and takes it a step further. Furthermore, hearing familiar concepts in a different style to normal is a very refreshing experience. If you have an interest in finding more out about the universe around you without much background knowledge, Six Easy Pieces is certainly a worthy and rewarding introduction to some important concepts."
45,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"This book is an introduction to the most basic ideas of physics, and part of its sophistication is that it hints at how deep the...rabbit hole...is, without requiring readers to have enough expertise to really go down it.It was readable but challenging for me - someone with a bachelor's in biology and no great adeptitude for physics or math. My one complaint is that author Richard Feynmann could work a little harder to help lay readers understand how his verbal descriptions of physics translate into the equations he provides. Sometimes it was clear and other times I was left wondering about some squiggly mathematical symbol I don't remember, or why something has to be squared... One thing that comes across very well: Some physical properties of the universe - the subatomic particles/waves dealt with by quantum physics - seem to, by their very nature, do things we can't pin down and predict precisely, but rather, we can only understand them in terms of the ODDS of what will happen. And if people try to precisely document certain tiny activities - like finding the probabilities of where electrons will go - the observers change the pattern just by trying to document it. In a couple of ways, uncertainty seems to be part of the root of reality. After reading this, I feel like I have much more of an intuitive basis for reading more about physics. I also have more intuition, after reading this book, about where math-based theory and experimentation complement each other in physics. That said, ask me what I read, and I'll probably stumble."
46,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15875470-molly-ison,5,"Possibly the most important part of this book is in the preface, when Feynman discusses the problems of physics pedagogy. These actually are easy pieces - if you have had high school level physics, the concepts should be immediately familiar. While Feynman presents them in a way that is fairly labeled brilliant, there are many physics teachers and professors who could give you an excellent understanding of the same material (and it's not too hard to find some online). The real issue here is the link between ability to solve problems and ability to understand concepts. When I took physics, I solved a lot of mathematical equations that involved different forces - a block moves up a hill and there's gravity, friction, the slope of the hill, the mass of the block, etc... One can be very good at recognizing the right formulas and plugging in the right numbers and still have no real idea about what's happening on a conceptual level. On the other hand, when Feynman actually delivered these lectures to a hall full of freshmen, despite having recitation sections, they did not do outstandingly well in being able to solve examination problems, and Feynman admits so himself. However, graduate students and other faculty members sat in on these lectures and valued them highly. So I would say that this is probably a book not for those who have never had exposure to physics, but for those who have a problem solving level understanding (or did at some point) and want to solidify for themselves what those problems are actually about. "
47,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436673-tom,4,"I've had this book on the shelf for some time, meaning to read it to refresh my memory of physics classes taken long ago. It was a quick enjoyable read that explained things I've already learned in a new and refreshing way, (even though these lectures were given almost fifty years ago.) I was especially impressed with the first two chapters. With some minor modifications, these two lectures could be used to explain atomic theory to elementary students. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the targeted audience is Cal Tech undergraduates! Feynman often said something like (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""It all goes back to the Double Slit experiment.) I truly believe that a person who becomes aware of this experiment and what it ""means"" can never really look at the world the same way again. As well versed as Feynman was with the intricacies of the paradoxes that permeate the Double Slit, I was sort of disappointed with his explanation of it. I think the chapter on it in ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" explains it better and does a better job of conveying the awesome mystery of it. Of course, Gary Zhukov had the advantage of writing his book after Alain Aspect had run his experiment (1964) related to Bell's Theorem, confirming that the Universe we inhabit is truly, deeply, weirdly mysterious. Still, I didn't think Feynman conveyed that very well in this book, but really that wasn't his purpose here, so I'm giving it four stars."
48,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"Non-fiction. This book contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during 1961-1964. It made me feel dumb. Well, not entirely, I did okay with the chemistry, biology, and astronomy aspects of it, as I have background in those areas, and I was all right with the quantum mechanics stuff because that requires more imagination than math, but I've never taken a physics course, so all the nonsense with pulleys totally shot over my head. All the weights and wedges and three 1 lb balls being lifted three feet by one 1 lb ball -- that I would have to see in order to understand, fig 4.2 just didn't cut it for me, but even when I had no clue what he was talking about, Feynman was a steady, calming voice, rational and grounded. He wasn't afraid to admit science might be wrong about something, or that there are still mysteries science can't answer. He was hailed a great scientist, but he was a great teacher as well, someone who loved his field of study, and even these lectures, trapped between the pages of a book, make that clear.Two stars for Feynman's laid back approach to some complicated concepts, but, like shooting one particle through a gap in a wall, it was hit and miss."
49,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/336491-laura,2,"I may be one of the few scientists who is not a Feynman fan. He admits that his approach is to teach to the very brightest students, hoping that the others manage to catch something along the way. But, when you remember the man taught at CalTech--where basically every student is pretty darned smart, his approach seems a bit arrogant. He also claims that he had no opportunity during the lecture series to gain feedback from students--that this came only at the end of the course. Astonishing that such an obviously bright individual can't think of some way to gauge student learning along the way... perhaps by asking the students? Administering a quiz or otherwise collecting some data?I realize this was a different time in university science education, where expectations were much different, but the fact that we haven't made a lot of strides in science ed on the post-secondary level increases my distaste for the old school approach.I will confess his explanations are interesting, if you're already familiar with the material. I just couldn't get past feeling sorry for the poor souls who found themselves learning physics for the first time with this approach."

A charming genius without the snooty air of formalism is a role model I can follow. And here in this book is the start to understanding a Feynman way of mind. These 6 essays are adapted from Feynman's Lectures on basic physics back in the 1960's. I wish I had discovered these essays before college, because they really would have made physics easy and interesting to learn before I took 2 semesters of crazy med-school fueled classes. Covering topics like the basics of science, atomic motion, law of the conservation of energy, gravitation, and even quantum mechanics. Feynman also has a unique style which is matter of fact and personable, but just has the slightest hint of poetry. A really fantastic read for the beginner scientist or the physicist who just wants a return to physical wonder. I've already put the full lectures on my to-read list."

After reading his book of short stories, I've been perpetually intrigues by Feynman, his interests, accomplishments, and thought process. These six lectures provide a window into the mind that helped inspire many future physicists and their subsequent breakthroughs. It inspired me to think more carefully about the mundane things we take for granted; I found myself thinking about the structure of an element, how it fits together to create molecules, and are the true building blocks for everything in the Universe. My favorite subjects were the generalities of atoms, the interaction of physics with all other sciences, and gravitational forces as they relate to our solar system, galaxy and universe. If you want a book that will truly keep you on your toes and thinking, pick this one up. "

This epitome of that masterwork really does offer an easy guide to what physics, and science in general, is all about. Feynman explores the most fundamental scientific theories that all intelligent people should be aware of – the structure and behaviour of atoms, quantum mechanics and gravity. These are the fundamentals that ought to be as well known as Shakespeare, Mozart and Picasso. The material is essentially a transcript of Feynman lecturing (you can even get the lectures themselves on a CD to accompany the book), and comes across like a wise friend giving you the inside story on a subject he loves."

In that sense I did get inspired here and there. But this book reads just like what it is: transcripts of live lectures, therefore in my opinion it just doesn't makes too good a book on introductory physics without the brilliant personality of the lecturer and his spontaneous notes on board or any other in-class demonstration. I found those detailed descriptions of the imagined experiments especially difficult to follow even though I already know the materials. So I think one should still learn physics formally and systematically, and can read this book as supplementary material just to see how it can be explained differently from the textbook."

The departments for both at my school were fairly challenging and I wasn’t particularly good at them and so I shied away for fear they would hurt my GPA.As it turns out, no one has ever asked to see my GPA and I would have been better off taking the classes, getting Cs and learning a lot. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose.Anywho, I have made it a goal to go back and study more math and physics on my own time and Six Easy Pieces was the consensus recommendation for where to start.Coming in at a slim 150 pages, Six Easy Pieces is a Physics 101 class in a breezy book.

I'm not sure if that's because the book is a series of freshman physics lectures Feynman gave (and I've taken a year of college physics) and because it seemed too simple; or because he seemed to bounce around between really simple concepts (what is an atom? what is light?) and really difficult ones, including formulas and calculations I'd never seen and didn't understand. I wouldn't recommened it to someone new to physics or someone well-acquainted; it would be too difficult for the former and too simple for the latter. "

He had a lively mind and spirit that helped him connect to the kids. Hell, he was a kid, just with an oversized brain.

Richard Feynman inspired people around the world with his scientific brilliance, endless curiosity about the world and unorthodox outlook on life. Here he guides the reader through the very basics of physics, including atoms, energy, force, the relation of physics to other sciences, the theory of gravitation and quantum behaviour. Presenting complex ideas in simplified, understandable terms and using illustrations such as shooting bullets, waves on a seashore and even Dennis the Menace's building blocks, Six Easy Pieces gets to the heart of how the world works."

73,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6470362-jean-tessier,5,"I while back, I bought a book that introduced math topics to the lay person. This looked like it could do the same for physics. And by none other than Richard Feynman himself.Feynman goes for a more intuitive approach and avoids any complex mathematics. His explanations and examples are strikingly clear. The jiggling of atoms explain the difference between solid, liquid, and gaseous states. Changing arrangements explain chemical reactions, like burning carbon. Everything is made out of atoms, with patterns that defy the imagination.I struggled through the chapter on the conservation of energy. One take-away is that we can explain limits in nature using reversible machines, even though there are no reversible machines in nature. The chapters on gravitation and quantum mechanics were exceedingly clear. The chapter on how physics relates to the other sciences was a lot of fun. So, too, the chapter on gravitation.Tycho Brahe had an idea that was different from anything proposed by the ancients [...] that to find something out, it is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep philosophical arguments. (p. 90) Tycho Brahe took measurements, Kepler deduced laws from these measurements, Galileo figured out inertia, and Newton formulated the law of gravitation (which was later refined by Einstein).I really like how Feynman repeatedly states the limits of science. There are many things that we simply do not know. For now. There may be things we will never know, but many phenomena in the past were deemed inexplicable, only to be explained later.It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. (p. 71) the principle of inertia — if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.) (p. 93) All we have done is to describe how the earth moves around the sun, but we have not said what makes it go. (p. 107) No one has since given any machinery. (p. 107) Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. (p. 116) Because atomic behavior is so unlike ordinary experience, it appears peculiar and mysterious to everyone, both to the novice and to the experienced physicist. (p. 117) According to Feynman, the fact that there are things we do not know does not mean that we are ignorant. We can explain the limits of how things operate with great precision, even though we cannot explain why.About the conservation of energy:There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law -- it is exact so far as we know. (p. 69) As I was reading the book, I often found myself wondering how much progress we've made since it had been written. For instance, in last year's Outgrowing God, Richard Dawkins makes a case for complex chemistry inevitably leads to self-replicating molecules like RNA and DNA, and eventually living organisms.Feynman does not reduce everything to physics. He acknowledges that there are areas of human knowledge outside of science.If something is said not to be a science, it does not mean that there something wrong with it; it just means that it is not a science. (p. 47) "
74,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115843326-liquidlasagna,2,"I adore Feynman, but i don't like reading this book...Why you ask?I find that the pieces were far more easily read in the Feynman Lecture's on physics because of the larger page size, and even the smoother better quality paper.Trying to put those lectures to fit into a smaller book, i find actually makes re-reading the lectures harder. I'm not a fan of the paper and the typeface size, and well to me, it takes away from the smooth flow of the much bigger pages of the original book.It just gives me a claustrophobic feeling.---I need those lectures with the pages extra three inches wider, and four inches taller!!---I was given the whole set, since i had trouble trying to find the original red hardcovers in good shape [they always seemed to be warped], and I found them somewhat rough going when I faced Heisenberg's Uncertainity Principle for the first time, I took a break... I took a break and tried again a while later....He was talking about calculating the orbit of one planet and I struggled in places.Anyways, i decided to take a break for a month or two, and i did exactly what Issac Newton did, i decided to reread things all over again, right from the beginning.I simply burned through the first 100-150 pages of the Feynman Lectures and enjoyed it.But i had two small moments where I realized i was rushing things, and decided, later... later...I couldn't have as much fun browsing Vol II because of the calculus, even though i had the math knowledge at the time, but not the introductory calculus-level university level EM, so browsing those early on, i realized i would face some struggles.[I actually spoke to someone once who went to Caltech in the 60s, and he said that he thought Feynman's Lectures were brutal. He couldn't remember his other textbooks, but i really appreciated his insight 20 years later]It really bums me out since Feynman's writing really is beautiful and deep, and i see a lot of slightly unhappy folks picking up this book and having a hard time with it.I totally sympathize, because i felt let down that my concentration didn't flow with the page as easily, as I thought it might with a neat little hardcover.All I can say is that lots of people who experienced the Lectures in the day, some people were frustrated, and some people were blown away, and some experienced both.----All i can say is that reread the book very slowly and patiently, or borrow a copy of Volume One of the full lectures at the library and browse through them, an read the first 30 pages.and please please please READ, Feynman's autobiography firstSurely You're Joking Mister Feynman [Part I]What Do You Care What Other People Think? [Part II]"
75,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,3,"I read this for all the wrong reasons. It was short and I wanted one more book for the month, and I knew I could blitz through all the basic science blah. I blitzed, it wasn't basic, I learned nothing except that I was insufferable and needed to stop this obnoxious book-counting. Also, Feynman was inappropriate and a irrascible, didn't knew. The writing is easy, likeable, and clear, I really wish I'd been able to sit in on one of his lectures, those must have been incredible. But I guess I had the next best thing, Bharatidasan kicking me out for the 10th time in a week because I wasn't adequately spellbound by his reading out from the illustrated guide to the simplified extract of Indian transliteration to the official university textbook of Electrical Machines I, complete with bad grammar, formula errors, and all the sweet smelling dryness of cow-dung prepared for fuel, which is apt because those books were some of the few that deserved to be taken to 451 fahrenheit. Clippingsphilosophically we are completely wrong with the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered even though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar thing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws. Even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work! That is the way in which we discover new rules.The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called quantum electrodynamics. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges,The masses given here are the masses of the particles at rest. The fact that a particle has zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot be at rest.it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth.When a light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is deflected."
76,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45200517-simon-zou,4,"This is book is great. I started to read it on the recommendation of a professor in Computer Science and because I wanted to ""like"" physics more, as opposed to thinking it's this hard, scary thing. To that end, it's worked, I like physics more than when I started. On the ""Easy"" in the title: The premise of the book is that, of Feyman's lectures on physics, these are the 6 easiest, digestable for a layman with little to no background in the sciences. So I listened to the first couple chapters as an audiobook. The audiobook uses the recordings from the real lectures and are awesome. The written version drops some of his character and jokes in exchange for clarity so it's nice to get both. Feynman waxes poetry about rocks and moons and atoms and how physics relates to other sciences and it's pretty marvelous. However, once at chapter 4, on the conservation of energy, just listening becomes untenable. There are diagrams and equations and concepts that required my full attention to grasp. I switched from listening to reading, to listening and reading at the same time, to asking myself ""at this point why don't I just watch the lectures on YouTube?"". I did that, and all was good. The explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics in particular would be pretty hard to get without looking at the diagrams but with them it makes sense, or rather, explains the consistent way in which quantum doesn't make sense. One thing I noticed from perusing all these mediums is that Amazon keeps track of ""popular"" highlights in books and shows them to you. These were far more prevalent in the first three chapters. I wish they made available (but understand why they don't) other stats because I would guess that chapter 4 is where people might have given up on the book. The title says these pieces are ""easy"", but the last few chapters require your full attention and some quantitative reasoning skills to grasp. It's not so easy that I could fully digest the ideas half paying attention while doing the dishes, as was closer to the case with the earlier chapters. Feynman also uses imaginary ""reversible"" machines to explain energy concepts and I'm still not sure I like that or really get what those are about."
77,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97017413-john,3,"This is quite difficult to review. I knew of Feynman (obviously) but hadn't read or seen his famous early 60s lectures before. This book exists as an introduction to the man and his teaching methods but I'm not convinced it does a particularly good job.Definitely don't read this if you want to learn anything about physics, some of the material is very dated (a lot has happened in the world of physics in the last 56 years). Some of it is still relevant but if you didn't know what how would you pick this out from the irrelevant? The blurb on the book says ""the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics"" and I would strongly dispute that.The book gets off to a decent start, the prefaces and introduction set the scene, they tell us that the lecture series wasn't actually that successful with only a few students present targetted by the material so it's hardly surprising only a few stuck with them. Lecture One (Atoms in Motion) is good, a nice introduction to Feynman's method and the subject matter is gentle and well described. But Lecture Two (Basic Physics) is a disaster IMHO, it's a complete mess with Feynman jumping all over the place and not really explaining anything properly and leaving the reader totally confused. Lecture Three (Relationship of Physics to Other Sciences) is very biology biased and spends a lot of time on enzymes. Other sciences are briefly mentioned or pretty much dismissed, geology and meteorology get very short shrift and only go to emphasise how dated the material is. Lecture Four (Conservation of Energy) is better and thank goodness for Lecture Five (Gravitation) and Lecture Six (Quantum Behaviour) which save this book as they are easily the best two and the best advertisement for Feynman. These last two lectures have the most interesting content and we can see how Feynman excels in explaining these difficult concepts.Overall the book hasn't inspired me to tackle more of Feynman's lectures although the final two lectures came close. There are better and more up to date explanations of many of the concepts tackled in this book. I think it's worth reading, it's a very short and quick read, but don't go in to it expecting to learn much physics."
78,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18566696-nitin-dangwal,4,"Richard Feynman was on my to-read list for a long time. I have heard a lot about his teaching methods. His crystal-clear thought that made him teach the most difficult subjects in the most easiest of methods. Given this, I had a lot of expectations from this book. And I was not disappointed.The book is a primer to anyone who wants to brush up their understanding of the basics in Physics. But unlike the books that we have studied, this book is not a bland narration of the concepts. Rather in your hand, this book is alive, with one of the best teachers of the physics speaking to you. Not one page of this short book is boring. And like a thriller, you turn page by page, trying to know what happens next. Almost every chapter of this gem of a book is amazing. But if asked my favorite, it has to be the chapter on Quantum Physics, and the explanation of dual nature of matter and the inherent uncertainty of the quantum world. I find Quantum Physics for one simple reason. It has confounded both physics and religious alike. So weird is the world of quantum that it makes sense to neither of them. For physicists Quantum Physics provide observation that throw everything they have learnt and beliefs down to gutter. For religious person, the quanta world is nothing short than work of devil, where the world has no order - something that they attribute to the god. And what can they so, so astonishingly is the world of quantum. Particles behave likes waves. But when you take a light source to see what is happening, they start behaving like particles again. Nothing is 'is' there. It is always they could be 60% here, and 40% there. Nothing is certain. Everything is probabilistic. Quantum world apart, I love the book majorly for one reason. It sews everything from the concept of heat to the concept of planetary motion in one single narrative. I think this is the major thing that the science education lacks in today's world. So much we have divided physics from chemistry that we don't realize they are the part of one whole story. This book fills this gap. Must read for a light and entertaining read about basic physics"
79,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89960099-john-doe,4,"Yes, it's very much an introduction. Mainly provide a ""big picture"" which chronologically connected scattered topics of modern physics, and most contents are basically high school physics stuff.But still, it's nice to intuitively connecting the dots in your mind. It's a quick read for me 😁 since I was kinda boost on physics in high school period, literally top grades in physics, favorite part was electric circuits design.If it wasn't for something random I would be the kid who loves physics and studied physics all the way up to uni, gradschool, and PhD maybe. Nevertheless I was a kid came across book with words like nuclear physics at age 5. Anyway, reading felt like a breeze after so many years literally disconnected with any physics stuff. Why I picked up physics again, because I need to understand quantum mechanics, and need to understand higher level mathematics in a physics way not merely arithmetics way. There was a lack of visual intuition in advanced pure mathematics area, I think catching up with the area of physics may be the key to develop intuitions.Another interesting point, why Mr.Feynman had a subtle distaste for philosophy?I think Mr.Feynman simply adopted the uncomformist attitude for both personal life and academic breakthrough, and most of the times the reasonings of the majority of philosophers were kind of absolute, which is the very core against what science at the age often adopted, uncertainty or statistical or probabilistic thinking, in other words, everything is by chance not that absolute as philosophers usually argued. However I think that's not a very fair judgement for philosophy the subject in general, nevertheless, the founding father of probability theory Pascal was himself a great philosopher, had profound work not just about mathematics but about thoughts for life in general. Besides, the very thought or intuition of every mathematics breakthrough IS philosophical. Therefore you can not be both anti philosophy and chasing revolutionary breakthrough in whatever area, instead you have to be kinda of philosophical."
80,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110560654-samen-yasar,5,"In the early 60s at Caltech, student interest in physics started declining sharply among undergraduates. Years of rigorous training in the basics meant undergraduates largely weren't able to engage directly with the most recent advancements in the field. To restore motivation in students, the faculty asked Feynman, already quite famous by then, to teach a course on introductory physics to the freshman and sophomore classes. The result was a wonderful series of lectures that was later transcribed and became what is known today as ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". This book contains only six of the easiest and most accessible pieces from that collection.The lectures are true to the intent. Unlike a typical physics lecture, where complex math and sophisticated jargon reigns supreme, Feynman's discussions have the bare minimum of scientific jargon and almost no math. He gets to the essence of complex concepts with just simple thought experiments and intuitive diagrams. It feels almost as if he is telling a story, when in fact he is explaining a rather complicated concept. Though he primarily focuses on basic concepts, he doesn't shy away from connecting them to more advanced concepts whenever he can. Since it was set in the 60s, some parts of the text pertaining to modern physics is a bit outdated. But those aside the text is truly remarkable.If there is any text on physics at all that I would gladly recommend to any fellow non-physicist, it has to be this series of lectures. The text's usage of simple language and the deliberate omission of math lends itself to a very wide audience. Anyone with basic high school level math and science background should be able to follow through easily."
81,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1848040-gabriella-gricius,4,"Why Read: I love physics. I honestly really truly adore learning about physics. The small caveat is that I'm absolutely horrid at it. Learning about how the universe works (not really why, as Feynman points out) is something that I am not particularly gifted in. But nonetheless, I love reading about it. Review: I picked up Six Easy Pieces an age ago. I thought that it would be a great book for me because as previously mentioned, I'm not good at the subject. The basics are most definitely something that I could use a hand in. Everyone has heard of Feynman's lectures, they're practically famous and so reading the first six ""easy"" pieces felt like something doable.Let me disabuse you of that notion. Much as I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't find it doable or easy to comprehend. The first couple chapters are okay, when you learn about gravity and about the magnetic pulls between atoms and planets - but then... then comes the quantum mechanics. Then comes the simple act that physic researchers are just trying to figure out ""how"" things work, rather than ""why."" Before reading this book, I hadn't considered that physics as a science is a bit of a test of experimentation. On one hand, we learn new rules by experimenting and assume they are true until something goes horribly wrong. On the other one, however, we just exist in a state of chaos - never truly knowing about why rules are the way they are. Talk about frustrating.I admit that in reading this book, I was frustrated. I wanted to know about why certain particles acted in the ways they did and... the answers weren't provided to me. Granted, no scientist has the answer so I shouldn't expect a ""Physics for Dummies"" book to help me. Still. It's a fascinating read, and it's not particularly easy. But give it a whirl, and you will be proud of yourself. Rating: 4/5 Stars"
82,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66906861-megawhoppingcosmicbookwyrm,4,"Quite the introduction to Physics! The only reason it doesn’t get five stars is due to my own limitations of absorbing the material put forth. Feynman is a fantastic educator and communicator, and even my poor excuse for a brain was able to glean a much better understanding of the subject.I didn’t do well with Science in school. Looking back, I can honestly say it was an equal mix of my not trying hard enough, and my writing off scientists as ‘evil people against my religion’; a detrimental state of mind inherited from my family. I’ve never studied Physics at all, and still enjoyed this book immensely.I would suggest only reading this if you truly have a longing to understand the universe more. It’s not something to pick up as a ‘light, entertaining read’ for a vacation or airplane ride... And be prepared for SO many equations.I’ll admit, I’m definitely a Feynman fangirl now. I never paid nearly as much attention to any other science than Biology, and I’m glad I’ve found more areas of interest to expand my horizons. I have Mr. Feynman to thank for that. His words have lit up a passion in me similar to how I felt when I read Darwin and Dawkins. I’m not a scientist, a teacher, or particularly clever by any means, but having people who are all of those things; and that are able to explain mind-boggling things to me so succinctly; is a truly marvelous feat. I am forever grateful to the great minds of this world."

Feynman is a brilliant teacher and, he’s arguably one of the smartest scientists in the 19th century next to Prof. Hawking and Einstein. People also believe that Feynman would have discovered “The General Relativity Theory” if Einstein had not done so. I’ve watched some of his lectures & interviews online and i was very impressed, which is why i’ve decided to invest my money & time in buying and reading one of his books. I have to be honest and say that the book is not as easy to understand as one might think. It is not for those that have no physics background at all. I had difficulties when Feynman talked about basic physics and chemistry facts, it was too dry & somehow really complicated. It was not easy to follow up and to understand the content. But, maybe, i lack the minimum knowledge one must have in order to start listening to a great scientist like Feynman in the first place, that is a very good argument indeed.

I was completely lost at some point after the atomic deep dive though, but for good reason according to Feynman, for “Things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.” and we have to use our imagination when it comes to the quantum. I’m more interested to see how physics can be stretched to philosophy like the incessant movement of atoms and how our body is continually changing even if there are no outward manifestations.I added this book to my reading list after Naval cited it in a podcast I was listening to, walking towards City Super buying a perk me up afternoon drink.***Quotes:What looks like a dead, uninteresting thing — a glass of water with a cover, that has been sitting there for perhaps twenty years — really contains a dynamic and interesting phenomenon which is going on all the time.

Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces speaks about six basic topics involved in Physics in a good, enjoyable and yes in a basic yet comprehensive way.

To be honest, I think the fourth (Conservation of Energy), fifth (The Theory of Gravitation) and sixth (Quantum Behavior - undoubtedly the heart of the book) were the best chapters in the book. I will not go into details as I don't want my review to be a complete spoiler.Just about the last chapter - It speaks and describes ""The Double Slit"" experiment beautifully like I have never understood it before, very detailed. This one chapter is undoubtedly the gem of the book.I'd definitely recommend this book to starters in Physics as well as to the experienced people in Physics (though you'd have known most of it - you can enjoy Feynman's deep insights).I am looking forward to getting hold of Six not-so Easy Pieces but not anytime soon..."

In this context, easy for students of physics at university level. - very minor gripe, but the formatting of the book. Feynman will discuss topics and the related figure or diagram won't be until the next page; frustrating if you're genuinely interested in pursuing this as a learning resource."

If you're expecting the jovial, self-aggrandizing Feynman of ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"": Adventures of a Curious Character, you're not going to get him here. This is Professor Feynman cleaned up for the classroom, and cleaned up further for mass ""respectable"" publication.The most illuminating part of this book was by far the quantum mechanics chapter, followed by the very basic chapters on basic molecular structure and physical states. Weirdly, the most obtuse chapters for me were on basic principles of force and energy. The diagrams did nothing for me there. I think a static medium of printed words and diagrams is maybe not the best for that subject."
88,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115451775-melvin,5,"This was a great book to read. I read it about three or four years ago as I started to become interested in physics. I had had it recommended to me via a Youtube video by Simon Clark. Anyway, I read it while on vacation and it was really, really good. It presents physics in a way that makes it easy to understand without hiding the details. I must admit that some parts were a little hard to understand and concepts were harder to grasp at some parts of the book. I think this is mainly due to my then younger age and the fact that I am a non-native speaker. I do still recommend it to everyone though. The book is perfect for anyone who thinks that they might enjoy physics and wants a first glance over the concepts. It introduces the concepts of basic principles such as conservation of energy all the way to more modern, advanced concepts such as quantum physics (although briefly and graspable). This book has been really important to me. I've only read it once, but the thought concepts presented in that book has been with me ever since I read it and helped me a lot in school to understand new concepts."
89,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67149971-elizabeth-saunders,3,"	In reading the book, ""Six Easy Pieces"" by Richard Feynman, there was one primary thing that I noticed. I consider myself to be a little bit more of a history or math oriented person, and I am even more confident about that now after reading the book. Not to say that the book didn't do a good job of simplifying some of Feynman's key points in physics- I believe it does just that. I understand that I am not part of the ""target audience"" from the book, which is why I feel like I didn't retain a whole lot of the more complicated parts. 	The lectures were definitely geared for the top tier science students. Also, at times, I found it a tad difficult to maintain a consistent level of interest through the passages with more data-heavy detail, as you might expect from a science lecture book. As a whole, though, I would say the book was very informative and an interesting read throughout. My feelings for Physics haven't changed, but at least I understand a little better about what the science of Physics actually is. -Duncan Hicks"

Mr Feynman's arguably legendary way of explaining physics is enjoyably succinct, my only complaint would be that I felt it could have been a bit more detailed, say with the inclusion of more equations while still taking into account the introductory theme of this book. However, this is it and those who wish to know more will certainly take a look at the Lectures themselves.Highly recommended to everyone who is interested in an introduction to physics in general - this is a light read and Mr Feynman is indeed a special person to teach us! However, if you do already have a gist of the basics, a more detailed book might be a better option for you. It is still a worthy read though, because there is some magic to 
how
 Mr Feynman explains physics, uses associations and makes physics intelligible."
91,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5676383-krishna-sundarram,4,"Feynman gave a series of lectures to first year students in the 1960s and the ones in this book are the 6 easiest topics. I was already familiar with these because I elected to study physics in school, so what I really after was understanding what made Feynman such a good teacher. After all, I had been taught the same matter by different teachers, some of whom taught in the conventional way, one of whom was heavily inspired by Feynman (shoutout to Prof Raavi!) and had also read 2-3 different texts on my own. So I hoped that I'd be able to contrast their approach to Feynman's and see if I could learn the techniques that made Feynman such a great teacher.Sadly, I couldn't. I know nothing more about teaching than I did before I started reading this (I didn't know much to begin with). That's not to say I got nothing out of it. I have a better intuitive grasp of escape velocity (should come in handy if I ever play Kerbal Space Program) and I finally understand the significance of the double slit experiment and the Uncertainty Principle. Its a fun read, even if you're already familiar with the matter.I still think its possible to become a great teacher by reading all the lectures repeatedly. Someday, I might look into that."
92,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45118733-eduardo-montiel,4,"Interesting read, the examples where a bit more complicated than expected. However, I have terrible spatial intelligence in order to accurately visualize them. My favorite section was where Feynman describes the relationship between physics and other branches of science: chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, and even psychology. All these fields can be described in terms of physics and he goes through the main findings of each field and how they advanced different areas of scientific research in terms of physics. It was really helpful for mental filing. Especially since he separates the categories. The examples on energy and the uncertainty principle were particularly difficult for me to visualize. However, the examples are a bit clearer when Feynman starts to summarize and synthesize the points at the end of the chapters. I would have liked a bit more information on relativity, apart from the tie in to gravitation and the speed of light. The uncertainty principle is fascinating, but I’ve read easier interpretations on the subject. "
93,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82482793-matthew-grenier,4,"The first lecture is almost unlistenable at points with the quality being so poor but the subsequent 4 were pretty good and easily understood (from a pure audio perspective, not related to content).Quality of audio aside, this was very informative. Feynman does a great job of not getting lost in the weeds of mathematical proofs and uses examples that people can understand to help us comprehend phenomena that are difficult to wrap our heads around because the aren't observable. This is a great introductory series of lectures, I have listened to them a few times now and it has really helped me get a better grasp on several basic physics concepts. Definitely recommend this to anyone interested in physics that doesn't have a post-secondary education in physics (otherwise this will be review, which could also be beneficial) if you do have post-secondary background in physics then ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"" which encompass these ones but also go much further might be a better choice, this may just leaving you thirsting for more which the complete set may be able to quench."
94,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,5,"In particle physics, there is an elementary sub-atomic particle called neutrino with zero mass. But what does it mean for a natural object to have zero mass? In order to answer this question one needs to first understand what mass is and what it abstracts. On the one hand, mass represents a property of a natural object within the context of the space-time continuum; a kind of constant that determines the strength of attraction of an object in the presence of a gravitational field (or another mass). On the other hand, we have the uncertainty principle that stipulates inherent uncertainty in the simultaneous knowledge of location and speed; and thus, if an object has zero mass it then means its location is absolutely unknown and therefore it must always be moving. Thus, if an object has zero mass then it can never be at rest.Feynman uses these kinds of questions to explain things we tend to incorrectly assume to be obvious. It is in those questions where the essential knowledge lies."
95,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70500211-michael,5,"The physics course I wish I had the pleasure to take. Professor Feynman is careful to elucidate all the shortcomings of our knowledge, leaving many doors wide open for discovery and new information to guide what we know to be true.A short read, yet very dense as he weaves the tale of how important physics really is. I took three physics classes in high school and two in college, yet I feel like I am learning all these things for the first time. Feynman has this wonderful way of helping you see what is going on, to understand something rather than just be able to name it. The final chapter began to stretch my ability to follow his explanations, but I feel as though I now have a better basis for quantum mechanics (no matter how minuscule it may actually be). I hope to return to this book periodically as we discover more and more, to reflect on what he/we knew then compared to now and the future."
96,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58933880-james,3,"I'm by no means someone who's studied anything further than high school physics and biology, so a lot of this was just rushing past my head whenever he came down to actual equations and a large part of the chemistry section BUT what comes after these parts is where the book really shines.Feynman, in what he's now famous for, clearly and simply breaks down these 'complex' (I'm sure they're actually quite simple for someone who knows more about this stuff) subjects into stories that easily illustrate the same principles.As a copywriter, I found it really helpful to see how Feynman was able to 'dumb it down' in such elegant and concise ways. Really inspiring stuff from this point of view.But, as someone also interested in the actual content of the book, it was a great read. I've given it 3 stars simply because I was too ignorant of the basics to actually make any real sense of the chemistry parts of the book and much of the mathematical stuff."
97,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96185483-haytam,5,"This book is a great introduction to the world of physics!! It is really interesting!!!If you want to read this book, please just keep in mind that its chapters are extracted from the first volume of Feynman lectures on Physics ( that has 3 volumes and 52 chapters just in the first one ), and from different spots. So for example, in the last chapter "" Quantum Behavior "", I had to explain some technical words and/or watch some Youtube videos to get the idea and be able to understand what the author is saying. And that's because sometimes he referred to chapters that I haven't read yet or used some words that I didn't understand. But I think that it's a great way to start!Anyways, it is indeed a wonderful book. But if you are unfamiliar with physics, don't feel bad for reading a paragraph more than once and defining words that you don't understand. When you'll keep building your understanding slowly, you'll definitely ENJOY the book and be AMAZED by its content!"
98,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77962764-ishan,4,"Billed as a layman's guide, but more complicated than that in reality. It is, after all, an abridged version of lectures given to university level physics students, and Feynman thus assumes some understanding of advanced maths and some scientific principles. This can make it occasionally impenetrable for the average reader. For the most part, however, Feynman's explanations are enchantingly lucid and occasionally even poetic, and the reader is sure to come away understanding just a little bit more about how the laws of the universe work, even if baffled by the formulas. I certainly did. It might even make you believe in a higher power - though not necessarily in any religious sense. I found myself awed by some of the truths Feynman uncovered, and the explanations (or lack of them) that he provided. This is certainly a brilliant primer for anyone looking to understand something about physics."
99,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2539789-lisa-manske,5,"As always, Feynman is a delight. I thoroughly enjoyed this ""conversation"" with theoretical physics of the 1960s. (Oh, how I wish he could have had access to what we have available today! If he could've studied Hubble images! ) As stated in the preface, Feynman wondered if there was a way to expose undergraduate students of physics with the excitement of the frontier instead of boring them for their first two years. He wondered why if there was way to bring the excitement of relativity and quantum mechanics to incoming freshman. His experiment, these lectures, was a failure, in his opinion, but someone had to try. I loved reading these and will definitely incorporate some of these connections into my own teaching. My favorite quote, from page 103,""That the law of gravitation is true even at bigger distances is indicated in Fig. 5-8. If one cannot see gravitation acting here, he has no soul."""

But, don't be fooled by how easy things look in the book. In the real world, the ones who attended these lectures were not beginners who want to learn Physics. It was his peers and Graduates who wanted to get his perspective. That's his speciality. You know how Chemistry works and how we smell. But, when he explains the concept, we can visualize everything in a completely different way. The last chapter about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle was the best of the lot. I am pretty sure that even if I wanted to , I can never forget how Quantum Mechanics originated. The real life ELI5. Worth reading it again and again till you understand. But, you can ignore Chapter 3 a little bit. Missed his magic there. Overall, what do you care what other people think ? ;)"

His description of the principle of conservation of energy and its relationship to potential/kinetic/electromagnetic attraction computation is beautiful. The chapter on quantum physics gives one of the best explanations of the process, not trivial and some knowledge of imaginary numbers would be useful too, but still one of the best pieces explaining whats going on down there. Still to figure out/review, relationship of the Schrodinger's cat paradox and the uncertainty principle, the uncertainty principle at a macroscopic level, imaginary numbers, try to start observations on planetary orbits and figure out the math behind to compute trajectories, speed, mass, etc. Review the math behind pulleys and other simple machines.

All reports of him being an excellent lecturer ring true.I tried to think about how to review this for non-scientists. This is a selection of six chapters chosen from the larger set of Feynman lectures - seemingly chosen for relative simplicity. But they're all over the place. I didn't remember there being a discussion of biology in one, and the quantum mechanics piece is (as they admit) more complex than the rest. I will admit, though, some of his double-slit experiment discussion was freshly insightful to me.I can't get it out of my head how these lectures succeeded and failed simultaneously. It felt like he just went up there and (in a clear and interesting way) talked. As a window into his thinking, it's interesting. I couldn't picture these pieces being a coherent part of a class."
103,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5126957-ted-young,4,"The title is misleading. The pieces are not easy, and Feynman considered his attempt to teach undergraduates a failure. That doesn't mean his wit and enthusiasm don't come across in these lectures, and the photographs of him teaching practically vibrate with his excitement. As one of the critics of Feynman's lectures on physics wrote, reading his lectures ""is like trying to drink from a fire hose."" Still, just because it's hard work, and because they're are portions of the book where I needed more explanation, doesn't mean that there isn't something exhilarating about going through the very start of physics with the best American physicist of the twentieth century as a guide. There's also something to be said for getting something of a glimpse into real brilliance. I learned some physics, though I've learned more from other authors, but this was more exciting."
104,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88199233-rick,4,"A really good introduction to physics throughout the particular, original and unique style of R.P. Feynman. It is easily understandable for who is familiar with the most concepts of science and physics in particular, but there are no great barriers for those who just don't have some primary base concepts. That's because Feynman writes not just about science, but about the humans behind it.And in doing so he manages to take out science from - literally - a glass of water.And this is the ability of a wise and valuable man, not just that of a super clever scientist (even if in this case both the two option corresponds to him and describe him).I advise everyone flow in the magnificent World Feynman is able to describe: it is just about some Beauty that can not be unrevealed. Everyone should know how wonderful is the world around us. Let YOU be free to get to know it."
105,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69411959-aaron,4,"Feynman's gift for explaining complex physics in a simple & entertaining way is on display with this fairly quick read. The diagrams are a bit outdated, but that is to be expected from a book that pulls its body from lectures that took place in the 1960s. While the introductory chapter does a great job, it is quickly undone midway through chapter two. However, I encourage readers to trudge on as the book does recover slowly in chapters three and four before ultimately redeeming itself in chapters five and six. As stated in the books introduction, this work is targeted toward a selected audience, that audience being those that are truly interested in pursuing physics and/or other sciences. This is not something you would want to read if you're just looking to dabble. This book has encouraged me to check out the Feynman lectures in their entirety."
106,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49435353-john-s,3,"""Easy"" is a subjective term. There is no doubt about Feynman's depth of knowledge and willingness to explain ideas. Like many incredibly intelligent people, he can often present ideas as obvious when a mere mortal like me cannot immediately grab them.As university lectures, these six easy pieces do create a foundation but I found often it was too high level and had to be taken on faith. Surprisingly, I found his description of quantum physics to be the most accessible of the six pieces taking very complex ideas and explaining them as well as illuminating the reasons for fundamental doubt. Frustratingly, he refers to future lectures which do not appear in the book.It is however a valuable publication showing a viewpoint drawn from extreme intellect."
107,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58618743-nazir,5,"Amazing, clear and concise book to introduce some of the pure physics concepts to the common reader. Though it is adviced to have at least high school level knowledge of maths, physics and chemistry. Otherwise it might seem like he's going too fast through certain topics. It's usefull to be comfortable with these subjects. Especially around the final two chapters when he gets into the good stuff (law of gravitation and quantum mechanics).Overall I'd recommend this book to anyone curious enough to get a basic view of the world from a physics perspective without all the technical jargon (though it has some. But they're properly explained) and maths. This is a must read for aspiring STEM majors."
108,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38008473-odyssey,4,"I feel that this book straddles the line between popular science and a physics lesson. It covers physics without resorting to mathematical formulae. This is the strength of Dr Feynmans knack for breaking things down and explaining it in the easiest terms possible for the audience. This definitely sparked the imagination and made me want to learn more. However, the lack of math is also this books weakness. Six easy pieces are taken from lectures and some of them presuppose previous knowledge that the reader might not necessarily have. At times I felt that I needed that extra bit of math with couple easy problems to solve myself to grasp the concepts a little quicker. If you are interested in science and thinking of pursuing physics this book would get my wholehearted recommendation."

Reading the first chapter of Six Easy Pieces guided my decision making and I shortly enrolled myself into a science and engineering program. I revisited this book recently after recommending it to my girlfriend (a liberal arts student aspiring to switch to science) and realized how foundational the writing in this book is to anyone wanting to understand science. To the kids of the future, this should be made essential reading to grok that science is not about memorization and solving equations but about reasoning first principles. Richard Feynman is the greatest teacher and then a Nobel Laureate."

It attempts to present Physics in an intuitive way, with little or no maths involved. It contains great pieces of intuition (the conservation of energy and its applications are brilliant, and the linking of physics with other disciplines is superb). However, there are other parts where one perceives it shows a bit of its age. For example, the quantum physics part doesn't mention the Standard Model nor its problem (obviously since the standard model is from the 70s). But again, this is a brilliant piece and very easy to read."

It provides an intuitive approach to the physic, very useful especially to understand the gravitational theory, demonstrating that with logic and reasoning it is possible to deduct the very basic pillar of the physic without recurring to formulas and equations (actually there are few equations here and there, but no rocket science involved).I will keep it on my shelf and I will read it again now and then as a refresher.

In any case, if you would like to learn basic intuition of how atoms work, how quantum mechanics came to be, or what the uncertainty principle is, this is the book for you. Some intuitions and images that are talked about in the book are very useful in visualizing the concepts.

By really difficult I mean it's practically impossible to imagine all the things that should happen when an experiment is done. It's better to watch this somewhere instead of reading it. That's why I though some of the lectures in this book are better to be done in a video format.Other than that, I learned quite a few things throughout the book so there were parts I enjoyed a lot. Just a book is not the ideal format for these lectures, in my opinion."

This book represents six of the ""easiest"" chapters of those lectures, covering atoms, basic physics, the relation of physics to other sciences, conservation of energy, gravitational theory, and an introduction to quantum mechanics. Feynman uses great analogies and examples to make the material accessible, but it was probably still good that I remembered some of my basic science heading into this."

If you read the book, buy the paper copy!With a MS in engineering I found much of what the book said to be a repeat of my college courses. In a few cases, where that was not the case, I could not decipher the related illustrations and was left somewhat in the dark. Potentially a good book for those that have an interest in this field.

With that said, physics boasts a long history of some of the most interesting scientists, and Feynman is a personal favorite. I had already read a few books about Feynman himself, and thought it would be worthwhile to read from these famous lectures of his. Of course, if what's said is true, the man was a performer in front of a classroom, and little justice can be done from simply reading his lectures. It was still nice to get a small glimpse into his teaching style. "

I quite enjoyed this, the only problem was that it was first published in 1963, which means some of the information in the book was a little out of date or behind the modern standards. There were also a number of references to 'recent discoveries' which were, of course, from the late 50s and early 60s, which held little interest for me at all. However, certainly in its day it would have been a brilliant book, and that it still mostly holds up now is a testament to Feynman."

I really enjoyed Richard's descriptions as several were not ones that I'd heard before. A few places got a bit dense even for me but this was a really enjoyable book.

Compiled based on lectures by supposedly one of the best instructors, the book demonstrates what having a good instructor can mean to a student. I won't go into the physics since, as I've said, my brain doesn't necessarily work in this manner but the lessons are interesting and mind expanding."
125,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5584359-nuno,3,"I was drawn to this work after reading Feynman's biographical book, and should say that I was expecting something better. The text is clearly oriented towards a physics student and so, for me, the equations (not many, granted) are not really needed. Also the theories have evolved and that means it's not the latest science that is on display. It was still refreshing to hear Feynman's take on the limitations of what the formulas tell us, and don't tell us, about the world we live in."

The idea was to present difficult concepts in a ""non-technical"" way. Feynman was a brilliant man and an amazing teacher - successfully using analogies to illustrate complex ideas. However, I warn the reader that these are some difficult concepts to grasp and understand so ""easy"" this is not. That said, if you are interested in Physics or Feynman this book is worth the read."
127,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16924720-zoe,2,2.5. Feynman is clearly an excellent teacher and the first half of this book was fantastic. However the second half was weighed down with unnecessary analogies that went on for pages. I thought he was much better at explaining the physics principles in context then otherwise. I completely agree with the opening remarks of the intro that this is definitely a book for people who already have a basic understanding in physics and those who want to experience the clear genius of Richard Feynman

As many before me have remarked, it is a true genius that can explain something incredibly complicated such that anyone can understand it. Above all, despite his knowledge of the field, his humble attitude impressed me the most -""Each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is always merely an approximation of the complete truth, or the complete truth as we know it... because we know that we do not know all the laws as of yet.""""As we go along, we find that we can amalgamate pieces. And then we find pieces that do not fit, and we keep trying to put the jigsaw puzzle together. Whether there are a finite number of pieces, and whether there is even a border to the puzzle, we do not know.""""Newton's laws are wrong - in the world of atoms. Things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.""""Mathematics is not a science... the test of its validity is not experiment.""""A poet once said, ""The whole universe is in a glass of wine"" - yes, all life is fermentation"""
129,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27846107-missfede,3,"This is great but also a bit frustrating. It's obviously called ""Six easy pieces"" because it contains ""easier"" parts of a greater and much more complicated discourse. Which means that you might be reading about extremely interesting facts and experiments that then are left incomplete because the more extensive explanation is probably too complicated for this book's audience. And you are left there hanging and understanding way too well your limits. "

Its audience, as it purports, is a committed upperclassman physics major or grad student. There were a few good moments in the book, but nothing wowed me, and there were too many math problems I didn’t understand and didn’t want to understand. Far too technical and unsexy. Anything by Stephen Hawking or Carl Sagan’s Cosmos are still the best for dabbling."

He certainly had a lot of charisma and he could explain physics in a logical way.One thing, which is not so surprising, but I have never thought about it this way was that: if the Earth was cubical, the gravity at the corners would just push them down."

Each chapter is an overview on the big ideas being researched in physics at the time. It's told in a straightforward style spiked with clever analogies.

I always find the Heisenberg uncertainty principle a pretty poor excuse for why things simply are. I didn't realise how little we knew about the atomic structure. And one question i was hoping would be at least probed was what keeps the electrons whizzing around the nucleus, surely that is 'perpetual motion'? Where do electrons get the impetus to keep going? "

Well okay then, disbelief suspended'. Ah well."
147,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4698630-joshua-tintner,5,"Feynman, when I understand him, repaints my perception of the world and fills me with wonder. He makes me think, and then smile. I love how he explains something that I already “know”, but makes me subtly reframe my thoughts, such as by contrasting nuclear with conventional explosions by mentioning only the atomic structure: “the atomic bomb has to do with changes inside the nucleus, while the explosion of TNT has to do with the changes of the electrons on the outside of the atoms”.But my favorite section of this book is one where Feynman’s own sense of excitement at pondering cosmic mysteries is palpable: you can make a ratio of the the gravitational attraction of two electrons relative to the electrical repulsion between the same electrons, and come out with this large number of 1/(4.17x10 to the 42nd). You can almost see the twinkle in his eyes as Feynman explains that this “fantastic number is a natural constant, so it involves something deep in nature. Where could such a tremendous number come from? Some say that we shall one day find the ‘universal equation’, and in it, one of the roots will be this number.” He goes on to consider a few possibilities, including that the number may be related to the age of the universe. I know I’ll never find a universal equation, but its fun to turn my thoughts for a few pages to discovery on such an epic scale."

There's very little beyond classical mechanics (a section on quantum mechanics towards the end), but most of the value here, as with other Feynman readings, are his thoughts on his approach to science, reasoning from fundamental principles and a bit of science history."

Feynman clearly articulates his thoughts and manages to make complicated topics seem rather less difficult than they actually are, exactly what a teacher should aim at. It's as he says: ""I am going to assume that the reader wants to become a physicist, not because this is a fact, but because every teacher assumes this."""
168,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6539564-lance-schonberg,4,"Excerpts from the Feyman lectures done in the 1960s. This is not the place to go into details about Richard Feynman’s life and career, so I’ll just leave it here that he was one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century. Also one of the greatest teachers of physics from what I’ve read, although not generally at an introductory level.I read the counterpart to this book, Six Not-So-Easy Pieces, years ago and remember enjoying the style and the concept presentation. Math is fun, but sometimes can get in the way of the basic concepts, and sometimes I’d really rather save the math for deeper exploration of the subject if I’m going to.Six Easy Pieces saves that math for later. Mostly.After the various introductions are out of the way, chapter one provides a very accessible introduction to atomic theory, at least atomic theory of the 1960s, and I’m not sure how much we, as a species, have built on top of that in the past fifty years. I think it was an odd choice to lead the book with, but it worked into a nice reminder for things I haven’t thought much about in a long time. That reminder pulled up other things, and I might be getting interested in physics at a more fundamental level again.Chapter two delivers a State of Physics report for the mid 1960s, the time when the chapters of this book were originally culled from The Feynman Lectures. I know that there have been changes and advancements in every science, not just physics, but I haven’t followed most sciences closely enough since my university days to know what many of them are or how big they are. I’m also well aware that things have changed since those days, twenty years ago and more, and continue to change all of the time with new discoveries. But it’s a good snapshot.Next comes a great chapter/lecture on how physics relates to a variety of other sciences: chemistry, biology (lots here), astronomy, geology, meteorology (still very primitive at the time), and even psychology. I can only conclude the good doctor believes that physics rules the universe! Supported by mathematics, of course. (Feynman does note that astronomy both gave birth to physics and is still so close to it that many of the examples given in his lectures are astronomical in origin.) The final paragraph of this chapter is dedicated to a science-based analysis of the poetic line, “The whole universe is in a glass of wine.” I suspect that poet may have been Feynman himself.Then, a nice introduction on the Conservation of Energy, including clear descriptions of potential and kinetic energy, with some variety (e.g. heat, spring) mixed in, plus some brief moments spent on electrical, chemical, nuclear, and even mass energy. And Professor Feynman is very careful to remind us that the whole idea of Conservation of Energy depends on things being part of a closed system. There’s also a brief paragraph or two spent on other conservation laws and how they relate.I remember being bored by gravity as a student. Newton’s Theory of Gravitation summarized to a quick, easy formula to plug numbers into and get what you wanted out of it. So long as you remembered the right value for the constant, all was well. Feynman gives a little bit of the story behind the development of that theory, the gravitational constant, and just what kind of revolution it really was. He also gives just a hint of the modifications made to the theory by Relativity and some of the scientific fallout from that.Now, there is a little bit of math, or at least formula, in the final “Piece” on Quantum Behaviour, but it’s not too complicated and really more used for illustration. Feynman doesn’t walk you through proofs and solve equations, he just drops a few equations in so you can see how things work mathematically—the pictures give a better idea of what he’s talking about, which is a buildup, in stages to the Double Slit experiment you may have run across in other texts, or really almost anytime Quantum Mechanics comes up. Feynman’s explanation of how the experiment works, its results, and what those may or may not mean are extremely readable. There’s also a quick intro to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and reminds us of the basis of the weirdness of Quantum physics, something that should still be a weird thing to most people, that watching something changes the result.Here endeth the lessons presented in this book, but with far more available from the frequently mentioned, though never named, set of wider volumes, The Feynman Lectures On Physics.Overall Rating: 4.5 Stars. I very much enjoyed the book and it makes me want to consider going back for all of the Feynman Lectures, but I stop just a little short of loving it. This is great foundational material at an accessible level. Quantum electrodynamics and path integrals (both of which are far beyond my current physics capability and are likely to remain there) may be what he’s best known for in science circles, but he was also an excellent teacherMy favourite little bit of the text: “We seem gradually to be groping toward an understanding of the world of subatomic particles, but we really do not know how far we have yet to go in this task.” Science is always trying to learn more."

This meant I was very familiar with all of the content so didn't feel like I learned anything knew. However, I do think it is well written and the concepts are well explained so would probably recommend this for people less familiar with physics."
252,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291872-thomas,4,"About twenty years ago, I read Feynman's two memoirs based on a co-worker's recommendation. He led an interesting life, enough so that even when he came across as self-serving, it was still hard to resist his anecdotes. Since I've started listening to science audiobooks, I figured it would serve me well to listen to some of Feynman's lectures. Six Easy Pieces seemed like the place to start.On the one hand, the best way to absorb these lectures is by listening to them. You get to hear Feynman himself, complete with his sense of humor and somewhat irreverent approach to science, and you can hear the sound of the chalk when he sketches something on the blackboard. On the other hand, you discover that Feynman was a very fast talker, and you don't get to see the sketches he makes on the blackboard. It doesn't help that the first lecture had deteriorated so much by the time they produced the audiobook that digital recovery was almost impossible, making the audio muddy and difficult to hear.It's also interesting to discover just how Feynman sounded. He was articulate and knowledgeable, of course, but he also had a thick New York accent that belies his appearance and background. I think I'm too used to folks like Carl Sagan and Neil DeGrasse Tyson, people who have worked to develop a public personality as well as a scientific background, to expect that to be how Feynman sounded. I don't want to say it detracts from the subject matter, but I did get pulled out of the lecture whenever I heard him say ""yuman"".Along with Cosmos and A Brief History of Time, Six Easy Pieces is a classic of scientific literature. It doesn't delve as deeply into some concepts covered in those books, but since these lectures were from a Physics 101 class, it's hard to fault Feynman for not going into more detail. Given in 1961, the lectures are dated in some ways, but what makes this book important is seeing how Feynman taught these difficult subjects. He taught them without complexity, giving examples that were easy to understand. Hearing excerpts from those lessons tells us a lot about science and about Feynman himself."
253,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76398102-sudhir-nallagangu,5,Great book before you read Six hard pieces. Feynman at his usual best for casual physics enthusiasts

Feynman will catch you up.
264,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15470847-sujeet-gholap,4,"Got no time? Skip everything and read the last lecture “Quantum Behavior”. It’s just amazing! The ease with which Feynman explained the whole shebang of uncertainty principle, without using any complicated mathematics at all, left me gaping at the book in awe.I took the book up after reading this “symmetry stuff” that Feynman mentioned several times in Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman! I had heard vague stuff about all this symmetry etc and also had this idea that it must be pretty mathematically advanced thing. This book was supposed to be a warm-up reading for the one in which he talks about symmetry: Six Not-So-Easy Pieces.Other lectures are good too, just that the very fact that they were aimed at freshmen and these six lectures were the easiest to understand, makes them very redundant at places. Nonetheless, every now and then Feynman’s lucid explanations make the redundancies worth putting up with. (This redundancy is what took this book from ‘it was amazing’ 5 stars to ‘really liked it’ 4 stars)For me, an unexpected result was the surge of nostalgia. Brought back very fond memories of JEE preparation days when reading Resnick and Halliday, marveling at the pictures was the most favorite pastime.Another thing I liked a lot is the way Feynman keeps emphasizing that we know the “what”s and “how”s, but we are very far even starting to fathom the “why”s, and no one should have any pretenses otherwise. Take the following for example,Principle of inertia: if something is moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it’ll go on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. Why does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.Contrast it the way it is usually taught: “Why does it keep on coasting?” “Because of the principle of inertia!”I found his efforts to not let “observational generalizations” turn into “reasons” quite admirable.Did I mention that his meta-commentary is awesome? His way of navigating the links between different sciences, his thoughts on the beauty of sciences and his meticulous-yet-concise remarks about the scientific method are definitely worth a read.Here’s Feynman’s take on ‘it is not magic and mystique that makes the world beautiful’. Boy! No one could’ve put it any better!
I usually pick one small topic like this to give a lecture on. Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars — mere gobs of gas atoms. Nothing is “mere.” I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination — stuck on this carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern — of which I am a part — perhaps my stuff was belched from some forgotten star, as one is belching there. Or see them with the greater eye of Palomar, rushing all apart from some common starting point when they were perhaps all together. What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the *why?* It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined! Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?

265,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Six Easy Pieces is a collection of six lectures by the Legendary Richard P. Feynman. Taken from the Lectures on Physics delivered at the California Institute of Technology, this slim volume covers physics that are “easy” or so I am led to assume from the title. At the same time, we are introduced to Richard Feynman as an educator. His sparkling wit and knack for coming up with analogies to demonstrate what was happening was a great asset.So as the title of the book suggests, there are six major sections or lectures in the book. The first one discusses the atomic theory and the wonders that follow from that line of thinking. Basically, everything is made of minuscule objects called Atoms. Feynman begins with a thought experiment. Imagine a glass of water. If we zoom in on it with our most powerful optical microscopes, we can see tiny microorganisms swimming about. This would be the realm of Biology. If you zoom further, you would be able to see the individual molecules of water. This is the realm of Chemistry. And zooming yet further would allow you to see an atom itself. That isn’t even as far as we are able to zoom, the center of the atom contains the Nucleus, which is made up of Protons and Neutrons. You can go even further, but Feynman at the time of these Lectures did not know that. The second talks about Basic Physics. It covers the Scientific Method and how we know what we know about things. It discusses the Electromagnetic Spectrum, and what we knew about the World prior to 1920. Incidentally, this is around the time that Quantum Physics became vogue and was popularized by the early pioneers of the subject. It gets further into the idea of the atomic theory and how we discovered the Neutron and the Proton and so on.The third chapter is called The Relation of Physics to the Other Sciences. Although this book mainly focuses on Physics, Feynman also discusses other sciences along with it. He talks about Chemistry, Biology, Astronomy, Psychology, and so on. Once upon a time, “Natural Philosophy” encompassed all of the Sciences, but over time things became more specialized. Feynman also discusses how this came about in this chapter. The fourth chapter is about Conservation of Energy. This is an important idea in that Energy is at a steady amount throughout the universe. It can change form, but there is always a certain amount of it everywhere. So we get inclined planes and some varieties of mechanics. It has something on Kinetic Energy and how to calculate it and lot of different images and examples.The fifth chapter is about the Theory of Gravitation. This part of the book that includes the Inverse Square Law. The sixth chapter is called Quantum Behavior. This chapter mainly deals with how an electron and other subatomic particles behave under certain conditions. For instance, it demonstrates the double-slit experiment. An electron can behave like a wave, or it can behave like a particle depending on how the experiment is designed and what you expect to find.The book was good considering what the Publishers wanted from it. It describes the simple aspects of Physics without resorting to too many equations. Using a simple style is probably the best for the layman."
266,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,5,"Six Easy Pieces is a great place to start, not only for science students but also anyone else who skipped physics at school and wishes to get up to speed with what they missed. The explanations in this relatively modest-sized book are quite possibly the best I have read, and Feynman quickly demonstrates why he is so highly and widely regarded as one of the all time greats. The six chapters are: 1) ATOMS IN MOTION - an excellent overview of the structure and behaviour of atoms, this acts as a good taster for Feynman's down-to-earth approach in communicating facts and ideas with daily language and examples. 2) BASIC PHYSICS - a good run-through of some of the most fundamental principles, both before and after the advent of quantum physics. 3) THE RELATION OF PHYSICS TO OTHER SCIENCES - including chemistry, biology, astronomy, geology and even psychology. This might as well be described as a rapid-fire explanation of the whole world. Never again confuse your atomic nucleus with your cell nucleus. 4) CONSERVATION OF ENERGY - the fundamental principle of how energy can change form. Probably the most difficult chapter for a novice, but a decent introduction nonetheless. 5) THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION - charting the development of the theory of gravity, from Kepler through to Einstein. There's some mathematics here, but provided you pay attention, it's nothing to be scared of. 6) QUANTUM BEHAVIOR - includes a retelling of the double-slit experiment of quantum mechanics - an explanation which, in my view, remains unmatched for its clarity. These lectures were first delivered more than 45 years ago, and while many advances have since been made, what is here remains an outstanding introduction to the basic principles of physics. Feynman's success lay in the way he could penetrate the mind of a student and pre-empt their questions at each stage of the process. His conversational tone and relaxed teaching style should not disguise the fact that his lectures here are logically structured and well thought-out. Only a couple of minor gripes: the editors chose to retain references to chapters not in the book (no big deal - if nothing else it whets your appetite for more). And a few of the diagrams are so small (at least in the edition I read) that labels are barely legible. Yes this is a short book, but quality not quantity is what you're getting here, and six chapters from one of the most brilliant physics teachers of our time is definitely worth it."

268,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12209015-jarrod-call,3,"Richard Feynman, like Carl Sagan, was an excellent scientist who also possessed the unique ability to communicate science's most exciting discoveries to the general public. Six Easy Pieces is a condensed version of the lectures Feynman delivered to undergraduates at California Institute of Technology (CalTech) between 1961 and 1963. In only 136 pages Feynman takes the reader on a journey through the atomic world discussing the intricacies of individual atoms within fluids and solids, then he proceeds to discuss concepts of particle interactions in the fields of biology, geology, chemistry, and astronomy. However, Feynman's toughest challenge is to describe the sub-atomic world including wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle. Feynman's true grasp of physics is shown by his ability to convey these concepts to the reader with words and images. I completed a number of physics courses while an undergraduate and Wittenberg, so the concepts presented in this book were not new to me. My true interest in reading this book was to read these concepts from the mind of Feynman and try to understand his teaching philosophy. Regarding his teaching philosophy, Feynman says his approach is to first ask himself why he wants his students to learn a particular concept and then the ""how to teach it"" will manifest itself naturally. I find this introspective approach to teaching unique and this is perhaps why Feynman is such an easy read and great communicator of science. Anyone generally interested in understanding how the atomic and sub-atomic world works would find pleasure in reading this book. But one doesn't need to be a physics enthusiast to enjoy the book, as Feynman himself knew that while physics helps explain how our world and the universe we are in works, one should not take these things too seriously as he write regarding a glass of wine, ""The glass is a distillation of the earth's age, and the evolution of stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be?...If our small minds, for some convenience, divide the glass of wine, this universe, into parts-physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on-remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!"""
269,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,4,"This is simply a great intro physics book by a great physicist, and an interesting read for people with and without a science background. It's probably the book you should read if you've gotten through A Brief History of Time and want to read more. The six easy pieces in question are atomic motion, basic physics, the relation of physics to the other sciences (which is probably the weakest part of the book), conservation of energy, gravity, and quantum behaviour. The discussion is pitched a little higher that Brief History, and there's a little math in there (although you probably don't need to follow all of the math to understand all of the concepts), but Feynman manages, remarkably, to give fairly short, lucid explanations of some of the most fundamental and heavy hitting ideas in physics, and also to keep relating the subject matter back to the idea of how science works, and how experimentation works.I'd always been a little leery of Feynman. Most people's opinion of him is that he's a pretty awesome dude who plays the bongos. This idea probably comes from Richard Feynman's autobiography, which can be mostly summed up as ""I'm a pretty awesome dude who plays the bongos"". But reading Six Easy Pieces has given me a whole new opinion of the guy. Almost everything I read (and pretty often re-read) in here seemed to be perfectly presented, explaining complex ideas in a straightforward and interconnected way. As a guy who teaches science (badly and haphazardly) for a living, I felt like I could really appreciate not only the science that went into this book, but also the educational technique, and I was impressed.There are two reasons I'm giving Six Easy Pieces a four star rating instead of a five star rating. First, the third chapter seemed a little out of place. In between all of these explanations of science and experimentation and physics, we have Feynman's explanations of the Kreb's cycle, DNA, turbulent flow and earthquakes, and psychology. It was a little jarring. The second reason is just that, having been written in the early sixties, some of the ideas were a little dated. I don't mean to say that anything in here is wrong. Rather, there are several places where Feynman throws up his hands, quite honestly, and says, ""We just don't know!"" But in the last fifty years, some of those things we have found out."
270,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2665750-sarah,4,"""Easy"" is obviously a relative term - I'm kind of poorly qualified to judge the accessibility of science books written for a general audience, since I'm an engineer who's studied a good chunk of physics. But I still found myself getting lost in places while reading this book, though I am proud to say that by sitting there and really drilling my mind at it I was more or less able to catch back up to Feynman throughout. So I expect this would be pretty good mental exercise for most people! That said, Feynman is pretty lucid and engaging throughout. It's not an entirely comprehensive introduction to physics; there's a pretty strong focus on classical mechanics, atomic and particle physics, and quantum mechanics, while many topics like thermodynamics and fluid mechanics are caught mostly tangentially, and there are huge swaths of electricity and magnetism that Feynman doesn't touch at all. But I found that when he did choose to explain something, he did so in a fresh and interesting way that often managed to be simultaneously simple and profound. (My favorite mind-blowing idea: conservation of energy is coupled via quantum mechanics to the principle that the laws of physics are independent of absolute time: if you set up an experiment and run it at a given moment, and then set it up exactly the same way and run it at a later moment, it should behave the same way both times. Likewise, conservation of linear momentum is associated with independence in space, and conservation of angular momentum is associated with independence of angular orientation. We don't know for sure if this is strictly true or not, but so far all indications are that it is. DUDE.) I also thought the chapter relating physics to other sciences was very good; sometimes it can be hard to connect the more abstract theories and constructs of physics to things that ""really matter,"" and I thought Feynman did a good job of that both practically and philosophically. All in all, well worth the read."
271,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22104649-c,4,"In 9th grade I took a physics course and enjoyed it despite it being the most challenging course I'd ever taken (or perhaps because it was?). But I got a B, so I gave up on physics, and I've regretted that ever since. So I bought this book a few years ago, but just left it on the shelf, largely out of fear that I wouldn't understand it and would have to then conclude that I'm just too dumb to learn physics. But then I came across Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character and was blown away by Feynman's insight and passion, and finally buckled down and read this (though not before procrastinating by reading Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman, which is also very good).Did I understand 100% of this book? Well no, but I understood enough to feel like I now know much more than I did before, and to want to learn more (at some point, when I have both the time and the mental energy, I'm going to sit down and read The Feynman Lectures on Physics - really!).Because this book is an extract from the Feynman Lectures, it often refers to chapters that aren't included, which is rather annoying (especially because, having given up on physics after 9th grade, I don't know how waves work, obviously that makes understanding particle-wave duality hard), but that gives an excuse for not understanding!I'm not sure why this book (the Popular Penguins version, at least) contains a swimsuit photo of Feynman, but as someone who has rather a crush on him, I liked that!"
272,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49024273-ben-g,4,"Purchased in a second-hand bookshop on the isle of Anglesey (two years ago now?) whilst on holiday. This is one of those books that as a Scientist (not Physics), one feels, one should read - it's aspirational not least because because Feynman was a colossus of the sciences (not just Physics), maybe the ""Scientists' Scientist"".The introduction, special preface and preface are worthy of study in themselves. I didn't pay too much attention to Chapter 1: Atoms in Motion, precisely because the subject matter is a little more familiar too me (i.e. much taught in Chemistry). However, Chapter 2: Basic Physics, was enlightening as much for Fenyman's teaching's on how to approach scientific problems and moreover how hypotheses can be validated / invalidated (pg.25) - i.e. 1) examine a simpler system to attempt to resolve the component(s) responsible for the behaviour. 2) check 'rules' (read: established facts) against less specific rules derived from them. 3) rough approximation. Fenyman also makes an important point about uncertainity in science. That is it is expected that once a specific result has been demonstrated, then this should be able to be replicated. However, Fenyman states:""...philosopher's have said before that one of the fundamental requirements of science is that whenever you set up the same conditions, the same thing must happen. This is simply not true, it is not a fundamental condition of science."" (pg.35).Statistics rears it's head (;-) ).Having finished these 'easy' pieces now and despite Prof Fenyman's exemplary explanations, I feel they are anything but easy! I trawled my way through conservation of energy, gravitation and quantum mechanics. I would recommend to anyone with an interest in science, but I'm not sure the going is that easy!"
273,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31460100-murali-neelakantan,4,"A must read for everyone. Feynman is an evangelist for physics and his books kept me interested in physics when it was really hard to make sense of it in high school. It is not easy to teach quantum physics in a manner that makes sense in a practical way but his lectures would make it possible for everyone to relate to it, even those who have no intention of pursuing an academic programme in physics. Not only does it make the most complex issues in science accessible to lay people, it is a study in how to communicate to students. Feynman uses the lecture method which allows for very little interaction but ensures that the concepts that he is talking about relate to everyday things around you. For example, he uses Dennnis the Menace and his mother to explain the law of conservation of energy. While it may seem like it is too simplistic a method and will miss the real subtle issues, it doesn't. The technique makes complex issues accessible to everyone so that those who have an interest in a particular topic can research it further and can add to the discussion in class but almost everyone will relate to what is being taught and take away the key themes and ideas. This technique was one of the key learnings that I took with me when I taught a course to law students in 2012. Although I found it very interesting to teach, I suspect, like Feynman, ""I don't think I did very well by the students"". I can only hope that as Feynman did, "" perhaps in some small place where there are individual teachers and students, they may get some inspiration or some ideas from the lectures. Perhaps they will still have fun thinking them through - or going on to develop some of the ideas further."" I know I did."
274,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23015731-casey,5,"I regret never taking physics in college. For those of you who have ever felt a faint flame of interest in the motion of astronomical bodies or the mystery of quantum mechanics, but have never come across the opportunity in life to do anything more than memorize and churn through kinematics equations in a mindless high school stupor, this would be a perfect place to start.Reading this book feels like the equivalent of being five years old again and having someone explain the ""why"" from the ground up. There is no judgement for not knowing something that should be ""obvious"" - Feynman assumes that nothing is obvious and that everything needs to be built from first principles. This is obviously the way it should be, and the majority of our high school and college professors have just really screwed up somehow.This book contains six direct excerpts from the Feynman Lectures on Physics, which are particularly intuitive to understand and require very little math. If you find this book and its methods compelling, and are willing to put in a bit of elbow grease on the math, the next natural move would be the textbook themselves. Otherwise, if you prefer to steer clear of the math but still want to enjoy Feynman's particular gift for observing and explaining the world, he has a whole host of other non-technical lectures which are sure to fit the bill.This book is a quick, pleasant dip into the vast ocean of physics. It is a tantalizing and perfectly curated introduction to Feynman and his methods, and leaves you free to continue your explorations in any direction you wish. Highly recommended for anyone who has felt the spark of physics in their heart, and wants to take the first step."
275,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10831886-nico,5,"This takes me back..Six freshman lectures given to students at CalTech during the early 60's by the famous Professor Feynman who was part of the team that made the first atomic bomb explode in the desert and who also demonstrated the reason for the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster..I too was a freshman once in the late eighties in a Physics class and a world away from CalTech.This is Physics 101 which means it is the kind of lectures that gets presented in large auditorium style lecture halls and in my case two thirds of the students were medical students, and it is not the kind of lectures that you get 3 or 4 years later in a small intimate annex room with the rest of the Physics majors..I did like reading through each of these lectures since it took me back and brought back some memories even though I did not end up in a career in Physics. Most of the experiments described we actually did , so the equipment must have improved between the 60's and the 80's and by now any modest Physics department can probably afford a cathode ray electron gun for the famous double slit experiment as well as a water tank and basic lights..The lectures covers the classical formulas of Newton's Motion and Gravitation and just give you a hint of Einstein's relativity , Heisenberg's uncertainty and the strange quantum world of Schrödinger..The great thing about the Feynman lectures is how densely they are packed with information and how they jolt your mind as in the wave particle duality of matter and oh yeah! you can use the De Broglie wavelength equation to calculate that.."
276,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1115629-aaron,4,"I picked this up to re-ground myself in some basic physics. Specifically I wanted to understand the relationship between light, radio, radiated heat and so on.Fortunately, the chapter explaining all that stuff is one of the better ones - it comes up as Feynman walks us through the history of physics. It's fascinating how the various concepts were unified over time.The much-talked-about intuitive explanations are hit and miss. Some are great - the analogy of waves in water for the electromagnetic field - and some much less so, for example the 'reversible machine' idea used to explain conservation of energy.The difficulty curve swings around wildly. From a gentle introduction to atoms and chemistry you are dumped into the lingo zoo of exotic particles. The maths is kept to a minimum - you'll need to concentrate a bit for the quantum probability part but it's worth it. There are a few moments of, 'as is obvious from this diagram you will see that X and Y,' where it's not obvious at all (Stevinus' proof of conversation of energy with the chain).In summary, lots of fascinating stuff in here. Read it, keep Wikipedia handy, and take some notes of the big points to refer back to.Two concerns:1. Written in the 1960s, how much of this is out of date? From what I can make out, it's mostly all good apart from some very recent updates on exotic particles. Nothing to worry about.2. Despite Feynman's strength in explaining some of the concepts, I can't help wondering if there's a better, equally readable, more complete introduction out there."

Stunningly, he agreed to do it for one year only. He knew this would be of historic merit...so in a move not really used before, he allowed to CalTech to audio record his lectures...and he also allowed the lectures to be printed...and he also allowed for all his slides and drawings to be made public.What you get are 6 amazing studies on why science is important...and why the field is so fluid...and why you can't just ""learn the basics""...you need to engage in a paradigm shift for how you view the world.The audio is crappy, despite best efforts to fix it...but I loved that part of it...and Feynman is SO ENGAGING!! He easily could have been a major star in today's world.My favorite line, as he is explaining a certain measurement...if you take an apple and blow it up to the size of the Earth, each atom in it would be the size of the original apple. What a brilliant way to visualize and memorize! I loved loved loved this book (which I listened to in audio, but I also went and skimmed key points in text) and will probably be listening to it for a long time."
278,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697731-courtney,5,"This book is an abridgment of a much larger Feynman work, the textbook ""Lectures on Physics,"" a collection of his introductory physics lecture series. ""Six Easy Pieces"" brings together six of the easier chapters from the textbook to present an enlightening introduction to what physics is about, including some of its core principals, how physicists think and approach problems, and some of the questions and mysteries that remain unanswered today.I have a year of college physics under my belt, and I've read a number of popular science books over the years, so none of the concepts presented in ""Six Easy Pieces"" were new to me. What was new, however, was the depth and perspective I gained from Feynman's explanations.I knew what the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle was, for example. It's the idea that we can't measure position and momentum of an object with any great precision, only one or the other. I now also understand the experiments that led to this conclusion. I'm also relieved to hear that even a Nobel Prize-winning physicist finds it confusing and mysterious. It turns out that much of the universe, from electrons to galaxies and beyond, is confusing and mysterious, and even when we can predict what's going to happen using the laws of physics, we don't know the how or the why."
279,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10797234-ravi-warrier,3,"Feynman certainly lives up to the reputation that his peers and students arrived to him all those years back. While the lectures in this book were edited to suit the reading mode, Feynman's style as a teacher is evident with his simple analogies and easy to understand constructs. The book was interesting to read, but I am sure attending a class would have been far more educational and entertaining.From basic physics to the introduction to quantum mechanics, Feynman does an excellent job of covering the message succinctly and simply. Any non-understanding on the pat of the reader can thus be only attributed to the ineptitude of the reader to grasp complex mathematical and physical concepts, a was in my case.There have been many other physics related books written by scientists for the common person that have been far easier to understand. But then, Feynman assumes that the people attending the lectures or reading this book have an inclination towards hard sciences. For example, I have read far easier renderings of the double split experiments and Heisenberg's uncertainty principles, but that is because I am not a physics student.The book might require you to re-read certain sections, or in the case of quantum mechanics, the entire chapter, but it is still a good read nevertheless. This is the closest you'll get to Feynman's under graduate class."
280,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8358497-paul,3,"I rated it thus because, even after reading, I still do not know who the intended audience for which this was compiled. It is certainly not the layman that this book is for (sure there are some simplified examples Feynman eloquently examines. But you couldn’t actually learn physics from these) It isn’t for physics experts either (except maybe finding some simple examples to express in teaching [perhaps]). Another issue is that this book is selected lectures from a larger edition (this being the presumed highlights [as far as I have ascertained]) We aren’t getting the big picture. I imagine these lectures would be great, if accompanied by the textbook readings, discussion (which is noted that they do [Or did, I suppose]), lab work etc. Having never taken a physics class, perhaps Feynman’s lectures are extraordinarily lively (?) – As opposed to what is usually done. I don’t know. This slim but packed book has piqued my interest in reading more Feynman and his QED theory (Which I won’t understand, not being Mathematically inclined) Perhaps I needed first to truly understand some basic physics before reading this. Though even I, with my extremely limited knowledge on the subject, could plainly see how dated these lectures are. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this book. It has given me a great appreciation for those who are studying physics. I could not do it!"
281,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16392456-janani,3,"Speaking as a Science student, I have to say some parts of Six Easy Pieces were quite boring. The first two chapters, Atoms in Motion and Basic Physics covered topics I've studied in high school, although it was interesting to read them without equations.The third chapter, titled 'The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences', was quite intriguing, especially the links with biology. Feynman asks his students to consider what possible changes happen in an animals' brain when they learn some new information. These are the sort of questions that every 5 year old has, and sadly forgets when they grow up. The chapter on Conservation of Energy had a very easy to understand anology using Dennis the Menace, and was the first chapter where I felt some maths might have been helpful while explaining energy conservation. The gravity chapter had a number of stunning pictures of the universe but again, high school physics.The Quantum Mechanics chapter was I say the most enjoyable. Feynman used two different patterns - one interfering (water) and one non-interfering (bullets) and compared them to explain electron interference. This chapter made little to no sense to me, but that's okay I think."
282,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26259694-tauras,4,"As a Physics student, I probably should have went to read the original ""Lectures on Physics"". However, I thought, this book might just be a rather good introduction to R. Feynman's style of giving lectures. The particular book would be best to people with the knowledge of physics of high school level. As it roughly introduces to the concepts that are being studied more in-depth in 1st and 2nd year of university. An additional fascinating aspect of the book is the general style and layout of the material. Even if the book is a collection of short essays giving an overview of the main concepts in physics, the approach itself is terrific. It is much more interesting and rewarding to investigate laws of nature from their first principles and then try to deduce an actual law, which can be tested through experiments. Hence, that was the exact approach of R. Feynman - to introduce main concepts of the time and move along deducing their implications. Lastly, I think that the book is suited for most people that are at least slightly inclined to science. The only fact worth mentioning is that the book forces you to think rather than just memorize the content of the chapters. It is made easier by providing a lot of analogies that illustrate those concepts. "

The first essay, Atoms in Motion, is a wonderful introduction to what all matter is made of. He does a great job explaining why a gas cools when it expands, and why blowing on your soup cools it down. But other chapters do not work quite as well It, as they sometimes refer back to lectures not in this book. The final chapter in quantum mechanics is much more mathematical than the rest of the book, including multiplying complex numbers. A lot has happened in science since 1963, so some of the topics are rather out of date. The greatest mind in physics does not seem to have a clear idea about the weak nuclear force. He does better on the older physics, though it is hardly his fault.In the introduction, Paul Davies says ""Einstein was quite simply contemptuous of experiment."" This is rubbish, while Einstein did not perform experiments, he paid close attention to experimental results. Sorry, I cannot not let this go by.Parts of this book are very good, but this is not one to add to my library."

This is why you will often find phrases like ""more on this later"", but you will never get to the ""later"". The title is misleading, since the lessons are not quite easy to understand. There are only about 3 places where you actually have the feeling that you have learned something interesting and where the lessons are written as cause-effect-consequences. But in the rest of the book it is just physics as you may know it, but with more ""gibberish""(he talks about quarks like it's common sense). What is more, Feynman has always the ""i'm-better-than-everyone-else"" attitude and regards physics as the ultimate science(disregarding some other fields as just toys) and this does not seem to be in line with all those ""best teacher ever"" praises he gets in the multiple introductions of the book.As a conclusion - it contains some interesting and accessible facts, but this is not a proper introduction to various fields in physics, hence not the best place to start - it's just a marketing trick to sell excerpts from an older bigger work of the author."
285,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16041437-steven,3,"I enjoyed this, but it certainly felt like a product of the early sixties. Feynman showed grainy shots of globular star clusters, and expressed uncertainty about what was happening in different splotches of similar images. I feel like too much time has passed for these lectures to be proper introductions to physics. I still think they are well worth reading as character pieces, and to show the state of physics in the mid 20th century, and for lots of other reasons. There is still a wealth of value to it. Thankfully we've progressed with the Hubble, LHC, and lots of other things in the past 50 years. I love Feynman's style, there are lots of memorable lines. I think a lot of things in Sagan's Cosmos series was inspired by Feynman. I love his bit about how, ""The whole universe is in a glass of wine."" - I think Sagan took that when he compared the universe to an apple pie in Cosmos. I also liked Feynman's famous line regarding that if one cannot see gravity acting upon a globular star cluster that he has no soul. A good pretty good book."

It seems I’m not as smart as I thought I was, but neither are physicists, which is some consolation. (Anyway, per Socrates, the discovery of our ignorance is true wisdom, right?) In summary, Feynman explains how we used to believe that we had discovered certain physical laws which went a long way toward making a kind of sense of the universe. It was a heady time. There seemed no limit to our mastery of the material world. But that was then, before quantum mechanics. These days, you can still trot out the “physical laws” for some harmless diversion if you like – but don’t call them laws anymore. Because they’re wrong. Call them probabilities, instead, but only at a human or planetary scale. They’re not even probabilities at the atomic scale. The truth is that we don’t really understand the relationships and interactions between objects. We don’t know why things do what they do, and we can’t begin to say what they’re going to do next. We don’t even really know what gravity is."

The title is somewhat contradictory because Physics and Easy do not really go together. I was hoping (unrealistically) that this book would be a shortcut to understanding in basic physics, quantum physics, and relativity. Unfortunately for me, there aren’t really any shortcuts, and Feynman hints throughout each of the chapters that the topics he is covering have much more complexity and nuance than he is able to present in this limited space. All that said, the book works very well as a general introduction, but be aware that if you want to have any real understanding of the topics discussed, you will need to go deeper, and will probably need to learn to speak the language of differential/integral calculus.Through out the book Feynman mentions certain areas of physics where our knowledge is incomplete. There are many phenomena for which which we don't know why or understand how they occur. To me, the ability to say ""I don't know"" is the marker of a truly curious mind, and a big plus in favor of Feynman!"

Now, of course the author is one of the most brilliant scientific minds in the 20th century. So easy for him is like, basically hard. But his explanations do an excellent job of illustrating difficult concepts, and his illustrations do an excellent job of explaining abstract ideas. For example, did you know that electrons can be (and are) in more than one place at one time? That's true, they COULD be here or they COULD be there, The ARE in both places at once. And both is actually a convenient way of saying they are in every infinitely possible place they could possibly be all at once - and as such they are technically never in any one place. Getting it? Well, I think that's about chapter five. Anyway, I'm not selling this book, but I am actually recommending it.It really is a well written introduction to the exceptionally confusing and beautiful world of physics. "
289,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2098336-lucy,5,"Feynman is a brilliant man and an impeccable character. Though Six Easy Pieces is not for everyone (you can certainly tell that by the mixed reviews.), it is a fantastic look at the basic understanding of physics and it's related properties. The examples can sometimes be difficult to follow as an example referenced could be on a separate page entirely, but doesn't necessarily detract from the lectures. This book is really meant as a lecture to first year physics students and also provides great overview for methods used in upper level physics courses, which makes the examples not always play well with the formatting. His intent with this book is to be able for students with an idea of the course to be able to gain a basic understanding of physics with one lecture, narrowed down from his well known lectures on physics. His unique style of speaking is portrayed perfectly in writing and keeps you engaged throughout the entire book."

I'm sure if I was a physics buff I would be in love with this book, but I simply don't know enough about these matters to comprehend even a relatively easy primer on the subject. Feynman is clearly brilliant and a talented, witty writer, but much of the text was still a mystery to me. Some parts were interesting and very accessible, but I really struggle to wrap my head around spacial thinking. Perhaps Dr. Brian Cox will help.I noticed several good examples of context-dependent truth in this book, the most important one being Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. This is a very important, ongoing parallel between philosophical inquiry and scientific discovery. The more we learn about the empirical facts of the world, the more we realize that singular, all-encompassing truths just can't be found in the natural world. "
291,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072300-megan,5,"A personable, clear, useful, and comforting read. I will probably need my own copy when I actually take physics. Fun footnotes, too; this isn't the most representative quote, but it's one of my favorites:""Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars — mere globs of gas atoms. Nothing is ""mere"". I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination — stuck on this carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern — of which I am a part... It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little more about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it. Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?"""
292,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4993854-andr-s-silva,3,"Yes, I have learned a few things about physics after reading this little book. However, I don't see how Mr. Feynman is considered such a good popularizer of physics and science. I think that Stephen Hawking, Mario Bunge or even Penrose (in some books) do a much better job.First, the introductory chapters are slow and boring. Later, I understood but did not enjoy his metaphor of the cubes for explaining energy conservation. Also, his explanation of a lifting machine and perpetual motion were not crystal clear at all. On the positive side, I really enjoyed his explanation of the wave-particle duality, probably the strongest part of this book.On another hand, I can't really stand science books that make use of non-metrical units such as feet, pounds or inches. Maybe it's me, but I find them annoying and confusing.I plan to read now his ""not so easy pieces"" but I seriously doubt that I will read his ""Feynman lectures on physics"" in the near future."
293,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28316189-joseph,0,"This was an interesting book in that I kept going back in forth in my desire to have more detail on each the topics versus wanting a much broader overview. I hate to admit it, but this book actually seemed dated in places, which took away from the overall enjoyment of reading this book. For example, Feynman discusses how scientists don't know exactly what causes earthquakes, continental drift, and lack of progress on meteorology models, right around the same time (early 60s) that these sciences were making major advances. Additionally, his chapter on gravity (describing how it works but also scientists' lack of understanding of WHY gravity exists) felt incomplete since scientists have recently discovered the long awaited graviton particle. You can't hold this against him since these lectures were given 50 years ago, but due to the amount of time that has passed as well as the significant scientific advances in that time, the reader is left wanting more."
294,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38923649-chris-peterson,5,"While these lectures were designed to be accessible and understandable to the general public, and they certainly are understandable and inspiring to most, I feel that they are much more valuable for someone whom already has a base in Physics. I am a Physics major and while I had of course already learned everything in these lectures Feynman connected them together and explained them in a way that really helps me build a conceptual understanding as opposed to simply a mathematical one that had been given to me by professors. If you are not strong in math and haven't taken much/any physics I think I would recommend reading something by Steven Hawking or Carl Sagan - their writing I think is better suited for the general public. These lectures will be interesting to you but I'm not sure they will leave you having learned much that will be retained long term unless you're really able to grasp the concepts. "
295,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1957039-patrick,2,"An excerpt from noted physicist Richard Feynman's 1964 The Feynman Lectures on Physics: The Definitive and Extended Edition. There's two options, both equally likely: either I'm too dense to get the ""revolutionary approach to physics"" that everyone mentions when discussing this work; or in the last 40+ years it has become so much a part of the way physics is discussed in ""popular science"" literature that none of it seems revolutionary anymore.As it is, nothing in here struck me as anything I didn't get from 11th grade physics, or from reading popular physics books. It wasn't painful, and Feynman clearly loves the subject matter, but I'm glad it was short because it was mostly a rehash for me."
296,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072527-nicholas,5,"The best short introductory book to the ideas of modern physics in print. Why it's better than others: Feynman doesn't skirt around the mathematics as other popular physics writers do. He takes head-on the challenge of explaining complex math to people at an introductory level, and he does so in a way that makes perfect sense. These six chapters are actually transcribed lectures from Feynman's stint teaching introductory physics to freshman students at CalTech. These are the six easiest to understand of that complete lecture series and include an introduction to physics, the relationship of physics to the other sciences and the fundamental principles behind mechanics (with an introduction to gravitation and planetary motion), energy and a very brief introduction of the principles of quantum mechanics.Looking forward to 6 Not So Easy Pieces."
297,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3513783-mike,4,"As many have said this book is a good coverage of basic concepts in physics. They do their job well avoiding diving too deep or technical (except perhaps the lecture on quantum mechanics). The downfall of this book is twofold: first it's a book & second it's a bit dated. As a book the lectures are made to stand on their own; which lectures rarely do. They are meant to be supplemented with other lectures, TA session, or other work. This could have easily been remedied by adding a brief follow up chapter after each lecture, this could wrap up the lecture (most seemed to end rather abruptly) giving some indication of where the reader could delve deeper. Follow up chapters would have also provided a good place to give the reader a recap of what's developed in the field in the 50 years since the lectures were written."
298,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4282200-rob-s,3,"Six Easy Pieces contains six chapters from Feynman's Lectures on Physics, which were transcribed from actual lectures he gave at Caltech during the early 1960s. The book is worth picking up for its final chapter on Quantum Physics alone. Feynman is known to those outside the scientific community because of his work with The Manhattan Project, his Nobel Prize, and his work on the investigation of the Challenger shuttle disaster.My main problem with this book is twofold: At times I think that some of the explanations go beyond the limited knowledge of someone who isn't a scientist or working to be one. Also, I think that by putting it in book form, the reader actually loses a great deal of what makes Feynman a great teacher and not seeing him in a classroom environment.Still worth reading though. "
299,0465023924,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564491-garrett-mccutcheon,4,"This is a great physics primer for the lay reader. Feynman's verve shines through here, and his explanations of physics, its problems, and how it relates to the world are lucid. While physics has progressed quite a ways since the 1960s, this book primarily deals with the foundations and fundamentals of physics, which haven't changed in hundreds of years.The only criticism I can lay against this work is that Feynman's physicalist bias shines through, especially in the chapter regarding physics' connections and implications to other subjects. Here, like any staunch physicist, Feynman lauds physics as the one true science, revealing his fundamental physicalist nature. One would do well to contrast this chapter against a work like ""What Makes Biology Unique"" by Ernst Mayr, where you will find a very critical refutation of this physicalist mentality."
