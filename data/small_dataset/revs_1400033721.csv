0,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/144579-ep,5,"I hated Physics when I was a kid, because the teacher who taught me wore coke-bottle glasses, had halitosis, and his spittle flew. He also churned out equations on the board, and expected you to get E=mc2 as if you were born to do so. How can one not understand the elegance and simplicity and total enlightenment that this captured about our physical world? Well, I didn't. Because the physical world -- believe it or not -- was abstract enough not to grasp at the 10,000 foot level.Ok, then comes Parallel Worlds, by Michio Kaku. I don't know what made me pick up this book. A lot of reading impulse probably had something to do with stray comments or observations one picks up from somewhere. I had read that this book was unputdownable. What! A science nonfiction book unputdownable. Was I born yesterday?Well, it could be said I was 'born-again' after reading this. From Newton's theory of gravity to Einstein's theory of relativity, to the mystery of the origin of the universe (the ""big bang""), to quantum theory, multiverses/parallel universes, time travel, wormholes, black holes, string theory -- Kaku slices through the heart of these scientific discoveries with a paring knife so sharp that even the most science-averse of us can grasp the mystery and the wonder of the universe. For someone like me, who grew up without religion, found God in a Catholic church, wanting desperately to understand how ""we"" came about, this book was eye-opening, humbling. It does not preach to the religionists -- it's hard not to face this cosmic question as one plows through the scientific evidence -- is there or is there not a Higher Intelligence that created all of this (especially the series of Goldilocks perfect coincidences that made life on Earth possible), but in the end, I wonder if I don't come away thinking all the scientific evidence in the world, and the brilliant theorizing about our physical universe has not proven a damn thing about the existence of God. I would go so far as to say it has not disproved the existence of God.Read and think through for yourself -- if anything, one realizes that so many of the political, religious, environmental backfighting in pockets of the world may be so much sand in the hourglass -- not that a comet or asteroid could hit us tomorrow and end all life as we know it, but that Earth could rotate a little differently on its axis, a black hole could be sliding perilously close to us but we can't see us and we'd be sucked into its Event Horizon within a billionth of a second and evaporated. All these things can happen. And there is still so much more we do not know about our universe! Any of those things we don't yet know could kill us. Life is super-symmetrical, held in fine equilibrium, but oh, so tenuously.The coolest thing I realized -- I had no idea that it was nuclear energy, one of the four forces that obtain in our universe-- that prevents our bodies (its atoms) from flying apart. Here I thought it was something only used to build bombs! "
1,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"Kaku starts off by comparing the big bang to the creation in Christian and Chinese mythology. Yuck. He also finishes off the book with a tedious digression into religious inanities.The syrupy and hyperbole-riddled language is guaranteed to cause misunderstanding in anyone unfamiliar with cosmology, and irritation in anyone already familiar with cosmology. But hey, it's a popular science book, you sort of expect that.Kaku attributes the ""discovery"" of dark matter and dark energy to the WMAP data.A halo of dark matter was first considered to account for the stability of spiral galaxies.Without this large halo holding the spiral arms together by it's gravity, spiral galaxies would not be stable.Later work on cosmic inflation supports this hypothesis, but didn't start it.Dark energy was first hypothesized to account for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe as measured by Hubble redshift of distant quasars.Again, this was confirmed by WMAP but was detected long before.In a later chapter, he goes on to the history of these ideas in more detail, contradicting his earlier mistake.There are many more examples of contradictions in this writing.For example, Kaku writes that the weak nuclear force is ""too weak to hold the nucleus together, sometimes allowing it to decay"".This can be horribly misleading to someone who doesn't already know that the strong nuclear force holds the nucleus together, whereas the weak nuclear force can cause disturbances which shatter the nucleus. Later in the same paragraph this is explained, but it is contradictory and confusing. Reader be warned.Kaku repeatedly refers to the event horizon around a black hole a ""magic sphere"". Yuck.Kaku claims string theory is the ONLY contestant for unifying gravity.This outright lie flies in the face of many researches, like Lee Smolin, who are looking at other ways to unify gravity. Unbelievable how smug Kaku can be.The chapter on time travel was a joke. Classic Kaku packaging wild speculation and supernatural fantasy as ""science"".The chapter on the anthropic principle was polluted with god this and god that, which I found enraging.Even in his area of expertise, science fiction, Kaku makes a gaff, mistaking the human-made robots in The Matrix for ""aliens"".Kaku constantly refers to the cosmological constant as ""anti-gravity"", which is a joke to any physicist, who knows that gravity is an inverse square law, while the cosmological constant is, well, a CONSTANT negative pressure. Just another example of Kaku's obsession with using irritating and inaccurate words."
2,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,4,"My first foray into Michio Kaku's worldHaving just listened to Brian Green's The Elegant Universe and his case for String Theory and M-Theory, the bold theoretical attempts to integrate Einstein's general/special relativity with quantum physics while also incorporating gravity, my occasional urge to understand the macro and micro principles of the universe, from quarks to blackholes, multiple dimensions, boson particles, Plank distances, and everything in between, his name has hit the radar many times as a physicist and futurist who writes popular science books for the general but scientifically-curious reader. He covers much of the same territory as The Elegant Universe, but with far less technical depth than that book, but with a more approachable style as he drops loads of science-fiction cultural references and he does excel at making the difficult subject matter a bit less intimidating. His enthusiasm for the various topics he covers is also infectious, so if the title sounds like something you'd like to read about without needing a theoretical physics PhD, by all means give it a try. It does stray pretty far into highly speculative territory such as sentient beings fleeing the heat death of our universe billions of years in the future, but if you're an avid hard SF reader this won't feel so far-fetched. Rather it's exciting to hear a respected physicist take such outlandish ideas seriously."
3,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,4,"If you are into time travel or a time travel author, this should be required reading (or in this case listening). Because there was so much great information presented in an understandable manner, this might become the only book that I will read after listening to it as I want to ensure I have this one as a reference.The first third of the book was a good refresher and had me thinking, “I know this stuff”. . in fact, I felt a little cocky and questioned why I chose this book. Then came the heavy stuff. Don’t misunderstand. By heavy, I don’t mean not understandable. By heavy, I mean, wow! awe-inspiring, make you think, and realize your insignificance. Insignificance not only in this world, solar system, galaxy, or universe but instead total insignificance in existing. The possibilities for multiple or parallel universes will leave your head spinning. However, as a time travel aficionado, this is a good thing making for some great reading by clever authors.It’s amazing to think that our existence is based upon the “Goldilocks” theory for everything. That Earth is exactly the correct distance from the sun, that the sun is the correct size, in the correct spot in the galaxy, that the correct combination of chemicals came together to form us, that the moon is the correct distance from Earth, and on and on.The mysteries of existence are not found only in a smaller scale as we continue to look for the building blocks of our life but building up as well. Like many others, I have always felt that we were part of something bigger. Nobody can really state what that is other than some form of a collective. My personal theory is (and I’ve never heard it anywhere before) is that our universe could simply be a cell in part of a larger being. Along with other universes that are hypothesized in this book, my theory is that we are physically part of God. So, if our universe is but one of God’s cells, think how many cells comprise a human and then realize how insignificant we are as part of his body. "
4,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,5,"January 2019Having re-read this book after 5 years, my opinion of it has not changed a bit. I still see it as a piece of great writing, skillfully popularising mind-blowing concepts and ideas. However, it is becoming more dated every year as the science progresses. So, for my next reading on the subject, I've ordered The Universe in Your Hand: A Journey Through Space, Time, and Beyond by Christophe Galfard - it also has good reviews on Goodreads, and so I hope I will not be disappointed.June 2013:Help, help! I'm surrounded by microscopic wormholes and baby universes!July 2013:I have just finished the best pop-science book I have ever read (including Balcombe's ""Pleasurable Kingdom"" which I found very well-written, perfectly constructed and also very touching; a no. 1 until now).The subject of the book is mind-blowing and it is extremely difficult to stay focused on the reading for a length of time, because it inspires and stretches imagination to the limits. I just couldn't stop picturing things in my head! Certainly, this effect is brought mainly by the information which one could derive from any other book on the subject of the string theory, but Kaku has a great gift of clear, understandable and entertaining writing. And he simply seems to be a great guy, a person delighted in the mysterious beauty of the world(s) who puts a genuine effort in facilitating the knowledge of it to as wide an audience as possible. I did have to consult Wikipedia occasionally, but generally the book is very self-contained: the writing is easy on the reader, and the apparatus helps in managing information.The book has one disadvantage: it is full of spoilers! Kaku refers to many sci-fi novels that seem like a lot of fun, so if you don't know them, you might risk a spoilt pleasure. I have the deepest respect for the Author for the last pages of the book, which send an optimistic message: we are here to learn, discover and make changes for the better. We are, right here and now, in that crucial stage which requires us to be careful and wise so we can perceive and participate in the universe with more awareness and impact than ever before. If we take the right social and moral standing today, we might be able to understand and enter the worlds previously unseen, become the observers who can truly understand and manage life, matter and intelligence. Is it overly optimistic? Perhaps, but it gives us a great purpose to follow, and it's nicer to keep going with such in mind instead of living with the vision of desolation and doom."
5,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,5,"A very, very nice book..! Provided a radical understanding of the nature of Nature from the physical perspective, while eventually ending the book with its plausible connections to divinity.... a Superb Book!!"
6,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Kaku takes us through physics history from Newton’s laws to M-Theory, his favorite flavor of string theory. Along the way we find Maxwell’s electromagnetism, Plank’s Constant, Einstein’s relativity, Hubble’s red shift, Schrodinger’s cat, Gamow’s big bang, Guth’s inflation and end up exploring exotic concepts such as wormholes and parallel universes. This brief history was well written and enjoyable. The rest of the book is engaging but has some shortcomings. As is typical in popular physics books, non-mathematical explanations of mathematical constructs such as string theory leave us only guessing at their validity. Kaku’s concern with the death of our universe in trillions of years was a little beyond my current event horizon of worry and his proposed escapes seemed more like science fiction than science. His musings on the Anthropic Principle and its implications for man’s place in the universe offered little new. Still, Parallel Worlds imparts a large amount of information simply and left me with a fresh sense of wonder."
7,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1922182-heini,4,"I am inclined to see this marvellously inspiring book as consisting of three distinct but entwined parts.The first part is a an excellent account of the history of modern science told in Michio Kaku's impeccably witty and easily-understood narrative. As such I would recommend this book as a natural continuation of for instance Thomas S. Kuhn's ""The Copernican Revolution"" or some other similar book about the history of science in general. Parallel Worlds picks up naturally and leads us into the twentieth century and right up to the cutting edge of physics - and beyond with qualified speculation on what the future might hold.Which constitutes the second and third parts. The second part is about where we are at at the moment. It explains in great detail which issues modern physicists are preoccupied with at the current moment and why. How did they reach these conclusions? On what grounds to they base their suspicions? What could all of these high-brow and abstruse theories be used for in all practicality? Michio Kaku, being a proponent of M-theory himself, is not afraid of letting his own personal stance be known. However, at no point did I feel that he misrepresented his opponents or attempted to distort their views. He treated difference of opinion in a respectful and balanced manner. Also in this second part Michio Kaku explores some of the philosophical implications of M-theory. I am afraid the book falls rather flat in this respect. For all of his formidable intellect it would be an overstatement to say the least to call Michio Kaku a philosopher. Gone are his sharp and illustrative analogies and his concise grasp on the subject matter. I got the impression that Kaku thinks little of philosophy and considers it rather unworthy of his time - unfortunately at the cost of critical thinking in regards to what would otherwise have been some very pertinent issues indeed. Just the fact that Kaku uncritically conflates indeterminism with free will without ever giving any sort of conceptual analysis of what he means by either should be enough to make any philosopher worth her salt cringe. One is left with no idea on what Kaku is really attempting to say.The third and last part of the book is entirely speculative. That is to say that it is science fictional speculation of what possibilities will become available to us in the future with an emphasis on the scientific feasibility and not so much on the fiction. Kaku imagines various ways it could be possible for a hypothtical evolved intelligence to survive the inevitable death of our universe. I am not sure if Kaku's intent was to provide hope. If it was, I must say he fails. The future seems rather bleak and each of the possibilities he mentions is outweighed by how much could count against it. Nevertheless, the thoughts and ideas are very interesting and if you like science fiction for its exploration of what might be, you will certainly enjoy this book.I gave the book four stars. The only thing that prevents me from giving it five is the above-mentioned wanton carelessness when it comes to philosophical considerations coupled with some minor, yet inexcusable, mistakes, which could all have been avoided if only Michio Kaku would have bothered to do more research outside of his own field when writing the book. (The most hilarious example of an avoidable mistake is that at one point Kaku sums up the plot of The Matrix franchise as humans being kept in a virtual reality by aliens. Perhaps not the most damning thing to get wrong but this detracts nothing from how little effort it would have taken to get it right.)All in all a book well worth reading despite its short-comings."
8,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368200-nathan,4,"Michio Kaku is quickly becoming my favorite science writer, and easily my favorite hypothetical or theoretical physicist. His ideas and the way he presents them make fun, easy reading for those of us who were always terrible in math and didn't digest much about astrophysics in school. He deals with a lot of ""what if"" scenarios, and more than most modern physicists he holds onto his imagination. Kaku's work bristles with excitement, something you can rarely say about a book covering cosmological topics. In most cases, unless you know how to build a particle accelerator in your basement, you're not going to get excited by a tome on cosmological constants and the mathematical flatness of the universe. Kaku, however, is just as happy talking about science fiction as he is talking the mathematics of a black hole, and his enthusiasm is contagious. Parallel Worlds is no let-down, and any fan of fascinating books about modern science that brim with imaginative possibilities should check Kaku's work out. This (along with Hyperspace) is one of the most fun books on cosmology I've ever read.NC"
9,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20189454-brigid-cruickshank,3,"Easy to read, they said; a good 1st dive into physics for the novice, they said. It was, in the beginning an interesting and enjoyable read - but then my lit spoiled brain began to hurt a bit. I stopped often, to read ""real"" books, it's true, but I finally made it through the dark era (despite my lack of warp drive). That is all I can say, however, I finished. I did learn a few things but then those tidbits of information slipped through a black hole and now it's in a different universe. My journey there will have to wait though because, after all, it's summer. And, my brain is begging for some literature."
10,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1802736-toomy,4,"This book is an entertaining and interesting read. Almost no formula, although you still need some basics to get the most out of it. It will update your general knowledge about cosmology to year 2004, when the book was written.The Large Hadron Collider(LHC) came online this year. Some scientists predicted that LHC could create black hole, which could destroy the earth. We all know what happened now. Dr. Kaku talked about LHC in his book - LHC could only create black hole in subatomic level with a very small probability. In other words, LHC would not a black hole in astonomical size."
11,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7555106-lori,5,"I've been putting off my review for this book in an attempt to organize my thoughts so the review consisted more of the contents within the book rather than just a mindless rant of how awesome Michio Kaku is. Unfortunately, my thoughts remained a jumbled mess as my giddiness took precedence.So why is he just so fantastic? Michio Kaku is not only gifted in his abilities as a physicists (he is co-founder of string field theory, has written textbooks, articles, novels, etc. in the field of physics and popular science), but he makes the difficult and convoluted subject of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics accessible and entertaining for the everyday person. An individual like me, who struggled through physics and calculus and who still sings the quadratic equation to the tune of ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" can pick this book up and enjoy it wholeheartedly.Kaku uses easy to understand analogies to explain mathematical equations or the theory in general which helps the reader remain on board when he begins to discuss higher dimensions, the possibility of space/time travel, or multiple universes. He also engages the reader with quotes or synopsis from our culture's best science fiction novels and he lists both obscure (maybe not for the avid physic buff) and popular scientists involved in proving, disproving, theorizing, advocating (well you get the picture) the various subjects within this novel which add much to the flow and pace of this book.Overall this book left me vibrating with excitement at the prospect of time/space travel; the possible reality of multiple universes (think Schrodinger's Cat); and the potential of humanity on earth to become a type III civilization. Narrator: Mark VietorPerformance: 5/5This book is straight narration without characters and different points of view and Vietor does a very good job with the narration"
12,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1284151-holly,4,"This book isn't exactly light reading. It's not what I'm accustomed to reading, either, but science has always been one of those topics I love to watch on tv, but flounder at in class. But I wasn't being graded on Parallel Worlds so it worked out fine!Mr. Kaku is actually one of my favorite guys on History Channel's The Universe (also gotta love Neil deGrasse Tyson) so I was really excited to read his book. I won't lie; it's not a summer beach read, in my opinion, but it's worth the read. String theory is exciting to read about to me because it's almost like real-life science fiction. Mr. Kaku covers that, along with how it relates (and doesn't relate) to Relativity and other laws and theories. He goes over scientists who paved the way to this theory, and everything in between. The book shows how string theory can be possible, and what it could end up being: The Theory of Everything. If you're at all interested in physics or the universe, I would suggest this book."
13,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,0,"The Blurb:In this thrilling journey into the mysteries of our cosmos, best-selling author Michio Kaku takes us on a dizzying ride to explore black holes and time machines, multidimensional space, and most tantalizing of all, the possibility that parallel universes may exist alongside our own.Kaku skillfully guides us through the latest innovations in string theory and its latest iteration, M-theory, which posits that our universe may be just one in an endless multiverse, a singular bubble floating in a sea of infinite bubble universes. If M-theory is proven correct, we may perhaps finally find an answer to the question, ""What happened before the big bang?""This is an exciting and unforgettable introduction into the new cutting-edge theories of physics and cosmology from one of the pre-eminent voices in the field."
14,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4859109-irena,5,"An excellent read especially if you are interested in cosmology and modern physics. Very well written, the language is precise and not overwhelmed with technicalities and pseudo-clever demagogy, but at the same time advanced scientific topics and the latest scientific developments are presented by an insider in an interesting, concise and thought provoking way. Lots of food for thought and fascinating topics here from creation of the universe and the place of intelligent life in it to the distant fate of humankind and the meaning of life itself. To read and reread. And I'm definitely going to read other books by Michio Kaku."
15,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2925334-anusha-sridharan,5,"This has been a great read. Since, I haven't done any extensive study before on parallel universes this book has been a mild eye opener to a lot of things I should be reading next. It got me inquisitive to research more. Once I do a little bit of reading there, I might come back to this book for inspiration."
16,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13180341-jaime-k,4,"The problem with books about science is that they constantly date themselves. No matter. This is still a very interesting and informational book, especially when considering how much has been done since 2004!And how much we need to do.I've read a few other books by Kaku, though published after this one. I found this to be more repetitious than I would like, though an easier read. Kaku really tries to make sure that ANYONE can read this, not just people in the field (in contrast to the other books, I think he got a bit more technical in them). The analogies Kaku offers with real-world, tangible examples are fantastic and so very helpful. So are the diagrams and pictures.There was some revolutionary development in cosmology in the early 2000s, and this book focuses not only on them but past developments and future projections. The history and evolution of cosmology, including how we have come to understand forces like gravity, were interesting to read.One thing I like about Kaku is that he's extremely fair and is willing to show the intersection of science and religion, not taking either side but showing both of them. I'm also glad he included information on Georges Lemaître, the Catholic priest who first confirmed an expanding universe (leading to the name of big bang).Information on the big bang as well as the unification with four fundamental forces in qualtum theory and elementary particle physics is fascinating.He discusses things that are seemingly paradoxical, like inflation vs. Einsteins theory of relativity.I love how aspects of string theory are analogies to music counterparts. I also love that Kaku notes that many theories leave uncertainties, as logical conclusions can't always be proven.And yet there is substantial evidence as to how and why multiple and parallel universes can exist.The phases and stages of the universe are both so neat to read.The Misner universe is very strange, and--even more odd to me--is easy to understand.The parallel quantum universes make me chuckle and boggled at the same time.It is easy to forget that while WE can't dissolve and rematerialize elsewhere, at the subatomic level, it's how electronics and lasers work.The information on string theory, supersymmetry, and duality is all utterly fascinating. Supersymmetry confused me the most.At first I was upset that he described the way Lisa Randall looked as she was the only female in her field for a while. But he did the same to at least one other person later on. It's to demonstrate that you can't judge a scientist by the way they look, but it threw me off for a second since I have always known Kaku to be so fair.I LOVE the Goldilocks aspects of Earth! I knew some but not all.The book dates itself, talking about the Large Hadron Collider and what it’s anticipated to do. Still, I enjoyed all the details.Using nanotech to recreate our brains for bots to use is SCARY. GUYS MOVIES WERE MADE ABOUT THIS.The conclusion wraps things up fairly well."
17,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58375962-david-raz,3,"About half of this book is science, and although a new edition with the latest findings may have been in place, this part is very good, explaining cosmology in a way that will attract both people with little understanding of the subject and people like me, who are scientists, but not in the field of Physics and cosmology.The other half is ramblings about time travel and escaping our reality. This part was riddled with speculation of the worst kind, inaccuracies and just didn't feel like science to me.Weighing both halves, three stars out of five."
18,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26925505-chris-stein,3,"This was my first Kaku book. I’ve been impressed with the writing in all of the popular science books written by big time physicists (Greene, Susskind, Tegmark, etc…) and Kaku did not disappoint me. He isn’t my favorite of the aforementioned authors, but he does offer unique perspective and comes off as extremely open minded. He certainly does not read as haughty, pretentious, egotistical, or self-congratulating as some of the others authors can at times. Kaku frequently pays tribute to colleagues and unsung heros throughout the book, but having read Susskind’s works and only noticing some small qualified Susskind citations on topics that Susskind wrote entire books about (and didn’t even mention him while talking about the Holographic Principle), I couldn’t help but conjecture that some professional rivalry or ego clashing might have gone on between the two. He points out that while specific individuals get credit for the major breakthroughs, the same thoughts had been thought by other non-scientists (like a Poe tribute) well before anything was rigorously and officially proven. He has a solid presentation of big Fine tuning parameters, but I prefer Tegmark’s more recent presentation of the theoretical emergence of parallel universes and the many worlds implications, description of the early big bang, and eternal inflation, especially for a book titled “Parallel Worlds”. He is sure to call out a scientist (like Feynman or a Hawking) on a direct antagonistic quote if it should be known.Part 1 of the book was a great presentation of the story of cosmology and science emerging from antiquity and leading up to and through the big bang theory. I’ve read variants of the same old story many times, but this presentation was a unique spin and added tidbits of humanity to the men behind the breakthroughs. Kaku also painted a nice picture of the drama and unsung heros standing up to dogma or contributing without recognition behind the scenes, and pointed out that if it were not for a few serendipitous events that unfolded and aligned with perfect timing some major breakthroughs would have been set back decades or never happened at all. Some life or sociological events that on the surface seemed like obstacles ended up possibly enabling the Einsteins and Newtons to make their largest breakthroughs and deepest impact. He was sure to point out contributions of women who struggled for recognition as physicists, and I feel that he went out of his way to show that dogmatism can be just as rampant and stifling to progress in science as anywhere else.I was a little disappointed with part 3. It read too much like sci-fi, an irrelevant breed of futurism, or a quick list of all of his ideas. I understand that working up to that section was part of his motivation for writing the book, and necessary to include, but I did not enjoy it as much as parts 1 or 2. Like our present situation in a runaway expanding universe with a positive cosmological constant, the sweet spot of the book was late part 1, and I liked it less as I went along. This is not a slight on Kaku, it is more of a reflection of my indifference to the kind of futurism that does not seem applicable to anything within a few generations or even a few hundred years of the current human condition.It is my opinion that Kaku seems incredibly open minded, covers dry topics without being dry, makes sure to stay in touch with human implications while discussing science, pays tribute where tribute is unsung or due, and makes sure to point out the shortcomings and humanity of those that might be worshipped as scientific gods."

20,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"Kaku uses the categories of ""Type I, II, and III civilizations"" that were ""introduced by Russian physicist Nikolai Kardashev in the 1960s."" Type I is a civilization that ""has harnessed planetary forms of energy."" Type II ""has exhausted the power of a single planet and has harnessed the power of an entire star..."" Type III ""has exhausted the power of a single solar system and has colonized large portions of its home galaxy."" ""Each type of civilization differs from the next lower type,"" Kaku explains, ""by a factor of 10 billion."" A strange way to measure social evolution. As far as I can tell, we are no longer qualitatively assessing homo politicus nor quantifying progress by homo economicus. Now we have homo exūstúrus, or man understood as He Who Will Burn Things Up.Some passages are delightfully absurd: ""There is a certain amount of danger, however, in creating a universe in an oven.""One example of a sentence I feel I ought to be able to understand, but do not actually understand: ""These six dimensions have all been compactified, so that entering a higher dimension is impossible – more than a little disappointing to those who would one day hope to soar into an infinite hyperspace rather than merely take brief short-cuts through compactified hyperspace via wormholes.""A quote from Brian Greene that I feel less awkward about not understanding:1. The tiny mass of the elusive, ghostlike neutrino could be experimentally determined, and string theory might explain it.2. Small violations of the Standard Model could be found that violate point-particle physics, such as the decays of certain subatomic particles.3. New long-range forces (other than gravity and electromagnetism) could be found experimentally that would signal a certain choice of a Calabi-Yau manifold.4. Dark matter particles could be found in the laboratory and compared to predictions of string theory.5. String theory might be able to calculate the amount of dark energy in the universe.Kaku quotes geologist Peter Ward and astronomer Donald Brownlee on the importance of the moon's orbit and gravitational influence on Earth: ""Without the Moon there would be no moonbeams, no month, no lunacy, no Apollo program, less poetry, and a world where every night was dark and gloomy. Without the Moon it is also likely that no birds, redwoods, whales, trilobite, or other advanced life would ever grace the earth.” Later in the book, Kaku explains the long-distance space travel ""warp drive machine"" proposed by physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994: ""It simply shrinks the space in front of you while expanding the space behind you. Think of walking across a carpet to reach a table. Instead of walking on the carpet, you could lasso the table and slowly drag it toward you, making the carpet bunch up in front of you."" These two ideas together are confusing to me, because, if the so-called Goldilocks ""just-right"" placement of the moon is so critical to maintaining stability on Earth, I don't know why we'd ever want to lasso entire planets or galaxies and pull them closer to us. It must be a hyperspace thing."
21,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61270111-sina-keshavarz,4,"Dr. Michio Kaku is the congenial scientist of the media. Meaning he knows quantum physics as much as he knows how to be a convivial person. He fills the gap between science and people by delineating the language of physics, quantum theory, string theory, M-theory, black holes and parallel universes in such simplicity that you can't help falling in love with modern physics. The book starts with depicting an ascetic compendium of modern physics. He then establishes the ideas of the book upon these bases unfolding the meaning behind parallel worlds and the M-theory. The book never wears you down since it is a vehicle to move you through space and time to observe the reality you could not see in your daily life. He then digs deeper into the 11 dimensions and their mathematics. I believe some chapters are not suited for uneducated people since the basics don't suffice for Kaku to express his ideas. ""Parallel Worlds"" states different works of physics - from different authors - to further depict the meaning behind utilized physical expressions. However, as always Kaku draws out different philosophical views toward the subject of his book and initiates a decorous contentious argument among the academic society. He demurs every superstition or wrong hypothesis in his books and always portrays science as the means of guidance by standing on the shoulders of the giants.PS: I always loved how Kaku finishes his books in a perfect, wonderful, and breathtaking denouement as if it is you who are unraveling the mysteries of the universe."
22,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2356237-melmoth43,3,"Albeit a comprehensive and informative history of Physics, I'm afraid the author and I parted company with the introduction of the String and M theories. To quote Einstein, ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" At this stage, String and M are simply hypotheses, with little or no hard evidence to prove their validity. That may happen, but as of now, in their present form, I find them lacking in two features all great discoveries have: simplicity and elegance of design. Unfortunately, Kaku doesn't help my little or no understanding much. As well, his dire encapsulation of our Universe's future, accurate as it may turn out to be, held little more than possible hypotheses again. The truth is we simply don't know what the future holds. For me, the most interesting parts of the book were what was, and not what may be.But still, Kaku is a good writer; and there was enough in this book to hold my interest."
23,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9053571-kirsty,5,"I highly recommend this book as an accessible and touchstone overview to Astrophysics. A non-fiction work in my opinion to be added to the list of books that absolutely everyone should read at least once. The points are often illustrated beautifully by quotes from literature or philosophy, making it a lot easier for the more bookish minded to grasp. It’s always pleasing when you come across a name you intimately recognise; like Poe, Lewis Carroll, and even Salvador Dali to name a just few. Kaku has a very elegant way of putting complex ideas across and evaluating others work for the lay person. So, if you have always wanted to read about cosmology but felt daunted by all the different theories than this is definitely the book for you. Kaku has definitely acquired a new fan."
24,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"I like Kaku's style but for me it is still not quite as likable as Brian Greene. I do like his way of thinking though. He as an ability to go to places and make connections with the wider world that I would not always make. He throws in a lot of geeky scifi book references too which I think kind of makes him endearing. Overall it was fun, my copy overly needed some updates though! Cosmology is moving fast and some of the information here is already outdated. Hopefully he has revisited some of these ideas in an update! "
25,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14036869-lisa,5,"I loved everything about this book. I am an amateur scientist (reading purely for fun) and found this book extremely accessible. From strikingly simple explanations of the creation & acceleration of the universe to purely mind-numbing theories of the multiverse and string theory, I had such a fun time reading this book! Kaku touches on the history of physics, implications of scientific discovery on religious thought, and most interestingly on what time travel and the future of human space travel might look like. A total eye opener and so fun to read!!"
26,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269099-angela-blount,4,"While this book does indeed cover the concept of parallel worlds—and the theoretical aspects of a “multiverse”—it contains so much more material. Michio Kaku actually lays out the foundations of Quantum Physics and Cosmology by reaching back as far as Isaac Newton. He dwells a great deal on Albert Einstein as well, but as Kaku carries such a torch of admiration for his work, this is no surprise. In fact, it is integral to his focus on Einstein’s ‘Theory of Everything.’ 
“Physicists are made of atoms. A physicist is an attempt by an atom to understand itself.” 
 Parallel Worlds was exactly what I’ve come to expect from listening to the author’s interviews and lectures. Kaku’s wording is pensive, conversational, and ever laced with a sort of open-minded sense of wonder. Not so much as a hint of arrogance or condescension. He doesn’t hesitate to give nods to his colleagues both past and present, as well as highlight those whose contributions were sorely overlooked in their time. His use of metaphors and analogies is, as always, a vivid and insightful bridge between laymen and theoretical physics. (While there wasn’t much by way of insight into Michio Kaku himself, he does reflect several times on formative turning points in his young mind—and even shares a professional realization moment that borders on self-deprecating.) Spoiler Alert!: As a part of his teaching style, Kaku likes to illustrate examples of various physics concepts by pulling directly from the pages of many famed sci-fi novels. On the upside, this gives sci-fi authors some much deserved visionary credit, and gave me a number of books to add to my to-read list. On the downside… most of his examples give away key plot points—potentially ruining the mystery for those who hold such things sacred. Consider yourself fairly warned!----------On a more sociological level, it was interesting to learn so much about the tenuous interactions between physicists throughout the history of the science. (example: despite being responsible for laying down the laws of thermodynamics, Ludwig Boltzmann committed suicide in part because of the peer ridicule he faced while defending the (now proven) existence of the atom.) Kaku paints a picture of a still sometimes contentious and divided community, extensively male-dominated, and fraught with recognition-seeking egos. (Perhaps not so unlike many other professions.)Accessible, balanced in viewpoint, and tentatively optimistic toward the future of Physics and the human race at large. Kaku’s exploration of the possibility of other dimensions is a thoughtful physics primer. Favorite Quotes:*“...the laws of physics, carefully constructed after thousands of years of experimentation, are nothing but the laws of harmony one can write down for strings and membranes. The laws of chemistry are the melodies that one can play on these strings. the universe is a symphony of strings. And the ""Mind of God,"" which Einstein wrote eloquently about, is cosmic music resonating throughout hyperspace.” *“The poet only asks to get his head into the heavens. It is the logician who seeks to get the heavens into his head. And it is his head that splits. —G. K. Chesterson” "
27,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4569625-mike,4,"I started reading this when it first came out in paperback and then, for some unknown reason, set is aside, only to find it again yesterday. So, the first 300 pages were read 10 years ago and the last 60 pages were read yesterday and today. I'm sure there's a time-travel quip hiding in there but my brain's too foggy to grasp it today.From what I recall of the first 80% of this book, it's a sprint through parallel worlds theory and M-String theory. What Kaku does differently from, say, Brian Greene, is to look at the applications of the theory he's explaining. At times, this makes it feel like a primer for science fiction writers embarking on a new Star Trek franchise. Which is no bad thing - I always understand a theory better if it's rooted in concrete examples although I suspect I miss out on some of the richness of the theory thereby.The last chapter is possibly the best: a whiz around what all of this might mean for our understanding of the 'purpose'of the universe. Even if we reach a position of synthesising a Unified Theory of Everything, who created that law? Is there a designer? Is there a god? Or is it just turtles all the way down?Fascinating."
28,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35498982-tasnuva-hoque,3,"I actually have a lot to say about this book. let me get the proper words. first lets start with the positive side. I was able to read about things I had some vague idea about. Many theories, speculation and thoughts were presented to me. I was also able to get a brief picture about the state of the scientists that research about this subject, why they do it, what drives them. Successfully piqued my interest in the black holes and I immediately searched for actual pictures. Made me wish to like maths (what). Now for the things I didn't like. It was very boring in a way. Read like some kind of scientific journal, albeit a bit easier. It had not much humor and was very difficult for me to persist for long. As someone who has very little knowledge about the subject only my strong interest kept me going. Too much information was cramped in it. Sometimes I did forget some terms.Overall I did like it. Able to make me want to know more about physics and the quantum theory."
29,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58076426-seng-wee-wong,4,"This book is written with rather high level of technical knowledge. Author is well versed with the current physics theories pertaining to parallel universes. (duh, Dr. Michio Kaku is a trained theoretical physicist) The book talks about the history of physics, particularly how the realm of physics has transformed since Sir Issac Newton's era. In summary, the book talks about many theories that physicists have about parallel universes although none of them has been conclusively proven. (sad but it's the truth) All the talk about string theory, M-theory, supersymmetry and loop quantum gravity still needs to be substantiated with concrete empirical data. Nonetheless, the author fed as much fun facts as he could in the book in a manner even non-physicists are likely to understand. Generally fun book to read."
30,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63773-kelly-sedinger,4,"Parts of this I would rate at 4.5 stars; other parts maybe 3.5. And there are long sections I wouldn't really feel qualified to rate at all because I simply don't understand quite a bit of it! Nevertheless, I love good science writing and Kaku is quite good, usually able to make things clear and explain how it all works. As noted, there are a number of points in the book where I just didn't understand, and I don't think that's Kaku's fault.The most interesting parts of the book, for me, are the last several chapters, when Kaku speculates both on the eventual ""heat death of the universe"" and what strategies might exist for intelligent life to survive even that. It's all quite fascinating to consider even as a lot of it goes beyond the ability to even visualize what such intelligence might look like."

33,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69833039-alexandra,4,"This book was interesting; however, it felt scattered at times, jumping from idea to idea and from year to year, and sometimes I thought I'd accidentally opened a book on theology instead of a book on theoretical physics."

Nothing seems too big for him to attempt to respond to and he doesn't shy away from saying he does not know the answer to some of the more difficult ones.This book is very much about string theory that leads to parallel universes or multiverse. The idea of the end of it all as we know it is entertaining as well."

While my mind was unable to grasp all of the scientific material discussed and explained, I was able to increase my shallow well of knowledge concerning our galaxy among billions within the universe. Of interest is the theory that the universe continues to expand, stretching outward, ever farther away from us, so that Earth humans may never be capable of reaching distant worlds. But theories of wormholes and time travel to other worlds, while not impossible to imagine and therefore likely possible to achieve, present the age-old question, not whether we can, but should we?"

But, time to time he had started the futurology thing with references to science fiction, that makes it hard to take this book seriously with so much speculation. The book may inspire people to get into Physics, but for those who are already there, those who are filled with wonder at mathematical models of the universe and not fictional stories, this book may fail to broadcast.Anyway, the fact that parallel universes aren’t a theory, but predictions of certain theories, means that there are three logically possible lines of attack on parallel universes, corresponding to three types of claims:1) One or more of these “X implies Y” arguments are incorrect (inflation doesn’t predict *Level I, say).2) One or more of the theories X predicting multiverses are incorrect (inflation, say).3) Parallel universe is indeed predicted by scientific theories, but scientists shouldn’t waste their time thinking about such topics.Now, Attacking all these weaknesses on parallel universes involves doing interesting experimental and theoretical physics research. If any of the attacks succeed, the corresponding multiverse evidence is discredited. Conversely, if all the attacks fail, then we’ll be forced to take parallel universes more seriously whether we like them or not - such are the rules of science. In this way, parallel universes are no different from any other scientific idea.

40,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42604293-steven-huezo,5,"“Parallel Worlds” by Michio kaku is a book based around the many mysteries of the universe and the dozens of theories surrounding them. Kaku talks about the many ideas that have been made in the past several hundred years trying to explain the questions the universe has to offer to humanity. Focused mainly around the idea of parallel universes and how this universe came to be with each theory being as complaining and mind boggling as the last one.The book is at times difficult needing additional research to understand its concepts especially for a beginner in this type of area but is does do a good job at explaining some of the world's most controversial topic of the meaning of life. Citing many famous physicists such as Erwin Schrodinger to Albert Einstein theories and experiments used to try and solve or figure out questions that god has laid out for its creations to solve. One of the many mysteries being addressed in this book is the idea of multi-universes and the thought of traveling into one or even being in one. One experiment used to test this out was Erwin’s famous Schrodinger’s cat “,we put the cat in a nether world of being 50 percent dead and 50 percent alive simultaneously.” pg 158. This quote is saying how we are creating two universes one where the cat is alive and the other where that cat is dead, the only way to see which universe we are in is if we make an observation of the cat’s current state. But this is all just theory with no definitive truth or evidence to back up many of these theories. The book leaves you with more questions than answers, a majority of the solutions suggested in this book trying to solve the universe’s most puzzling questions can't even be tested or experimented on by man for awhile.The fact that we are just as far in technology and knowledge then when we were first brought into existence is just a mere step then what is left to explore. There is still so much that we humans have yet to understand and the fact we consider ourselves higher than any other species is just pure arrogance. It is astonishing to realize that we are still have a way to go to even answer some of the most basic of questions surrounding the creation of man. “Parallel Worlds” is an amazing book leading us on the front line of solving the most essential questions to our species and world around us. "
41,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,2,"In the Constance Garnett translations of Dostoyevsky, exasperated characters routinely ejaculate ""Tfoo!"" To sum up this colossal muckheap of a book, I say, ""Tfoo, Kaku!""Apparently, Dr. K. has done decent theoretical work in physics, but his inability to present clear ideas or a logical structure for whatever it is he's trying to say makes that a little difficult to accept. His ""aw shucks"" little-boy approach to difficult concepts leaves more loose ends than my cat toying with our curtain.My suspicions of the man started with the first page, his acknowledgements. Those he interviewed are arranged not alphabetically, not by the wealth of their contributions, but by the awards they have received: All Nobel laureates are noted first, followed by lesser beings. What does that tell you of objectivity and independence?Overall, this is a study (or hodge-podge) of theories of multiple universes and how to book a ferry ride between them. We visit wormholes and find that they wouldn't work well, in part because you'd need most of the energy of a galaxy to navigate one. And because you probably couldn't go home again.Kaku leaps form theory to theory like a mountain goat, leaving the reader, often, to plummet down an uncharted crevasse. His simple-minded and careless descriptions of complicated concepts read like early notes that never got edited. And his failure to fully evaluate opposing theories – some clever and interesting, others ludicrous – seems a dereliction of duty.Look at this: ""The mind reels when we realize that, according to this interpretation of quantum mechanics, all possible worlds exist with us. ... these quantum realities exist in the very same room that we live in."" They don't do anything of the sort! They exist in a some-other-where that has no connection with any room in our universe. This is just plain crappy, lazy writing.As Mr. Horse so eloquently put it in ""Ren and Stimpy,"" ""No sir, I don't like it."""
42,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35306337-harikleia,5,"The book “Parallel Worlds” by Michio Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, is a very good guide for the universe, and perhaps, the multiverse (If the universe is infinite, then there must be a parallel one). It describes everything from the origins and beginning of our universe, to escaping the boundaries of it and what we may find there (if that is possible, and if we can ever manage it).	But this book is not boring like a textbook. It is true that most textbooks have analogies, but this book goes into more depth when it comes to such a thing, as well as making the analogy itself more interesting. Think: what would you find more interesting, accurate, and/or fun to read: if you were to take a fish out of a pond for a few seconds, and have it think that it was in a very different world (which it kind of is, but not in the sense the book is talking about) or if you put an animal in a zoo, instead of it’s natural habitat. Not only is this book informative, but also the method to grasp the reader’s interest is well thought-out. 	The writing style aside, the information presented in the book itself is intriguing. It doesn’t just address scientific fact and near-scientific fact. For example, most science books do not mention time travel as a possibility, because the idea is so absurd, especially with paradoxes (such as the Grandfather Paradox and the Predestination Paradox). And what if you knew that you could teleport to distant places in the universe. It’s just like saying that people can fly without using any apparatus, specifically for the purpose of flight.	As frightening as it may seem, the book also describes the possibilities of the end of the universe as we know it, but not in great detail. Still, most of the possibilities are hard to think of, so here comes the credit for the five stars!"
43,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42753855-ylexia-padilla,5,"Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku explores the many mysteries and theories of higher dimensions, black holes, creation of the universe and quantum theory through the greatest scientific minds as in Einstein, Heisenberg, Guth, Bohr, and Newton. The book explores many paradoxes such as the Cat Problem, where if a cat is sealed in a box with a bottle of poison inside connected to a hammer, which is connected to a Geiger counter placed near a piece of uranium. There is a 50 percent chance that the uranium will decay setting off the Geiger counter, which sets off the hammer breaking the glass bottle of poison killing the cat. “The cat is both dead and alive because the universe has split into two. In one universe, the cat is dead; in another universe, the cat is alive”. Like this, your mind will take a journey through the universe that will surely expose thoughts never thought of before. This book touches on many theories said and tested throughout history and clearly explains content with many analogies. I was surprisingly impressed on how the author, Michio Kaku, presents these meticulous, complex theories in a way that can be articulated by young readers. One of my favorite parts of the book was when Dr. Kaku decided to take a philosophical turn with the quantum controversy by George Berkeley that objects only exist because humans are there to observe them. “If a tree falls in a forest but no one is there to see it, then it does not really fall?” I recommend for all who have a deep curiosity of astronomy, quantum physics, and the mysteries of the universe.

But I never regret I started to read this book and finally finish it. Mr. Kaku successfully delivered comprehensive explanation about the universe.The book contains the A to Z of our universe. From the formation of the universe, the possibilities of the parallel universes, to some concepts for our civilazation to survive the death of our current universe by moving to the new one. One of the things that I like the most about this book is Mr. Kaku invited us to contemplate our life in our current time on Earth, he wanted us to celebrate our existence and utilize our life for beneficial things that could lead to better life for our descendant.Subjectively, the main down side of this book is some (if not most) of the contents of this book are too intense and complex. With only my highschool level of newtonian physics background and non-existence quantum physics background, sometimes it took good amount of time and several re-read for me to completely understand the concept and the content explained in the book and made it a little bit boring at times. Overall, this is a really good book to learn about our universe and all of things related to it. Thought the content is a little bit hard but it was so exciting to know and learn new things. I'd recommend this book to people who have interest in universe and physics in general."

There are so many things that we have to discover and are being discovered that are revolutionizing what we previously thought. For example, recently in physics we had a set number how the maximum mass something could be, astronomers then found a cluster that proved this theory wrong ultimately boggling the minds of today's brightest minds.In this book they go more in depth into many topics so that the reader understands basic theories proposed by multiple projects. These theories go over many different genres of Astronomy. They include the multiple String theories to even the theory of Schrodinger's cat and the multiple dimensions. This book blows the mind of its readers by filling it to the capacity with things you have never even thought of, although its not really a book but more of a collection of many different theories.This was definitely a fantastic read. Although it follows no direct storyline it goes over all different constructs of the universe. Each seperate catagory which are devided into chapters intrigued me more and more making me want to finish the whole book in the fastest amount of time. I genuinely enjoyed this book and a lot of people say they cannot put the book down and this was definatly one of those. "

A few rare spots he delves into the mathematics and in some places he goes too long in the history of a particular theory, but mostly he explores the realms of other places that we cannot currently detect with our senses and instruments.I like Mr. Kaku’s writing style and on TV, during his presentations of science, when he explains in a calming voice such topics as the end of the universe. He reminds me of Carl Sagan and his whimsical explanations about all the things we do not know concerning the universe.The problem with science books is that they can quickly become outdated. This was written in 2006 during the heyday of string theory and the development of M-theory. Whether these continue to become the prevailing winds of the Theory of Everything (TOE) or the Grand Unifying Theory (GUT) has yet to be determined. Yet, the book is still worth a read regardless what happens in quantum physics because what happened to the universe in the past and what will happen in the future will most probably continue to be theory."
47,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35205135-alopexin,3,"I started to read this with a measure of excitement because I like (some of) Marvel and (some) scifi and I'm all about that multiverse. But little by little this book wore down on me and I don't enjoy it at all. Most of the reasoning is so abstract they flew right above my head. To tie in with purely physic and cosmological knowledge there are also questions of ethic and philosophical dimensions (Like, when can you say that something exists??) It just makes me want to tear my hair out. Half way through the book I start to space out a lot and basically I was just persevering to glean out any bit, any trivia that I might understand and remember. The author believes that a person non-initiated in astrophysics can understand this book. I'M SORRY I FAILED YOU, AUTHOR. So Even if I didn't enjoy this book I'm putting three stars on it because I don't want my intellectual limits to penalize this massive, comprehensive work's rating. "
48,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73490-jihad,4,"Most of the book is a general history of physics and cosmology, not unlike many other general science books. What really stood out to me is the discussion towards the end of the book of ideas about parallel universes. I've read other books briefly mention the possibility of parallel universes, but never have I read such a deep discussion about them. There are fascinating ideas of how future advanced civilizations could do things like traveling to a parallel universe, or escape the end of our universe by creating another universe. It just blew my mind.. the realization that while our engineering capabilities are so far behind to realize such potentialities, our scientific minds are advanced enough to consider them in quite some detail."
49,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6128676-peter,5,"After reading this and rating it a few years ago, I find myself still thinking about it's contents and impact on my outlook to this day. I felt I should write down a review that simply stated that this book is really an insightful read to the nature of reality and it should affect your frame of mind in regards to the universe (if you have not much exposure in deep physics concepts). Although, I do have to admit that it is dry and may be extremely difficult to read. I took a long time to read this book. Others I know have found it difficult to read and some have put the book down entirely. But it is enlightening, if you dare delve into this text. Also the last 50 pages are a little sci-fi and zany. Possibly depressing. Enjoy!"
50,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2063636-adam-sprague,3,"Parts of this book I loved, while other parts suffered from a few problems:1. Kaku forgets his readers are, in fact, not physicists. 2. Far too much speculation3. Reads like an Einstein biography at timesIn short, Kaku may not have had enough information for a book, but rolled with it anyway.Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot from reading it, and there were some truly jaw-dropping moments, but the last 100 pages or so of pure speculation with no scientific data to back up any of the claims he made was a bit too much.Still, if you love cosmology, this is something I would still recommend reading."
51,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655975-andr,5,"Great book! Yes, I loved it. Michio Kaku really does belong to my favorite authors. He covers almost everything about quantum physics, cosmology and all that in his book, including Maths. This book is not only for the layman, but also for the advanced reader. At least in my opinion. 517 pages also takes quite some time to read."
52,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,4," If you are interested in cosmology (like me), then this is the book for you. fascinating and approachable to anyone who knows some basic physics. I like Kaku's random stories of physicists and his style of writing. Parallel Worlds is a science book that reads like a work of literature. Also highly recommend Michio Kaku's Visions and Hyperspace."
53,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3079724-chad-kohalyk,3,"After reading this book, I can finally read and understand the Wikipedia article on string theory.Though I could do without the first bit, and last couple of chapters (and all the unnecessary references to theology), the middle of the book, which gives an easy to grasp explanation of quantum theory, string theory and m-theory, was excellent."
54,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2557898-agnes,5,"After finishing this book I literally hugged it. If you love physic, dont love it but you love to read and you are interested about space, this should be a must read. I am pretty sure after this read you just want to know more and more about it. About space, time travel, parallel worlds, and all that crazy theories in physic you never really understood. You cant get enough of it. Wonderful read."
55,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891662-max-wilson,3,Just finished this one - good read but very similar to Hyperspace. This book is less fanciful and discusses more Quantum Theory than cosmology.
56,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27561315-mike-alcazaren,4,Excellent book. I love how Dr. Kaku is able to take complex topics and break them into more palatable chunks. A few of the concepts were still over my head. 
57,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942757-rrrrrron,5,This is one of the best and most accessible books on string and m-theory that I have read. Also a good update on the developments in cosmology in the past 5-10 years.
58,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16371687-russell-upol,5,Amazing read... Probably would need to read a few more times just to be fully satisfied... ha ha! A must read for anyone who's interested in the cosmos... and beyond! Mind blowing stuffs :)
59,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61782419-whatthegemini,4,He will make difficult confusing concepts seem a little less difficult and a little less confusing. His book and lectures are wondeful. I would highly recommend his books.
60,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21611728-g-j-griffiths,5,"Michio Kaku’s brilliant book is one of those few that make the reader feel sad at the end. This is not because it has a denouement that pulls out the tears for the events that overtake any of the participants but because of the author’s skill of inspirational explanation about such an incredible subject. You just feel as though you want more of this kind of elegant and entertaining exposition. What could be considered to be very dry and difficult areas of physics to make explicable to those with little interest in or knowledge of science are made as compelling and as intriguing as any crime thriller. The main subjects Kaku tackles are cosmology and quantum theory, as well as a fair dose of string theory which is his specialism. But his weaving of philosophy, science history and the many anecdotes surrounding famous names, for example Newton, Einstein, Darwin, Hawking, as well as some less well-known physicists to layperson readers, has produced an extremely comprehensive book about parallel universes that is accessible and fascinating – without as I recall any sign of an equation throughout it!The “events” of which I spoke earlier are all those, physical, chemical, or biological that have occurred since the so-called Big Bang and Inflation; and those that are still yet to descend upon all planets, galaxies, universes; and include all forms of life and consciousness as the “participants”. When the author moves towards the end of the book on to the subject of the purpose and meanings of life and the universe it is with great sensitivity, even optimism, and his undoubted enthusiasm and awe for the wonders and mysteries of “everything” in this universe also comes through. Many of the subjects are handled with a hint of fun and amusement from Michio Kaku and this often helped to balance my own large lumps of scepticism in some of his discussions. Another great bonus for this particular reader was a better grasp of string theory, which I once despaired of ever achieving. Highly recommended to anyone interested in the destiny of humanity in this or any other world – one that may be just a few millimetres away."
61,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100688021-ben-lyons,5,"I have to say I was surprised by this book. For a non-fiction physics book, I’m amazed at how difficult it was to put down. As an A-Level student planning to study Astrophysics at university this September, I’m used to reading these non-fiction science books, but usually I’d need motivation to get through them. In Parallel Worlds however, I found myself reading for hours on end without losing concentration. Kaku is an incredible author when it comes to popularising physics. It feels as if he makes complex scientific theory feel as if it’s a story, like a tale within the book. He often references a lot of the theories to actual sci if novels and films to help people understand how these ideas fit into the actual world. For the most part the book is very clear with Kaku using excellent analogies to explain his points; I must however point out that a certain degree of scientific knowledge is necessary to understand some parts of the book. As I said earlier, I’m studying physics which makes some of these complex theories a lot easier for me to comprehend, yet there were still parts of the book that sent my head spinning. There is a lot of mention of symmetries, especially when concerning M-Theory. Kaku doesn’t really explain symmetry In much depth so when he references it over and over again, you start to get lost on what’s going on. I’d like to add that M-Theory is an extremely complicated theory and just visualising it is extremely difficult. I find that this both adds to and takes away from the book. It gives you an insight into current research and ideas that are still being tested today and leaves you in awe at how spectacular the theory is, but it also leaves you rather confused trying to understand it, especially when it comes to dimensions (I will say no more) Overall Parallel Worlds is an excellent book that makes very difficult parts of physics feel almost easy. I’d recommend it to anyone studying physics or anyone with a particular interest in astrophysics or quantum mechanics. "
62,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/553795-nemo,5,"Started in BJ for the first 70page as my last read of ""the grand book reading season created by cronavirus during home stay for 2.5 months"", continue the 2nd 70-page during BJ-SZ flight, and finish the rest several 70pages during hk stay. I bought it quite some years ago in Collectables (a bookshop already out of business) and till today was intrigued to read, mainly as a sequence to reading Hawking's great two books. I really enjoyed the writing style of this author, not quite as succincnt as Hawking, but definitely a better writer (or a better fit to me) than Dawkins. What I like most is again the chapters discussing the meaning of universe (or multiverse), why such a grand design and what we can do to escape the end of the universe. Two most shocking views 1) the dinosaur fossils dont really exist until you look at them. but when you look at them, they spring into existence as if they had existed millions of years ago. 2)when you walk across a room you would have to consider all possible paths that take you to Mars, Jupiter, other stars, even paths that go backward in time back to the big bang. The sum of these numbers over paths that were bizarre and violated Newton's law of motion usually canceled out to give a small total. 3) the universe can be created out of nothing (or by using a total mass of one ounce), which is so similar to acient Taoist teaching. BUT, I sitll dont find answer to ""why"", why is there something rather than nothing? Maybe I should continue to read Hawking's ""Grand Design"", and more other books. The 11-dimension M theory and various techs of string maths in this book, well, still sound quite a tian-shu to me, but the author knows when to make a stop to pure tech writing. So overall a very reader freindly book, and it triggered a lot of deep thoughts about universe. "
63,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14818760-rachel,4,"I'd seen Michio Kaku on TV before, describing M-theory, which I've regarded as perhaps the most beautiful theory to come out of science. I'd been wanting to read more about it for years before finally picking up [i]Parallel Worlds[/i]. I specifically wanted to read something by Dr. Kaku simply because I liked his personality based on what I'd seen, so I thought I might inherently find his writing more engaging as an indirect result. Here's the thing: I have no physics qualifications whatsoever. Cosmology is basically one of my little side interests, which I think stems from being exposed to my dad's astronomy books with all the jaw-dropping pictures of stars and supernovae as a kid. It's a subject I read about on occasion on my own, because even though I'm not in a scientific field, I have always wanted certain questions answered, and I have wanted truthful answers:1. Why are we here?2. Where did we come from?3. Where did our origin come from?Much of Kaku's answers are theoretical. I'm not sure why people complain about that, because he is a THEORETICAL physicist, using the bits we do know to see if it'll maybe help us understand the universe better. And honestly, the fact that these ideas can be generated from the science we do know and think we understand, is absolutely remarkable.One thing I will say is not every single section of this book made perfect sense to me. Some of the explanations were either too abstract for a non-physicist like myself to understand, or I just got too curious about how some of this stuff worked that my brain wouldn't compute until my more basic-level questions were answered. However, I will say I got most of it, and more than enough to feel impacted by the different things being described throughout the book. That being said, if you have a superior understanding of physics, based on other reviews I've seen, maybe read some of Kaku's work published in scientific journals if you're going to be too picky for a popular science book dealing with theoretical physics. One thing I appreciated was Kaku didn't pretend that religious explanations didn't exist. One of my biggest pet peeves of all time is when people pretend that cosmology and religion are mutually exclusive subjects - especially when you consider, as Kaku himself describes, scientists are a mixed bag on this subject. Considering the possibilities of a creator in a book about creation is relevant. Furthermore, it would be odd if Kaku did not acknowledge how people have throughout history tried to understand the universe through religion and mythology. At the end of the day, these interpretations were ways of people trying to theorize and understand some of those big questions that I think about a lot: Why are we here? Where did we come from? And where did our origin come from?Kaku's rather personal sign-off was quite powerful - a lovely way to end. As one of the most well-known theoretical physicists of his time, I'd say his opinions count for something, and I think the way he looks at the world is very fascinating and refreshing. I definitely enjoyed [i]Parallel Worlds[/i], and I'm interested in reading more of Kaku's books in the future. "
64,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44102948-dean,4,"In Part I (approximately 100 pages), Kaku describes what we know about the universe (at least what we think we know, that is). This is done in the typical chronological style of 'along came Isaac Newton...But then Einstein came along...Hubble proved that the universe is expanding...But then there's Quantum Mechanics...' A lot of books about the universe begin in this fashion in order to explain current scientific knowledge to newcomers but Kaku's version is better than most I've read and relatively concise. Part II (around 150 pages) describes 'The Multiverse'. Here, Kaku talks about the possibility that our universe is but one universe in a larger multiverse. If true, this could possibly mean that the big bang was the beginning only of OUR universe and that big bangs may be happening regularly which sprout new universes. It also discusses the potential of travelling between universes via wormholes and the possibility of time travel.Part III (about 80 pages) discusses the far future of humanity (if we survive the near future, that is) and briefly touches upon the big questions; man's search for meaning, the God question.Overall, I enjoyed this book. Kaku's writing style is easy to read and thoroughly engaging. However, large parts of the book felt like a science fiction novel and I think Kaku is overly optimistic about man's future. Kaku seems to think that one day we will understand everything about the universe and be able to manipulate time and space with ease. I disagree with this but it was interesting to read such imaginative thoughts on the future."
65,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,3,"I liked this book. I would have loved it if it had been more technical, but I am not the audience of this book. The book brings a difficult subject (M-Theory, String Theory, Multiple Universes) within reach of the normal, non-technical reader. It does that successfully. I've seen Michio Kaku on several science shows on the Science Channel. I like him. I especially liked him in the show ""Parallel Universe"" (2001) produced by BBC's Horizon series. That show prompted me to read this book, ""Parallel Worlds"". Any problems? Nothing serious. There are not a lot of notes, very few equations, and a few interesting illustrations that are designed to help the average reader to understand physics. One might say that such things are not a problem. For me, they are. I've been reading technical books on astronomy since I was in middle school and astrophysics since I was in high school. Obviously I am the exception, so don't go by my opinion on this one.I doubt I would read this book again, But I will read some of his other books just to see how they go. I suspect they will be wide-ranging but not very detailed. (Nothing wrong with that for the normal, non-technical reader.)"
66,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10917960-joshua,4,"This is a great book. If you have ever read Dr. Kaku then you know how entertaining and how easily he explains complex ideas. Dr. Kaku is not pretentious or arrogant but excited to impart science to those inside the discipline and those outside. He presented some excellent and engaging thoughts about time paradoxes, multiple realities, and the existence of parallel worlds. He also talks about what man's future may hold when the universe finally dies. He suggests some tantalizing options for intelligence to continue. He incorporates philosophy, science, and some theological ideals. My only complaint was that he lapsed into some technical aspects that made it hard to follow from time to time. It could have been because I was listening to this book via audible. Otherwise it was fantastic and I highly recommend it."
67,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15142735-kristaps,3,"Although at times a bit too metaphorical, hyperbolical and plainly over-sentimental, this is a rather good and factual book on cosmology and development of different theories in order to get to the ""ultimate theory of the universe"". Many aspects of both history and science in the field were explained to great lengths. It is an interesting book for those interested in science behind sci-fi as it both manages to explain recent cosmological and quantum theories while still being rather easy to grasp and connecting said theories to pop culture. Also the theoretical exploration of future both in understanding the universe and using this understanding for space travel in the first place and time travel as well (if you close your eyes and start to fantasise) was quite interesting. Not the easiest read, but worth it if you are into the topic."
68,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66395940-kristen-belles-bookshelves,3,"""We now have a symmetry large enough to include the entire universe.""Really interesting, if a little difficult to understand, book delving into different theories surrounding parallel worlds. String theory (or M-theory), the multiverse, and others I'd never heard of. Kaku does a pretty decent job putting everything into as easy a terminology as one can hope for a book about physics. Obviously, there's only so far you can ""dumb it down,"" and even then there are a lot of concepts that went over my head. But it is very interesting if you can work your way through it, or perhaps just sift through the chapters that one is interested in. There are lots of quotes and information by multiple physicists and scientists, graphs, and explanations to help you learn and understand more."
69,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81268657-michael-swisher,2,"If this book was still current/accurate I would give it 4 stars. I was very well written and pretty easy to follow (especially the first several chapters). When it was over I wanted to learn more,so I researched more info. And what did I find out? Well many of the theories he said would be proven by the HSC have been proven, but not in the way he expected. Everything he said the future test would show did just the opposite.He should have taken a more middle of the road approach to the science that isn't proven yet and gave more reasons why the test may not be positive. Or if they fail what that would mean. So this entire book while not completely wrong it is wrong. I did learn though and it is interesting."
70,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25859289-reuben,3,"Kaku pushes to give religious/creationist viewpoints equal footing/consideration alongside hard science - a position these viewpoints have definitively not earned. The book was light/fun and bettered a few soft spots in my layman's understanding of physics, but much of it was either theoretical to the extent that I'd describe it as pie-in-the-sky science fiction. If this wasn't just the regurgitation of famous science fiction ideas, the passages lacked adequate explication to demonstrate their grounding in sound evidence. I suppose this is the level of rigor one should expect from a pop-science book, but it would have been nice to have the latter parts of the book stick to firmer ground instead of devolving into pure speculation about the existence of an evidence-free creationist god."
71,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75138647-tag,4,"I read this book as an extension to learn more about the cosmos. It isn’t the easiest book to get through as there are many difficult physics concepts (which made it feel like a textbook at times). The book precedes Michio Kaku’s other book, “The Future of Humanity”, which was less theoretical so I would recommend reading this before his newer book as it sets a great foundation. The book stretches our thinking on what is life, why we are here and how we got here. Was there a grand creator? I don’t think we will ever get the answer but books like these give us a lot of think about, in the context of how small we are (Copernican vs anthropic principle). Einstein once said (in explaining his interest in theology): “Science without religion is lame. But religion without science is blind."""
72,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54899646-tibby,5,"I love this author and his take on the universe and the ultimate fate of humanity is just astounding. His thoughts on space and time are beautifully articulated and he presents idealistic views on the state of existence itself that had honestly never occurred to me before. I have re-read this book around 4 times now because it is one of those books that just blows your mind every time. There is always something small I've overlooked that i go back and flag and look into further. Reading books like this really made my reality feel a bit altered, like i never truly thought about these subjects in such a intricate manner. 10/10."
73,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73478784-johan-syahriz,4,"I had to read this book slowly to process the information. This is my second Kaku's book and he never failed to present enormously about the universe and beyond. I always loved physics/ science but then math came in. I mean I did love maths until a topic about algorithms killed the vibe. Although the book has so much abstract events going on, the author manage to deliver it to where an observer like me able to understand. Clearly he knows what he is talking about and having a full understanding about the topic.I was just mind blown of how puny we are and the fact the universe doesn't even care we exists. Or is it? Who knows"

This book takes you through the journey of current cosmological knowledge and how we reached here."
75,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15310305-sten-tamkivi,5,"Fantastic overview of the current state of metaphysics, multiverse theory and potential future scenarios in the future of the cosmos. All delivered as a gripping tale, exposing not just the knowledge and theories, but also the characters who have gotten us here (who argued with Einstein on what, and who spent too much or too little time with Nils Bohr in Copenhagen?), relationship between facts and religions, and where next knowledge gaps are waiting to be filled.Made me think what could have been if I read this book in(stead of) highschool physics. And definitely giving paper copies of this to my kids as they turn to 12-14 age."
76,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38771557-thanh-thanh,0,"There's a line between science and science fiction. Both are great, there's no doubt that one correlates with another and sometimes, fiction has inspired and then become real science. However, it's dangerous when you can't tell them apart. 30-40% of the information in this book is about how modern scientists/physicists make assumptions about things should be IF their theories were proven to be true. They keep dreaming about making a ""theory of everything"" (the M theory), modifying it subjectively to how they think it should be, rather than finding it. (In other words, I think they're stuck. And I believe that Einstein is right, that God does not play dice.)True or not, Parallel Worlds is still a fascinating idea and there's no harm in reading this book to know how and why scientists are considering it as a possibility. But if you'd rather something more fun, more exciting and just as smart and mind-opening, I recommend A Thousand Pieces of You and other fictions like Cloud Atlas and H.G. Wells's works.*Trivial: You can say that I read this book in either 3 years or 3 weeks lollll"
77,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7693283-terry-pearce,1,"I gave up on this. I read a lot of pop sci-fi; I'm not a scientist, but I am pretty good at understanding stuff for a lay person. I read and mostly understood Carlo Rovelli's work on Quantum Gravity and on Time.I say this to qualify my opinion on this book: it's awful. It just hops from one thing to another without really explaining any of them. It doesn't really know what it is. If it's a history book about scientific progress, it gives no real sense of it. If it's an explainer of scientific concepts to lay people, it fails completely. If it's aimed at people who already know their stuff it seems as if it would be pointless. The narration on the audiobook is poor, too.Avoid."
78,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77300453-simon-mirkovic,4,"The book is very interesting, until you read about 3/4 of it - then it gets all messy. Maybe it's because of the translation, maybe I wasn't focused enough, but the moment Michio started talking about the M-teory, or supersimmetry, or superstring, I got a little bit lost - it sounded like ramblings. Like, if I knew it was a sci-fi book, I wouldn't pay much attention to the fact that it's messed up, but since I considered this something like ""official"" science litterature, I got very dissapointed. So, in conclusion, it is a book worth your time, if you're ready to strugle deciphering how superstring intertwine or what is an event horison."
79,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11232235-daniel,5,"Arguably one of the most compelling books written by Michio Kaku. Relativity, Quantum Theory, the Standard Model, String Theory and M Theory are all explained in good enough form for readers with slim to none experience in the subject (kudos to the brilliant glossary!). The only criticism to this book, as in many of Kaku's, is the fact that they tend not to age very well, e.g., this one speculates whether we'll be able to find the Higgs Boson with the Large Hadron Collider or to detect gravitational waves with LIGO - as of December 2017, we know both endeavors have been achieved."

I always dream about escaping this universe through a sophisticated wormhole and venture a new world which is being promised by our calculations.Michio Kaku is one of the top astrophysicist of present world and this book is an excellent journey to an excellent world of dream with an expert tour guide. The time spent reading this book was fabulous. I was almost out of the world and deeply absorbed in a new dimension which is detached from everything.Whoever loves parallel world gossip and space world, can jump deeper in these pages. "

Nevertheless this book takes popular science to another dimension (or dimensions, may be!!). The writing is very powerful so much so that if I had a science teacher as good as Michio Kaku probably I would have been a theoretical physicist by now (just kidding...)Intersecting between science and philosophy this is a wonderful masterpiece that I recommend it for everyone who is in a hurry but curious to learn the mysteries of the universe !!! :)"
82,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23849861-the-mole,4,"I quite enjoyed seeing how cosmology has progressed since I last read about it in the 1990s (!). At that time String Theory was the new kid on the block.I didn't enjoy the ""what if"" section at the end. Yes, Kaku is explaining what is possible based solely on the laws of physics, and he might be right in that all these things may come to fruition, but I still felt like they didn't quite belong in a book explaining strict science (and science history).Anyhow, I'm glad I read it, but I wonder what else has changed since he wrote this is 2005..."
83,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70033168-aaron-eames,3,"As there’s more about gravity and black holes here than parallel worlds, the book doesn’t get to where its title implies it will go until Part III, aptly mirroring Kaku’s point that nothing less than a Type III civilisation (a long way off) has any chance of accessing other universes. This is because the book assumes an average reader, like me, who knows nothing about fermions, gravitons, quantum foam or the Schwarzchild radius. There are probably few universes in which there is such an engaging book on the subject but, unfortunately, very few in which it is easy to understand."
84,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1657210-a,4,"For some reason, I like to hear about physics. Maybe because some of it is beyond my comprehension, or maybe secretly I am not as confounded as it may seem. Cosmology! Eleven dimensions...the Large Hadron Collidor... I remember when they were building the linear accelerator at Stanford. There was the Bevatron and the Cyclatron at Berkeley. Richard P. Feynman. You can tell me stories about nuclear physics and I'll listen."
85,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8327230-mihai,5,"This was indeed a fun read. Dr. Kaku's writing style is easy to read and understand even for a person without background in Theoretical Physics like me. Besides the explanations of advance Quantum Mechanics concepts, there is a lot of theory and ideas about how the Universe works and how would a sufficiently advanced civilization try to escape it in the event of it's demise.All in all, a fun and informative read with lots of great bibliography if you're interested in deepening the subject."
86,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25528896-tom-lous,4,"Even though this book is a bit dated, it's still a interesting read en gives a nice overview of many worlds theory, quantum theorie, M-theorie, etc, but also a philosophical approach to physics.So in my opinion part 1 & 2 are the most interesting parts.Part 3 reads more like science fiction and attempt of the author to introduce the need of religion some where in the story. I think the book would have been better without this part to be honest"
87,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11253374-e,4,"Slightly outdated (as of 2019) but nevertheless a fantastic read into parallel universes/multiverse. While Neil deGrasse Tyson is generally considered to be a great science communicator (though not so much when it comes to his books) I find Michio Kaku to be a superb science communicator that can break down fantastically-complicated theories down where a layperson can understand it, such as the M-Theory or discussing about higher dimensions, etc. Great read over all!"
88,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98185715-boadecea,5,"Michio kaku really offers complicated topics in a fun and easy way for understanding. However some of the chapters about ""recent"" developments in astronomy are not relevant and recent anymore. But still it doesn't lower the value of the book a little bit. Good for instruction popular science and astronomy. After reading this book most of the subjects won't come to you as strange. You will be familiar. And the visual context adds to its value."
89,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9241468-david,5,"a very fine book that helps me to dig deeper into understand i) M theory ii) wormholes, whiteholes iii) Types of civilization evolution iv) stages of universe....one can specifically take out many other great minds Prof. Kaku has mentioned from within: Susskind, Misner, Weinberg, Scherk/Schwartz, Alcubierre, Rees, Calbi-Yau, Kaluza-Klein, etc.."
90,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12100665-james,5,"Definitely one of my go-to authors.Kaku's work speaks for itself. If you're interested in theoretical physics, he is able to explain it in such a way the layperson can easily step right in and understand the advanced concepts he writes about. I recommend to all who'd like to understand the frontiers of science a little better."

92,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39364424-eric,3,"the first third of this book is a good history of physics and cosmology, the middle section delves into the theories of M-theory, but the third section contains speculation that is largely a watered down repeat of similar sections of Kaku's other books ""Physics of the Future"" and ""Physics of the Impossible"". Interesting overall, but winds up far too generous to intelligent design."
93,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75335923-dropofocean,4,Explaining scientific theories to average person is far from easy but Kaku is very good at it. This book has tons of fascinating stuff written in such language that you will understand it and you are also entertained by it. There are few subjects that I find more intriguing than parallel worlds and this is the book to read if you are also into knowing more about the subject.
94,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71834000-castles,5,"Michio Kaku is probably the clearest, most articulated and very friendly physicist currently in the business of explaining physics to the masses. He’s humbled, endlessly patient and he explains very complicated things in a simple language with many examples. On top of all he flatters and quote his colleagues and his scientific and cultural heroes in an admirable way. "

"
96,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84826805-aiman-adlawan,5,"After reading, I found the book very interesting. Less Math and has more insights and explanation about some interesting topics in physics like quantum theory, spring theory, the big bang, black holes. The last part was also interesting. Its all about the Designer of the Grand design and why should we consider the ides of a Designer. Great book. I recommend this book. "

I thoroughly enjoyed it."
98,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62769037-jose,4,"Very enjoyable science read. Even though Kaku is capable of explaining complex matters into more understandable terms, you still need to know the basics of physics to follow his train of thought.

To my demise, I was so deep into social sciences/psychology, I regret not studying physics and picking up this book when I was a teenager. This is the book that expanded my mind and led to the “rabbit hole” of physics, cosmology, and astronomy for years to come. I learned a lot from this book and plan on reading Kaku’s other books as well."
100,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/522767-mansoor,1,"Science fiction in mathematical form. What Kaku actually does is that he interviews a bunch of big scientists, he takes the ideas, and then turns them into a science fiction castle. Also interesting to mention that after announcing the 2019 Physics Nobel Prize, Kaku has lost a bet (stakes $2,000) on superstring theory."

160,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91784952-vaman,5,Has exactly what a science nerd wants to read!
161,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34014990-antonio-tamez,3,"At its heart Parallel Worlds is an update of Dr. Kaku’s 1994 book Hyperspace, which I had the chance to read just two or three years after publication. My excitement, back then, at such incredible theories and amazing ideas was the kind of innocent, cheerful, intellectual enjoyment that I rarely have these days. I have no idea if it has to do with me becoming older and more cynical, or the mainstream appropriation of these ideas, both in the popular culture and intellectual discourse, making them passé. Whatever the case, and the obvious time that has gone by since this book’s publication (The LHC was still under construction, let alone the discovery of the Higgs boson), it was nice rediscovering some of the more esoterically aspects of contemporary astrophysics. This used to be the food for thought that fueled my vintage science fictional fantasies and day dreams back in the mid to late 90s.The obvious problem is that Parallel Worlds often feels just as what I previously described it as; an update of Hyperspace. Many of the examples and anecdotes that Dr. Kaku uses to explain the physics in this book can be found in Hyperspace. I don’t have the book available right now, but it wouldn’t surprise me if the writing was verbatim, not to mention all of the mandatory “introductory” material that can be found in many, if not all, astronomy and physics books, one after another (The development of Newton’s laws, Hubble’s discovery of the expanding universe, Einstein’s reasoning towards Special and General Relativity, etc). This isn’t exactly Dr. Kaku’s fault; there is so much you can write about in a popular science book before you start repeating what others (and yourself) have written many times before. Parallel World’s is the first physics/astrophysics book I’ve read in a long time. The last one was Brian Greene’s The Elegant Universe, a book about very similar subject matter, but one that I read so many years ago I can’t properly talk about it anymore. It is probably because I am rusted in my hardcore science reading, but I’ve found sections of Parallel Worlds to be very difficult to plow through. One chapter in particular (Chapter seven; M-Theory: The mother of all strings) was almost impossible for me to navigate, accentuating the book’s overall format of presenting fact after fact after fact, sometimes with little to no explanation of how the data relates with each other. But whereas the previous chapters had a slim, but present, narrative arc, this one is just data piled upon data. I’m not the sharpest knife in the kitchen, but I can find my way through complex texts and yet this chapter pummeled me. It probably has to do with the format of popular science books in general. Almost all of the non-fiction I’ve read in the last couple of years has been by writers like Philip Hoare, Rebecca Solnit and Robert Mcfarlane, books that pack plenty of information inside, but presented in a very calculated and literary style, with plenty of narrative and anecdotes that related the information to both the writer and the book’s subject matter. I think the last popular science book I remember reading that worked on a similar level was by Carl Sagan, probably Pale Blue Dot, maybe another one. The book ends in classic Michio Kaku fashion with an exploration of future applications of everything we’ve read this far. Dr. Kaku is usually criticized for his extraordinary claims and baseless future predictions; he is a science fiction nerd at heart and loves talking about this stuff. I have no problems with this, as far as the reader knows this is the moment in the book where Dr. Kaku starts hypothesizing. It is fun and mind expanding and it always has the probability of at least some of it becoming reality sometime in the future. There is one thing that really bothered me about this book, though. There are many instances where Dr. Kaku writes lines like “some scientists believe….” or “in the future, scientists think…” This is very surprising, coming from him. Science is not a static method, but an ever changing body of data used to build an approximation to explain reality. True science shouldn’t be a belief. “Scientists believing” this or that are just that; scientists believing that something or other might be explainable in this or that way. I normally don’t have problems with this, whatever scientists believe today will either be confirmed, rejected or update tomorrow. But there are just too many of these lines throughout the book, a problem when they are presented side to side with other concepts that still haven’t been proven as facts but marketed as such (For example dark energy and matter; this could just be a vacuum in our knowledge instead of an actual, physical phenomenon).This is one of the many good books out there to learn about the basics of pop contemporary theoretical physics (circa 2006, in this case). For the most part it is fun and interesting, but it could have benefited itself from a stricter editor and a more dynamic writing style."
162,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116525753-bookraterboy,5,"An optimistic look forward, and a very intriguing look into the history of physics and cosmology. This book helped launch my fascination for said topics, and gave me a whole new look at the world. As for the writing style, it does get slow at parts, and at parts goes to into (*yes) too much detail, but once a new chapter starts, you feel refreshed and interesting. This is a good book."
163,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57559526-zhaleh,5,A comprehensive book that not only illustrates physical concepts in simple language but also teaches us very interesting and precious lessons about our existence 
164,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6798373-annie,4,"Finally a book on quantum physics that English majors can enjoy - and understand. Michio Kaku, where have you been all my life? For any lay person interested in the history of quantum theory from Newton to Einstein's theory of relativity to string theory, M-theory and an explanation of Shrodinger's cat, Parallel Worlds is an engaging read and a vital reference book. My only caveat is that it was published in 2005, and there have been significant technological developments since then.I took four pages of notes and will attempt to give an overview of this amazing but highly detailed work.Basically, theoretical physicists are on a hunt for the theory of everything, and this hunt is critical for the survival of intelligent life. From what scientists can tell, the universe will eventually die - likely by rapid expansion and a deep freeze. If we can discover the theory of everything, we can possibly either manipulate the universe to sustain life or - more likely - find a parallel world in which to jump proverbial ship via a wormhole.What happened before the big bang? If the universe is a symphony of strings (string theory), who is the composer? Is there a composer?In addition to answering these questions (or, at least outlining the historic quest to answer these questions), Kaku presents some fascinating philosophical issues. I particularly enjoyed the explanation of ""free will"" versus ""objective reality"" versus ""probability"" and the ""atomic world"" versus the ""macroscopic world."" As Kaku explains, to Newton and Einstein, ""the notion of free will, that we are masters of our destiny, was an illusion."" The three schools of thought can be summarized by using the metaphor of an umpire at a baseball game:Number 1: I calls 'em like I see 'em (our personal reality -or opinion)Number 2: I calls 'em the way they are (Einstein's objective reality - that there is an absolute reality outside of human experience)Number 3: They ain't nothing till I calls 'em. (The theory that reality only exists after an observation was made.)This third one is most fascinating to me - especially having studied metaphysics and Eastern thought. Nobel Laureate Eugene Wigner advocated that consciousness determines existence. Basically, the process of observation determines the final state of an electron. Per the three postulates of the Bohr Copenhagen school: (pages 152-153)a) All energy occurs in discrete packets, called quanta.b) Matter is represented by point particles, but the probability of finding the particle is given by a wave.c) Before an observation is made, an object exists in all possible states simultaneously. To determine which state the object is in, we have to make an observation, which ""collapses"" the wave function, and the object goes into a definite state. The act of observation destroys the wave function, and the object now assumes a definite reality.As Andre Linde explains:""In order for us to see that something happens, and to say to one another that something happens, you need to have a universe, you need to have a recording device, and you need to have us . . . In the absence of observers, our universe is dead.""John Wheeler's It from bit theory goes along with this by purporting that information is the root of all existence. ""When we look at the moon, a galaxy, or an atom, their essence, he claims, is in the information stored within them. But this information sprang into existence when the universe observed itself . . . At the beginning of the universe, it sprang into being because it was observed."" I also enjoyed the discussions on the Copernican Principle versus the Anthropic Principle. Our existence in the universe is within what is called a ""Goldilocks Zone"" - a very narrow zone where everything has come together just right to sustain intelligent life - and something rare, indeed, from what scientists are discovering after looking ""out there."" So, are we divine miracles or happy accidents? This review hardly gives Kaku's book justice, but the book itself will leave you wanting more. Fortunately, we can all keep up to date on the latest discoveries at Kaku's website: Michio Kaku "
165,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91417841-suki-wang,5,Dr. Michio Kaku has given us a thoroughly covered and scientifically corroborated probabilities of the existence of parallel universe. 
166,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54151026-surender-negi,3," Michio Kaku - A new age of Guru of Science for Non Science people around the worldBeing a Science student, I have always love for Physics and Cosmology, Although I am not very good with equations and Mathematics (**Still I am an electrical engineer ;) ). This my third book of Kaku which is more fascinating and interesting than others. Kaku's book always have charm to dilute you with history of Science and Technological evolution. Kaku's book remind me one famous line of my state:  ""Books are not only summarization of knowledge but its a whole journey of a human, his experience and his wisdom. So never waste your time to do anything else except gasping wisdom from world most enlighten people [around the world]""  Well, Moreover Kaku has started his journey with as usual legend of Physics : Einstein and Isaac Newton. These prime bacon of science is almost starting point of everything. Kaku's explain Gravity and their relation with other cosmic bodies in solar system. What more passionate me !! Well Kaku describe these complex theories like a laymen [for a laymen]. Read the review [follow below link] "
167,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4," Parallel Worlds is a good overview of the history of cosmology, all the while introducing its most common concepts. I really appreciate the fact that Michio Kaku skipped most of the very early developments of cosmology (i.e. the Greeks), and spent more time explaining the rise of different theories/ideas over the last 200-100 years, which are much more focused on explaining problems and paradoxes that are still relevant today.It’s a little jarring when Kaku quite suddenly dives into the world of neutrinos, W- and Z-bosons, quarks, gluons, and so on, though. He doesn’t fully explain what everything is, yet names them in order to explain the theories which try to unify the four great forces of the universe (gravity, electromagnetism, and weak and strong nuclear force). It’s a little confusing, mucks up the easy flow of the book, and might be disheartening for its intended layman audience.That said, the thing I enjoyed most about Kaku’s writing is that it is so crisp and clear, without frivolities and unnecessary tangents. He doesn’t fall victim to rambling about his own favourite academic field or topics, and instead seems to strive to keep the material as concise as he can (perhaps consciously so, as the book’s intended for an amateur audience). Parallel Worlds is divided up into three parts: the Universe, the Multiverse, and Escape Into Hyperspace. The first part of the book deals with the history, basics, and development of astronomical science, physics, and the universe itself. In the second part, Kaku dives deeply into the issues that modern day physicists keep themselves busy with, and starts elaborating on M-Theory, which he obviously (but not annoyingly) prefers as an answer to the universe and everything himself. Finally, in the third part, Kaku takes speculation and hypothesizing to a new level when he explores in what ways the evolved entirety of the human race (or any intelligent beings) could escape the inevitable death of our universe.It’s incredible how Kaku is able to present ideas that still sound like science fiction to us as both realistic and feasible, and I commend him for that. I greatly enjoyed the third part of the book even though it was hypothesizing, mostly, and with the backdrop of an explained M-Theory of the second part of the book in my mind, I could easily follow all of Kaku’s ideas about how to handle the future of the human race. A somewhat dark and depressing future, if I might add, and one that we have little chance at surviving in.I think it’s safe to say that I haven’t read any book that’s similar to  Parallel Worlds yet. Kaku’s focus on both speculation and scientific truth is unparalleled (ha), and presented me with quite an interesting work of physics, astronomy, and the universe. His ability to make all of this understandable for the layman is enchanting, and he is quite good at it (even though Carl Sagan still holds first place in my heart for making science accessible for everybody).Recommended for anybody who wants to know more about contemporary physics and the issues therein, M-Theory, and who’s interested in learning more on how we could possibly save our own future."
168,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1659811-ben-dutton,4,"Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist who seems determined to bring the complex ideas and theories of his field to a much wider audience, and if the evidence of this book is anything to go by, then it is a field that we as a race should be paying closer attention to.Astronomer Royal Martin Rees called Kaku’s book “an exhilarating romp through the frontiers of cosmology” and that is the best summation of this book that I can find. It is a romp – taking in Newtonian physics, black holes, wormholes, time travel, alternative dimensions, parallel worlds and string theory. There were passages that in this book simply left me scratching my head – in a good way – and there were ideas and philosophies here that have had me thinking for days. It does what every good introduction to a new field of study should do – excite our interest.In many respects this book is filled with more awe and wonder than most science fiction novels (and Kaku name checks a few), and contains as much speculation as those books might. Only in this instance Kaku backs up his wild theorising with science and the potentialities of science. At the end of this romp you will be left believing that time travel is possible, and that out there somewhere there is another version of you and another and another, ad infinitum.The most troubling aspect of Kaku’s work, though, comes towards the end when he begins to discuss the question of God and His place within this cosmology. Kaku is not expounding a Christian view, but he offers a way in which God might be possibly within a scientific realm – for:“Whenever Einstein was creating his cosmic theories he would always ask the question, how would I have designed the universe? He leaned toward the idea that perhaps God had no choice in the matter. String theory seems to vindicate this approach. When we combine relativity with the quantum theory, we find theories that are riddled with hidden but fatal flaws: divergences that blow up and anomalies that spoil the symmetries of the theory. Only by incorporating powerful symmetries can these divergences and anomalies be eliminated, and M-theory possesses the most powerful of these symmetries. Thus, perhaps, there might be a single, unique theory that obeys all the postulates that we demand in a theory.” (P.357)All the flukes and coincidences and “events being just at the right time” (our planet being just at the right distance to support life, the planets being in just the right orbits to stop earth being hit by passing space debris etc) indicate to some that there must be divine intervention in play. If there is a divine hand, than to explain everything within this grand theory there has to be the further postulation that mankind is not special, that we are just biological beings that rise and fall like everything else.And this is the final powerful truth that Kaku shows: that cosmology by its very nature must be concerned with the end (as well as the beginning) and that therefore it becomes a mournful elegiac science.Kaku’s book is well worth a read, containing the basics of all the major branches of cosmology and particle science. It is a work that will produce questions and send you off looking for more answers. It is as powerful in that sense as philosophy, and this time you can back the thoughts up with facts – just don’t expect them all to be right."
169,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692632-alexandria,4,"This book was way, way over my head...but I liked it all the same. Some of the concepts were familiar while most were as utterly alien as you could imagine string theory and quantum physics to be for someone who predominantly reads sociology texts and urban fantasy. That being said, I loved exploring the new, erm, worlds presented in this book. The ideas are larger-than-life and most of them are something I will have to research further before returning to this book on. But I feel like I was exposed to a whole new way of thinking, of seeing, that I had never considered before. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to challenge themselves, not just in scientific understanding but in the way they view the world in general. Don't let phrases like ""compacted higher dimensions"", ""super strings"", and ""quantum physics"" scare you. Kaku does a wonderful job of making these terms accessible even for those who don't specialize in science, let alone physics. The book will leave you a little wide-eyed and wondrous, at least for a time. It's the kind of book I think I will end up coming back to over and over. But, for now, I am still trying to wrap my mind around the concepts I learned on this, my first read-through."
170,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30206505-raj-aich,2,Hyperspace is more interesting and much better written by the author. This book is written in line with Elegant Universe which is equally detailed.
171,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3587328-boorrito,4,"I thought about the star rating for this book a lot. I decided to err towards 4 stars in the end because it kept me interested right till the final chapter which I skimmed. I think humanity is much more likely to wipe itself out a long time before the universe starts to end so it didn't hold my attention well. I think I'm part of the target audience for this book. I did physics at school and was terrible at it, ended up hating the subject due to crappy teaching, not very good at maths but I am interested in science. I'm just not good at doing it (go go double C in GCSE Science). This meant that I had a vague knowledge of some of the stuff written about here but nothing solid. This book felt like a good jumping off point, though I'm sure half of it is out of date now as it was written in 2004 and even from my limited knowledge I know big things have happened in the field since then. I did get lost at points because there are big concepts explored in the book (also quantum mechanics - but nobody *really* understands them, even the people who study them) but never so much I felt like giving up on it. I think part of that is that cosmology appeals to me as a historian in a way which Kaku points out himself in the book: ""There are no experiments one can conduct on the big bang. Cosmology is more like a detective story, an observational science where you look for ""relics"" or evidence at the scene of the crime, rather than an experimental science where you can perform precise experiments."" (54) It's not far off from how Ward describes history in his book Stalin's Russia: ""History is a different way of looking at things, a way of thinking about their vanished meanings. But it does not follow that we can ever know what it felt like to live in the past. The association of words, places and ideas...as they appeared to denizens of another world, are lost to us forever."" (1)The maths aspect wasn't so hard-going that it put me off (speaking as someone whose understanding of maths got about as far as Pythagorean theorem before trailing off) and I liked Kaku's usage of Sci-Fi examples - though I could see why other people might not like it. If you don't find Zizek's examples a constant push they should be fine. As a popular science book I'm sure there's lots of inaccuracies and simplifications going on in here like there are in certain popular history books I've read. I would also like to read another cosmology book that wasn't written by someone who was so pivotal in the development of string theory - of course someone who's spent a good part of their lives on a theory isn't going to go ""it's horseshit"" in their book. Overall an interesting first introduction, though not to be taken as absolute gospel, and a book that I'd really like to see an updated second edition of."
172,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26117407-david-schwinghammer,5,"Michio Kaku's discussion of PARALLEL WORLDS results from physicists' attempts to reconcile Einstein's Theory of Relativity with that of quantum mechanics to form a ""theory of everything."" M-Theory, the newest form of string theory, allows for the possibility of a parallel universe no more than a millimeter from ours. Kaku believes the newest super collider, which should be ready in 2007, may reveal evidence pointing to this alternate universe.Another theory, Alan Guth's inflationary universe theory, argues that the universe expanded much faster than the speed of light (possible because this was empty space that was expanding) and that the antigravity force which caused this original Big Bang still exists, allowing for more explosions, more inflation, and multi-universes.Also, if we apply the quantum theory to the universe, we are forced to admit that the universe, like an electron, may exist simultaneously in many states.Kaku asks the question, ""What might these alternate universes look like?"" Kaku theorizes that each time a new universe sprouts off from the original the physical laws change, creating entirely new realities. All of this gets even stranger when Kaku projects that all possible quantum worlds might exist simultaneously.The author does not shy away from controversial issues, such as the Designer Universe. At one point he compares the likelihood of our world occurring by accident to a ""Boeing 747 aircraft being completely assembled as a result of a tornado striking a junkyard.""PARALLEL WORLDS really gets interesting when Kaku discusses Nikolai Kardashev's classification of civilizations according to energy output. Type I would have harnessed planetary forms of energy. Type II would be able to consume the energy output of its star and might even be able to ignite neutron stars. Type III has colonized large portions of its home galaxy and is able to use the energy from ten billion stars. Earth is a rather primitive civilization in contrast. Kaku states that if we reach Type I civilization it may launch a time of ""unparalleled peace and prosperity."" But that's a big if, considering the greenhouse effect, pollutin, nuclear war, fundamentalism and disease.Kaku ends his book with a theological discussion of sorts. ""If all possible universes exist, what's the point?"" he asks. In a quantum universe, parallel selves would exist in parallel universes, with ""different life histories and different destinies."" Kaku believes that if string theory is eventually confirmed, providing a theory of everything, one must ask where the equation came from.The author ends on a high note, seeing this as the most momentous time in human history, a time of transition to a type I civilization, a true paradise on Earth, if we can overcome our self-destructive natures."
173,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4088780-mike-w,3,"This is a good summary of developments in physics over the last century, from relativity and quantum theory, to the many worlds hypothesis and string theory (or M-theory). As usual, Kaku does an excellent job of conveying the majesty of physics and the mysteries it has opened up. But this book does not cohere as well as some of his other books, like ""Beyond Einstein: Superstrings and the Quest for the Final Theory"", which covered much of the same ground.The title comes from the notion that there is not one universe, but many. This is implied by the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, which suggests that everything that is possible, actually occurs in some universe. This offers one solution to the mystery of the ""finely tuned universe"", that some fundamental constants in nature seem to be tuned just right for the development of intelligent life, since ours is just one of an infinite number of universes, the vast majority of which have radically different properties which would make them inhospitable to life. The idea of paralell universes also comes out of M-theory, the latest incarnation of string theory, which is currently the best hope physicists have for uniting Einstein's general relativity with the quantum mechanics of Heisenberg and Bohr, both of which had hitherto seemed correct, and yet contradicted each other.I wonder, though, in reading this book whether modern physics has gone off the rails, whether the physicists have become so captivated by the elegance of their abstruse theories that they have become rather divorced from empirical reality. I recall Heisenberg warning about the postulation of realms that are even in principle unobservable by us, which he considered rather more religion or metaphysics than science.The weakest part of the book is when Kaku speculate about future soceities. he talks about type I, type II and type III civilizations, classified according to the soruces of energy they use and the power that they are able to harness. But he attributes to these technologically superior civilizations attributes (like cosmopolitan tolerance) that seemed to be grounded more in the author's hopes than in any reality. The skeptical reader will recall, on reading these passages, that some of the most technologically advanced societies have also been the most barbaric, like Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union.Still, this is an engaging book, well worth reading. I especially liked Kaku's discussion of religion. His reflections of modern physics and the mathematical order it seems to have revealed have led him to a panentheist conception of God similar to that of Spinoza and Einstein, not to the atheism that many associate with science."
174,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42591892-andres,4,"Parallel Worlds is a gentle guidebook for the universe, using topics that have taken hundreds of years to flesh out being explained to the extent where they can be understood by a 5th grader. The book is divided into three sections. The first is called ""Universe"" where Kaku mainly sets a groundwork of knowledge for the rest of the book while familiarizing the reader with some of the topics that are brought up later in the book. Part two is called ""The Multiverse"", and focuses on not only the M-theory, but also string theory and more delicate and science fiction like topics such as time travel and dimensional portals. Lastly, in part three, ""Escape into Hyperspace"", Kaku really finds his personal niche when he begins to speak mainly about what could and will happen once all of these futuristic hypothesis are proved correct. He talks about sentient beings able to watch billions of years worth of cosmic events pass in a blink of an eye, among spiritual and religious aspects of these ideas.Michio Kaku is one of the most well known minds in this sect of science, and he does well to show it in this book. I feel the greatest example of how well did was with the translation of mind boggling ideas into simple, easy to understand analogies that nearly anyone could understand. Simple, eloquent examples, such as relating the Einstein-Rosen bridge to the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland (page 118), allow the reader to register a visual in their mind to recognize this abstract concept to at least some degree. Another place where Kaku exemplifies his ability to simplify concepts, constantly relating his ideas to those starting in science fiction, taking concepts from several books, such as ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" (page 146), as well as ""The Invisible Man"" (page 181), and morphing their fictitious plots into something tangible and real. I also enjoyed that while Michio Kaku mainly kept the book unbiased and scientific for the most part, near the end he began letting his own opinions seep into the book a bit. For example, on page 358, Kaku states, ""For me, the real meaning in life is that we create our own meaning. It is our destiny to carve out our own future rather than handed down from some higher authority."" I enjoy that Kaku waits until the end, after all of the information is unpacked, to lay down his own opinions, which are still of worth. Overall, I enjoyed my reading of Parallel Worlds. At times the subjects get tired and over explained, but they are explained appropriately. I feel Kaku's elegant and simplistic way of showing key concepts really hit home in this book, and makes it an engaging read for not only the science buff, but anyone who is interested in the universe."
175,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27472296-paulina,4,"I enjoyed it very much - some of Kaku's explanations for Newtonian vs quantum theories are just so clear and easy to understand; and his writing is free of arrogance (albeit a bit too flowery for my taste). The first two parts were my favourites - I felt like I was learning so much, which is just such a rewarding feeling. I'm looking forward to reading up more and being able to revisit it with a more critical eye.Quick note: He does mention God a few times, but my impression is that it's never proselytizing or without considering the atheist version. I don't necessarily think all scientists must be atheist, or that science should eradicate religion, so I didn't find it grating at all. To each their own."

177,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2763719-john,3,"This book is great for imparting a general overview of the history of cosmology, as well as for giving readers a general idea as to the current (as of 2004) scientific trends and ideas being hashed out by physicists all over the globe. For that purpose, the book is easy to recommend. If, however, you are looking for solid scientific FACTS that modern cosmology has unearthed, you will likely be disappointed. Since Einstein, most highly-regarded theories in the realm of cosmology have been purely theoretical and totally untestable. Most of them all completely based on mathematical equations, and, although things like black holes, white holes, anti-matter, monopoles, new dimensions, etc. almost certainly do exist, no one has ever actually seen any of them as of yet. Unfortunately, the way that cosmologists come up with many of their theories (string theory being a big example) is backwards from what true science should be: namely, first they come up with the theory, and then they try to go back and make the theory jive with what we know about the universe. Ideas like string theory and M-theory are interesting, but they are simply guesses (however educated) based on assumptions. The biggest assumption being that the universe was created in their idea of ""The Big Bang."" Remove that assumption and the whole field pretty much collapses like a house of cards. String theory is a beautiful idea and I wish it were true, but I suspect that it (along with most of the other far-out theories that Kaku proposes) will be disproved at some point. In the distant future, I think scientists will probably get a good laugh out of books like this, though I admire Kaku for pushing the envelope of scientific thought and doing what needs to be done in getting people to think outside the box regarding the universe we live in. Kaku has a very likable, enthusiastic personality which really comes across in his writing and is probably what has propelled him to be such a media sensation in recent years. The book is a very difficult read at times, especially for someone like me who sucks at math and never took a physics or chemistry class in his entire life. But I found all kinds of things here that I thought were incredibly interesting, such as information on the anthropic principle and quantum mechanics. Two-thirds of the way in, the book gets a bit too fanciful for my taste, as Kaku goes into topics like escaping into other universes and using technology in the future to drive the Earth away from the sun and into orbit around other stars. Yeah, good luck with that.Still, a pretty great read, if you can keep everything in perspective. "
178,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,4,"An awe-inspiring read that tackles what must surely be one of the most exciting - albeit speculative - areas of modern physics. Kaku is the ideal scientist to take us on the journey: clearly well-read, he slips in a medley of references to literature, art, history and philosophy, all of which help to liven up the narrative. To the extent that popular science should educate and inspire, Parallel Worlds is a success. The first few chapters get the reader up to speed with the basics of cosmology and quantum theory. Relativity, the big bang, black holes - it's all touched on capably if briefly. Then we reach supersymmetry and string/M-theory. For the uninitiated this might be harder-going, but it's worth persevering. The following chapters are the most thought-provoking of all, including the section on cutting edge science - gravity wave detectors, dark matter detectors, particle accelerators, etc - which leave you eagerly anticipating the potential discoveries of the next few years. The anthropic principle sets the scene for the remainder of the book, beginning with a humbling account of just how many of the familiar constants of the universe lie within a very narrow band that makes life possible. This is the best summary of the ""goldilocks zone"" that I have read. Also humbling - but in a more depressing way - is the chapter that examines the inevitable long-term fate of our expanding and ever-cooling universe, as the stars disappear, temperatures approach absolute zero and atoms finally come to a halt. More upbeat, Kaku speculates about how a suitably advanced civilisation of the far future might be able to avoid this fate by escaping into a different Universe. Underpinning this is the very serious business of categorising types of civilisation according to their level of technological development - Type I, II or III. (In case you're wondering, we've yet to reach Type I, and our animalistic instincts and carelessness may yet prevent us from getting even that far.) Finally, he tackles the big one - the ultimate question of whether current scientific understanding points to the existence of a Creator. (Kaku believes it does, but of the non-personal 'creative force' of Spinoza and Einstein rather than the anthropomorphic prayer-answering 'God' of religion.) A few quibbles - some spelling mistakes, a lack of in-text numbering to the end-notes, no chapter name at the top of each double-page - but these are minor complaints. Otherwise this is a must-read for anyone interested in our place in the universe (and whatever may lie beyond it)."
179,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"At the end of the day, any GUT is going to be some sort of a mathematical construct. Trying to verbally explain it is always going to be messy. Still, the author does a great job explaining post-relativity cosmic world. That said, one can buy more dimensions and even multiple universes with their own scientific laws/realities but it is more difficult to accept alternative quantum universes than even the most illogical of religious theories (why - there should be googleplex or so new possibilities every tiny fraction of time!). As such, the more one goes through some of these ideas, the more one feels that there has to be something deeper to quantum science meaning that we have not even remotely learnt (does not have to be probabilistic when we really get it!). All that said, a great book.After the second read:Prof Kaku’s Parallel Worlds was likely a far better book when published. Its value has diminished significantly more than a decade hence.The book remains a great place to get a well-articulated, excellent overview of the cosmology. Unlike what one encounters in many other books, the author does not get enamoured with the extraordinary features of relativity, quantum physics, string theories or their inventors. Rather, the focus is steadfastly on narrating the creation (at least in early and the best parts of the book), and particularly on the inflationary phase. The author does a far better than job than almost anyone this reviewer has read in convincing why inflation not only accounts for a lot of galactic structure we see today but also provides a good base to believe in multiverse theories. It introduces relevant parts of all modern physics theories and their inventors only as needed. The structure helps the author hold the reader interest and seamlessly progress towards the more exotic concepts including multiverse and the higher dimensions.That said, the book suddenly loses the excellent plot somewhere in the middle. Discussions partly turn to highly speculative scientific notions like wormhole travel, partly to metaphysical aspects of creation, partly to then-current global projects and partly to where science and societies may move in coming thousands and billion years (and other advanced civilizations). In some, the discussions are dated. In some others, they are too brief. In some others, they are naive. And in some others, they are just fantastical and incredible in the way presented. Yes, one does learn along the way, but not necessarily as intended by the author."
180,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209835-lara-lazenby,5,"Before I rant and rave about how much I love Michio Kaku and this book (written in 2005) I have to admit that I am no Sheldon Cooper. I'm no Penny, either. I am a 45 year old math phobic, Star Wars/Battlestar/Trek/Stargate/Scifi and recently Morgan Freeman's Through the Wormhole lover. I was the girl you used to laugh at because I was too stupid to solve any blackboard math equations.You know, the one who used to cry in the back row and sink in her seat every time the teacher asked to solve for x and y. I can barely remember phone numbers and birthdates, so you can understand why I am completely over the moon for Parallel Worlds.Anyone who knows me will tell you that I love Dark Energy, Dark Matter, and black holes.I Don't know where this passion came from because my science teachers ignored me and one high school math teacher told me I'd never amount to anything. At the time, I believed him. I always felt intimidated by the beautiful smart ones and secretly envied the math geeks who made laser noises with thier ball point pens. But for some strange reason, a journey through creation and the posibility of higher dimensions makes me all tingly inside. The mystery, the enigma of it all just sucks me into the Event Horizon, and I am hooked. And thanks to Michio Kaku, the brain fog is lifted and a whole Universe is unveiled before my eyes. String theory and music, Einstein and Shakespeare, Four fundamental forces and six numbers that govern the Universe (so that's where my favorite guest star on TNG got the name Q)... Kaku weaves the cosmos and universal grid using words and visual imagery I can actually understand. I had read about the Higgs Boson last July, so imagine my thrill last week (March 14, 2013) when they announced the LHC in Geneva had discovered it, that tricky little ""God Particle."" Four days later I was reading page 276! My frinds and family just don't understnd why I scream at the TV and do the happy dance for physics, or stomp in dimay because LISA was dropped along with the shuttle program due to lack of funds. And yet there is still so much to learn about the folding of space-time and warp drive, M-Theory, the theory of everything or the theory of nothing, quantum theory and supersymmetry, the anthropic principle... Yes, I believe God is the ultimate scientist.Yeah, I'm no Sheldon, Howard, Raj, or Leonard, but Michio Kaku makes me feel smart. And maybe, just maybe, one of them might lend me their pen. "
181,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11712114-daniel,5,"This is a sequel or an update of Professor's Kaku seminal 1994's book Hyperspace. The contents of both books intertwine but definitely one needs to read both.I found this book more insightful and easy to grasp but I believe that between the 10 years since these two books were published much has changed in the String theory area. As Professor Kaku says, many of the discoveries of this theory cannot yet be tested or observed but the theory behind the strings is still flourishing which is an adamant slap in the tendentious proponents of the end of science.After Hyperspace and The Einstein Cosmo, I was completely obsessed with relativity so I even tried to understand tensors but lacked the geniality to grasp it even though I have a major in electrical engineering ( and if there were minors in Brazilian universities I would have probably gotten a minor in math ). Personally speaking I was never a big fan of electrical engineering, rather enjoyed the digital world and programming courses but I was very fond of electromagnetism. I was amazed by the conciseness and beauty of Maxwell equations as well as the complexity of vectorial calculus. But we were not taught anything further except very brief notes about quantum mechanics.So after reading this book what became a sheer wonder for me is not cosmology or astrophysics , it is the beauty of the microscopic world described by quantum physics and string theory. If you have wonder as a child where could we go if we had a powerful microscopic and see the beyond the atoms this book will provide the description accurately and without the math.Professor Kaku also addresses astronomy, cosmology and astrophysics in this book and needless to say these are fascinating themes as well. The parallel universes are intrinsically related to all these theories as you will read in this book, they derive from many of the incredible theories that are explained here.Spectacular descriptions of types of societies based on upon their scientific advance lie side by side with philosophical discussions about the anthropomorphic and Copernican theories: Professor Kaku is an elegant and extremely educated proponent of the ""there is no God theory"", something he exposes with a respect that make guys like Dawkins look like crying babies. Well, if not for the book itself, man, the glossary at the end of the book is a beauty itself, a wonderful explanation of all these fascinating themes.Strongly recommended."
182,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879865-mark,2,"As a general explanation of new ideas like string theory and multiverses, etc, it's pretty readable, for the most part. But some of the ideas get so far off the wall as to seem completely impracticable- i.e; intelligent life surviving the end of the universe. Kaku suggests that a Type III Civilization could escape the death of the universe by escaping into another which it somehow creates itself, loading all its biological information onto quantum computers and sending them through the black hole wormhole, or whatever sort of other artificially gravitational ""droplet"" has been created to accommodate it. But one thing. Once all the biological information gets there, how do the bots know exactly how to reassemble it? What do the newly transported decanted beings eat? What do they live on when they get there, seeing as they'll somehow need to evolve and grow stars and planets, of course, first? What about the billions of years it will take them even to get to that? Or is the assumption that, by this time, machine bots will have preserved in themselves some fantastic mechanism of consciousness with which they can rationalize survival and reproduction? Perhaps I am ""too lay"" an astrobiology fan to be the proper person to review this, which I get for the most part, but am on some other levels, mystified by. People get paid to write books and think about this stuff so you would be hard pressed to get them to admit any of it seems illogical, since they like to prove by logic and equations that such and such even could be possible... But just those questions were increasingly nagging me through the final chapters. It might take the sum value of that Type III Civilization just to create that new universe for its mechanized biota ""ark"". Which would be of course fantastically economically ridiculous (even if they ruled this universe) and prohibitively expensive. Perhaps a true ""Type III Civilization"" would be philosophically evolved enough to realize that, everything blooms grows and dies, and there is a beauty and justice in submission to the inescapable reality that this is fine enough."
183,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35648230-sirius,4,"In short I liked it a lot. Four stars! I relearned some physics and learned a lot more. I cannot lead a conversation about how parallel universes may exist but I should be able to follow. I also learned about how the universe came to be and where it is going. I loved that part the best. I did not like the last two chapters so much, about types of civilizations and ""beyond"" this universe. Though with types of civilizations I did remember the aliens from Brave Police and figure they are the level 3 maybe z...maybe a few letters down. I had a small laugh that the thought. I found this funny too. I do not think so true but the general idea is what I like on page 157. I hope that makes since. ""You can always spot the scientist at a strip club, because he is the only one examining the audience."" I also loved chapter 6 as talked about the spin of photons. I heard about it on TV somewhere and had the idea it was how Skywarp could teleport. Teh best part about this book? I THINK IT MIGHT WORK!! Not as I had thought but close! :D I loved that. The first part of chapter 7 helped in some idea I had with religion. Oh! It started on page 196. There was talk about music and how it worked with nature. That all of nature could be broken down into numbers and those numbers made music to play. The Greek Pythagoreans kind of started the idea. It made me think of Jazz. :3 XD On page 221 I had the question of why can gravity escape but not others? Xp ...still not sure but I would guess if I did a reread I would find the answer. Not sure about this one ""222 3/2 paragraph new it Big Bang! :D""I just really like the quote. XD; ""For me, the real meaning in life is that we create our own meaning. It is our destiny to carve out our own future, rather than have it handed down from some higher authority."" - Michio Kaku "
184,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/526331-richard,4,"For a long time, I have been in a bind when it comes to buying books about science or mathematics. My bind is this: I am well versed enough in these subjects to find beginner books rather tedious and often a lot of review rather than exposing new ideas, but I am by no means enough of an expert to pick up a high-end theory or textbook and follow it very easily. This has made a lot of science and math books rather unattainable--I am either going to be bored with it or find it too hard. But Kaku has usually been able to offer good solace, and he does not disappoint with this one. In _Parallel Worlds_, Kaku explores the realms of string theory, quantum universes, time travel, a whole host of experimental physics. Kaku sometimes kowtows to simplifying his subjects to a false degree, but his best analogies explain the wonderful simplicity of an idea as well as its complexities. The issue of dark matter, for example, or what really blew me away was the idea of invisible energy, attraction created between two parallel metal plates not by charge but by an imbalance of virtual particles between the outsides and insides of the metal. Kaku is fine with presenting highly theoretical ideas that have no present means for testing and confirmation, and he is very objective with most about them when it comes to their plausibility and potential faults. Since he has helped develop string theory, he of course has a lot of hope for it, but his overall objectivity and scholarship is enough to trust throughout. Some parts are worth going slowly through, to follow the train of thought that leads to rather anti-intuitive conclusions, but that is the joy of math and science, after all, and this book is well worth that read. "
185,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5352344-annie,4,"Sitting in the afterglow of the last page, I have to say, I really, really enjoyed this book. Kaku is a wonderful writer who somehow manages to bring a large amount incredibly complex science (as well as the entire known/speculated history of the universe) and condenses it into quite a charming little read. Admittedly, it took me a few months to finally work through, but this was no fault of the author or the content. No, if anything I was surprised by how easily accessible the writing and the tone were; it was like having a friendly conversation with someone you know is fifty times as brilliant as you are, but it's never awkward. The author dances between science, religion, and philosophy without making any sort of commitments; he presents multiple sides of an argument, before briefly mentioning upon his personal views and then gracefully bowing out. I appreciate that. The last chapter in particular was quite touching, and I came away from it positively inspired.I have to imagine that, due to the mentions of pop culture and ""current"" science, this book is bound to be seen as dated, even within ten years time. (For example, it mentions that the LHC, Large Hadron Collider, was still being built at the time the book was published. But in 2013 scientists are close to confirming the existence of the Higgs boson particle. So.) Still, I think this is definitely a book worth coming back to, not only for the picture it paints of the past, but for the possible views it gives us for the future. "
186,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15239630-pawel-szupryczynski,5,"HyperphysicsIt's been a while since I've read  Hyperspace, so I felt this book to be a bit similar. Maybe the reason is that to get to the ""string theory level"" you need to go through basic physics - Newton, Einstein, Big Bang etc. so parts had to be repeated for sure. What about the intermediate/advanced bits? Well here it gets complicated :) The M-theory, string theory are difficult stuff. Michio Kaku tries to use some layman comparisons, but I would lie stating that I understood everything from this book. Up to a certain level it's bearable, but I think you really need a Ph.D. in physics to feel comfortable in later subjects.Nevertheless, there is still a lot to grasp here. I loved the parts about Kardashev's civilization levels, parallel universes, black holes and future of universe. The book reminds me the Discovery documentary series with Michio Kaku, where he prepares answers on questions like ""How could we reach a parallel universe?"" or ""How to enter a black hole?"" by creating a real solution to the problem. (impossible to implement today, but maybe in distant future.. :)The only flaw is that the book is already over 10 year old. I'm sure some things could be updated (like the Higgs boson story) and various space mission or projects were delayed or canceled (as usual). Fresh comment from the author would be also beneficial. It's not an easy read, but if you want some extended physics lesson, I highly recommend it :)"
187,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3049435-jeannie-and-louis-rigod,5,"This book took me three months to complete but at my snail's pace, I understood almost every word I read. This for a person without ever having taken a physics course in her life was a testimony to Dr. Michio Kaku's ability as a teacher and Author. This book is extremely readable and it does not talk down to you, instead, it teaches you.This book was a complete (up through 2004) look at the theories revolving the subject of Parallel Worlds. Taking us, the reader, through the Big Bang (creation) through higher dimensions, and on towards the future. Yes, there are formulas, however, we are walked step by step through the formulas so that we recognize how to read them.I learned the viewpoints of 'Flatlanders' to the possible lifestyle in a Multi-Verse world. Einstein and Rosen Bridges, and off to the Super String Theory (which Dr. Kaku had a bit to do with himself.) Being given the gift of learning what the Hubble Space Telescope has seen and it's ramifications was so interesting to me. Learning about the CERN project and even the cancelled super collider projects and how this will affect our future life on planet Earth or other planets was suddenly cleared up. Perhaps we need to learn more about Space projects and become activists for them...The main thing I learned from this book was, do not be afraid of learning a subject outside of your comfort zone. There is a World of learning out there waiting for us. "
188,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25904772-steele-dimmock,3,"All Michio Kaku's books are great. You never waste your time reading one of his books, however, I wanted this one to talk more about Parallel Worlds! Instead all the first half and most of the second half of this book is taken up with the history of physics - planck, einstein, newton, schrodinger. They are all given their own mini bios.When Michio finally got on to dark matter it was only too briefly. He spent not nearly enough pages on M-theory or different universes existing on branes. The 10/11 dimensions concept is fascinating and I felt was largely glazed over. The 5th dimension I get, but why more, how does this translate in to reality. These were the things I was reading the book to find out more about.An unnecessarily large amount of space was given to the concept of the quantum multiverse, where infinite actions take place in infinite worlds. I find this a novel but really tedious notion in physics, and it borders on being just a nihilist thought exercise.The vibrations of the strings in string theory is always interesting. I appreciate there isn't much to work on here and its challenging to make it palatable to a lay audience but I would have appreciated the effort.3 stars - only because I was expecting more membrane/blackhole work in relation to Parallel Worlds. If it was called ""The History of Physics and warped space"" I would have given it 5 stars."
189,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2474863-something,5,"Amazing! I forgot how much I loved reading science books! This book is very understandable, even for someone who does not have a lot of knowledge in physics. I loved the theories and the speculation a quite a lot too. ""Is our Universe in a cd-rom?"", ""Is there a purpose to the Universe?"", are questions that are posed at the end of the book, matters that I love to think about. Understanding the string and the M theory, as well as many others, was also very rewarding! Having a better understanding of the theories involving the possibility of parallel worlds was what attracted me to this book in the first place. I wasn't disappointed by what I learned here, by the contrary, it was all very nicely explained. Too bad I probably can't actually understand the math behind it once I do research, but it would be awesome. The only part I skimmed through without interest was the one relative to technologies more advanced civilizations can use. Not that it was badly explained, but it's just a theme that never appealed to me, sounding too much like science fiction.I'm probably biased when rating this book, given that it's the first book of this genre that I've read in the last years. Also, I'm no physic, so I have no idea in regards to the accuracy of the book. I expect it to be good though.Overall, a great reading and a great insight on how our universe works. "
190,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27184593-lacer,4,"Published in (I think) 2005, some aspects of the book, specifically those describing current and upcoming experimental programs, is a little dated. In the 9 or so years since publication, we have continued to progress at the fantastic rate hinted at within the book. However out of date info on experiments aside, this is a great book, fantastic if you like your scifi, forget stuff dredged up from Gene Rodenberry's head, the real stuff (and the potential for what we could do in the future) is even weirder. The book gives a good grounding in quantum theory then goes onto to discuss more advanced stuff, I'll admit some of it went over my head, I 'read' this as an audiobook and I think it's easier to loose concentration in this format. But I particularly loved (and at the same time was slightly depressed by) the ending, as it discusses how a future advanced civilisation could survive the 'Big Freeze' as the universe dies. I was also fascinated by the philosophical questions raised by the discussion of the anthropic principle. The author's summary though is something that we should all remember, we are here, witnessing a crucial time in human history, our civilisation could progress to the next stage of advancement or we could just as equally destroy ourselves, it's us that will decide what happens."
191,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51845751-krishnan,4,"Wow. It took a long time to finish the book but totally worth it. From WMAP to multiverse from the questions on grand design to string theory and Schroedinger's cat. This book is a must read for every Sci-fi fan. I could connect some dots about type1, 2 and 3 civilization people with the description in hitchhiker guide and foundation. Would love to re-read this book. The only sad part is that the M-theory subject was too dry and there was too much time spent on history of string theory physicists, which is fine but it wasn't interesting enough. However the author has a amazing grip over reader in the first half by kindling and bringing up the questions which form the basis of human inquisitive behavior. Always a fan of quantum physics and theoretical physics, I liked the way the book is split into three parts. Part 1 and part 3 is phenomenal. There is some worshipping of other theoretical physicists but totally justified with the text. Some interesting parlance S of life are shared by quoting Einstein and Weinberg and other scientists take on life. Didn't know that Einstein believed in God. Weinberg statement,""good people do good and bad people do evil. Good people do evil for religion"" is bulls eye for today's world. I love the way the book concluded that each individual has to find their own interpretation of life... Beautiful book"
192,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6134085-maria,5,"This book, by one of the most talented physics professors of our time, Michio Kaku, is a collection of the leading physics theories and an exploration of the universe. The book focuses mainly on the revolutionary developments in cosmology within the last several years. The author based it on new evidence from the world’s laboratories, the outermost reaches of space, and new breakthroughs in theoretical physics. It is divided into three sections. First, Kaku describes the study of the universe and the evolution of cosmology in “The Universe”. Then, the second section, named “The Multiverse” , explores the theory that our universe is one that exists among many (Superstring theory and M-theory). This section also discusses the possibility of wormholes, space and time warps, and higher dimensions. The third and final section, titled “Escape into Hyperspace”, concentrates on the big freeze, the end of the universe, and the idea that humanity may be able to enter another universe or go back in time when the universe was warmer. I would recommend this book to readers interested in physics and cosmology. Even if these subjects are not of interest, this is an enjoyable book which provides captivating theories and allows fascinating thoughts to develop."
193,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17686477-betty,5,"Summary in a nutshell (or rather in a string): Kaku has the gift to put into words some of the most sophisticated theories of physics today. He is the one who came up with the equation that summarizes the field theory of strings. The heart of the electron is a vibrating string, tinier than a proton. If we were to pluck the string, its vibrations would change it into any one of the known subatomic particles. Did you know that the 5th dimension is light? If Einstein had never discovered relativity, his theory might have been discovered as a by-product of string theory, because the lowest vibration is a quantum of gravity. All 11 parallel dimensions are probably encoded in these strings, and might be revealed sometime in our technological future. This book was published in 2005 but most of it still stands today. Perhaps some minor updates for the microwave data from the WMAP satellite (after more recent calculations, 26.8% rather than 23% of the universe is made up of dark matter) and there’s probably more updated information on the LISA antenna and the Large Hadron Collider which are mentioned in the book but were not yet built at the time of publication. Excellent ‘theory of everything’ for everyone!"

I enjoyed it because it's been a while since I read anything on string theory, and it was nice to hear about it from someone who not only believes it holds the answers to the future of physics, but who helped to co-found one of its tenants! One aspect of this book that I found mildly frustrating is that it is a little older (not much, though) and it kept talking about experiments and experimental apparatus that would be ready to go in the future (at this point, most have already begun or happened) and how they would reveal or might possibly reveal various answers. I had to keep looking up to see if the experiments had already happened and if they were conclusive, so it was kind of like a tennis match with the book. But that's obviously not the book's fault! All books have to be written at some time or another. All in all, a very interesting book. I continue to be surprised by how much I enjoy Dr. Kaku's writing. There's really no reason for me to be surprised: I guess I had just grown so used to seeing him on TV that I subconsciously gave him less credit than he obviously deserves. Recommended."

In fact I kind of hated it because I kept failing to understand of what my teacher taught me when I was in high school. This book, which happened to be my first Kaku, changed the way I thought about Physics. Kaku brings us to the core mind of great scientists of all time and it's actually funny yet engaging to realize that science, back then until now, have been nothing but theories. From big bang to the future of cosmos, Kaku has done a great job in making his readers into it. It's not exactly a light reading but I love it. His way of writing just excellent.What I love the most about the book is that he quoted the great Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking about their belief in God - although some of you would think that Hawking is an atheist - oh well. There are surprising facts as well like the idea of 'superatom' and the thought of 'the stars we see now are the lights that may have taken years ago' actually came from the author Edgar Allan Poe. Whattt. Also Picasso's famous eyes of women who look directly to us was inspired by fourth dimension. Great stuff!"
197,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7560968-jonathan-goddard,4,"Amazing! This book is an adventurous journey into the deep cosmos and the possibility of parallel universes. Kaku shows how, by attributing the principles of quantum theory - where 'anything that can happen does happen' - to the universe, parallel universes are not impossible, in fact they are the most likely reality. I keep wanting everyone to read Kaku's books, because they are so informative and exciting. It's good to learn while also being stimulated and entertained, and this book does that brilliantly. If you like this you should also try Physics of the Future and Physics of the Impossible. The reason I didn't give it five stars is because I found the end of the book an anticlimax, where Kaku goes into a discussion of different concepts of God, the issue of Creation and the universe. He places 'most modern scientists' in Dante's first circle of Hell, which is a misunderstanding of Dante as the first circle is Limbo, reserved only for unbaptised infants and those who lived before Christ - thus those who are heathen without having a choice to be otherwise. The rest of this section is just Kaku summing up various people's opinions but it doesn't amount to a valuable debate."

Answers that span not a human lifetime, but an Earth-lifetime. Through know-how of today's (2005, science moves rapidly) knowledge in physics and cosmology, Kaku explains the history of mentioned sciences, the most important theories (relativity, string, etc.), the future of humans-in-space, and other scientifically curiosities - everything in a language that the common man/woman can easily understand (most of it; some you've have to read twice, if not five times and then do a university subject to fully understand everything).The second (middle?) part of the book is a bit heavy, but do not worry.

However, after reading this confounding book by Kaku-one of theories leading PR man- I'm considering believing in God again because it makes A LOT more sense. Einstein believed any theory that couldn't be illustrated so a child could understand it is probably worthless. It's no wonder that he denounced most quantum physics when it came to the search for a unified theory. By the end of this jumble bad-acid trip- sometimes completely contrictary theories- I was conviced that physics has been hi-jacked by group of insistent men who settled on a crazy mess of ideas and then came up with some crazier math to prove that, well it might even be possible- then ask- well, you got anything better?I later skimmed Brian Greene's Elegant Universe, and the illustrations are much more concise.

And if our universe is dying, will we be able to jump ship to another? Kaku runs through the recent history of cosmology, from Newton to Einstein, and introduces his own theories. He writes clearly, and a good glossary helps. But with many digressions and complex concepts, most readers will need some help. A few critics recommended starting with Brian Greene's Fabric of the Cosmos (**** May/June 2004), a snappier, though still difficult, book. Or, just go to superstringtheory.com.

Parallel Worlds tracks recent developments in the realm of cosmology and presents in a wholly engaging and accessible manner.The book is divided into three broad sections: the first summarizing the evolution and development of cosmology, the second presenting emerging theories - including superstring theory and M-theory - and the third being something of an extended thought experiment that begins with a narrative of the ultimate demise of the universe and then goes on to posit how a truly advanced civilation might actually escape such an end. While this last section is, of course, purely speculative, it does provide the reader with a useful insights into the universe as it is currently modeled by the latest cosmological theories.Parallel Worlds provides a fascinating glimpse into life, the universe, and everything.

He blends technical detail with religious debate as he explains how theories have developed, adapted and been debunked. It covers everything from the very small: how sub atomic particles may not be particles at all but strings of energy; to the very large: the Big Bang, the rate of expansion of the universe and whether our universe is only a small outcrop on the edge of a larger one. It does get quite technical in the middle when it gets into explaining how certain theories work in 5, 10, 15 and 22 dimensions; and how those dimensions may be smaller than a subatomic particle. However, the last section of the book becomes as he applies these theories to the very practical issues of how to travel through time, explore new universes and build teleport machines. A great balance which leaves you plenty to ponder as you stare at the stars. "
204,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17131437-peter,3,"The idea of parallel universes began with Everett Young, a graduate student whose thesis in quantum theory argued that the collapse of the Schrodinger probability wave upon measurement was not really a collaps: measuring a quantum state didn't just cause all states other than the one found to disappear. What happens on measurement, Young argued, was that the universe splits. Tou, the observer, are in one universe where the outcome you see exists, and there are other YOUs that see the other outcomes.This wss very mysterious. Where are all these other universes? How could ""reality"" split just because a die came up 6? It was considered quackery. But modern physics has increasingly accepted the idea, and Michio Kaku--a real physicist--tells us how and why.Brian Greene's take on the parallel universe notion is, for me, a much better book. I enjoyed Kaku's take, but it seemed like old soup unwarmed."
205,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22417625-ian-ang,4,"Michio Kaku is my favourite personality to watch on science documentaries, and he certainly isn't a letdown in his written works as well. There is much straight to the point facts here, so much that it isn't easy or productive to read more than a chapter at one go. Because the book is 'simplified', most of the theories are not fundamentally explained or proven(they aren't in real life anyway), and you just have to accept what's thrown at you. This was exactly the kind of book I was looking for - an introductory book to parallel universes - before I ventured deeper into the concepts.HOWEVER, I still do not think this book is an easy read by any means. Without much passion and love for the subject I feel that many will put the book down after several pages. If you just want to know the very very very basics of parallel worlds so you can understand recent sci-fi movies better, just Google short articles on the subject instead."

But mostly because nobody really knows still.Even though it failed me there, it was a great book to review a lot of what I remember being covered in Brian Greene's ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"". I definitely spaced out during some sections either because it was covering stuff that I've read about dozens of times already (history of science through Einstein), or because it was covering stuff I have almost no real/intuitive understanding of (string theory), or because I listened to it as an audiobook during my marathon training runs and was tired or trying to avoid being hit by cars. So to truly appreciate it I'd probably have to read it while sitting still and quiet, but it certainly helped the running time pass and was educational."
207,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3626799-adam-dodd,4,"A beautifully written summary of cosmology up to the beginning of the current millennium and an assessment of the possibilities intelligent life may have for surviving the inevitable death of our own universe. Although published in 2005 and therefore slightly out of date in a few unimportant ways (eg the Large Hadron Collider at CERN was still being built, and he talks excitedly about the possibility of finding the Higgs Boson which was (tentatively) discovered in 2013; he refers to English being the second most widely spoken language on Earth which is no longer true) the substance of the book is relevant and will continue to be so probably for a million years or so. Some of the facts and concepts in the book are truly breathtaking, and despite being largely about theoretical physics, it can't help but stimulate the reader's philosophical gland in considering our place in the universe and in revaluing one's life in the context of just how unlikely an accident that life really is."
208,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2242980-shaz,4,"I would be lying if I said this was an easy read. Introducing concepts such as dark matter, black holes and event horizons among many others, Kaku does a great job of breaking these down into easy terms to understand sans technical jargon. I struggled mostly with M theory and string theory though and the concept of parallel universes. It was also a good introduction for me to physicists such as Einstein, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, etc. as well as their various theories. What I found especially refreshing was the introduction of the Goldilocks theory (or anthropic principle) which suggested that there may be a God or higher power since the position of Earth from the sun, moon and other planets is just right for life to flourish and exist. This book is my first Michio Kaku book and it's great. Definitely worth a read if you're interested in learning more about the cosmos, quantum mechanics etc."
209,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11158261-juan-rivera,5,"Magnificent book if you like physics and cosmology; quite updated information.I learned many things, including:The latest discoveries of string theory and M theory .... And I do not like at all these theories, they seem to me mathematical games made without any basis or proof in real life, so not scientific (as well have millions of possible solutions). They remind me the demonstrations of St. Thomas Aquinas, but with mathematics.Now, regarding the Schrödinger cat I do not like or agree with this paradox. The cat is dead or alive, it is conscious to that, not mattering if a human would not; therefore function collapses anyway.But the most interesting part of the book is the future of the universe, which await only two destinations: death by cooling (because it is constantly growing and cooling) or death by a Big Crunch .... I think the first is the most probable.Speculations of how an intelligent civilization could survive the end of the universe are very enriching."
210,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35447635-vasco,5,"Oh wow. What an excellent and disturbing read.First of all, when reviewing, each person has a purpose. I'm not reviewing this book as a book for someone who has a deep knowledge of physics and wants more specialized knowledge. Nor am I reviewing this as a book for the mainstream for someone who has no idea of the basic physics principles. I'm reviewing this book as for someone that has a basic knowledge of physics, engineering, whatever academic experience is it, but that will give you an underlying understanding of the basic principles, and that wants some specialized knowledge summed up in quick and clear fashion.For that purpose, this is an excellent book. To take your basic understanding of physics and tell you what the main theories are, the pros and cons of each, and to give a perspective of how we might evolve and what we might find next. It's an excellent snapshot.Will re-read many times in the future."
211,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29831403-zack,0,"I liked the book because a lot of the way it describes Michio Kaku's theoretical process through verbal visualization as well as the thought process he used to kind of get an understand of the cosmos in his own way. Another reason I liked the book was that it is just an intricate spider web type perspective on religious beliefs as well as his description of his own religious standpoint which I thought was cool considering that a lot of astrophysicists don't believe in a “Higher power” but instead believe that the cosmos is what always will be, I also liked how he gave credit to scientists that kind of “paved the way” with their work so to speak by allowing him to use their theories and scientific calculations to further his own work on a similar concept on that of the cosmos, and when I say credit them I am of course talking about the beginning of the book where he gets the more simple concepts out of the way."
212,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46101008-aidan,1,"A very pedestrian text. It's unexpected how dull Kaku makes this whole subject. He's very bad at explaining physical phenomena and complex scientific ideas. He just does not have any lucidity whatsoever. He states complex scientific solutions for fact, and never tries to make them make sense or elucidate on the underlying processes. Sometimes he tries to use analogies, but his effort in this regard ultimately comes off as an unskilled imitation of Brian Greene and the latter's facile analogies. Kaku doesn't know how to do it. His attempt becomes mechanical and artificial and is repugnant to read. He fully fails in his endeavor of writing science. Moreover, on occasion, he veers well into the spiritual and religious interpretations of science, which is nearly criminal for the genre he presents himself in.It's a dumb, low-quality book. The explanations are juvenile and don't seem to have been thought through. What a disappointing author. "
213,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74266552-nik,5,As always Michio provides a thought provoking & interesting read. He has a great talent of explaining complicated physics in simpler terms giving just the right amount of depth without bogging you down in the mathematics behind the theories. I really enjoy his method of working through the historical theories & how they evolved into what we know & theorise today.As the name suggests this book walks us through the theories that lead to multiple universes budding & branching off from each other & also the multiverse theory of parallel words spawned by quantum physics. He then moves on to question how intelligent life may be able to survive in the far future as our universe is coming to an end. The last chapter that delves into theology felt a little brief & out of place but I guess that's a whole new debate.Overall it's a great read for anyone with an interest in the wider scope of universes outside of our own.
214,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1670648-lori,4,"Skip Part III and you’ve got a great read here. Part I and II of this book provide an outstanding overview of quantum mechanics, string theory and M theory, and the state of things in particle physics right up to the LHC. Kaku’s writing style is engaging and fun to read and he cites all the heavy hitters and some of the lesser-known players in the physics community. This is a good starting point to discover other publications on the topic of time, string theory, many worlds theory, and quantum mechanics. While he references concepts from science fiction novels throughout the book, it doesn’t become problematic until Part III, which is an exercise in pure speculation. I wish the editor would have suggested that Part III be relocated to some other space and time so it wouldn’t mar this otherwise highly-enjoyable book."
215,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3067948-michael-critz,4,"Kaku tells the story of the universe which includes everything and the kitchen sink. He approaches advanced topics in physics from the perspectives of art, music, and literature. I was shocked to learn that Edgar Allen Poe was an amateur physicist who first proposed some legitimate theories. Overall, it's very interesting, though Parallel Worlds often seems to suffer from it's own form of paradox. It tries sometimes to be too approachable: repeating simple concepts most seventh graders can easily grasp. Other times Kaku deliberately writes with complex technical detail, often with hilarious results.At one point Kaku describes a telescope with an electronic image sensor hilighted by ""4,000,000 picture elements."" To which I thought, ""a 4 Megapixel camera… so what?""It's still a good read, and provides a fresh look at pop physics. "
216,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038582-ajitabh-pandey,3,"This is my second book by Michio Kaku. Like any other book of the similar kind, this book too starts off with the entire history or various physics theories and then reviewing various points which these theories postulate. As usual there is a mix of Christian/Chinese religious thoughts. Unfortunately the author has not mentioned the Indian religious philosophies about the creation of the universe which are much more advanced in terms of multiple universes and to and fro travel between these universes.Nevertheless, in view of the modern research in quantum and cosmological worlds, this book presents an excellent read. This book mentions LHC being built at Switzerland, which now is live and couple of days back there was a news item about LHC found the Higgs Bosons, the God Particle. I would wait and see what further developments take place now since the God particle has been found."
217,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22393167-parker-douglas,4,"Kaku is probably my favorite ""hard"" science writer, and he, Dennett and Dawkins (on science not theology) are my favorites who are living. Kaku presents his ideas such as to make them fun, easy reading. He deals with a lot of ""what if"" scenarios, and more than most modern physicists he follows his flights of fancy. I imagine that, in most cases, unless you know how to build a particle accelerator in your basement, you're not going to get excited by a tome on cosmological constants and the mathematical flatness of the universe. Kaku, however, is just as happy talking about science fiction as he is talking the mathematics of a black hole, and his enthusiasm is contagious. Parallel Worlds is no let-down, and any looking for a fascinating book about modern science that brim with imaginative possibilities should check Kaku's work out. "
218,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27154589-lilly-b-k,3,"My friends are free to keep the ""nerd"" comments coming, but I genuinely enjoy Kaku's writing style, and Parallel Worlds is one of a number of his books that I've read. His use of analogies makes the concepts fairly easy to understand and absorb, although sacrificing their mathematical portions. However, as interesting as the book was, I found that it seemed like a slightly more confusing version of Kaku's earlier work, Hyperspace. Parallel Worlds tackled many of the same ideas, but was structured in a way that seemed choppier and a little more confusing to follow. Although I think Hyperspace might be a longer read, I'd recommend reading that one first, at the very least. Parallel Worlds does hit on some unique concepts that are really interesting, but the overall organization of the book wasn't as easy to get through."
219,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30232795-nour,5,"In this thrilling journey into the mysteries of our cosmos, bestselling author Michio Kaku takes us on a dizzying ride to explore black holes and time machines, multidimensional space and, most tantalizing of all, the possibility that parallel universes may lie alongside our own. Kaku skillfully guides us through the latest innovations in string theory and its most recent iteration, M-theory, which posits that our universe may be just one in an endless multiverse, a singular bubble floating in a sea of infinite bubble universes. If M-theory is proven correct, we may perhaps finally find an answer to the question, ""What happened before the big bang?"" This is an exciting and unforgettable introduction to the cutting-edge theories of physics and cosmology from one of the preeminent voices in the field."
220,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/580941-jason,3,"Parallel Worlds cured me pretty quickly of that burning interest I had in getting up to speed on the multiverse, string theory, and what lies beyond the event horizon that I felt so keenly after I watched Interstellar. The early chapters on relativity, black holes, and quantum theory were pretty engaging, but I started losing my moorings in string theory and by the time Kaku hit his stride theorizing about how humankind might escape our universe in a couple hundred million years, I just wasn't feeling it. Theoretical physics just seems so cabalistic after a certain point. Plus, I couldn't keep my quasars straight. I guess I'll just wonder at the recent images from Pluto and whatever was going on at the end of Kubrick's 2001 and let greater minds hash out the details of space's next frontiers and the future of the universe."
221,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6001984-einar-nielsen,3,"This book starts out, like many popular books on science, talking about very basic science like Newton. It then goes on to talk about Einstein, which is more complicated but still if you took some physics in collage you learned about relativity. I totally get why Kaku does this, he has to assume that the basic reader knows nothing. Thing if you like to read popular science book like I do, you get pretty tiered reading about Newton and Einstein in every book.That being said when the book starts to explore interesting concepts it really gets going and I really enjoyed it. Kaku writes about some really interesting ideas that I would love to explore more. I really can recommend it especially the second half.Although in the version I read said that the antagonist in the matrix were aliens which everyone should know isn't correct!"

By Michio KakuThis book clearly explains theories allusive to many of us who are not physics scientists. Kaku presents the theories chronologically: blackholes, time, multidimential space, and the most intriguing, the possibility that worlds may be occurring right next to our own.“The problem lies not in relativity but in assuming that our common sense represents reality.”Philosophical and scientific. Did God play dice with the universe, as Einstein asked, or are there answers yet to come. “What happened before the beginning? Can time be reversed? Can dimensional gateways take us across the universe?” Kaku takes the reader on a thrilling ride...in just as entertaining a way as many science fiction writers. "
223,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15505156-tom-hill,4,"This is the second book I have read written by Michio Kaku and he does a very good job of taking complex concepts and explaining them in a layman's language. He points out that a lot of what he discusses in this book goes against common sense, but also reminds us that our common sense is developed in our middle earth world. In the land of the very small and the very big you quickly realize you are not in Kansas anymore. Particles that can be in two different places at once, multiple dimensions and universes, and the potential for time travel are all concepts that are discussed in the book. I found only a few spots where Michio wades a little too deep in the knowledge pool and I needed to skim ahead to get back to solid ground. He definitely makes the future look amazing as scientist unlock even more mysteries about this universe we live in."
224,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6974552-kent,5,"This was the second book I read from Kaku. The first was Physics of the Impossible, which I also really enjoyed. This book does a great job of explaining quantum theories and some string theories without being too mathematical. I'm not super great with math, so that helps a lot. He gives much more than just what these theories are, but also what the implications are and what it means for our future. He is very much someone who looks into the future of what sorts of technologies we can create and what it could look like. The big question is- can we get there? I feel we are still among a strong anti-intellectualism and religious fundamentalism that makes progress quite slow at times. But there are still dedicated people to the sciences that make these breakthroughs that are talked about in this book. A lot of it takes a lot of thought to comprehend, but it is fascinating. "
225,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575378-robert,4,"I started reading about string theory around a year ago; this was a big deal for someone avowedly not a ""science person"" I think the best way to get into this frequently mind-bending subject is the shotgun approach. I'd start with the PBS doc THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE, then maybe Brian Greene's FABRIC OF THE COSMOS, and then this book. There's a lot of overlap which is the point since you're guaranteed to not understand everything the first time through (or even the 3rd, 4th, 5th...) Another surprisingly good general science book to add to the above is Bill Bryson's HISTORY OF EVERYTHING for which there's a nice unabridged audiobook available. I may start with Lisa Randall's book WARPED PASSAGES after a little bit of a breather. Any other suggestions on general science tomes?"

I got quite a lot of ideas for not only current writing projects but future ones. Kaku-san does such a good job of bringing together cosmology, quantum physics, theology, morality and ethics, environmental issues, and more. Towards the end it got a bit overwhelming, but I worked through and took diligent notes. I don't know that I agree with Kaku-san's belief that we are living in the most desirable time for humanity, but I do agree that we are on the cusp of achieving something really big - or loosing it all. If you're interested in getting a ""bigger picture"" look at where we are (as of 2005), I highly recommend this read. You won't be disappointed. "

It blew my mind. If you haven't yet heard, we live in a multiverse of infinite universes that exist all around us in hidden dimensions, and are constantly being created and destroyed by mini big bangs. The most entertaining is Kaku's chapter on futurism, where he makes predictions thousands of millennia into the future. He follows the model of categorizing civilizations based on energy use, from Type 0 civilizations that rely on dead plants for energy, to solar civs that harness atomic energy from their sun, to galactic civs that travel by wormholes and are able to capture the energy of entire galaxies. This is wild stuff."

First of all, I recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in the origin of our universe, quantum mechanics and string theory but yet need it all explained to you without it insulting your intelligence. This book takes you on a journey through the minds of the best scientists of our time and helps you to understand how the view of the universe came to be. Not only is our universe amazing on a grand scale, but there's a lot more to it than what we can see. The smaller things are in scale, the more bizarre things seem to be.

Even so, this stuff is very hard to understand, even from such a great interpreter. I'd be happy if I understood even 10% of it.

Very thorough and informative for a reader who has no scientific background. Some of the concepts are a little hard to understand, but they are cleverly put together in a way that after a few minutes of reflection, one can grasp the meaning. I enjoyed this book, though Carl Sagan was by far the greatest science popularizer.

Mr. Kaku did an excellent job of taking a very complex esoteric subject and putting it in to words a layman could understand. Unfortunately, it was still a little too much for this layman. The first half of the book was the best. The history of Newton and the laws of gravity and motion, then on the Einstein and relativity, and then to many other theories. One could follow a progression of thought and research. The last half dealt with multi-dimensional worlds (11 dimensions is the current theory) and multi-universes. That is where I really bogged down. I will read at least one more of his books; but, not for a while."

Michio Kaku moves into astrophysics and cosmology within this book; broadening approaches enormously. With simple explanations of strings, m-theory, and black holes there is also focus on the importance of electromagnetism. This book makes reference to the universe that we are not alone; and the possible travel connection to parallel universes. Michio Kaku makes an appealing presentation in science that connects to the everyday world. There is a list of contacts in the physicist community for other interesting reading."

If you've spent time reading books like ""The Elegant Universe"", ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"", or ""4% Universe"", a LOT of this will serve as a very high-level review. However, even then, Kaku's review of gravity comes with a few interesting and vivid examples, and for that alone it may be worth reading for the cosmologically curious. The final chapters are great fun if you like thinking about possible scenario about the future history of the universe (SCIFI FOLKS, TAKE NOTE!), and those alone make the book worth it."

And more significantly: What various civilizations may be able to do and profit from through time, to better human life and escape the inevitable destruction of the Earth.

He explained not only the realms outside our 4-dimensional world, but also extensively discuss how we might get to ""the other side"".The kind of book that can make you pause and ponder about your very own existence. The one that can make you question your own purpose in this unfathomably vast universe.

Not cool Kaku, why not just let science be science rather than adding on some wild conjecture all for the sake of 'shock value' and or that of being 'so outlandish' that you stand out.

Summarizing the history of cosmology, he highlights the seemingly contradictory ways in which large things, like baseballs, planets and galaxies act to the way very small things like electrons and quarks behave. He then goes on to black holes, time travel and the theoretical possibility that, in the far future, intelligent beings might escape a cold dying universe into another one, perhaps one of their own creation.

I love the way Kaku portrays all of the concepts presented in the book with applications to science fiction novels or potential future technology. it took me a while to read this because I would often stop and think about the theories presented. if you're curious about where we came from and where we are going, definitely read this book! it doesn't have all the answers, but it's full of intriguing scientific theory bordering on philosophy."
244,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18748430-joimson,4,"The premise of the book is that we exist in 11 dimensions which no matter how crazy sounding is empirically, mathematically and most-likely possible thanks to String Theory, a theory of everything (also called M-Theory). String theory explains physics from the smallest sub-atomic particles to the vastness of the known universe and everything in-between that's why they refer to it as a theory of everything. Kaku joins the dots in scientific discoveries and even uses science fiction to help explain the theory which he himself was a part of discovering."

Terrific! He explains almost all the mind-boggling concepts that are known to the astrophysicist fraternity, in a very enthusiastic and lucid manner. If you happen to be someone who likes the subject of cosmology this book will take your interest a notch above! And if you happen to be someone who does not know much on this field, this book will ignite an eternal quest for knowledge about our universe, rather 'Multiverse' ! "

Definitely re-hashes (and sometimes lifts intact) chapters in other books by Kaku. This is understandable but somewhat tiresome if you are familiar with the other works. He can be quite illustrative and willing to imagine beyond what can be easily projected. The speculative aspects of the Future of the Cosmos sets this apart from others writing in the field. "

The subject discusses present day investigations and many previous discoveries that prove to be quite enlightening. Kaku's simplicity of writing is easily understood and invaluable when discussing such serious fields of science. The stories of important forerunners such as Einstein and Schrodinger are so involving as the reader follows their every move to discover the secret and the possibilities that reside in our amazing universe.

If someone was to run a language concordancer on the book, I wouldn't be surprised if the same group of words crop up over and over again...Nevertheless, there was plenty of content that I bookmarked for further reading - a decent guide to the multiverse theory.

I probably will re-read the book in a year or so to really hammer in some of the points. The only thing that annoyed me was the phrasing of the ""greatest discovery/theory of all times"", which should say ""... In our time"" as that definitely will change over time.

There's so much to think about and understand at times in certain chapters that I just couldn't get up to getting to read about it for weeks.

He first captured my attention to the field of astronomy in several Youtube videos that I watched of him and now my attention to this field has been further enhanced because of this book.On the cons side, I felt like sometimes he stumbles in the explanation in some of the concepts which resulted in me getting lost a lot. Hence the four star rating. "

Certainly no fault of the author, but I don't have near the background to grasp many of these concepts at a high level.With that being said, I found it very fascinating.

For example, since the publication of that book, both the gravity waves, and the Higgs Bozon were found.

That feeling of nothingness and meaninglessness is somehow the most beautiful purgatory feeling in the whole world. Don't read the book to look for any answers from the outside world.
