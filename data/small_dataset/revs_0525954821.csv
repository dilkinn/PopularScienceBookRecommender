Manny has asked us to review Sean Carroll's new book. I trust you've all read it?LUCRETIUS: Say, how come we're writing this for him? What's going on, Plato?PLATO: I owe Manny a little favor. Fellow-seekers after wisdom, we have eternity ahead of us. This won't take more than an aeon or two. Who's first?LUCRETIUS: Okay, I didn't like it much.PLATO: Would you care to elaborate, dear Lucretius?LUCRETIUS: Well, it's a cheap rip-off of De Rerum Natura.HUME: Modest as ever, I see.LUCRETIUS: Look, he's just updating my formula! Fear not the Gods, fear not death, there is nothing but atoms and void--LAPLACE: Quantum fields.LUCRETIUS: Whatever. He's done a good job on the philosophy, I grant you that. But come on guys, he calls it ""poetic naturalism"" and where's the poetry in his book? LAPLACE: Where's the naturalism in yours?HUME: Touch√©!LUCRETIUS: Now Pierre-Simon, you know that's not fair. I was writing in the first century B.C.LAPLACE: Well, you could have read Aristarchus. Or at least Hipparchus. Sean's naturalism is state of the art. [General murmurs of approval]PLATO: With all due respect, brother Lucretius, I think Pierre-Simon makes a fair point. If one wishes to defend naturalism, an understanding of nature is required. It is evident that Sean understands these -- ah -- quantum fields very well. And he has a gift for explaining them.LUCRETIUS: But the hexameters--PLATO: Sean maybe lacks a feeling for the poetics of words. But he sees the poetics of geometry.LAPLACE: I enjoyed his geometric demonstration that there can be no occult forces.PLATO: Yes, his use of the -- what was it called? --LAPLACE: Feynman diagram.PLATO: That was it. By turning the Feynman diagram through a right-angle, we see that all forces must already have revealed themselves. Very elegant. I must remember to show it to Eudoxus. Now, who else has comments?THE REV BAYES: It is unworthy of me to say this, but I was touched that he believed more in my little rule than in God.LAPLACE: You did well there, Tom.THE REV BAYES: Perhaps too well. I fear people like Sean may be disappointed when they find out that--ALL: Shhh!THE REV BAYES: I'm sorry, I forgot we were still live. Charles, you look like you want to say something?DARWIN: Well, I was also flattered that he took me so seriously. But remember, I always left open the question of how life originated. That ""warm little pond""--HUME: It's true, I did feel at times that Sean's protestations of rigorous scepticism were not entirely justified. I liked the kind things he said about me too. Though when he told us he was certain that science would soon understand the emergence of life, it almost sounded like--THE REV BAYES: Faith? There's nothing wrong with that, you know.HUME: Yes, but he says science isn't faith. I'd have felt reassured if he'd quoted Iris Fry's book. There's a woman after my own heart. But she's not even mentioned.WEYL: And the same story with the universe's low initial entropy. I wasn't afraid to compare it to a miracle in my book. But despite the fact that Sean constantly refers to the Past Condition, there's hardly a word about why the world might have started in this extraordinary state.PLATO: Gentlemen, gentlemen, please! Remember, it's easy for us to nitpick. Sean's just mortal. DARWIN: True. Well, he's better than Richard Dawkins. VOLTAIRE: And Christopher Hitchens.WEYL: And Victor Stenger.THE REV BAYES: Not to mention A.C. Grayling.[Elaborate facepalm from VOLTAIRE]PLATO: So, all in all, we don't think he's so bad.LUCRETIUS: No, no, his heart's in the right place. As Pierre-Simon said, he does a good job of explaining the atoms and void.LAPLACE: Quantum fields.LUCRETIUS: Whatever. I still can't forgive him for taking out my hexameters. But maybe that's just me. PLATO: Thank you Lucretius. Then, I hope that--HUME: Wait! If Sean's correct about the finality of death, then what are we all doing here?[A moment of general consternation]WITTGENSTEIN: Relax, everyone. We're only a figure of speech.PLATO: Ludwig, I don't know what we'd do without you. So, we're giving him a pass? All those in favor--EVERYONE EXCEPT HUME: Aye. Aye. AyeHUME: With the caveats already mentioned.PLATO: Duly noted, David. Now thank you again, gentlemen, you've all been very kind. The first round of ambrosia is on me."
1,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a wonderful book about the meaning of our universe, and of life. Sean Carroll is an active theoretical physicist, and he brings some fresh new ideas to philosophy. He coins a new term, Poetic Naturalism. It stems from a quote by Muriel Rukeyser, The universe is made of stories, not atoms. While naturalism is the idea that only natural laws and forces (not supernatural or spiritual) operate in the world, poetic naturalism says that the way we find meaning to life does not naturally emerge from a purely scientific approach. Poetic naturalism encourages extending discussions into what is right and wrong. It integrates scientific reasoning methods into our purpose-seeking and meaning-making, with emphasis on Bayesian techniques.In 2003, a Dutch pediatric nurse was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of four children under her care. The case became a media sensation because, as it turned out, the case rested on the misuse of statistical reasoning. Infant mortality had actually been higher before she started working at the facility. The real cause of her conviction was psychological: People believe that infant deaths could not be random; someone must be to blame. Leibniz coined the Principle of Sufficient Reason: ""For any true fact, there is a reason why it is so, and why something else is not so instead.""But this Principle of Sufficient Reason is not necessarily true. A cancer survivor sells empathy cards that read, ""Please let me be the first to punch the next person who tells you that everything happens for a reason."" And, by the way, I fully support the thought behind these cards!Some things have reasons, while others do not. For example, the question, ""Why is there an accordion in my bathtub"" has a reason. But, ""Why is a proton almost 2000 times more massive than an electron might not have a reason or an answer.I rarely hear the true description of the big bang, but Sean Carroll writes that the big bang was a moment in time, not a location in space. It was not an explosion of matter into an empty void. It was the beginning of the entire universe, with matter smoothly distributed throughout space, all at once. The big bang really marks the end of our theoretical understanding. We understand what happened after it, but it is a label for a moment in time that we don't currently understand.On Earth, there is an up and down. In space, all directions are equal. In the everyday world, time has a definite direction. But really, both directions in time are equal. It is just that we live in the aftermath of the big bang. Physical motions are reversible. Of course eggs break and never unbreak. The real question is why eggs were unbroken in the past. There is an interesting chapter on why we remember the past and not the future (very relevant to the recent movie, ""Arrival""), that is why the arrow of time points toward the future. It is because of the increase in entropy since the big bang, and the second law of thermodynamics. There is a difference between reversible laws of physics and the concept of cause and effect. Laws of physics predict what will happen. They do not, however, dictate a cause as responsible for later events. Events are simply arranged in a certain order. No particular event is a cause.Sean Carroll writes that it is okay to doubt everything. He writes about ""planets of belief"", which is a wonderful metaphor. Science does not presume naturalism. Science concludes that naturalism is the the best available picture of the world.Sean Carroll wrote that no scientist working on the origin of life points to a particular process and says, ""Here we need some supernatural intervention."" And, some people say that evolution occurs too slowly for an experiment to observe. However, David Bartel and Jack Szostak performed an interesting experiment in 1993. They started with a random RNA molecule consisting of trillions of molecules in a random sequence of nucleotides. They picked out a fraction of them hat held higher rates of catalysis, and made copies of them. Random mutations occurred during copying. After ten iterations, the last pool of molecules was 3 million times better at catalyzing reactions than the original sample.The key to life is the set of instructions for chemical reactions that gets copied. Mutations in the instructions allows life to evolve with natural selection. In an experiment in 1988, Richard Lenski grew E. coli bacteria in flasks, along with specific nutrients. Every day he managed six generations of the bacteria. Over time, over thousands of generations, the bacteria evolved to better use the nutrients in the flasks. Michael Behe, a critic of natural selection, is an advocate of intelligent design. He introduced the concept of ""irreducible complexity"". And he used the example of a mousetrap. Every part of a mousetrap is essential; if any part is missing, it cannot work. However, Carroll points out that actual mousetraps were not designed overnight, but their design evolved over many years.A very interesting part of the book discusses the so-called ""Fine-Tuning"" argument for theism. The argument states that since many of the fundamental physical constants seem to be finely tuned for the development for galaxies, stars, planets, and chemistry that can support life, there must be a creator who ""designed"" these constants for this purpose. Sean Carroll admits that fine-tuning is the best argument for God's existence. However, it is still not a very good argument. It uses what Carroll calls ""old evidence."" It uses evidence that life exists, that we know already is true. The argument is not predictive.Carroll uses Bayesian reasoning to sort out how much credence one should give to naturalism versus theism, given that life requires the chemical reactions we observe in nature to occur. His argument against theism is that many aspects of nature are unnecessary for life. Two heavier families of elementary particles are not needed for life. All the billions of galaxies are unnecessary. Theism predicts that they should not exist.Carroll has an interesting approach to understanding whether we have free will. He describes how the so-called paradox of free will is really just an incompatibility between the languages of quantum mechanics (atoms and physical laws) and the human-scale world. When Carroll sums up his discussions, he writes that the majority of philosophers and scientists are naturalists today. But in the public sphere, religion and spirituality are most prominent. Our values need to catch up with science.I enjoyed this book so much! It is beautifully written, and well thought-out. Sean Carroll has a lot of new, interesting philosophical and scientific arguments, and makes many analogies and metaphors that help to explain his reasoning. He boils down a lot of the uncritical thinking of the past to the incorrect application of Bayesian reasoning, or no application at all. To my knowledge, this is a new idea; the application of Bayesian reasoning to philosophy should be very prominent in the future."
2,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle,4,"I received this on a read to review basis from NetGalley. Thank you to the author, Sean Carroll, and the publisher, Dutton, for the opportunity. A brief overview of this fascinating non-fiction can be written no more aptly than in the synopsis itself - ""In short chapters filled with intriguing historical anecdotes, personal asides, and rigorous exposition, readers learn the difference between how the world works at the quantum level, the cosmic level, and the human level--and then how each connects to the other.""The extensive research and knowledge put into this book is unparalleled to anything I have read before. This could very easily have become a dense and 'stodgy' feeling read, but the light, conversational tone led this to become, instead, a fascinating and understandable insight into the physics underlying the universe, the world and ourselves. The subject matter is dense and complex but it is approached using comprehensible anecdotes, simple analogies and a breaking down of the scientific laws to a layman's level. I found this was also a wonderful subjective and psychological insight into how human beings assign ourselves an importance, despite the briefness in the longevity of our existence, and attempt to bring order and understanding to the chaotic and incomprehensible laws of the universe."
3,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"After having a countdown for this book, which spanned months, I woke up at 5 am on May 10th and thought, ""It's finally here!"" I opened my Audible library and it was better than Christmas. In the quiet of the morning, I began to listen to this deeply philosophical book and immediately fell in love with it. It felt like a Poetic Naturalist's version of Christmas- material gifts replaced by the gift of trying to understand the nature of our vast universe and the world in which we live. Those who have wanted to read Sean Carroll but didn't want to wade through the science will be happy with this book. In the spirit of Alexander von Humboldt, Carroll tucks much of the complex science away in an appendix for those who would like more detail. But, that doesn't mean this book is light on the science. To the contrary, Carroll, as usual, takes some of the most complex issues science has to offer, and packages them in a form that even people with little or no scientific background can understand. In fact, this book in particular is aimed at those who might have little education in the sciences and and even less education about heuristics. It welcomes everyone to join in a thoughtful conversation about understanding what we know about our world and the wider universe. Does it have a purpose? Does its design imply any type of creator? Instead of insulting those who say that it does (I am guilty of this myself), Carroll provided a real way to put our beliefs to the test. He was very willing to consider the views of those who believe in God and provide a detailed method, which is both kind and built on logic, that can help us figure out whether a belief is true. If the preceding paragraph suggests to you that those with extensive education in the sciences (including cognitive science) will be bored or find nothing new, then I have represented the book poorly. Even people whose undergrad and grad career consisted of many of the following courses will find new ways of thinking about that information and connecting it to the Big Picture. Samples of related course material:Intro to Cognitive Science (including Kahneman's heuristics)Cognitive Neuroscience Biochem (including chemiosmosis)Evolution (including environmental modification of genes)Origin of life research (including Martin, Russell, and Lane's work on bioenergetics and others working on RNA world)Philosophy of Mind Carroll opened the door for *everyone* to think about and discuss what evidence we would need for any belief to be validated. Instead of dismissing ideas of belief outright, Carroll employs a very gentle, yet fiercely logical style of problem solving. The result was powerful and reminded me of the deep humility and unfailing logic with which Darwin wrote his many books, including his autobiography. Prior to this book, if anyone had asked me if I wanted to read yet another book on creationism vs. science or the hard problem of consciousness (involving Chalmers unrealistic and pseudoscientific zombies), the answer would have been a resounding, ""NO!"" I feel as if too much of my thinking time has been wasted by these concepts that serve only to anchor our progress. I want to push past all of that. I want to never again allow that type of scientific sabotage to ruin the progress I might make in understanding the universe in a real and more complete way than my current view allows. Often reading about the efforts of those who wage war on evidence based knowledge leaves me frustrated, often wishing I could get that time back. That was not the case with this book. The whole time, even though I was reading things I thought I was tired of reading, my neurons were flooding my brain with wonderful dopamine bursts. Reflexive ""Wows"" kept reverberating from my brain. The book fits into the category ""MINDGASM!""In a book, which includes such topics as:how we know what we knowthe forces that govern the universe properties of elements in relation to other elementsquantum mechanicsemergence and complexityhow we gather and evaluate scientific evidenceCarroll, in his usual relatable fashion, seamlessly included discussions about today's relevant issues in society such as transgender rights, marriage equality. I recall reading E.O. Wilson's book Social Conquest Of Earth and feeling somewhat confused about the organization of the book. He kept social issues separate throughout the book and then bombarded the reader with a litany of important social issues. I love both Wilson and his book, but the social issues didn't fit and felt as if they should be in another book. Carroll's humorous (yet serious) approach when discussing such issues makes me feel as if I am reading a 20 something university student with his finger on the pulse of the upcoming generations, while at other times, when he is discussing concepts that take a long time to learn, I feel as if I am reading a book written by a scientifically minded Zarathustra. In a crazy way, this writing style really works. Parts One, Two, and Three (the first half of the book) were basically an excellent summary of and entire 4 year experience as a major in Cognitive Science. After introducing such concepts as understanding cause and effect, understanding how things move and how momentum is conserved, and understanding how we come to adopt our belief systems, Carroll examined the many heuristics we employ when trying to understand how we know what we know. To figure this out, he introduced a sort of ""best of"" collection of thinkers. Marrying Cog Sci 101 (with a strong emphasis on Baysian reasoning) with Epistemology and Philosophy 101, he tried to understand what thinkers such as Descartes and Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, and Kahneman thought about the nature of reality. The main questions scholars have been asking are, ""How can I know what I know? How can I know what exists? How can I know if my beliefs reflect reality?"" A take home point from Section Two is that people are all entitled to have their own prior beliefs. However, they are not entitled to have their own likelihood. There is an objective likelihood to be discovered, and it takes solid reasoning, and not tightly held belief, to make that discovery. **** see note at end. While discussing heuristics, Carroll gave a shout out to one of my favorite books -- Mistakes Were Made, but Not by Me. I love that book and am often disappointed that not too many people I have talked to seem to appreciate it in the way I do. I love that it got the recognition it deserved. Many books like it are sort of self-help oriented and veer too far from the science. Many authors fail to question if they are using the very heuristics they are writing about. Still others fail to question the methods to the studies they choose to include, brining down the overall quality of the book. But, Tavris and Aronson did much better than most avoiding these pitfalls. They deserved some recognition, not from the self-help crowd, but rather from a scientists who is celebrated for his keen logic. In Part 4, Carroll related a humorous story about ending up on a plane, seated next to origin of life researcher Mike Russel. That was a great lead in to explaining Darwinian evolution, cellular formation, emergence, complexity (his complexity research sounds great! I am definitely going to read everything I can get my hand on concerning that), and ATP synthase (my very favorite protein channel!). If you are a bit fuzzy about what Free Energy is, this section will clear that up and relate it to exactly how your very own body works. (What a delicious section. I was too excited to see what came next. So I did not stop to listen again or take notes on this section. As soon as I am done writing this review, I am going to listen to this entire section again.) Theodosius Dobzhansky said, ‚ÄúNothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution‚Äù. Thanks to scientists such as Sean Carroll, Mike Russell, Jeremy England, and others bridging the gap between living and non living systems, it will soon be said that Nothing in Biology or the larger universe Makes Sense Except in the Light of Thermodynamics. If you want the best possible summary of how thermodynamics fits into the story of living systems (including how those systems likely came into being and how they evolved), then you will love this section. In Part Five, Carroll took on the philosophy of mind debate. You may have taken courses or read extensively about The Chinese Room, Mary, What it's Like to Be a Bat, Eliminative Materialism, and The Hard Problem. Even if you are extremely familiar with all of this, I would recommend reading Carroll's summary. Wow! I was engaged in a way that surprised me. He breathed new life into these debates. I was a tiny bit sad that he left out Andy Clark's work (especially in relation to Chalmers), but considering this book was more than 17 hours long (Audible), I understand that he didn't have time for everything. It's just that Clark's work (along with the Churchland's work) is what made Philosophy of Mind so great for me. Carroll ended the book with what I can only say was a beautiful essay I didn't know I needed to read. If you are unfamiliar with the Is vs Ought problem, you can find out in this section what it is and why should you care. If you are well familiar with this question, you will enjoy the discussion provided on Carroll about morality. Deeply satisfying! A+! He ended on a more personal note than any thing I have read by him to date. It was truly a lovely book, from start to finish. I think Carroll will be remembered along side of Copernicus and Darwin for providing us with gentle but clear evidence that we are not special. Far from being a depressing nihilistic view of the world and universe, Carroll showed his reader (even if you read with your ears) how reality is actually more special than any false belief about being special. Understanding can be the deepest religion of all (idk if Carroll would put it quite like that, but it's my takeaway message). ****I was going to include in this review a bit about Sean Carroll's ""planet v black hole belief system,"" but I posted about it on Facebook and butchered what was an excellent analogy. I can only say that you need to read it for yourself. If you get the analogy, you will forever ask yourself, ""Am I being a black hole right now? ""Am I following the evidence or am I fooling myself and holding tight to heuristically driven fallacies?"" I can see a new viral way of thinking springing from this analogy -- e.g. insults or memes that include the statement, ""Stop being such a black hole!"" "
4,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Most popular science books either focus in on a specific bit of science, or explore the work of a particular scientist. However, every now and then, authors get the urge to go large - to take on life, the universe and everything. It‚Äôs what you might call the science writer‚Äôs midlife crisis - and this title typifies the genre.Of itself, this isn‚Äôt a bad idea, though it can be a struggle to decide how to organise such a vast subject matter, and the ‚Äòbig book‚Äô syndrome frequently rears its ugly head. Because this is a big topic, either the publisher or the author often feels it has to be a big book. This translates into a painfully long book, something this certainly is, at over 400 pages. The result is page after page of waffle, which in a subject that naturally inclines the author to philosophy can be more than a little deadening. So, for instance, although Sean Carroll does actually put quite a lot into his opening section, it can feel like he‚Äôs spent 80 pages saying ‚Äòthings do or don‚Äôt have a cause, depending on what they are and what you call a cause.‚Äô And there‚Äôs only so much you can take of that kind of thing.At the book's heart is the concept of poetic naturalism, which Carroll presents as the best scientific approach to universal topics. This amounts to having a clear naturalist approach (nothing is supernatural, everything can in principle be explained by reductionist means), but building on it the storytelling aspect of our understanding that takes us beyond the fundamentals like quantum theory to add on emergent aspects reflecting the world as we understand and experience it. The poetic naturalist knows that it's all particles and fields underneath, but accepts that we need the higher level stories to relate to the universe. Carroll covers this at great length in his six sections: Cosmos, Understanding, Essence, Complexity, Thinking and Caring.At page 159 we finally get away from philosophical hand waving, but given that, so far, Carroll has been hammering out each point at great length it's unfortunate that when he is on more familiar ground, he leaps into assumptions about what his readers understand. So we are told, for instance, that an electron in a hydrogen atom only gives off 'certain discrete wavelengths'. It's a shame that, while philosophical jargon was given pages of explanation, a word like 'discrete' which isn't commonly used the way physicists employ it, isn't given a brief explanation. When get onto the serious science bit, after acres of pages telling us about the difficulty of being certain of everything, it‚Äôs a wave of the magic wand and physics has all the answers (admittedly to a small subset of questions). It‚Äôs not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with the physics presented here, but the way it is described there seems a danger of falling into the trap Carroll himself identifies of declaring that nothing much new will emerge as we pretty well know it all. And after all the philosophical justifications and exploration, it feels unsatisfactory to be presented with the physics on a ‚Äòthis is how it is, and you have to believe it because I say so‚Äô basis. This comes across particularly strongly in the description of crossing symmetry. The lack of explanation and justification here is disappointingly different from Carroll‚Äôs lucidly explanatory From Eternity to Here.The good news is that in the next section (Complexity) things finally get both interesting and better explained. As we move into biology, Carroll continues to keep the writing interesting and delivers significantly more than he has to date. Unfortunately, this doesn't last and we head back to the philosophising and logic-chopping as Carroll makes one of several attempts to provide a logical consideration of the existence or non-existence of God, saying that the fine tuning of the universe is probably the best argument for theism, but it proves to be a weak one. There's something dated about attempts to make logical and/or Bayesian arguments for or against a deity and it just doesn't do a lot for the reader. This is followed by a long, occasionally interesting, philosophical discussion of the nature of consciousness.Towards the end of the book, interest is re-kindled with some thoughtful material on ethics and we finish with an absolutely lovely chapter, where Carroll relates his move from his early Christian beliefs to a naturalist viewpoint. This is the best writing in the whole book - simple yet personal, and far more effective as a flag carrier for atheism than any of Dawkins' raging.Overall it's an odd book and one that has way too much philosophising and meandering for me to have enjoyed it. Interesting nonetheless."
5,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Physicist Sean Carroll goes well beyond the ordinary bounds of his discipline in this wide ranging exposition. He begins with ontology, the fundamental nature of everything, and ends with how humans can derive meaning living in a world that is not transcendent. Along the way we get explanations of quantum field theory, quantum mechanics, entropy, Bayes Theorem, abiogenesis, evolution and consciousness. Much of the material does not represent new thinking, but one discussion stood out to me.In his excellent book, From Eternity to Here, Carroll explored the relationship between entropy and time in detail. Carroll shares his expertise in entropy in this volume. How does one explain the emergence of complex structures (planets, people, etc.) in a universe going from low to high entropy? He points out that these are vehicles for creating high entropy. They convert free (useful) energy to disordered (waste) energy. Whether through photosynthesis, fermentation or cellular respiration, living organisms are converting free energy from the sun to disordered energy in the ATP to ADP cycle they use for internal energy. As one of Carroll‚Äôs associates put it, ‚ÄúThe purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon.‚Äù This idea of life as a process tied to the universe‚Äôs direction and fate through entropy was new to me. As Nobel Prize winner Albert Szent-Gyorgyi put it, ‚Äúlife is nothing but an electron looking for a place to rest‚Äù. Life becomes a solution to the problem of liberating free energy, something the universe is hell-bent to do. Needless to say there are other ways to look at life.Carroll proposes what he calls poetic naturalism, a scientific view of the world that is open to describing it on many levels at the same time. Thus we have the physicist‚Äôs view of particles, forces and fields, but equally valid are operational views of emergent states. Human beings and human behavior are emergent states from the underlying physics. Biology and psychology provide objective views of emergent states while morality and esthetics provide subjective views. The fundamental reality of physics is not the reality we experience. Our conscious decision making and human relationships are best evaluated in their own terms. Every theory has its own domain of applicability. Thus mixing, for example, psychology and quantum mechanics in the same description is likely to lead to gobbledygook. Throughout Carroll defends his views from the common attacks of religionists, creationists and others with supernatural beliefs. Unfortunately, these people are unlikely to read his book or be convinced by his arguments. For those of us that accept science and nature as it is, this is space Carroll could have used for something more productive. For example, Carroll points to the conservation of momentum to explain that the universe does not need a mover. It operates on its own. I doubt this science based logic will change any minds. Carroll covers a lot of ground presenting his poetic naturalist vision. He takes us from his home ground of physics to biology and even morality. I found little to disagree with but also little new with some notable exceptions such as the relationship between entropy and life. I am struck by the need of some brilliant people like Carroll (Richard Dawkins also comes to mind) to defend so hard against inane beliefs. It seems like a hopeless task, but it is understandable given the relentless attacks on science in America today. Carroll also clearly felt the need to show that one could have values, embrace morality and live a meaningful life without belief in the supernatural. I applaud him in that effort."

7,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4947834-dave-ciskowski,2,"A disappointing book; despite its potential, I can‚Äôt recommend it. Carroll‚Äôs tenet ‚Äî the idea he calls ‚Äúpoetic naturalism‚Äù ‚Äî is appealing to me and would be worthy of a good exploration. Unfortunately, Carroll spends most of his time exploring the ‚Äúnaturalism‚Äù side of his philosophy, which amounts to knocking over cardboard opponents. The early phases of the book (where Carroll is on his most certain scientific ground) read as an interesting tour of the current state of cosmology and the Standard Model, and why they leave no room for non-physical influences. It‚Äôs no accident that the firmest parts of his argument are where he‚Äôs essentially focused on the ‚Äònaturalism‚Äô side of ‚Äòpoetic naturalism‚Äô. I was intensely interested in the later sections, where Carroll tackles more complex phenomena such as consciousness, intelligence, free will, and ethics. Sadly, these chapters are far less illuminating, as he basically spends them in tiresome arguments against dualism ‚Äî neither philosophically interesting nor rhetorically convincing.One example, just because it‚Äôs near to my heart. Carroll spends most of a chapter attacking John Searle‚Äôs Chinese Room argument. The issue isn‚Äôt necessarily the argument itself ‚Äî though Carroll treads no new ground there. The problem is that he spends his time criticizing a view that Searle did not hold (property dualism) and in so doing, attacks the Chinese Room in its weakest and least interesting form. Whether or not Searle is right, the interesting question that he raises ‚Äî whether a computer program of sufficient complexity would be necessarily conscious ‚Äî is left unaddressed by Carroll. It‚Äôs exactly these questions that ‚Äúpoetic naturalism‚Äù could have had the most interesting insights to offer; instead, Carroll knocks over yet another straw man on his march to conclude his exercise.The later sections, dealing with how we can develop ethics and meaning from a purely physical world, are well-written as articulations of his personal ethos, and I appreciated his enthusiasm. Yet I did not find any fresh insight or new perspective here either. Perhaps another reader, struggling with these questions, would take inspiration from them ‚Äî they truly are movingly written. But I wasn‚Äôt that reader.These are difficult questions and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt fault Carroll for not having answers for them. But he doesn‚Äôt even fully engage with the questions. A book-length argument for naturalism doesn‚Äôt say anything useful: those who agree with him won‚Äôt find much new to consider, and those who disagree won‚Äôt abandon their faith. If he had more to say for the poetic side of his account ‚Äî how multiple levels of theory and examination are necessary for explaining the world we inhabit ‚Äî I‚Äôd be much happier with the book. I‚Äôd love to have a beer with Carroll and get his thoughts on these more interesting questions; my guess is that he feels on less firm ground here and didn‚Äôt want to risk a more ambitious discussion. The reader, though, suffers as a result."
8,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,2,"Poetic Naturalism: Not a Good Way of TalkingThe ‚ÄúBig Picture‚Äù is an attempt by a physicist to explain our universe, up to and including culture. It begins with naturalism, the concept that there is a single, objective reality that follows a set of laws. We can discover those laws by observing that reality using scientific method. The author extends that (or dilutes it) to something he calls ‚ÄúPoetic Naturalism‚Äù. This means, in his words:1) There are many ways of talking about the world. 2) All good ways must be consistent with each other and with the world.3) Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.As I explore this book, I will try to explain why it is not is a very good way of talking about science. I also question what it has to do with poetry.Emergence: More Than a Just Another Way of TalkingHow can all the complexity that makes up life arise from only a few fundamental particles or forces? This requires the concept of emergence, meaning that complex systems have properties not found in their underlying components. In my opinion this is one of the most fundamental ideas in science, which is often ignored or only mentioned in passing. At least this book considers it in some detail.The example of emergence he uses is air. At the microscopic level it is composed of individual molecules. But we can think of it as a fluid, with properties such as temperature that emerge from the underlying chaos of molecules flying around. But this example does not really support his conception that levels of emergence are completely separate. He tells us,‚ÄúWithin their respective domains of applicability, each theory is autonomous. Organisms can be alive, even if their constituent atoms are not. Animals can be conscious even if their cells are not.‚ÄùThe vital concept missing here is a bridging theory that links the different levels of emergence. In the air example the bridge is clear: the temperature of the fluid is the average speed of the individual molecules. There are bridges from quantum mechanics to chemistry to biology to neurology. On the other hand, the bridge to being alive or conscious is not so clear. This is the mystery I would love someone who knows that they are talking about to explore. I am still waiting. It seems this author would rather indulge in vague language than build bridges.‚ÄúSo the fluid and molecular description are two different ways of talking about air.‚ÄùWhile trivially true, it obscures the reason why the descriptions need to be different. The real problem begins with the following idea that is repeated throughout the book:‚ÄúThere is only the quantum wave function. Everything else is a convenient way of talking.‚ÄùI take this to mean that any science about emergent properties, meaning anything other than physics, is second rate, just a different way of talking about what the fundamental quantum wave functions do. It is curious that the term reductionism is mentioned by name only once in this book, where he appears to dismiss it out of hand. Yet how else can one interpret the following?‚ÄúUnderstanding what quantum fields and particles are and how they interact with each one another is a crucial part of comprehending what it means to be human.‚ÄùThis flatly contradicts what he has just told us about the meaning of emergent properties. We do not need to know anything about fields or atoms to understand humans. Unfortunately, such contradictions are characteristic of this book.The Universe and Beyond‚ÄúSo the big bang does not actually mark the beginning of our universe; it marks the end of our theoretical understanding.‚ÄùWhat a beautiful way to express the limits of what science can explain! If only he would keep that in mind. Since we don‚Äôt know how our universe began, what does it mean to conjure up other universes?I think of the multiverse as a kind of cosmic attic ‚Äì a place where we put the stuff we don‚Äôt know what to do with. Why do particles end up in specific places when they come from a wave that is everywhere? Lets invent a new universe for every place they could appear. Is it a problem that string theory makes a gazillion contradictory predictions? Not if we make each one of them true in a different universe. It couldn‚Äôt be a problem with the theory itself. We are told that when you apply the uncertainty principle to the theory of the early rapid expansion of the universe, you get ‚Äúeternal inflation‚Äù and an infinite universe. Could this be a sign that the theory is broken? Not when it gives us the logical equivalent to a multiverse - what a great place to put all the string theory universes! Never mind that cosmic inflation was developed from general relativity rather than string theory.Perhaps the reader should be informed that these are three independent types of hypothetical multiverse, not multiple lines of evidence supporting a single multiverse theory. Oh well, I suppose all the multiverses let us be pleasantly diverse and inclusive with all our incomplete theories.Disorderly Thinking About Time‚ÄúIt is the tendency for entropy to increase that is responsible for time‚Äôs arrow.‚Äù The second law of thermodynamics states that any system will tend to become more disordered (or have higher entropy) unless external work is done on it. There is another view that this ‚Äúlaw‚Äù, rather than being fundamental, amounts to a tautology: the most likely future path of a system is the path that is most probable. Perhaps entropy is simply an emergent property of discrete objects appearing in the universe. Just as temperature emerges from the speed of the air molecules of a gas, entropy emerges from their distribution. If entropy drives the emergence of time, one might expect that time flows at different rates depending on the local entropy, which we do not observe. Another view is that if general relativity is valid, space and time are intimately connected, and an expanding universe means that space-time itself is expanding. This predicts that new time will be created at the same rate everywhere in space.Instead we are given a strange theory of how increasing entropy somehow leads to the development of complexity, apparently derived from observing cream poured into coffee. [I am not making this up.] But remember the part about external work reversing entropy? That work is done by gravity. However universe started, after the emergence of matter led to hydrogen atoms scattered around in a highly disordered state. Gravity pulled the atoms together to form stars, and eventually planets that can support life. Gravity is the fundamental anti-entropy force in the universe that makes stars, planets and life possible. How could he leave this out?Scepticism and AuthorityScepticism is the fundamental attitude required for scientific thinking. It does not mean to conveniently reject what you disagree with. It means question everything. There is no unquestioned authority, but there is relevant expertise that should be respected.In the above paragraphs this amateur has questioned the authority of an accomplished expert in quantum physics. I have no right to an opinion in that subject. However, it is legitimate to observe that other equally good experts have differing views on these questions. While I have no right to decide which is true, I must conclude that these are still open questions, more open than this book suggests. There are a lot of open questions in science.I think it is a common problem that scientists are used to advocating their viewpoints to other scientists who already understand the range of scientific opinion. When writing for the general public, they often forget the need to explain the competing viewpoints and the degree of scientific consensus about them. But here, it seems he is leaving out other viewpoints entirely.A Bad Premonition: The End of Psychic PowersHis treatment of psychic powers is so heavy-handed that it resembles what one finds in pseudoscience. What do I mean by that?A standard pseudoscience trick is to misrepresent the theory under attack. For example, the theory of evolution presented by Creationists bears little resemblance to the actual theory. Here he constantly refers to psychic powers as spoon bending. As far as I know, there is only one person claiming to be able to bend spoons with his mind. Contrary to this straw man, the usual claim of psychics is that information can flow from one person to another over great distances. Information is much lighter than spoons.There is another pseudoscience technique that I call immunization. Spell out the fallacy you are about to employ, claim that you understand all about it and of course you would not do such a thing. Then liberally employ the trick. Now watch it in action:‚ÄúWhat we know about the laws of physics is sufficient to rule out the possibility of true psychic powers. That is a very strong claim. And more that a little bit dangerous: the trash heap of history is populated by scientists claiming to know more than they really do, or predicting that they will know almost everything any day now.‚ÄùHe then gives a number of historical examples of scientists doing exactly that. But,‚ÄúMy claim is different. I am claiming we know some things, and those things are enough to rule out some other things ‚Äì including bending spoons with the power of your mind.‚ÄùAgain, rather than bending spoons, psychics claim they are transmitting or receiving information. I do not see how a theory that claims its fields permeate the entire universe can rule this out. If quantum time really is a superposition of all moments, as he tells us, then even clairvoyance can look somewhat within the realm of possibility.I do not claim to understand his technical explanation about why quantum field theory rules out other forces. I rather doubt that it can rule out life after death, as he claims. No theory can rule out what is outside that theory. That amounts to a claim of clairvoyance.The reason to be sceptical about psychic powers is that they are difficult to demonstrate in a repeatable experiment. If we could reliably replicate psychic spoon bending, we would then have to modify quantum field theory. That is how science works ‚Äì evidence first, theory follows.Who Am I? Or, What Could I Possibly Be Thinking?We just saw an example of scientific overreach ‚Äì making a statement with a certainty that cannot be justified. Now we suddenly encounter the opposite, where scientific method gets tossed out the window when it comes to human beings. A remarkable (not in a good way) chapter titled ‚ÄúWho Am I?‚Äù addresses the currently popular transgender issue.‚ÄúFor many people, the concepts of ‚Äòmale‚Äô and ‚Äòfemale‚Äô are deeply rooted in the fabric of the world. Poetic naturalism sees things differently. Categories such as ‚Äúmale‚Äù and ‚Äúfemale‚Äù are human inventions ‚Äì stories we tell because it helps us make sense of our world. The basic stuff of reality is a quantum wave function. Everything else is an overlay, a vocabulary created by us for particular purposes. Therefore, if a person has two X chromosomes and identifies as male, what of it?‚ÄùA quantum wave function is also a ‚Äúhuman invention‚Äù. Categories such as male and female are ‚Äúhuman inventions‚Äù that encapsulate our best description of how reproduction in all complex life is fundamentally different from that of bacteria. In science, words have specific meanings. If a person has two X chromosomes, she is by definition genetically female. If you want to talk about the relationship between gender and behaviour, then find the appropriate language without changing the meaning of existing words.I will quote the next few paragraphs in full so you can see how he mixes subjective and objective thinking for yourself:‚ÄúThis can sound reminiscent of the old postmodern slogan that reality is socially constructed. [Yes, it certainly does.] There is a sense in which that is true. What is socially constructed are the ways we talk about the world, and if a particular way of talking involves concepts that a useful and fit the world quite accurately, it is fair to refer to those concepts as ‚Äòreal‚Äô. But we cannot forget that there is a single world underlying it all, and there is no sense in which the underlying world is socially constructed. It simply is, and we take on the task of discovering it, and inventing vocabularies with which to describe it.‚Äù‚ÄúPeople who think that transgenderism is a violation of the natural order sometimes like to use a slippery slope argument: If gender and sexuality are up for grabs, what about our basic identify as human beings? Is our species socially constructed?‚Äù[A better term for ‚Äúslippery slope‚Äù is false dichotomy. On one side there is an arbitrary and rigid definition of what gender roles should be, and on the other the idea that gender is an arbitrary construction and we can be whatever we want. But now he slides us all the way down that slippery slope.]‚ÄúThere is, indeed, a condition known as ‚Äòspecies dysphoria‚Äô. It is analogous to gender dysphoria but is characterized by a conviction that the subject belongs to a different species. Someone might think that, despite their nominal human form, they are actually a cat or a horse. Others go further, identifying with species that do not actually exist, like dragons or elves.‚Äù‚ÄúSo poetic naturalism does not automatically endorse or condemn someone who thinks they are a dragon, or for that matter someone who thinks they are male or female. Rather, it helps us understand what questions we should ask: What vocabulary gives us the most insight into how this person is thinking and feeling? What helps us understand how they can be happy and healthy? What is the most useful way of conceptualizing this situation? We can certainly imagine thinking through these questions in good faith, and at the end concluding with ‚ÄòSorry, Kevin. You are not a unicorn.‚Äô ‚Äù[Then why not, ‚ÄúSorry, Kevin, your Y chromosome means you are not a woman.‚Äù]‚ÄúThe real lives of people whose self-conceptions do not match those that society would like them to have can be extremely challenging, and their obstacles are highly personal. No amount of academic theorising is going to solve those problems with a single gesture. But if insist on talking about such situations on the bases of outdated ontologies, chances are high that we will end up doing more harm than good.‚ÄùYes, actions have consequences. We should indeed be sceptical about ‚Äúoutdated ontologies‚Äù while remembering that traditional morality is the product of centuries of social evolution and may contain some truths based on long experience. We should therefore be even more sceptical about modern, constructed ontologies that are not based on evidence. They also have consequences and can do harm.I suppose his writing might seem to be balanced and reasonable. I disagree. I think it is a false balance, slipping in ideas that are hostile to the spirit of science. He chooses to use the loaded term ‚Äúsocial construction‚Äù which really means an arbitrary arrangement, usually imposed by the ruling elite to maintain their power over society. It is an explicit claim that the only reality is about relationships of power. This is the philosophy of subjectivism ‚Äì the idea that we can believe whatever we want to believe to achieve our social goals. While he insists there is an underlying reality, one gets the impression there is no way to address emergent reality scientifically, so all we can do is ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù ways of talking about it. The reader is left to cross the thin line to the next step, to construct any reality that conforms to their social world view.What Happened to Scientific Method?Scientific method is not a specific technique; it is a way of thinking that can be applied to any aspect of reality. It means challenging everything based on the best evidence available, recognizing uncertainty, and knowing when the evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions. Humility is (or should be) at its core. Unfortunately, scientists do not always live up to this standard. At least, when they do not, there is an objective way to challenge them. There is no way to challenge a subjectivist, as any opinion is arbitrarily constructed.Human beings are not an arbitrary construction, or a blank slate. We have evolved over time to adapt to a changing environment. Our distinctive feature is our ability to cooperate, to behave as a social organism. Morality is how individuals modify their behaviour to make social cooperation possible. It has a genetic base with a culturally learned overlay. For those of us for whom evolutionary theory is not just another way of talking, this means there is an objective basis for morality that can be understood using scientific method.That does not mean science can give us a complete and authoritative theory of morality that can be tested in a laboratory. It means we should question all moral concepts, including modern ones, and try to understand their consequences on the basis of evidence as much as possible. Using critical thinking rather than believing what is socially convenient means avoiding the following:‚ÄúDeciding how to be good is not like solving a math puzzle, or discovering a new fossil. It is like going out to dinner with a group of friends. We think about what we want for our individual selves, talk to others about their desires and how we can work together, and reason about how to make it happen.‚ÄùDinner with like-minded friends is a recipe for groupthink. I suppose he picked up his moral relativism from his academic dinner mates.I Have No Need For This Way of TalkingLet me mention one last logical fallacy: transfer of authority. An expert in physics is not necessarily an expert in philosophy or morality. In this case I often felt I was reading a guy who has read the same books I have. But he failed to pick up the message that there is no room for subjectivism in science. It is as if he has made a deal with the devil to let him keep the integrity of physics, but all the other emergent sciences (or ‚Äúdifferent ways of talking‚Äù) get thrown under the relativist bus.Ideas and language have consequences. For example, if biology is just a way of talking, the benefits of immunization are simply a social construction. If you do not like this kind of thinking, then do not use the language that leads there. There is another word for the constructionist fallacy:‚ÄúAlternative Facts‚Äù The other side has learned to play the game. After all, it is just another way of talking. Although there is much of value here, I find it difficult to recommend a book that sells out the very integrity of science. He is a good writer, and I would happily read a book that sticks to his field of expertise. However, I will take my naturalism without the poor excuse for poetry, thank you very much."

It's a little too much too long too high-level philosophy, re-iterating the same things over and over again, and just overall meh. Someone else less familiar with physics might like it.EDIT: I accidentally read this book again forgetting that I already had. I have to start by saying that I actually love Sean Carroll and adore his presentation/teaching ability. That said, I had to skip over a bunch of it because the book is primarily a work of philosophy and history, and a concatenation of the first 2 paragraphs of popular science articles on topics of physics. The part I actually loved was the Appendix, where he discusses the Core Theory in quite a lot of detail. If that 2 page explanation was expanded into the length of this book it would be an easy 5/5."

Sean Carroll is a cosmologist and physicist at the California Institute of Technology, and his previous books dealt with that subject. Carroll‚Äôs new book is about an even bigger topic ‚Äì everything. What Carroll attempts to do is give the big picture of our existence, and he does a fine job. He combines science, philosophy, religion, psychology and other subjects, to show why no one explanation works. There can be no general theory of everything. Carroll explains how our understanding of how things functions depends on the domain of what we‚Äôre describing. So, explanations of the unseen world quantum mechanics do not explain everyday human behavior.

11,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9590631-mark,4,"Can meaning and purpose be found and explained within a non-theistic (vs. an atheistic - related, but different) worldview? Sean Carroll argues that not only is it possible, but the only reasonable perspective. He creates a new paradigm, which he calls poetic naturalism to explain how he joins science, philosophy, and a naturalistic worldview with one that also allows for wonder, mystery, joy, purpose, and meaning in life. Poetic naturalism contends that we have different ways of talking about reality depending on scope and context. We use different vocabularies when we talk about stuff at the quantum level than we do at the level of a complete human organism. We use different vocabularies when we move on to the universe and the cosmos. Poetic naturalism borrows the language of poetry to tell different stories at each different level. Each story makes sense and is meaningful within proper contexts. The problem that often occurs in discourse about naturalism, science, worldviews, philosophy, and life is that words used in one domain don't mean the same thing when used in another. Carroll argues that even though at the atomic level, discussion of meaning and purpose makes no sense, at increasingly more macro levels meaning and purpose become increasingly emergent. We can talk about purpose of simple organisms; we can talk about purpose of more complex ones; and we can finally talk about purpose at the human level. We use the same word, yet at each level the semantics are different. In this book Carroll provides evidence and argument against any kind of outside force or influence being involved in the universe as we currently observe and know. He provides comprehensive arguments against commonly used theistic arguments in favor of Creationism (of any kind) - this includes the ""watchmaker"" argument, intelligent design, and more. This book is for the mainstream public, but I think understanding it is easier if the reader is already familiar with physics, quantum physics, astrophysics, cosmology, higher mathematics, biology, neuroscience, philosophy, and religion. I think it is important for theists to examine the arguments and reasoning found in this book. They may discover that what they've assumed about arguments for theism aren't nearly as strong as they've thought. Or that non-theists possibly can't have meaning, purpose, ethics, or morals is a myth; and conversely that belief in God is required for ethics and morals. They may also discover that what they've been taught about science and naturalism looks quite a bit different than what it actually looks like within today's scientific theories.For naturalists Carroll provides avenues for more nuanced dialogue about science and how it shapes their worldview. It elevates storytelling as a more effective means of communication than a mere offering of raw data, facts and theories. He provides common ground in which all can strive to work toward a better world. (This review based on ARC provided by the publisher through NetGalley.)"

There is very little evidence, based on the initial dozen chapters, that Sean Carroll really is a theoretical physicist at Cal Tech. While he most likely is, this book is just an unlistenable mess that I started skipping through after a few chapters, and then gave up on about halfway through. "

I would recommend this book who doesn't know Dr. Carroll from the interwebs and I think he is a good writer and I like his grand work here but I think i like his earlier works better. Still I like this synthesis of science and philosophy a lot and I think he gets his picture right.February 7, 2017,  Upon doing a much more careful listening on Audible I have gotten a lot better appreciation for this book and Carroll's understanding of poetic naturalism. I can sign on to 99% of what Carroll endorses in terms of the science and philosophy of the book. I might fight him on his interpretation of consciousness and the status of philosophical zombies but as for the rest of his vision of poetic naturalism I find it satisfying and beautiful and more importantly probably the closest to the truth.

Not the ideas themselves, something else - the attempt to cover everything? The lukewarm philosophy? Still, highly admire the author, and can only recommend his blog"
15,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Carroll introduces a philosophical idea he calls ""poetic naturalism"" in which the ontology includes objects which are useful in talking about the world at a given scale or levels of detail. For example, we can talk about people when it's useful to do so, and not worry that people are just made up of atoms and without getting distracted by questions like which is the last atom that's part of ""me"" on the tip of my finger.The book takes the reader from the beginning of science with Newton's laws of motion up to modern day quantum field theory. This is structured like a survey of physics so as not to let any novice readers get lost. He does a great job of explaining why psychic powers can't be real, why ""qualia"" and ""philosophical zombies"" are dumb, etc. He introduces a cool analogy of a ""planet of belief"" which represents all the things a person believes. Every person has a different ""planet of belief"", and they can be stable or unstable, etc. He smacks down the idea that science, like religion, requires ""faith"". He tackles the hard and soft problems of consciousness. He says the soft problem is really hard, and the hard problem is a misunderstanding.There's a whole lot of talk about god in this book. I'm not sure why. He does say its important because so many people believe in god. The topic is approached with a lot of caution which seems to me an attempt to avoid turning away theists. That's nice, but I felt like he was treating religious ideas with kid gloves and that's not too fun for me to read. It's also boring. I want to hear that space stuff!Here are some claims in the book which I consider mistakes.* He claims ""there's nothing about quantum mechanics that necessarily invalidates determinism."" Um, what about the part where observations are random?! He invokes the MWI and says the ensemble (multiverse) is deterministic. But this doesn't work because you don't do quantum mechanics using the ensemble. You use the same maths using MWI to make the same non-deterministic predictions about what's likely to happen when you make a measurement. A theory is deterministic, by my reading, if there's an unique prediction when evolution forwards in time given fully specified initial conditions. This is true for Newtonian mechanics, and untrue for Quantum Mechanics. If you look at MWI as providing an unique solution evolving forwards in time, you do so at the cost of all predictive power, because we have no way to tell which path down the infinity of branching universes our reality has taken.* He claims there's nothing in the practice of science that excludes supernatural explanations from the start. Actually, there is. The word ""supernatural"" generally means a force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature. So it's unscientific by definition! But even if we grant the most charitable definition of ""supernatural"" as being merely inconsistent with known laws of physics, we still have a problem. Scientific theories must be falsifiable. A supernatural claim is one of an exception which has been found to the laws of physics. If this exception is explained by some new hypothesis, we must test that hypothesis. If found true, this new hypothesis is added into what we mean by ""the laws of physics"". So a supernatural claim, when unsupported, shouldn't be believed at all, and is rightly rejected by anyone practicing the process called science. And as support for the claim's truth becomes available, it *must* become consistent with the other laws of science. This process can be gradual or rapid, depending on the nature of the evidence, but at no time is any natural explanation ""supernatural"", and at no point is any ""supernatural"" explanation necessary much less allowed in scientific discourse!* He claims the universe could be just a bit larger than what we observe. His point here is that we should remain skeptical about unknowns, and not assume the way the universe looks here matches how it looks elsewhere, or even assume there is an elsewhere! This is subtly incorrect. We actually do have some knowledge about that which lies outside our observable universe! If spacetime were curved such that the size of the universe were finite and on the order of the observable universe, we'd expect an enormously positive value for the curvature of the universe. Which we don't see. Also, if the universe relatively close to (but outside) the horizon of our observable universe were significantly anisotropic, we'd notice the impact of this anisotropy on objects close to (but inside) the horizon. The isotropy of the observable universe is very precisely known. So, he's made an overly naive claim because it ignores important lines of evidence about what lies outside the horizon of our observable universe, where that evidence can be gathered from right here within the horizon."

18,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"Quite interesting philosophical discussion of what we know, what we can know, and what we can't know. The author is a professor of physics and begins with a review of the history of what we have learned about the laws of physics He then launches into a discussion of philosophical belief systems contrasting those of theism and atheism. He describes his belief in a system termed ""poetic naturalism."" The naturalism part is that there are no gods, no creators, no life after death, etc. In other words, ""what you see is what you get."" The poetic part refers to a deep appreciation of the great beauty of our natural world. He discusses the fact that we can't really know, or prove, which system of belief is actually true. It is just a question of what is most likely given what we can see and measure. Some people believe the universe started last Thursday; maybe but not likely. Same with souls and spirits."

Having read 33% of it, an investment of several irreplacable hours of my life, I have found precious little science, and chapter after chapter...after chapter...of philosopical preaching about the foolishness of those who put any credence in the supernatural. I surrender!Look, I have no problem with atheism! It is a perfectly reasonable way of looking at the world, particularly from a physicist. But whether you are pontificating about religion or atheism, after awhile it becomes condescending! It is like, ""Okay, I get it! The universe functions fine by itself! Now to the science of how!"" But no! The philosophy lesson coninues!The last 67% of the book might be wonderful, and filled with wonders of the universe I will now never learn, because I can't take any more preaching! "
20,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6593669-whitney-milam,5,I finally have a term to sum up my own personal philosophy toward life (which was certainly deepened and expanded by reading this book): poetic naturalism. 
21,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2492588-katie,4,"I bought this at an airport bookstore, mostly because I admired the audacity of someone who would write a book about life, meaning, and the universe and slap it all on the cover. I'm pretty much the audience for this book. I like science but have zero formal training in it; I like books that are overly ambitious in their scope. I also went into this book (without realizing it) already having essentially the same philosophical and religious views as the author. That made for a somewhat satisfying read, if never a particularly challenging one. Carroll is a decent writer - nothing spectacular, but always clear and approachable. He's one of the rare science writers I've come across that shows a regular respect for historical thinkers who were clever but also wrong. He's also quite good at deploying analogies to explain difficult concepts (I especially liked this discussion of time and entropy). That said, I'd imagine this book is a bit of mixed bag for actual, trained scientists. It's relatively light on hard science and if you're not already on board with Hugh Everett's multi-world explanation of quantum mechanics, this is certainly not going to convince you. But that's okay. That's not really what this book is trying to do. It's fitting that the books' last chapter is called ""Existential Therapy"" - Carroll's book is really designed as a philosophical statement, as a gentle ""it'll all be okay"" to people who look at quantum mechanics with existential dread. I was already pretty much on board before I started reading it, so I can't say how effective it'd be at convincing non-believers. But it's still an interesting, engaging book, filled with clever analogies and a broader, humanistic view of the world. "
22,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Sean Carroll speaks of a new idea called poetic naturalism. The poet Muriel Rukeyser once wrote, ‚ÄúThe universe is made of stories, not of atoms.‚Äù The world is what exists and what happens, but we gain enormous insight by talking about it‚Äîtelling its story‚Äî indifferent ways.Naturalism comes down to three things:1. There is only one world, the natural world.2. The world evolves according to unbroken patterns, the laws of nature.3. The only reliable way of learning about the world is by observing it.Essentially, naturalism is the idea that the world revealed to us by scientific investigation is the one true world. The poetic aspect comes to the fore when we start talking about that world. It can also be summarized in three points:1. There are many ways of talking about the world.2. All good ways of talking must be consistent with one another and with the world.3. Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.A poetic naturalist for example will agree that both Captain Kirk and the Ship of Theseus are simply ways of talking about certain collections of atoms stretching through space and time.Here's some quotes from the book: - To understand time, it helps to start with space. Here on the surface of theEarth, you would be forgiven for thinking that there is an intrinsic differencebetween the directions ‚Äúup‚Äù and ‚Äúdown,‚Äù something deeply embeddedinto the fabric of nature. In reality, as far as the laws of physics are concerned,all directions in space are created equal. If you were an astronaut,floating in your spacesuit while you performed an extravehicular activity,you wouldn‚Äôt notice any difference between one direction in space and anyother. The reason why there‚Äôs a noticeable distinction between up and downfor us isn‚Äôt because of the nature of space; it‚Äôs because we live in the vicinityof an extremely influential object: the Earth.Time works the same way. In our everyday world, time‚Äôs arrow is unmistakable,and you would be forgiven for thinking that there is an intrinsicdifference between past and future. In reality, both directions of time arecreated equal. The reason why there‚Äôs a noticeable distinction between pastand future isn‚Äôt because of the nature of time; it‚Äôs because we live in the aftermathof an extremely influential event: the Big Bang.- Among the small but passionate community of probability-theory aficionados, fierce debates rage over What Probability Really Is. In one campare the frequentists, who think that ‚Äúprobability‚Äù is just shorthand for ‚Äúhowfrequently something would happen in an infinite number of trials.‚Äù If yousay that a flipped coin has a 50 percent chance of coming up heads, a frequentistwill explain that what you really mean is that an infinite numberof coin flips will give equal numbers of head and tails.In another camp are the Bayesians, for whom probabilities are simplyexpressions of your states of belief in cases of ignorance or uncertainty. Fora Bayesian, saying there is a 50 percent chance of the coin coming up headsis merely to state that you have zero reason to favor one outcome over another.If you were offered to bet on the outcome of the coin flip, you wouldbe indifferent to choosing heads or tails. The Bayesian will then helpfullyexplain that this is the only thing you could possibly mean by such a statement,since we never observe infinite numbers of trials, and we often speakabout probabilities for things that happen only once, like elections or sportingevents. The frequentist would then object that the Bayesian is introducingan unnecessary element of subjectivity and personal ignorance intowhat should be an objective conversation about how the world behaves, andthey would be off.- Prior beliefs matter. When we‚Äôre trying to understand what is trueabout the world, everyone enters the game with some initial feeling aboutwhat propositions are plausible, and what ones seem relatively unlikely. Thisisn‚Äôt an annoying mistake that we should work to correct; it‚Äôs an absolutelynecessary part of reasoning in conditions of incomplete information. Andwhen it comes to understanding the fundamental architecture of reality,none of us has complete information.- The progress of human knowledge has bequeathed to us a couple of insightsthat, taken together, suggest a world that is profoundly different fromthe picture we construct from our everyday experience. There is conservationof momentum: the universe doesn‚Äôt need a mover; constant motion isnatural and expected. It is tempting to hypothesize‚Äî cautiously, always withthe prospect of changing our minds if it doesn‚Äôt work‚Äî that the universedoesn‚Äôt need to be created, caused, or even sustained. It can simply be. Thenthere is conservation of information. The universe evolves by marching fromone moment to the next in a way that depends only on its present state. Itneither aims toward future goals nor relies on its previous history.- Following Aristotle, the fact that the universe exists is often cited asevidence in favor of the existence of God. The universe is specific and contingent,the argument goes; it could easily have been otherwise. So theremust be something that explains the universe, and then something thatexplains that thing, and so on through the chain of reasons. To avoid divingdown a rabbit hole of infinite regress, we need to invoke a necessary being‚Äî onethat must exist and could not have been otherwise, and therefore requiresno explanation. And that being is God.Poetic naturalists don‚Äôt like to talk about necessities when it comes tothe universe. They prefer to lay all the options on the table, then try to figureout what our credences should be in each of them. Maybe there is anultimate explanation; maybe there is an infinite chain of explanations;maybe there is no final explanation at all. The progress of modern physicsand cosmology has sent a fairly unequivocal message: there‚Äôs nothing wrongwith the universe existing without any external help. Why it exists the particularway it does, rather than some other way, is worth exploring."
23,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"This is nonfiction science. It was very science-y which is not my thing, but I liked this one. If every physics teacher could be like this author, more kids would leave high school having enjoyed science, as a whole. Some of this was completely over my head, but not once did the author ever make me feel like I was in the weeds. He took his time and described everything so well. This author posed a lot of ""big  picture"" questions, but instead of letting the reader ponder them, he stepped in and gave you answers. That approach worked with this book, but sometimes I wanted to ponder some of the questions. "
24,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"All popular science books should take a clue from this book. There is no 'one scientific method' there are just many different possible ways we determine our justified true beliefs.This author is never afraid at talking above the listener. He's perfectly comfortable at using the appropriate terms that our needed, and he takes a stand on many of the issues within the Philosophy of Science. As the author says, science before Galileo thought in terms of causes and purpose (teleology), and afterwards started thinking in terms of patterns and laws (rules).I would say the book is essentially divided into two parts. The first part lays the foundation for the nature of science and introduces the listener to the nature of being, the study of ontology, and the foundations that are created which we use in order to explain. He'll actually get into some deep discussions on possible building blocks for the universe (monads, dyads, substance, forms,....). The importance of emergent properties because of the different regimes that are created by our ""domains of appropriate applicability"". Anti-realist v realist, the entailing of different theories by other theories, Bayesian statistics and why it's so necessary to understand what it is, and most of the other standard topics from the philosophy of science.There's multiple ways to understand the world. Sometimes we have to get at the particular before we can understand the whole or the universal, and other times we must understand the whole before we can get at the particular. The judgement we use by subsuming the particular under a universal rule gives us the bridge from reason to understanding.I saw the second half of the book as a refutation for all of the classical arguments for the existence of God. He doesn't frame them that way but uses the argument as a departure point in order to educate the listener on how to think about the world and ourselves such that we are a part of nature not apart from nature and how everything that can be explained (understood) can be thought of in 'poetic natural' terms. (Look, he's an incredibly gifted writer, but I think he could have done a better job on his 'fine tuning' counter-argument. But his refutation on the prime mover argument, that 'nothing is not a state of being' was superb).Science is always underdetermined. The scientific facts that we have can be explained by multiple theories. Just read any issue of Scientific American and you'll see an article on a new scientific phenomena such as Dark Energy and you'll see a statement such as that there are three different explanations for the phenomena under consideration (e.g. gravity changes over distance, a dark energy field exist similarly as the Higgs field does, or the vacuum energy of space creates it). ""Grue', green before a date and blue after a date, is my favorite color for a reason. It quickly shows that science will be underdetermined. I mention this because I think that the graveyard is full of scientist who makes such a claim as he does in the book that the ""bending of a spoon by mental telepathy is not possible because our current theory would never allow it"". It is wrong to make that statement. There can always be a different ontology that will entail the current one but allow us to realize different perspectives.I really like the book a lot. He merges the nature of science with understanding science as nature. I saw the bibliography on this book before it came out. I read over 2/3s of the books mentioned in it and knew before I read this book it would be fairly redundant and it was. I slowed down reading popular science books because most of the ideas in popular science books I read I have read elsewhere. Even in this book it mostly consisted of things I've read elsewhere. But, he does something that I wish all pop science books would do, he understands the issues in the Philosophy of Science and he knows how to relate that to the science that is being told. "
25,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17511973-p-wilson,3,"This a good book if you're looking for a reasonably clear synopsis of modern physics. It also has an excellent section on scientific reasoning, including a useful description of Bayesian probability and abduction (as distinct from deduction and induction). It is marred, however, by the what I would call the author's evangelical atheism. His alternative, ""poetic naturalism,"" is best described by one reviewer as ""not even wrong."" (Robert Crease)Poetic naturalism, the author's coinage, are the stories we use to talk about ""macroscopic"" phenomenon that emerge from the underlying, and ironclad, physical realities. He too easily dismisses the sticky question of ""consciousness"" by saying it's just the way we have of talking about cognitive processes that make it seem as if we have a non-physical soul. My question: if consciousness is so easy to dismiss, could you please explain electricity? It seems to be an emergent phenomenon that is physical, but undefinable. Poetic naturalism is also invoked to describe the unproven, and unprovable, idea of the ""multiverse."" According to Carroll, this controversial idea is ""just a way of talking.""Carroll's insistence that the laws of the universe are now clearly understood is undermined by his acknowledgement that we can't reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics, that physics is a ""mess,"" and that we don't know what dark matter is, even though it seems to fill most of the universe. Moreover, in a recent article in the New York Review of Books, Steven Weinberg, one of the world's leading theoretical physicists, argues that it might be time to reconsider the whole idea of quantum mechanics based on its shortcomings.The last part of the book, in which Carroll argues for an ethics based on ""poetic naturalism,"" reads like a New Age poster written by a California surfer dude. His ""Ten Commandments"" are trite, to say the least.Carroll does skim across a lot of interesting philosophical territory, but to me his coverage seems Wikipedia deep. "
26,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy,5,"Carroll's book is ambitious, and ultimately it's impressive because he achieves--at least as far as I can determine--what he set out to do. The big picture is the nature of reality explained by contemporary science. He describes how the universe works in every scale from the cosmic to the quantum and how the current understanding of such elemental foundations make clear concepts like the arrow of time and entropy and unite in our heads as consciousness and language and even notions of morality.Intended for the layperson, like me, some of his book is necessarily spent explaining how to think about the science and the phenomena he describes. Many of these ideas are head-splittingly knotty. The diagrams and charts are helpful, sometimes even clarifying a text too difficult for my knowledge and experience to grasp. Working forward and downward from the Big Bang and cosmic scale to the mysteries of quantum mechanics he details existence as we know it today. Sometimes it was like trying to understand magic. Existence may be a human perception, but Carroll still had to explain how consciousness is a physical process defined by the activity and motion of quantum particles and how ultimately all of it affects such philosophical ideas as determinism, causality, and free will.This was a difficult read for someone like me who doesn't have a background in science. But I rode this beautiful, muscular animal of a book, clinging to it, refusing to be bucked off. And by the time Carroll got to consciousness I felt like I knew how to ride a little bit. I may not have tamed the complete picture of reality, but I learned a lot, and I learned I want to read more. "
27,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19403634-h-lio-steven,5,"At some point in life, we all end up wondering about our place in the cosmos. For a lot of human history, it was thought we were at the center of all action, and that the universe was way smaller than it actually is. Given the epistemic/scientific limitations of much of our history, one can't say it wasn't all that unreasonable to hold such a view. Plus, it probably was somewhat reassuring, making more vivid the idea that we were somehow special in the big scheme of things. What's not to find attractive about this picture? Alas, we now know better, and Sean Carroll's The Big Picture attempts to show just how much of a dramatic change our knowledge about the world has been subject to. Carroll's book is not only a decent survey of what philosopher Wilfrid Sellars calls the contemporary ""scientific image"" of the world, but is also a defense of a metaphysical stance called naturalism. Although there's no consensus on what the term exactly means, the basic idea here is that objective reality is nothing but that revealed to us by the sciences -- or, to put it in Carroll's terms, the basic idea is that there's only one world: the natural world as revealed by the sciences. Naturalism can come in different forms, the most famous of which probably being the reductionistic one. Roughly speaking, reductionistic naturalism claims that the only real things are those revealed by fundamental physics, and that everything else that is studied by special sciences (also known as ""higher level phenomena"") can be reduced to fundamental physics without loss. Aware of this variety of forms naturalism can take, Carroll is careful to specify just what kind of naturalism he subscribes to, which he's labeled poetic naturalism. The ""poetic"" qualifier is motivated by the idea that there are different ways to talk about the world, many of which are useful given certain purposes. This qualifier is not as innocent as it might seem at first, for Carroll uses it to differentiate himself from the redutionistic brand of naturalism. By emphasizing that there are different useful ways of talking about the world, Carroll wants to say that so called higher level entities and phenomena are derived categories that deserve to be called real. To put it in more prosaic terms, just because in fundamental physics there are no such things as ""chairs"" or even ""time"" or ""causes"" it doesn't thereby follow that these things don't really exist -- they do exist insofar these terms are useful descriptions of our macroscopic reality. Where reductionistic naturalism seeks to eliminate high level phenomena studied by the special sciences, poetic naturalism tries to reserve some space for them in the big picture.The other motivation for describing this variety of naturalism as ""poetic"" is that, even though our current scientific worldview reveals us an impersonal, careless universe, there's still room for meaning and purpose for human life. More specifically, Carroll argues that there's plenty of place for morality and meaning in life even though these things aren't part of reality in the same sense that, e.g., photons are. In other words, life can be meaningful and there can be moral progress even in the absence of objective, mind-independent standards to ground either meaning or morality.As it should be clear by now, this book is ambitious. So, how does Carroll go about defending poetic naturalism? He proceeds by showing us what the contemporary scientific image reveals to us about the natural world. To keep it terribly short, Carroll argues that our current scientific picture shows that the universe is causally closed, self-contained and that we have every reason to believe that everything in it can be accounted for without resorting to any outside entity or phenomena.Of course, we can't be absolutely certain about our scientific worldview. But then again, as Carroll goes on to argue, knowledge needs no absolute certainties. The tremendous successes, in terms of predictive and explanatory powers, of our contemporary well-established scientific theories have utterly displaced the old Cartesian idea that knowledge requires certainty provided by unshakable foundations. Granted, we are fallible beings and we could always be wrong. However, mere possibility of being wrong should not be taken as identical to ""we're probably wrong"". With this problem in mind, Carroll explains that our claims of knowledge should be based on Bayesian reasoning: we should update our credences (i.e., the degree of belief that something is the case) in a given thing according to the evidence we find. So, for instance, if you believe that you can bend spoons with the power or sheer thought, repeatedly trying and failing to bend spoons through sheer thought should make you decrease your credence that you can actually do that, and this process will eventually make your credence so low that you simply give up believing it's really possible to bend spoons with the power of the mind. As this example illustrates, another important aspect of Bayesian reasoning is that everyone has their priors -- i.e., everyone attributes initial probabilities that something is the case. While this might be a problem, as Carroll himself acknowledges, the important thing to note is that if people engaged in a truth-seeking enterprise are really honest and open-minded, Bayesian reasoning assures that these people will tend to converge to the same set of beliefs even if they start with very different priors.With this Bayesian toolkit at hand, Carroll shows us how our contemporary scientific image ends up enormously increasing our credence in naturalism. In the process he makes clear how metaphysical claims can be subject to empirical scrutiny, and it's precisely this possibility that allows us to build a solid case in favor of naturalism. To illustrate, consider the existence of God. Determining whether God exists is a metaphysical matter, but there are many ways one could either try empirically supporting or weakening the thesis that God exists. The fine-tuning argument for God's existence, for example, crucially depends on empirical input. And since that is the case, assessing our available evidence and trying to figure out what naturalism and theism, for instance, predict about it in the end will make us increase our credence in one of those thesis while simultaneously decrease our credence in the other in the same proportion. Many philosophers will easily agree with what I have just said, but will go on to say that there is at least one other way to assess the plausibility of metaphysical theses: a priori reflection. Indeed, the traditional philosophical approach is, to a great extent, to advance a priori arguments and thought experiments and test them against our intuitions. This is what epistemologists would call ""rationalism"". Carroll explicitly eschews the idea that we can know about objective reality by pure thought by claiming this is not a reliable methodology. He doesn't provide much support for this claim, though, and so I would completely understand if someone with a good epistemology background complained about it. Moreover, he doesn't address contemporary rationalism, which is more sophisticated than its ""classical"" variety. However, Carroll hints at how an argument to support such a view can be developed by mentioning cases of metaphysical principles (e.g., ""for every effect there is a cause"") that were held to be known by a priori intuition and that were cast on doubt by scientific findings. For a better articulation of this kind of argument, I strongly recommend reading the first chapter of Ladyman and Ross's Every Thing Must Go (2007) and Kornblith's ""The Impurity of Reason"" (2000). So, summing up, Carroll believes that some sort of empiricism is the best way to know about objective reality, and this belief is partly based on the view that rationalism's methodology isn't reliable. This is important because it helps motivate naturalism: if our best way to know about the objective reality is in the end through scientific means, then given our best scientific worldview it seems that naturalism is probably true. Someone might complain that this is not right, because science subscribes to methodological naturalism, according to which scientific explanations should not posit supernatural entities or phenomena, and so basing naturalism in science is in the end question-begging. Not so fast, says Carroll. He argues that science is actually committed to methodological empiricism, according to which our we acquire knowledge about the world throuh empirical means. Thus, naturalism is a conclusion supported by what we have come to know through methodological empiricism, not some sort of dogmatic assumption embraced by science. None of the above is to say that absolutely everything about our scientific knowledge is evidence in favor of naturalism. One of the most satisfying features of the book is that Carroll is pretty honest about naturalism's shortcomings and about how some of what we know are more probable under theism than under naturalism (such as, e.g., the amazing regularities we observe in the universe). We don't need to have every piece of evidence being more likely under naturalism in order to subscribe to it; rather what is needed to stick with naturalism is that our total available evidence renders naturalism more probable than its competitors, and that is just what the book tries (successfully, I submit) to show. Now, I have said before that Carroll differentiates himself from reductionists by emphasizing that there are different useful ways of talking about the world, and that what is described by these ways of talking deserve to be called real. But what exactly does it mean? Unfortunately, Carroll is not as clear as he could have been on this. However, given the context where he usually resorts to this expression, what Carroll has in mind by ""useful ways of talking"", as far as investingating objective reality is concerned, is probably along the lines of what I call the non-redundancy clause, according to which some phenomena studied by some special science can be considered to be real if they can't be explained and predicted by fundamental physics alone or in conjunction with other lower level special sciences. Carroll's reliance on the notion of multiple realizability of many coarse-grained theories in special lends excellent support to this interpretation, and this is certainly distinct from reductionism. Moreover, in the best spirit of naturalistic philosophy, it's motivated by how science is actually conducted, not by intuitively appealing first principles. Very well. But is this non-redundancy clause an epistemological stance, or an ontological one? This is important, because reductionism can be understood either epistemologically or ontologically. One can agree that several special sciences theories resist straightforward intertheoretic reduction because of our epistemic limitations and at the same time maintain that the phenomena and entitites described by the special sciences are ultimately ontologically reducible to fundamental physics. Someone who holds both of these views can be said to be an epistemological nonreductionist while also being an ontological reductionist. While Carroll can be easily said to be an epistemological nonreductionist, it's harder to tell whether he is also an ontological nonreductionist. Throughout the book he seems to oscillate between these two ontological stances, and not even after I have finished the book was I sure about which ot the two he actually subscribes to. Although this is not that much important on general metaphysical grounds, in that in the end both positions are entirely naturalistic and this dispute does not bear on whether naturalism itself is true, it's important both for the sake of understanding the nature of objective reality and also to see just how Carroll's variety of naturalism eschews mere ""poetic license"" when it comes to talking about ontology.Maybe it's easy to agree that all is well for naturalism when it comes to fundamental physics, but one may find it harder to go swallow the naturalist pill after confronting the question of how naturalism accounts for things like intentionality and consciousness. Intuitively, it seems that these things are just stuff above and beyond quantum fieds, collections of cells and all of what is described by science. How on earth can naturalism explain consciousness, for example? How does naturalism respond to famous thought experiments against physicalism about consciousness, such as Frank Jackson's ""Mary's room"" or David Chamlers' ""philosophical zombies""?Carroll argues that both of these thought experiments fail. He correctly points out that Jackson's thought experiment has a pretty slippery notion of knowledge. If, as Jackson says, Mary knows every physical facts about color, and if this knowledge includes having certain synaptic connections that correspond to having the experience of, say, red, then Mary doesn't learn anything new when she goes outside. Now, by stipulation Mary has not yet experienced seeing red, and so those synaptic connections never took place in her, and thus she definitely learns something new when she goes outside. But then, given this stipulation, it's very doubtful whether we can say Mary truly did know all the physical facts about color there was to know. As Carroll notes, Jackson seems to have introduced an artificial distinction between kinds of knowledge understood as synaptic connections.As for Chalmers‚Äô p-zombies, the problem is basically that the thought experimente is ultimately question-begging. Chalmers simply assumes that being able to conceive of p-zombies means that they are logically possible, and that being logically possible in turn suffices to show that consciousness isn't physical. But this is something a naturalist would call into question. If p-zombies are physically identical with conscious human beings, then, a naturalist would argue, contra apparent conceivability, p-zombies are actually just as conscious as human beings. P-zombies, a naturalist could go on, are thus just modal illusions: we think they are possible because we think we can conceive of them, but really once we understand that consciousness is a completely physical phenomena we can see that we can't actually conceive of p-zombies -- they are impossible.Now, one can easily notice that responding to these thought experiments does nothing to provide a positive account of consciousness in naturalism. True, and Carroll by no means depends only on responding to challenges against naturalistic accounts of consciousness to conclude that consciousness is a natural phenomena. He mentions a variety of evidence that strongly indicates that consciousness is a physical process through and through, and correctly notes that, while we don't understand a lot about consciousness, cognitive science has been making significant advances in the direction of understanding more and more about it. It's worth highlighting how Carroll describes consciousness qua physical process, because it's the same basic strategy he uses to naturalistically account for things like purpose and even free will. Terms like that refer to emergent phenomena whose underlying regularities can be best described with the vocabulary typical of higher level special sciences. We can make best sense of certain patterns of behavior in cognitively complex animals, for example, by resorting to terms like ""beliefs"" and ""wantings"". Here Carroll's notion of ""useful ways of talking"" about emergent phenomena is central. And an important point associated with this discussion is that there's no in principle reason to think it's simply impossible that very complex machines would be capable of genuinely thinking. Granted, this is all pretty counterintuitive for a lot of people, given how much at odds it is with our folk notions of consciousness, purpose and the like. But being counterintuitive by itself hardly suffices to show that a given scientifically informed position is false. While intuitions in many cases might serve as a good start to theorizing about the world, it should by no means be the final word, and we should be ready to abandon them if our best available theories are at odds with them.I have said that one of Carroll's motivations for using the qualifier ""poetic"" is that his variety of naturalism seeks to defend that we can have meaning and morality even in the absence of objective standards as guides. How does he defend it? Keeping it short, Carroll defends that meaning in life and morality are both human inventions, but that acknowledging it should not make us shy from seeing these things as important to our lives. Not only that, he also defends that there can be such thing as moral progress despite the absence of objective standards. Carroll subscribes to a meta-ethical theory called constructivism, according to which morality is ultimately dependent on human's desires and attitudes, but that it's possible to engage in fruitful moral discussions and that there are good and bad arguments in favor of a particular moral claim. Roughly, fruitful moral discussions are possible because, as matter of fact, people have some widely shared moral values, and certain values might be in tension with one another. Thus, insofar as people wanna behave according to their values and also wanna have an internally coherent system of values, it's possible to persuade other people to abandon one particular moral stance or another by showing how they are logically incompatible with other deeply held values, for example.This approach might seem unsatisfactory to many people, especially to those who gravitate towards moral realism. But once we recognize that naturalism is probably true, and that mind-independent, objective morality violates naturalistic ontological constraints, then I guess we can appreciate that this might be a good enough approach to ethics. But it's important to note that constructivism is not the only meta-ethical theory compatible with naturalism, and that there are other compatible and interesting meta-ethical theories available. The Big Picture is an ambitious and beautifully written book. It has its shortcomings, of course, and there are many things with which I disagree and some arguments I found very wanting, but it succeeds in showing how naturalism can be rationally motivated and just how our current scientific worldview justifies attributing a pretty high credence to its truth. Carroll is a theoretical physicist, but he gets his philosophy straight where many other popular naturalists fall short (I‚Äôm looking at you, Sam Harris and Lawrence Krauss et al) and is well aware of how naturalism can be hardpressed. He acknowledges the many puzzling and unresolved questions naturalists must face and that much of our scientific understanding is still incomplete. The most important thing to be emphasized here is that, despite all of the existing problems and puzzles, naturalism has theoretical resources to deal with them. (In order not to be too vague here, let me quickly illustrate: we don‚Äôt know exactly how life began, but we have both different, plausible hypotheses to account for it and some evidence that supports some of them to a certain extent.) Finally, he also tries to inspire us to see that just because we are in charge of coloring the world with values and meaning in an impersonal and indifferent universe it doesn‚Äôt mean that we can‚Äôt make a beautiful, satisfactory piece of art. And speaking of art, Carroll should be praised for showing how it‚Äôs possible to paint such a big picture with fairly broad brushstrokes and have as and end result such a beautiful and elegant image."
28,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3323455-jeremy,4,"As ambitious as its title suggests, this is a book meant to lay out a particular worldview. If we accept the universe as physics presents it, a vast panorama of elementary particles and quantum fields born in a fiery Big Bang and destined for a thermodynamic heat death, how are we to see ourselves? Can we simultaneously accept human beings as swarms of simple particles, organisms produced by random variation and natural selection, and as conscious and intentional beings with choices and a purpose? Sean Carroll thinks so, and he thinks that we can have such a world view without invoking God or immaterial spirit. He calls this Weltanschauung ""poetic naturalism.""Carroll is a good writer and a good physicist, and he has more respect and appreciation both for philosophy and history than some book-writing scientists. The physics material in the book is often fascinating and sometimes provocative (to the general nonscientist reader, anyway). Some of the interesting physics that he tackles will be familiar to readers of his previous books and his blog: the thermodynamic arrow of time and the ""past hypothesis"", the Everettian ""Many Worlds"" interpretation of quantum physics, the Core Theory of Physics, et cetera. Unsurprisingly for a physicist, he considers evolution and natural selection primarily as an algorithmic process, and the brain in terms of electrical processes and networks of neurons. There's a lot of interesting intellectual meat to chew on here, in terms of both information and food for thought.The best thing about the book, though, which is entirely in harmony with its goal, is to lay bare the chain of reasoning that builds his naturalist view of the world into a worldview that meshes with his sense of human life and purpose. He takes as his guide an epistemology based on Bayesian reasoning and a conviction that the emergent features of the universe - from chemistry to the human mind to the rules of basketball to morality and ethics - are just as real as the quantum fields and elementary particles that they are made of. You don't have to agree with all of Carroll's conclusions to find a lot of value in following his argument. And you would be well served to look in the Further Reading section to continue the journey he starts you on. "
29,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4461733-paperclippe,4,"This was more of a philosophy book than I was expecting it to be, having read many of Sean Carroll's previous books, but I ended up liking it more than I thought I was going to for more than a couple of reasons.First, it's rare that I come across any sort of ""speculative"" book (I know that that's not the right word, but that's how it's sticking in my mind at the moment) that I agree with more often than not, and I did find myself agreeing with Carroll's positions much of the time. Now, I will amend this statement by saying that Sean didn't take too many hard positions (except in the case of things that were one hundred percent absurd or factually disprovable), instead favoring a pretty balanced view (which was also nice after what felt like a spate of pop sci books that too a more ""hard and fast"" approach without acknowledging evidence to the contrary. I'm lookin' at you, Brian Greene and Lee Smolin). Second, and this might sound silly, but I really enjoyed how short the chapters were (and the compulsive part of me also very much enjoyed that there were exactly 50). It's almost as though Carroll (or his editor, perhaps) knew that the information could get dense and overwhelming, so they broke it up into nice, bite-sized portions that were easy to wrap your head around and let you take a little break every so often, even if that break was just the time it took to turn the page and absorb the blank header space at the beginning of a new chapter. Now, I know formatting isn't everything, but it's nice.And third, the cover has glitter on it. 'Nuff said."
30,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31053607-amaan-cheval,5,"The Big Picture is the best book I've read so far. It aims to address some extremely difficult questions, and surprisingly enough, it does do them justice and address them well. Sean Carroll pulls in research from several avenues to build as comprehensive a picture as possible, including logical and well-structured arguments for what he believes and why that makes sense.The book is very thought-provoking and it feels like it does a great job at peeling apart several layers of the human experience and examining them in detail.I've gained at least a dozen new models of thinking from the book, which are refinements on ideas / views I've held for a long time. This may well be the reason I enjoyed the book so much - because, for the first time have I had so much confirmation bias in one place, and not only in confirming, but also building on top of these ideas and explaining them in much simpler and logical methods.The book can also be quite inspiring and if nothing else, I'd urge everyone to at least read about poetic naturalism (a worldview which prides itself on ""real"" being whatever is a useful way of speaking about things - regardless of it being a human construct or not) and emergence (a phenomenon explaining how something can be larger than the sum of its parts, roughly).After reading the chapter on emergence, I had to go back and watch Robert Sapolsky's brilliant lecture on emergence and complexity, which does make for a fascinating complementary lecture:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_ZuW..."
31,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76105804-rick-wilson,2,"It felt like this book was a response to a question that I wasn't aware of. Sean wore me out early on with mental gymnastics on his treatise on the ‚Äúunknowability of anything.‚Äù It felt like a cartoon episode where each time a layer of certainty was peeled back, the characters look and say ""but can we go deeper?"" again and again until the joke is no longer funny or even comprehensible. By the time we got into Quantum Mechanics, I was cross eyed and drooling. Just not the right book for me at this time. I‚Äôm sure there are those who would enjoy this immensely, I can see how at another time I might enjoy taking a hit of acid and listening to the audiobook while feeling myself dissolve into a cloud of unknowable cosmic dust. As of December in 2019 I did not find myself to be in that mood. "
32,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26706153-j-earl,4,The Big Picture by Sean Carroll is a very accessible addition to the category of science books for the general public. As is usually the case this incorporates contextualizing the science within the more philosophical parameters of daily life. We may not think of our lives as philosophically driven but our actions and ideas are indeed so in the broadest sense. Carroll uses the concept of ‚Äúpoetic naturalism‚Äù to bring the discussion from the hows of science to the whys of the humanities.I found his discussions quite enjoyable and his arguments well grounded both scientifically (of course) and philosophically. That isn‚Äôt to say I agreed with every use of every term but he did not grossly misuse any terms to make a concept fit his paradigm. This is often where books at the boundaries between disciplines begin to falter; that does not occur here.I would recommend this to anyone who generally likes these books as well as anyone looking for a substantive discussion of naturalism using the latest science as part of the case-building. An enjoyable read with very few instances which should require extensive background.Reviewed from a copy made available through Goodreads First Reads.
33,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"Very broad and expansive material for the mind! This book is basically a Humanist look at the universe, life and existence through the lens of physics, ontology, biology, Astro physics and quantum mechanics.I can't fool myself into believing that I grasped everything this book lays out for its audience, but it is supremely inspiring and only furthers my thirst to learn more about science. I really enjoyed Sean Carroll's respectful approach to religion. He is admittedly an atheist and very clearly lays out hard to argue claims against creationism and nearly every other argument that religious types tend to have against science, but he does so in a very respectful manner and never once comes off as condescending or full of himself. It was a refreshing and much needed approach for a book like this. You don't convince people by beating them over the head at 'how smart you are, and how dumb they are' for believing in things that are dated, can be factually debunked through science etc. No, you will have much better results by coming to the debate the way Sean does in this book! I absolutely loved this inspiring, fresh, motivating, and educating look at how the things in our universe, earth and life existence, came into being!"
34,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18847122-stany,3,"This book started with strong 5 stars, but as it got longer and longer it digressed from what it should have been about and lost two stars on the way. The parts on fundamental theory of nature, cosmology, the origin of life and complexity were generally very good (albeit with very little new in there). The description of poetic naturalism (what a poor name) is good. Had the author focused more on this, and in particular developed more the ideas of Bayesian statistics on these subjects and how it applies to our credences, I would have kept 5 stars. But suddenly the book suffers a phase transition and becomes a kind of self-help book, talking about caring and feeling, including a list of ‚Äú10 considerations‚Äù to a better life and ending with an anecdote of pancakes with strawberry syrup. So my suggestion is that you read the first 300 pages and the rest you relegate to the self-help shelf."
35,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"I feel bad for talking down this book, but there‚Äôs hardly anything new in it. Sean Carroll is a fine theoretical physicist who also happens to be very well-read in my other areas. In this large book he gives you a summary of modern physics and the naturalistic explanations of things like consciousness and morality, etc. Nothing that you can‚Äôt find elsewhere. His own bit of original contribution is his insistence on what he calls ‚Äúpoetic naturalism‚Äù: that we can have different narratives for the same thing, e.g., consider it a collection of elementary particles subject to the laws of quantum physics, or consider it a human with free will, and these two narratives are not contradicting each other.

Some of it did go way (WAY) over my head but that is hardly the authors fault. So how do I judge the book in the form of a review? The book made me want to read other ""thinkers"" books, so that alone makes this a very good book. The author is able to write in such a way that I was able to enjoy it if not fully comprehend it. "

Thanks to both for fine reviews.I spent more time trying to understand Sean Carroll's ""Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime"" and ultimately gave up on that one too.

The title of the book really says it all - you really get the big picture and find out more about philosophy of science, how the brain works, etc. It gives a lot of little bits of information that might inspire you to look into some of the topics covered in the book more deeply."
39,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,4,"When I finished this book, I made this loud horse-snort sound as I exhaled. You know, where your lips flap and there‚Äôs that, uh, horse-snort thing I just mentioned. And if I knew how to spell the aforementioned sound, that‚Äôs what I would have put down as my first line here. [horsesnort]Not a bad sort of one, by the way, but one that I made because I‚Äôd been thinking so much as I read it. It was a lot to take in, a lot to think about. The past few months for me have been a bit of a whirlwind. It‚Äôs not been bad, just busy. As such, I‚Äôm coming out of a months long stretch of the least amount of reading I think I‚Äôve done as an adult. And what I have been reading, honestly, has been almost entirely non-fiction. The desire to read fiction just went away with a big giant whoosh. I‚Äôm sure it will come back. I‚Äôve got a tbr pile with hundreds of books on it, and half are fiction. I‚Äôll read whatever I want to next, and at some point, the mood will strike again. So anyway, I‚Äôm in the midst of a pretty hardcore attempt by some family members to convert me to their religion. And I mean, really hardcore. I honestly enjoy the conversations, so it‚Äôs not a burden for me. I enjoy pointing out the logical fallacies (as I see them) in their arguments and occasionally realizing I might need to rethink a position of my own (that latter part doesn‚Äôt happen very often, but this conversion thing has been going on with me for the better part of two years now, I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve not quite got everything figured out). I do find it occasionally frustrating that when we touch on a topic, once their argument appears to be exposed as flawed they tend to move on to a different topic (as opposed to conceding the point). The reason I get frustrated by it is because they‚Äôll want to bring up the same argument again in a later conversation, or worse, use it as an axiom on the next point they want to make. So, whatever. As I‚Äôve seen it, arguments for converting to their faith (when it‚Äôs not just bible-quoting) falls into two main domains:‚Ä¢	Cosmological (look at the beauty/complexity/wonder of nature‚Ä¶ Therefore, I should convert to their faith)‚Ä¢	Moral (how can you know right and wrong without God to point it out? I should totally convert now)Now, I‚Äôm not saying they do this on purpose, it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve noticed. And It‚Äôs also fine, those are valid questions to ask. This book, much to my surprise, is sort of a take on the second category of questioning. I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what I was getting when I picked this book up. Sean Carroll is a physicist who described a near death experience he had in the opening pages of the book. This book appears to be his means of sort of figuring out his (and our) place in the universe. It‚Äôs a systematic look at what we think we know about how the universe works, how we know it, how reliable that knowledge is, and what the implications mean. He makes some bold statements, and seems willing to stand by them (essentially, he states we can confidently rule out the supernatural as a real thing, and no future discoveries will invalidate that stance ‚Äì he does this fully aware of how the hubris of scientists making other proclamations has been a source of embarrassment later). But he holds fast to that, nonetheless. He then works into how we can derive morality without there being an objective Godlike entity making it clear. So, that‚Äôs basically the book. It‚Äôs big, and he takes small bites in each chapter to build his arguments. I think it was well thought out, and clearly written. It wasn‚Äôt a page turning read, but I was always interested. And when someone asked me what the book was about when I was two thirds of the way through it, I had to honestly say that I wasn‚Äôt sure, but it was great. It didn‚Äôt become clear to me until I was nearly done where he was heading with all this (maybe if I‚Äôd read the jacket on the book cover first). This is written in the spirit of Carl Sagan, and upon finishing it, it made me want to go back and re-read some of his more seminal works. Carl did, after all, shape my worldview more than any single person on this planet ‚Äì aside perhaps my mother. So, I ordered one of Carl‚Äôs books off the internet (I gave away all my other copies) and will probably be revisiting that soon."

But I'm gonna give this +1 more star than I gave the Grand Design simply because it was more engaging and I think I learned much more from this one and researched far more shit than the other one. Oh well..  Not that THIS one was the easiest thing ever, while I was indeed searching for words and meanings on a bunch of stuff cuz English is not my native language (duh), everything was clearly explainable and understandable as easy as possible. This is what's inside basically:Modern science can't yet explain everything about the universe or the human mind (duh-doy) there's a bunch of shit we do know (DUH) because of science (DUUUUHHHH). The laws of physics and a bunch of other scientific shit have given us a great deal of insight and explanations to nearly everything around us, from why the Earth orbits around the sun, to why pseudo-scientific theories, like telekinesis (yaaay Jean Grey) or teleportation *BAMF* or a bunch of other superhero stuff are just bullshit. But well, if we zoom out and look at the bigger picture , by applying scientific thinking we can also shed light on questions that have baffled us for ages. Like how time works, how complexity arises out of order and what the mind is made of. What I liked was the chapters about the theoretical Particle X, was a nice brain-scratcher and with a bunch of what-ifs, and well sure that was all imagination and shit but true to theory and understandable.And the chapter about Aristotle was quite good and true to the source, from what I can remember about reading Aristotle back in the days of wanting to read about our people of yore. But yeah, Aristotle basically said what scientists are saying in the last couple of years, with a simple example (taken from the book) ""if you put a book over a table, the book itself cannot move by itself unless there's a force that makes it move"". That basically tells us that nothing that's stable can move on its own or create something by itself, and Aristotle's theory was that, when we push something or react to something ( the author here uses the term causality formula which is taken from a scientific term of course ) we create something out of it, which is how the world came to be. That something made someone do something so that's how evolution came to be. Someone had to do something, something made the homo-whateverous to stand on his feet, to go hunt to eat to shit to fuck to go out of the water and stop being amphibious or whateverious.SO... we come to the conclusion that SOMETHING had to HAPPEN for the universe to just START. Someone HAD to make SOMETHING for the universe to be created, and well, Aristotle's theory was that THAT something/someone was simply.. yeah you guessed it... God. Anyway, nice book and yeah, I wrote a lot for a review. Fuck. What the hell is wrong with me. I'm going to read some Batman now to clear my head from all this nonsense. "
41,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16886290-irma-ravkic,4,"This book is tricky to review because there are so many ideas in there. What I love about it is that it talks about the everyday phenomena of human life and the universe, but at a different angle, of a poetic naturalist. Poetic naturalism is a type of naturalism which encourages a variety of ways to talk about the world, using language dependent upon the aspect of reality being discussed. It acknowledges that the methods and terms used within one domain may not be coherent with those of another domain, yet both can be considered valid representations of reality. It gives this different view of nature combining all of the science, statistics (Bayesian reasoning) and neuroscience - showing how they sometimes seem to disagree, but at a deeper level just represent different ways of talking about things. One of the main topics of the book is that we have the world we currently have because of the way the universe was initially created: the principle of increasing entropy. That principle is visible in all the aspects of our lives: birth, living, dying. This process is not present only on Earth, but in the entire Universe. What I also liked is the discussion of so-called emergence. We often attribute purpose and meaning to our human nature. The traditional view is that the universe is created FOR us. (The book also discusses the emergence of religion). But then he analyses how universe is just there, its processes are determined in the early age of the universe, and everything else is emergent from those processes, including us and our consciousness. The human is a side story relevant only to us and from the view of the Universe, we're just helping to increase its entropy. This he views as something positive and nothing to be depressed about. We should be lucky we're here despite all odds. One nice quote in the book explains that attitude. It was written for Sceptical Inquirer by Carl Sagan's wife Ann Druyan, after he died. This excerpt is a personal note at the end of the piece ‚Äî as good a summary of how naturalists view the preciousness of life as you‚Äôll find anywhere:""When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me-it still sometimes happens-and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don‚Äôt ever expect to be reunited with Carl. But, the great thing is that when we were together, for nearly twenty years, we lived with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is. We never trivialized the meaning of death by pretending it was anything other than a final parting. Every single moment that we were alive and we were together was miraculous-not miraculous in the sense of inexplicable or supernatural. We knew we were beneficiaries of chance. . . . That pure chance could be so generous and so kind. . . . That we could find each other, as Carl wrote so beautifully in Cosmos, you know, in the vastness of space and the immensity of time. . . . That we could be together for twenty years. That is something which sustains me and it‚Äôs much more meaningful. . . . The way he treated me and the way I treated him, the way we took care of each other and our family, while he lived. That is so much more important than the idea I will see him someday. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever see Carl again. But I saw him. We saw each other. We found each other in the cosmos, and that was wonderful."""
42,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6309342-bruce,4,"I‚Äôm fascinated by the idea that we‚Äôre here and we don‚Äôt know why. The Big Picture delves into the big questions of life, the universe, and everything from the perspective of a physicist. Sean Carroll is one of my favorite physicists, and I have read some of his other books and listened to many of his lectures on particle physics and the cosmos. Carroll attacked the big question from the viewpoint of particle physics, molecular biology, astrophysics, and mathematics. He employed bayesian reasoning, including a long chapter detailing the statistical method which I mostly skipped over. He challenged the religious idea of a soul or a spirit by referring to Rene Descarte, who believed the soul was located in the pineal gland. He wasn‚Äôt making fun of religion. Rather, he was illustrating the question seriously as a scientist. If there is a connection between human beings and another realm, how does that connection work? Where in the body does that connection take place? Carroll promoted an idea he calls poetic naturalism. Sure, we are simply a collection of protons, neutrons, and electrons that obey certain physical laws. The purpose of life might be to oxygenate carbon, but we can describe such reactions in beautiful and poetic language. I dunno. If you‚Äôre looking for the latest in physics, math, and biology, this book is very good. If you‚Äôre looking for answers on the big questions, not so much. In the end, The Big Picture doesn‚Äôt really offer anything for my original question. I‚Äôm probably pretty silly for thinking it might. "
43,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,4,"The book is very interesting and thought provoking. It delves into the majority of philosophical questions with which mankind has been struggling. They key element of this book is that it looks at this questions from the perspective of scientist, combining empirical evidence, logical argumentation, and Bayesian thinking‚Äîculminating in poetic naturalism.Overall, I learned a lot from this book, and I found it delightfully stimulating at many points. My only qualm about the book is it has parts that are not so engaging, giving too many examples, or taking too long to make a point. I would not describe it as a superb piece of writing, but it is definitely worth the time and effort."
44,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,2,"At times, this book feels like Sean Carroll‚Äôs imitation of Icarus flying. He jumps from subject to subject, discipline to discipline, making his case for his so-called ‚Äòpoetic naturalism‚Äô as an all-encompassing worldview or something close to an admittedly temporary theory of everything. On that front, I‚Äôd say he kind of blew it. Poetic naturalism comes off as a pretentious turn of phrase instead of anything more substantive. He also sets up tons of straw men throughout the book when he disagrees with some school of thought or some thinker in particular. With that said, he‚Äôs clearly still a competent scientist and mostly clear communicator so there‚Äôs plenty of great information to glean here. In other words, the trees are all lovely, it‚Äôs the forest that‚Äôs unsightly."
45,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"This is an excellent book that hearkens back to the early times when philosophy was the only science. The author tries to explain all the amazing new theories of life, the universe, and everything in the most scientific terms but with a philosophical twist. He says a better way to think about the universe is that it is made up not of things, but of stories, and that there are ‚Äúplanets of belief‚Äù where our beliefs are like planets aligning to each other in the void. He expounds on the principle of ‚Äúemergence,‚Äù where things take on new and different aspects and meaning as we look at them at higher levels; and phase transitions (like solid ice melting to liquid form and then boiling off as a gas.) The author tells us about these things citing many scientists and philosophers from the past and present. The book is written in short chapters which makes it easier to contemplate, with big sections. The last 2 sections (Thinking and Caring) contemplate the nature of consciousness, and expound on a philosophy of living life. I enjoyed this book even if I struggled with the deep science. The one thing I don‚Äôt think the author accomplished (he may not have been trying to accomplish it, it‚Äôs hard to tell) is to convince a religious person that the universe is devoid of God. Other than that, this is a fantastic book well worth the effort."

47,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,0,"First let me say this is the best book I have read in a while. I admit to already being a Sean Carroll fan, having read his very eloquent books ""From Eternity To Here"" and ""The Particle at The End Of the Universe"", as well as taking his Video Courses on 'Dark Matter Dark Energy', 'Modern Mysteries of Physics - Time', and 'The Higgs Boson and Beyond'. I have also watched many of his talks and lectures on YouTube, and I follow him on Twitter and frequently read his blog site Preposterous Universe (http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/b...).In his new book The Big Picture, Sean Carroll encapsulates the human journey of discovery of the natural world, the epistemology of how we know what we know, the effectiveness of using the scientific method to test hypothesis and develop and strengthen our theories, and how it all affects us as conscious creatures travelling on a little dot in the cosmos.No stone is left unturned as Carroll discusses the entire gambit of human intellectual pursuit: physics, chemistry, biology, neurology, cosmology, psychology, religion, consciousness, free will, etc... all the while updating the reader on the latest developments in each discipline. This book basically outlines the educational journey I have taken in the past few years reading strictly non-fiction science-themed books to learn about these topics and how they apply to the ""meaning of it all"". Carroll says we as humans have a strong predilection to assign agency and meaning to the universe and the happenings within (the guiding force behind organized religions), but he concludes that the only real ""meaning"" in life is intrinsic and we only have an average of ""3-billion heartbeats"" to determine what the meaning is before we are gone (and yes, Carroll joins me in the belief that death is final, and ""now"" is all we have).Through an approach he coins ""Poetic Naturalism"", Carroll lucidly shows how discoveries and enhancements in the past couple of hundred years has changed how we view our world:""Naturalism is a philosophy according to which there is only one world ‚Äî the natural world, which exhibits unbroken patterns (the laws of nature), and which we can learn about through hypothesis testing and observation. In particular, there is no supernatural world ‚Äî no gods, no spirits, no transcendent meanings. I like to talk about a particular approach to naturalism, which can be thought of as Poetic. By that I mean to emphasize that, while there is only one world, there are many ways of talking about the world. ‚ÄúWays of talking‚Äù shouldn't be underestimated; they can otherwise be labelled ‚Äútheories‚Äù or ‚Äúmodels‚Äù or ‚Äúvocabularies‚Äù or ‚Äústories,‚Äù and if a particular way of talking turns out to be sufficiently accurate and useful, the elements in its corresponding vocabulary deserve to be called real.""The best part about this book is it is ENJOYABLE to read. You don't need a degree in theoretical physics to understand the concepts (but Carroll does include an appendix that breaks down what he calls ""The Equation Underlying You and Me""). However, a lot of ground gets covered. In Part One he sets the stage, seeing how discoveries in science have revealed a universe that runs under unbreakable, impersonal laws of nature. In Part Two he thinks about how to conceptualize such a universe: how to learn about it (Bayesian inference, abduction) and how to talk about it (emergence and overlapping theoretical vocabularies). In Part Three he gets down and dirty with quantum mechanics, the Core Theory, and effective field theories. In Part Four he starts down the road of connecting to our macroscopic world, seeing how complexity and life can arise due to the arrow of time. In Part Five he discusses the leading challenge to a physicalist worldview: the existence of consciousness. And in Part Six he recognizes that the universe isn't going to tell us how to behave, and acknowledges that the creation of meaning and purpose is ultimately our job.I loved this book. Carroll takes his reader by the hand, explaining how we know what we know about the natural world by telling the story of human scientific discovery and why it matters today. This book should be added as mandatory reading in our educational curriculum and belongs among the great scientific intellectual works of Carl Sagan, Stephen Hawking, Lawrence Krauss, Daniel Dennett, Michael Shermer, and Richard Dawkins to name a few. Five stars... Highly recommended!"
48,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38819471-marek-winiarz,4,"Book Review The Big Picture by Sean CarrollThis was my first genuinely philosophical book in many years, albeit based on physics and the observable universe. It is an ambitious book, a book about life, the universe and everything . (Of course Douglas Adams answered this question in his groundbreaking book ""Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy."" The answer to life, the universe and everything is 42. Carroll tries to go a little deeper.)In keeping with the spirit of the Unified Field Theory ‚Äì naturalism ‚Äì it postulates that the entire universe can be fully described by quantifying the state of every atom in the universe. That may be literally true, but it‚Äôs not a practical or even a possible exercise. And since atoms do not have consciousness or emotions, this kind of description misses a large portion of our experience entirely. Hence the concept of ‚Äúpoetic naturalism‚Äù. The poetic part adds those descriptions that are undoubtedly true cannot be quantified by atoms alone: feelings, colors, life, consciousness‚Ä¶ This is where philosophy gets added in.Parts of the book are easy to accept even if some of the quantum physics is difficult to comprehend. Let‚Äôs say that we understand the physics after the Big Bang and the subsequent universe expansion. (There is even an equation for the Core Theory in the appendix ‚Äì with the caveat that it‚Äôs still incomplete, blah, blah, blah).The middle of the book, where understanding and essence are considered, is fascinating. What is real, what is beliefs? Is any of it real? Much of ‚Äúperceived reality‚Äù has changed ‚Äì such as oft-cited example of whether the earth revolves around the sun. And yet the naturalist universe has not changed at all.Some aspects are truly revolutionary. Evolution theory and adaptation are well accepted, supported by empirical observations that can be reproduced. But if correct, why did life begin in the first place? If atoms don‚Äôt have emotions, why do they care if they exist as a collection of inert particles, or coalesce into biological organisms with consciousness and reasoning?This is the first time that I read something that even remotely makes sense on the level of fundamental science. Keep in mind that when asking eternal questions it is unreasonable to expect crisp answers - and to verify their veracity. But some theories are tantalizing, like Michael Russell's that life's purpose is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide. Not the answer you'd expect. (Strictly chemical - no soul). But it fits with basic physics of increasing entropy and reducing energy. (Physical systems seek the lowest possible energy state, that‚Äôs why a golf ball drops into the hole). Examples of other spontaneous organizations in nature are provided.And so it goes. Examples of thought experiments on consciousness and recognition, establishing rules, constructing goodness, and existentialism close the book. These are much more along the lines of ‚Äúclassical‚Äù philosophers, many of whom are cited.To credibly write a book about everything takes courage, I think. The point is not answers to eternal questions, but something for the ‚Äúinner life‚Äù. Indeed I have often wondered what good are philosophical books anyway? These are concepts and ideas to think about as you ponder the incredible you and the universe around you. I found this book fascinating."
49,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43249479-mitch-lindgren,3,"I think I'd need to read through The Big Picture twice to fully absorb all the information in it, but the likelihood of that ever happening is very low given how long it is. I did enjoy it overall, but it covered a lot of complex topics in only cursory detail, and therefore not all of the topics were given the attention they deserve. In particular, I think Carroll was a little to quick to dismiss philosophical positions he disagreed with, and failed to explore their nuances. This is probably inevitable given the scope of the book, and I do think there's value in a book that tries to tie these complicated topics together rather than exploring each in detail but in isolation from the others. However, I think it worked better in the chapters on physics (Carroll's professional expertise) than in the chapters on philosophy. Still, I do think that this is a good book, and with how selective I am about what I read/listen to these days, the fact that I actually finished it despite how long it is is a testament to that."

The book is great nearly through and through: a fascinating and hugely thought-provoking tour of...just about everything. It's only the very last chapters -- to do with the human experience, including ethics and the good life, that disappointed (seeming facile and forced). Not that I disagree with anything they had to say; they were simply enormously less compelling than the rest of the book. Nonetheless, I commend the author for painting on the widest possible canvas, and for the overall brilliance of his exposition. This book is manna for anyone who loves science and ideas. Terrific read."
52,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6953429-elazar,1,"This book is boring, has nothing new to offer, and the author seems to desparately and unsuccessfully prove his personal beliefs."
53,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61557581-behrooz-parhami,5,"I listened to the unabridged MP3 audiobook version of this title (read by the author, Penguin Audio, 2016). A shorter version of this review, posted on May 8, 2018, was expanded three days later, when I found my misplaced notes on the book. The title of this book seems at first to be pretentious and overambitious, but Carroll delivers on its promise. A theoretical physicist by training, Carroll undertakes the nearly impossible task of explaining deep scientific findings, alongside their connections with complex philosophical thoughts about choice, morality, and happiness, in a way that opens up new vistas for the readers/listeners. Carroll, recognized as one of the greatest humanist thinkers of his generation, discusses a wide range of topics in terms of three key concepts of entropy, complexity, and time-arrow, as he takes the reader/listener on a fantastic journey through all that is known about our physical world and spiritual existence.Growing up in a traditional family who went to church every Sunday, Carroll actually enjoyed the minimally invasive religious traditions and rituals. Later, he became a naturalist owing to a couple of important encounters. In this book, Carroll covers a lot of ground, switching effortlessly between discussion of microbiology or information theory, on the scientific side, and entropy, the nature of time, and Bayesian belief theory in philosophy. He reiterates Feyneman‚Äôs contention that almost no one in the world understands quantum physics in full, yet the theory is quite useful in shaping our understanding of the universe. A recurring theme in this book is that we need models at multiple levels of abstraction to make sense of the world around us and to think/talk about it. Trouble arises when we mix these levels and start talking about several of them at once. For example, in the morning, we may go to our clothes closet and ‚Äúchoose‚Äù what to wear to work. We would get in trouble if we simultaneously think about that ‚Äúdecision‚Äù at the atomic level. In a similar vein, we can talk about a gas in terms of the atoms comprising it or we can resort to high-level ‚Äúemergent‚Äù properties such as temperature, pressure, and density. These emergent properties allow us to discuss gases, without dealing with the enormous complexity we would encounter in an atomic-level model. It is in the same sense that talking about emotions, moral values, and free will makes sense, despite the fact that everything is essentially pre-determined. Pascal famously said that what seems like a human-being's free will is really God‚Äôs will, manifesting itself in our decisions. Modern science has replaced ‚ÄúGod‚Äù in Pascal‚Äôs formulation with ‚Äúphysics‚Äù or ‚Äúnature.‚ÄùCarroll emphasizes what he calls ‚Äúpoetic naturalism.‚Äù Naturalism implies the supremacy of nature and its laws, whether known or as yet undiscovered, with no need for God(s) or super-natural phenomena. The ‚Äúpoetic‚Äù qualifier arises from the belief that there are many ways of talking about nature, involving different levels of abstraction and artificially defined notions that have no natural embodiments. When we discuss the world at one of these abstraction levels, there may be problems in connecting things to other levels, but these should not be alarming, as long as the model is internally consistent and serves a useful purpose by offering accurate predictions. So, even though, at a fundamental level, everything is composed of atoms, themselves formed of sub-atomic particles, the artificially created higher-level concepts of stars, planets, and galaxies are quite useful. We can talk about, or even accurately predict, the motion of these massive bodies, without a need to constantly refer to the behavior of many many trillions of atoms that constitute them. Given the laws of physics, we should be able to determine the next state of the universe from its current state, what LaPlace claimed a ‚Äúdemon‚Äù could do, given enough computational resources. And herein lies the paradox: The required computational resources are so immense, that the theoretically possible eventuality is unlikely to materialize.A good chunk of the book‚Äôs later parts is concerned with the nature of, and connections between consciousness, free will, and morality. Carroll imparts ideas in these complex domains through simple and compelling examples. Consider, for example, Mary, a scientist who is confined to a monochrome life, but she isn‚Äôt color-blind and has studied all relevant theories of color and color perception. Now, if Mary is suddenly allowed to go outside and see colorful flowers for the first time, does this experience add something to her knowledge of the world? Carroll argues that even though seeing flowers adds new abilities and memories to Mary‚Äôs life, it does not follow that the universe is more than its physical attributes.So, how do we find meaning in a seemingly purposeless universe? Carroll‚Äôs answer is clever, though perhaps rather unsatisfying. The way in which our lives matter isn‚Äôt a scientific question but can be understood by compiling a list of ‚ÄúTen Considerations‚Äù (in lieu of Commandments). We are free to shape life‚Äôs meaning, individually or collectively.Here is Carroll‚Äôs 63-minute book talk at Google: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x26a-..."
54,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2270881-ken-rideout,4,"A big ramble of a book which really does measure up to its title as he dives deep into just about everything. He claims to be advocating for a new philosophy called ""poetic naturalism"" but it seems to me that he just is expanding on standard naturalist humanism but in a kindler, gentler way. He doesn't deny theism, he just points out systematically that it is a statistically unlikely explanation of how we came to be.Some insights that really struck me:-Science and religion should not be treated separately. If science is about seeking the true nature of the universe, then religious claims should be thought about and considered just like all ideas of how the universe works. Looking for answers where there are none is most likely just the result of how we have memories of past events enabling us to construct a chain of apparent cause-and-effects due to ""the second law of thermodynamics and in particular to the fact that entropy used to be low in the past."" [indeed that is the answer to why time has a direction] (p. 59)-In thinking about a Universe that has a beginning in time and perhaps came from nothing, consider this amazing fact: all the conserved quantities (e.g. energy, momentum, charge) actually sum to zero as best we can tell! (p. 200)-In science, we tend to focus on what we don't understand but, in actual fact, we understand so much of how the universe works (and have tested our theories about how particles interact so thoroughly) that there is really no room for supernatural effects. Even if and when our Core theories (quantum field theory + general relativity) are superseded by a better theory in the future, our current model will still hold up in our domains of space and time because experiments tell us so. ""The laws of physics underlying everyday life are completely known."" (p. 191).-We have an answer to what underlying reality is made of: ""the fermion and boson fields of the Core Theory."" (p. 176) -I never understood the natural relationship between entropy and complexity before: ""That's us. Ephemeral patterns of complexity, riding a wave of increasing entropy from simple beginnings to a simple end. We should enjoy the ride."" (p. 236) He uses the metaphor of stirring cream into coffee and how the intermediate, mixing state is the interesting, complex one rather than the beginning or end states.- Why we remember the past but don't remember the future if the direction of time is a construct: Since entropy was lower in the past we can pin down the past: ""When a feature of our current state implies... something about the past, that's a memory; when a feature of our current state implies something about the future, that's a cause of some future effect."" (p. 380) We are actually making decisions in a certain sense because our thoughts are so far removed from the predictability of the laws of physics: In principle our decisions are predictable, but none of us knows the exact state of all the particles in our brains: ""The unavoidable reality of our incomplete knowledge is responsible for why we find it useful to talk about the future using a language of choice and causation."" (p. 380)-Consciousness is not an illusion but neither is it anything so special; our intuition tells us that consciousness must be more than a purely physical process but our intuition ""as science keeps reminding us"" leads us astray (p. 354). Our mental experiences are ""not separate things, but instead are useful parts of certain stories we tell about ordinary physical things...""-Over and over again, he points out that much confusion arises from our muddy use of language from one domain (say quantum mechanics) to another (like human thought). To each domain its own language. The existence of quarks does not negate the utility of the chemist referring to an object called a 'nucleus'. -Life is a process, not a state. That's why it's central to life (and the universe) to be born and to die. Processes have beginnings and ends. (p. 420) Seeing the universe as it actual is takes hard work but better to concentrate on having a good story to tell at the end of your life rather than trying to be in a state of happiness all the time (p. 426). Although the universe doesn't give it to us, we can bring ""meaning and mattering into the world"" (p. 431) so the lack of an afterlife or a divine purpose need not be a downer. "
55,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2167338-david-agranoff,5,"I was overdue for reading this book, earlier in the year I discovered Sean Carrol's podcast Mindscape. I enjoy the podcast quite a bit. It is basically this super smart Caltech theoretical physicist talking to other smart people. The episodes are hit or miss for me depending on the guest but when I saw the title of this book I knew I have to read it. I love cosmology and the big picture, I know I understand these things better than I should. One of the highlights of my year was when Dr. Brian Keating in my Dickheads interview with him told me I had missed my calling as physicist. Yeah the whole sucking at math thing prevented that, but I love thinking about these cosmic issues. Dr. Keating himself called this book ""Poetry for Physicists"", and the writing is indeed very deep and profound. Carrol tackles the meaning of life from basic thought to the creation of the universe. To say this book is mind expanding is really selling the experience short. It is funny to me that books that explore history, culture and politics are often called must reads, and yet most books that explore the very existence and meaning of life from a scientific perspective rarely are. Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking might be the last time, but unlike that book I think the Big Picture is much easier book to get a handle on. This book has better chance to be understood if people give it the chance. Sean Carrol not only explains the science, but gives it relatable human meaning. ‚ÄúPoetic naturalism is a philosophy of freedom and responsibility. The raw materials of life are given to us by the natural world, and we must work to understand them and accept the consequences. The move from description to prescription, from saying what happens to passing judgment on what should happen, is a creative one, a fundamentally human act. The world is just the world, unfolding according to the patterns of nature, free of any judgmental attributes. The world exists; beauty and goodness are things that we bring to it.‚Äù Keep in mind that the chapter on Poetic Naturalism begins with a discussion of the Richard Matheson written episode of Star Trek the Enemy Within and the ethic of cloning via the Transporter. That is more fun than sticking to straight forward academic theory. That was the first of several parts that took the book to a different level for me. Some times it is something fun like that then other times it was intense ideas.Even when I disagreed with him I liked that he got me thinking... ‚ÄúThe trick is to think of life as a process rather than a substance. When a candle is burning, there is a flame that clearly carries energy. When we put the candle out, the energy doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúgo‚Äù anywhere. The candle still contains energy in its atoms and molecules. What happens, instead, is that the process of combustion has ceased. Life is like that: it‚Äôs not ‚Äústuff‚Äù; it‚Äôs a set of things happening. When that process stops, life ends.‚ÄùWhen the candle flame is put out the smell of the wax often floats in the room, I refuse to believe that when the process of our bodies stops that the things that make up our spirit ends. I like that this book prompted me to think so intensely on the subject. After all this science the Big Picture ends with a very human chapter. ‚ÄúThe idea of ‚ÄúTen Commandments‚Äù is a deeply compelling one. It combines two impulses that are ingrained in our nature as human beings: making lists of ten things, and telling other people how to behave.‚Äù So instead Carrol ends with Ten Considerations number 9 really struck a chord with me. ""We can do better than Happines."" Creativity, art, knowledge, activism. Your existence in this massive universe is kinda of a miracle, and there is nothing spiritual about that. I am talking cold rational science. You are damn lucky to be here, and damn lucky to have a cool book like this to prompt how you think about that universe. Yeah read this one."
56,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24846552-ruth,4,"Review of ‚ÄòThe Big Picture‚ÄôThis book deals with the questions I've always had myself, and I found it very engaging. They are big questions, and it may seem presumptuous to want to answer them, but I am glad he took the trouble to try.That said, I did feel often that the author was a little too sure of everything he posited. It's quite bizarre to see him quoting a long list of people from history who all said that now we knew nearly everything and then were proven wrong, only to continue to say that this time we really do know nearly everything. So I'm not all that impressed with the answers he provides, but he did a good job explaining all the questions and pitfalls, laying out the landscape of what we need to take into account if we want to speak sensibly about reality and meaning. The book lays out this landscape of where the questions lie, in six parts: Cosmos, Understanding, Essence, Complexity, Thinking and Caring. All parts composed of several chapters explaining the questions one might have on these topics, and background information on what others have already said about them. All very informative, and lively written. Sean isn't afraid to be personal and share his own journey through these questions, I appreciate that. Part 1, Cosmos, deals with the nature of reality, and time, and questions about what causes things. It‚Äôs a bit introductory, he explains his own vision of ‚Äòpoetic naturalism‚Äô. I nearly stopped at the first chapter, because this was the most presumptuous in my opinion, stating things like ‚Äòwe now know nearly everything‚Äô.In part 2, about Understanding, he engages in the questions of how we can know what we think we know. A question that has always bothered me as well. Especially his chapter ‚ÄòPlanets of Belief‚Äô explained beautifully how we can build a whole consistent system of thoughts, feeling safe there, and then, all of a sudden (or slowly growing) we can find that there is some inconsistency, making us feel as if our foundations are shattered. I found the recognition in this chapter very comforting.Part 3, Essence, deals with body and soul. Very intriguing topic, but here I felt that he broke his own rules, and mixed the various layers of meaning. He was too obviously out to prove that no such thing as a soul can exist. However I did really appreciate the background information he gave on the correspondence between princess Elisabeth Palatinate and Descartes.In part 4, about Complexity, he engages in depth with the various arguments that have been brought forward by the advocates of ‚Äòintelligent design‚Äô. This part was especially convincing to me, since he uses arguments from the field of computer algorithms, which is a topic I know very well. These chapters were eye-openers to me, making me ponder once more what (if any) is the difference between our soul and artificial intelligence, and how I would go about describing that.Part 5 deals with Consciousness, which is the most interesting topic in my point of view. He explained how some people have called this ‚Äòthe hard problem‚Äô, but if I understand him correctly, he himself thinks it isn‚Äôt a problem at all, since consciousness isn‚Äôt a real thing. (Here I disagree)Part 6 deals with Caring, this is the part that becomes most personal and less consistent with the rest of the book, I think. But I appreciated that he tackled this topic as well.So, with this ‚Äòbig picture‚Äô in mind, I now have some new starting points in my own thought process, especially on the topic of consciousness, which is indeed (I think), the hard problem. As I said, I think I disagree with the author, but I‚Äôm at loss for words on how to explain where exactly I differ. I do think that whether or not you believe in consciousness is very much related to your faith in God. I think it is no coincidence that Augustine called our consciousness God‚Äôs Image in us. As a first, more personal, reaction I wrote a prayer to God with my questions raised by this book. It's on my blog: Dear God."

The finitude of life lends poignancy to our situations. Each of us will have a last word we say, a last book we read, a last time we fall in love. At each moment, who we are and how we behave is a choice that we individually make. The challenges are real; the opportunities are incredible.Humanity has always imagined ways that life might continue on after our bodily deaths. None of them holds up very well under close examination. What the stories fail to account for is that change, including death, isn‚Äôt an optional condition to be avoided; it‚Äôs an integral part of life itself. You don‚Äôt really want to live forever. Eternity is longer than you think. Life ends, and that‚Äôs part of what makes it special. What exists is here, in front of us, what we can see and touch and affect. Our lives are not dress rehearsals in which we plan and are tested in anticipation of the real show to come.

If we admit that we can always be mistaken, it makes sense to open our minds to our fellow human beings to hear what they have to say. We all have our biases, so getting a bit of outside perspective isn‚Äôt a bad thing. If purpose and morality aren‚Äôt out there to be discovered, we might be able to learn something from our compatriots in the ongoing creation of meaning.our lives are to have meaning and purpose, we are going to have to create them. And people are different, so they‚Äôre going to create different things. That‚Äôs a feature to be celebrated, not an annoyance to be eradicated. Much of what has been written about the quest to lead a meaningful life has been produced by people who (1) enjoy thinking deeply and carefully about such things, and (2) enjoy writing down what they have thought about. Consequently, we see certain kinds of virtues celebrated: imagination, variety, passion, artistic expression. And these are all worth celebrating. But a fulfilled life might alternatively be characterized by reliability, obedience, honor, contentment. Some might find fulfillment in devoting their efforts to helping others; others will concentrate on their own daily practice of being.We Can Do Better Than Happiness.The mistake we make in putting emphasis on happiness is to forget that life is a process, defined by activity and motion, and to search instead for the one perfect state of being. There can be no such state, since change is the essence of life."
58,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98125252-vincent-sels,5,"If only everyone on the planet read this book... :)Carroll introduces 'poetic naturalism' as a framework of thought, to construct a coherent, open-minded, critical world view (or 'planet of belief' as he calls it), based on the scientific method and Bayesian inference; which allows room for higher-level concepts where such abstractions make sense, such as 'love', 'goals' or 'free will'. Get the gist of it on his blog: https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/... or on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big...I've always shared this world view, without knowing whether there was a name for it. I think it's actually incredible that there wasn't a name for it yet before Carroll coined this *poetic* naturalism, as I think it'll be difficult for anyone to disprove it; i.e. you could say this worldview is really the only sensible one - I'd be really interested in discussing this!Throughout the book he applies this philosophy to all aspects of reality and lays out the consequences.If you've heard his podcasts and/or read his blog, there won't be that much new in here for you. In fact, if you've read a bit about all of the touched upon domains and 'layers of emergence' (physics, biology, philosophy, psychology, morality), Carroll probably won't introduce a lot of new concepts or ideas that you haven't heard of before. He doesn't go much further than the classic real-life or thought experiments.But at sketching the big picture, the book is sublime. It's incredibly well written, with a lot of humor, well-structured in 6 parts, 50 shorts chapters, divided in paragraphs, which allow you to process through it quickly. Sketching a 'theory of everything' in 430 pages will always be challenging indeed, and he inevitably had to make some choices which will disappoint some people. For instance, I'd have loved it if he had gone into a bit more detail on how the scientific method works; whereas I think he might have gone on a bit too often about Bayesian inference. Or, I think that in the part about morality, chapters on politics, ideologies and maybe even economy wouldn't have been misplaced. He chose not to mention any of those concepts.I really wonder though if the book would be able to convince anyone who's not already convinced of poetic naturalism. As he finishes his book: it does take a bit of courage and effort to be open to it. One has to fight through quite some cognitive dissonance to fundamentally update his or her world view. It would be interesting though to see how religious or spiritual people react to the book... I'm definitely planning on putting it to the test! ;)"
59,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22113748-dierregi,3,"Given the subject matter (everything) the structure of this book is the first thing to praise: each topic is explained in short paragraphs that compose short chapters and make the rather difficult content easier to digest.Carroll explains that his approach is based on ""poetic naturalism"", those most relevant feature is accepting that there are different narratives of the world, the terms of one domain not necessarily coherent with another, but all valid representations of reality.I find it easy to go along with this approach and equally easy to accept that the universe exists without any ""reason"". Also that life is compatible with some of the universe physical structure, again for no particular reason.However, I would have liked a clear explanation of the arrow of time. Given that it is an unsolved general physic question, perhaps a good explanation is difficult to provide. Unfortunately, after having finished this book, I know as little as before. On the other hand, I got plenty of explanations about the Core Theory and quantum physic.Everything can be explained by quantum physic and what cannot be explained now will probably be, at some stage in the future. Which is perhaps true, but very similar to saying ""have faith in quantum"", when faith is definitely out of the picture.Once we move from the universe to humankind - and especially to the problem of consciousness - things start to crumble. Apparently, quantum cannot explain why we think about thinking, the best theory being that life is a dynamic process moving towards entropy (read: death) and a living organism conscious and in motion has better chances of spreading its genes... Carroll is very clear about the fact that consciousness is still to be understood, just like the reasons why there's so much variety of life on Earth are unclear. We just have to accept that those are the facts.One of the last chapters tackle the sticky problem of ethics and it is the part I liked better. Carroll rejects moral relativism in favour of moral constructivism. The fact that moral rules are invented by humans does not make them any less real, just like the rules to play football. If we all agree to follow the same rules to play our game together to the best enjoyment and results for everybody, the world could be a better place - perhaps...Finally, Carroll is not a rabid atheist, explaining that he had a mild religious upbringing and eventually decided that a godless universe made more sense. That is refreshing, compared to many atheists who tend to be quite fanatic with their non-belief. To me this just proves that human nature is tragically tribal and at present that the""atheist"" tribe is strong enough to start its own Inquisition. That could be poetic naturalism's irony.Despite some sparkles here and there I did not enjoy this book, nor I found it particularly useful. However, I acknowledge the amount of work, the structure and the divulgative attempt, hence the three stars. Perhaps the picture was just too big to tackle..."
60,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"The physicist as philosopher.This is an enormously ambitious book, infused with an admirable passion and a formidable intellect. Professor Carroll, who is a Cal Tech physicist by trade and one heck of a philosopher by inclination, attempts to reconcile the scientific truth that we are ‚Äúmere matter in motion‚Äù (p. 14) with our psychological need to believe we are something grander.Some observations:‚ÄúWhy are we here?‚Äù is not a question for a physicist. Nor is it a question for a philosopher. It‚Äôs a question for a poet. The belief that such a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù question can be answered presupposes some belief in purpose. In no equation, in no observation, in no result of an experiment will you find purpose except as put there by humans. Purpose is an anthropological notion. And so, it is as the poet said, ‚ÄúWe are here as on a darkling plain where ignorant armies clash by night.‚Äù (Matthew Arnold) Or Life ‚Äúis a tale. Told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing.‚Äù (Shakespeare)So, it is not by happenstance that Professor Carroll calls his philosophy ‚Äúpoetic naturalism.‚Äù He knows better than I do that science does not answer ‚Äúwhy‚Äù questions. What he is saying with this idea--for example in the case of free will and in the conflict between a scientific viewpoint and our social and even practical need to believe in free will--is that both viewpoints can be said to be legitimate depending on the frame of reference in which they are expressed. If we‚Äôre in a courtroom free will is a legal fact of life; but if we are neurologists perhaps free will is an oxymoron.Whether a homicidal maniac has free will or not and is responsible for his actions or not is beside the point: he has to be stopped. Whether he should be punished or whether heroes should be rewarded has nothing to do with whether we have free will or not. The homicidal maniac should be punished so as to deter others from behaving in a similar manner; heroes should be rewarded in order to encourage others to heroic action.But wait! If we don‚Äôt have free will how can others act in accordance with doing the good and avoiding the bad? The answer is, with or without free will they will be influenced to do what is right and avoid what is wrong by societal forces acting both from within and from without.While poetic naturalism may be a felicitous way of talking it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that in a scientific sense free will is an absurdity. What Carroll is doing is glossing over the truth for social and perhaps political lubrication. If we adopt his position (and I think we should) we don‚Äôt have to be concerned with some awkward truths. Some more observations:Carroll writes: ‚ÄúThe Big Bang itself, as predicted by general relativity, is a moment in time, not a location in space.‚Äù (p. 51) I realize that physicists use the term ‚Äútime‚Äù as a way of talking. Einstein himself did even though he made it clear that time does not by itself exist. Better here I think would be ‚Äú‚Ä¶is an undefined event, not a location in space.‚Äù He says as much in the next paragraph when he notes that the Big Bang is ‚Äúmost likely, not real‚Ä¶‚Äù but ‚Äúis a prediction of general relativity.‚ÄùIn the same paragraph beginning with ‚ÄúThe Big Bang itself‚Äù Carroll writes the Big Bang ‚Äúwould be the moment prior to which there were no moments: no space, no time.‚Äù I think he means ‚Äúsubsequent‚Äù not ‚Äúprior.‚ÄùCarroll asks (p.90) ‚ÄúHow do you know you‚Äôre not a brain in a vat, or a character in some more advanced being‚Äôs video game?‚Äù He answers, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt. You can‚Äôt.‚Äù Two pages later Carroll brings up philosopher Nick Bostrom‚Äôs contention that ‚Äúit‚Äôs more likely we are living in a simulation than directly in the ‚Äòreal world.‚Äô‚Äù Carroll explains, ‚ÄúThe idea is essentially that it‚Äôs easy for a technologically advanced civilization to run powerful computer simulations, including simulated people, so most ‚Äòpeople‚Äô in the universe are most likely part of such simulations.‚ÄùHow to fight against cognitive biases? Ask yourself ‚ÄúDo you want something to be true? That should count against it in your assignment of credences, not for it. Does new, credible evidence seem incompatible with your worldview? We should give it extra consideration, not toss it aside.‚Äù (p. 121)In talking about an ‚Äúantirealist‚Äù approach to quantum mechanics, Carroll contends that Niels Bohr believed that ‚ÄúThere is no quantum world. There is only an abstract physical description. It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature.‚Äù (p. 167)This is similar to one of my favorite ideas, namely that humans can never find ultimate truth but, as in an ever-widening sphere, gain more and more knowledge and understanding.On page 219 Carroll makes the point that life is ‚Äúa process rather than a substance.‚Äù (Also see page 2.) He adds, ‚ÄúLife is a way of talking about a particular sequence of events taking place among atoms and molecules arranged in the right way.‚Äù Incidentally ‚Äúa way of talking‚Äù is an expression and idea central to this book. Some things in our experience and understanding are for all we can prove just ‚Äúa way of talking.‚Äù Carroll‚Äôs point is that a way of talking can be very important.A sly joke: ‚ÄúMars is the only known planet to be inhabited solely by robots.‚Äù (p. 238)When Carroll writes about consciousness (I‚Äôm thinking of the ‚Äúneuristor‚Äù thought experiment on page 342) he fails to define consciousness. He writes on the next page that ‚ÄúWe should judge a conception of what consciousness really is on the basis of whether is provides a useful way of talking about the world‚Ä¶‚Äù In my book ‚ÄúThe World Is Not as We Think It Is‚Äù I give a three-part definition of consciousness that allows us to ‚Äútalk‚Äù more effectively about consciousness. At least I hope so. Understanding consciousness is another matter. It may be that it is so difficult that we could compare it to the difficulty a two-dimensional creature would have in understanding or appreciating the three-dimensional world.As noted above Carroll‚Äôs stance on free will is a bit slippery. On page 393 he avers that ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt slaves to our desires; we have the capacity to reflect on them and strive to change them.‚Äù I would say, ‚ÄúYes, IF that is our desire.‚ÄùOn page 411 Carroll seems to agree‚Äîagain it‚Äôs a bit slippery. He quotes David Hume: ‚ÄúReason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions.‚Äù (Read ‚Äúdesires are.‚Äù) Carroll goes on to say that we ‚Äú‚Ä¶are the raw materials from which morals are constructed. Judging what is good and what is not is a quintessentially human act., and we need to face up to that reality.‚Äù In other words, our morality comes from our desires or passions. He notes that ‚Äúother people might not pass judgments in the same way we do.‚Äù --Dennis Littrell, author of ‚ÄúHard Science and the Unknowable‚Äù"

The go-to answer is 42, a brilliant Douglas Adams quip that lampoons the expectation of an easy answer to such a weighty and unspecific query. And yet, that's exactly the question theoretical physicist Sean Carroll has tackled in ""The Big Picture"" (subtitle: ""On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself""). If you've ever wondered how a naturalist views the world, it's all here: from the minute actions of quantum fields to the final state of the entire universe, with all the messy business of evolving life, consciousness and purpose along the way. It's an entire worldview in a book. The worldview is that of what Carroll calls the ""poetic naturalist"": someone who accepts everything science has to tell us about the underlying physics that govern the actions of everything we see, and yet allows for multiple explanatory frameworks and language at coarser levels, as long as they are consistent with our underlying knowledge. It is only when we try to make causal statements or mix language across frameworks that we get ourselves into trouble, and confusion.Carroll is a patient, friendly and gifted explainer who wastes no time as he builds from one concept to the next. You'll learn about the arrow of time, entropy, quantum physics and the Core Theory, reality, belief, uncertainty, abiogenesis, life, death, consciousness, morality, purpose and meaning. What we know and why, and what we don't know and why not. If you already have a good handle on those things, you'll gain some excellent examples, analogies, and ways of explaining all of the above. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone, as I think everyone could benefit from it."
62,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21680009-seth,5,"A surgical dissection of the universe's inner workings with remarkable verbal precision. Carroll captures your imagination instantly, takes you by the brain, and guides you on a journey through the bowels of the cosmos. Aside from awe, there's also wonder. Carroll's earnest curiosity pours out of this book in formidable waves that at first seem daunting, but once the reader learns how to properly ride them, she is naturally swept up, finding herself constantly posing questions and pondering potential answers. The book has a slow, steady build - from foundational logic to particle physics and quantum mechanics, up to organisms and evolution, finishing with morality and meaning. All the while you crest wave after wave as he fleshes out the concept of poetic naturalism - an ontology centered around seeking out the objective truths of how the universe really operates. He makes a convincing case for why poetic naturalism is the best lens through which to search for and discover life's biggest truths, comparing it to a host of other ontologies and using compelling and indelible reasoning to thwart these competing theories. Ultimately the reader will sporadically yet inevitably feel profound moments of existential provocation, helplessly considering her total insignificance in the scope of the universe, yet through this fact concluding that that is precisely what makes life so significant - the sheer impossibility of it all. She, too, will come to see the big picture. "

But so much of the middle felt unnecessary and like a slog to get through. This book isn‚Äôt short, it‚Äôs 17 hrs on audio. Maybe that‚Äôs not the best format for it as he drops so many names and isms that‚Äôs it‚Äôs hard to keep track of them all. Perhaps in print it would be better. I also just got irritated with some of his premises. It seemed to me that he briefly went through quantum theory in a chapter or two and then used that as evidence for basically the rest of the book but if that‚Äôs going to be a giant part of your argument you better make sure you fully explain quantum theory AND what experiments we have done to know that. So much if the first half is about questioning things and then the author later just states what ‚Äúwe‚Äù know and expects you to just believe that this nebulous idea of the ‚Äúscientific community‚Äù as this seeming monolithic thing has definitely proved that this is right. That irked me. Then he was also throwing in the core theory and using that as a explanation for everything, all without in-depth discussion of what the core theory is. I feel like I might need whole other books discussing these theories to get the most of out this book."

I could name a few places where the book could have elaborated more. But, for the comprehensiveness and size of the book, I think it did an amazing job. I especially liked the first half of the book as I found it was more rigorous and dissecting with the subjects of philosophy and science it handled. the second half came to discuss more human concepts and it was elegant but more handwaving about it. overall, I really enjoyed this read, and I highly recommend it to everyone who is curious about the ""essence of science """
66,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58314045-ethan-tuan,4,"Basically the book attempts to summarize and blend important ideas in physics and philosophy in simple language. It succeeds. It also covers a range of topics in psychology, anthropology, biology, theology, etc. To some extent, it seems more like a literature review of current ideas and debates on the universe and meaning of life. That's what I both like and dislike. On one hand, readers can enjoy gaining knowledge in various fields, written in simple terms. On the other hand, I cannot find any idea truly original. Still, I appreciate the ""poetic naturalism"" as the heart of the book, and his personal anecdote to illustrate the theme.Don't skip the ""Core Theory"" explanation and ""Further Reading"" section at the end!"
67,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60680330-brian-keating,5,"At the accepted rate of one picture per thousand words, Sean Carroll‚Äôs magnum opus, The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself, would be worth about 100 pictures. Carroll, a theoretical physicist at Caltech, could have easily titled his book Poetry for Physicists, touching as it does on the deepest chords of existence, from astrophysics to zoology.We can begin, as Carroll does, with definitions. Consider the word ‚Äúuniverse.‚Äù Religious interpretations have it originating from the words ‚Äúone‚Äù and ‚Äúverse,‚Äù or from ‚Äúword,‚Äù as in the word said to be spoken by God ‚Äúin the beginning.‚Äù The Roman philosopher Lucretius, one of the founders of naturalism and a peripheral character in the book, is said to have coined the word‚Äîwhose Latin translation means ‚Äúone roll‚Äù‚Äîto evoke ‚Äúeverything rolled, or combined, into one.‚Äù The disparate views on this seemingly innocuous word perfectly capture the richness of The Big Picture.Although there aren‚Äôt many new ideas in The Big Picture, it shines as a juxtaposition and synthesis of what we physicists do know. Carroll‚Äôs book contains the definitive treatment of a wide range of subjects, including quantum entanglement, Bayes‚Äôs theorem, the Turing test, abiotic evolution, the physically relevant aspects of philosophy, the multiverse, and, of course, the standard model of physics. The standard model is the main focus of the tome, which Carroll calls the ‚ÄúCore Theory,‚Äù a term coined by Frank Wilczek. Readers also receive fresh insights into old standards such as the anthropic principle.Although credulity might be stretched in describing a 480-page book as ‚Äúlively,‚Äù Carroll‚Äôs humor shines in wry passages such as those describing ‚Äúfull employment for philosophers‚Äù and ‚Äúabducting God.‚Äù He is as adroit at quoting the secular S√∏ren Kierkegaard as the religious evangelist Rick Warren. He can mix Immanuel Kant‚Äôs categorical imperative with Bill and Ted‚Äôs own imperative, ‚ÄúBe excellent to each other!‚Äù Few authors so deftly mix the weighty with the buoyant, and that compels us to read on. From working in the bowels of particle accelerators to being a lab rat inside an MRI machine, Carroll skillfully pulls off a synthesis of all his intellectual peripateticism.Carroll‚Äôs fundamental thesis is that we know enough about the core theory to describe all that can affect us. We should not fear the paranormal or the astrological: If they have any reality whatsoever, they must obey the laws of nature. New observations may require us to expand or adapt the core theory, of course, but as Carroll puts it, ‚ÄúWe know enough to draw very powerful conclusions about the limits of what we can do.‚ÄùOne need only take a cursory look at the many extant glowing reviews of The Big Picture to be convinced it‚Äôs worth purchasing. I feel duty bound, therefore, to focus on my few qualms with the book. Some of the material in The Big Picture, including Carroll‚Äôs descriptions of concepts like entropy and the arrow of time, seems to be more or less adapted from his earlier books. Jettisoning some of that material might have somewhat reduced the book‚Äôs heft, but retaining it is forgivable; Carroll‚Äôs descriptions are worth reading twice.The Big Picture also takes the ambitious step of addressing ethics alongside its physics. Carroll is devoutly secular but not vituperative. His bias toward naturalism is evident, but he implores physicists, philosophers, and theologians to engage in serious, respectful dialog. Can one imagine a humanist‚Äôs Ten Commandments? Carroll takes a crack at just that. Although that may seem like a fool‚Äôs errand, Carroll‚Äôs version delights and inspires. If we do not agree with it, we must at least grapple with it.While believers must confront the question of theodicy‚Äîthe existence of evil in a universe governed by a good God‚Äîhumanists must confront the existence of goodness in a world governed by survival of the fittest. How does one explain performing acts of self-sacrifice or giving alms to the poor in a purely physical world, so ‚Äúred in tooth and claw,‚Äù to quote Alfred Lord Tennyson? Carroll admits that there cannot be an absolute morality without God, but that doesn‚Äôt prevent him from trying to establish ethics from scientific principles. Carroll sees humans as good. However, he must grapple with the fact that although individuals are good, humanity as a whole has a very mixed record. In the end, Carroll‚Äôs claim that human values can emerge from ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù is unconvincing. If there is indeed a sociological ‚Äúarrow of time‚Äù toward goodness and caring, as asserted, it is difficult to appraise the initial conditions that impelled it to be so.Religious texts aren‚Äôt scientific texts, they‚Äôre not intended to be read as science, and they haven‚Äôt been cited for scientific purposes since Giordano Bruno‚Äôs time. But can physicalism, catalyzed by the core theory, actually provide spiritual meaning? At the end, Carroll admits, we cannot dispense with the claims of religion in its own domain. So why bother trying to extend physics into the religious or ethical realm? Clearly religion fills lacunae in people‚Äôs lives. For the gaps that remain, there is The Big Picture‚Äîa manual for the majestic, poetic existence of all that is.Paul Dirac famously quipped, ‚ÄúIn science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in the case of poetry, it‚Äôs the exact opposite!‚Äù Unification of physics escaped Dirac. Carroll‚Äôs version of poetic naturalism attempts to unify the physical with the ethereal. With its delightful blend of evocative love paeans and four-dimensional integrals, The Big Picture offers a uniquely physical vision of life‚Äôs meaning. This is poetry. For Carroll, it comes naturally."
68,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464095-ryan-alsaihaty,3,"Carroll discuses his philosophy of life, which he calls ""Poetic Naturalism;"" naturalism because there is only one unified physical world (that may contain many universes) and poetic because there are many useful ways of talking about it. Throughout the 50 chapters of this book, Carroll discusses many concepts and how a poetic naturalist view them including reasoning, time, cause and effect, knowledge, religion, core theory, quantum mechanics, origin of life, evolution, consciousness, and morality, to name a few. The presentation of the book is overall clear, simple, and has a lot of valuable insights. However, because of the many different (sometimes unrelated) concepts discussed in the book, the book sometimes feels disjointed, thereby disrupting its flow."

You should be happy living in this short but wonderful moment in an otherwise infinitely long and dark eon of the universe . Bad news: If you still insist that you're more than a bunch of particles, you should be disappointed. From a microscopic point of view, you are no more than particles colliding and self-arranging, your thoughts and actions are no more than electromagnetic force, and your consciousness is no more than weak-emergence of some chemical reactions.

I think he does a very good job at covering a broad spectrum of topics and still being able to discuss things with sufficient depth.

Carroll explores big concepts and age-old questions through the lens of physics and metaphysics, arguing that life is both particle AND narrative. The constructs we create to express ourselves are just as important or ""true,"" if you like, as the atoms and chemical reactions which underlie our existence. Perhaps part of the big picture is a non-dualistic embrace of the ways we describe our world in their respective areas of application. Oh. And Bayesian reasoning. That's really important. But you should just read the book. Sean Carroll is a remarkable communicator and apparently an excellent scientist. An epic combination, indeed."

That‚Äôs a tremendous intellectual achievement, one of which the human race can be justifiably proud.What this book offers: a full naturalistic worldview starter kitThe Big Picture covers quite a few topics: epistemology, quantum mechanics, the origin of life, the nature of time, consciousness, free will, morality, meaning, and more. Carroll ties science and philosophy together to present a cohesive naturalistic worldview and explore its implications for some of the deep questions that everyone grapples with. I strongly disagree with some of his major conclusions - especially about consciousness, free will, and morality - but I admire the project and learned a lot from it.Poetic NaturalismCarroll summarizes ‚Äúnaturalism‚Äù as follows:1. There is only one world, the natural world.2. The world evolves according to unbroken patterns, the laws of nature.3. The only reliable way of learning about the world is by observing it.He calls his way of looking at reality ‚Äúpoetic naturalism‚Äù, which builds on that with the following:1. There are many ways of talking about the world.2. All good ways of talking must be consistent with one another and with the world.3. Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.The point is to explain how one can believe that ultimately the world only consists of fundamental physical particles/fields, and yet also believe that things belonging to higher-level categories are real and should not be regarded as illusions. For instance, it makes sense to talk about tables and chairs, even if they are just collections of atoms. Trying to talk only of atoms would be unwieldy, and the ideas of ‚Äútables‚Äù and ‚Äúchairs‚Äù have explanatory power. Similarly, we need the vocabularies of chemistry and biology because trying to use just the vocabulary of physics to predict the behavior of the world would be entirely impractical, even though in principle possible.That may not be particularly revelatory, but Carroll does a good job of exploring how different vocabularies can relate to each other and the pitfalls of mixing them:The most seductive mistake we can be drawn into when dealing with multiple stories of reality is to mix up vocabularies appropriate to different ways of talking. Someone might say, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt truly want anything, you‚Äôre just a collection of atoms, and atoms don‚Äôt have wants.‚Äù It‚Äôs true that atoms don‚Äôt have wants; the idea of a ‚Äúwant‚Äù is not part of our best theory of atoms. There would be nothing wrong with saying ‚ÄúNone of these atoms making up you want anything.‚ÄùBut it doesn‚Äôt follow that you can‚Äôt have wants. ‚ÄúYou‚Äù are not part of our best theory of atoms either; you are an emergent phenomenon, meaning that you are an element in a higher-level ontology that describes the world at a macroscopic level. At the level of description where it is appropriate to talk about ‚Äúyou,‚Äù it‚Äôs also perfectly appropriate to talk about wants and feelings and desires. Those are all real phenomena in our best understanding of human beings. You can think of yourself as an individual human being, or you can think of yourself as a collection of atoms. Just not both at the same time, at least when it comes to asking how one kind of thing interacts with another one.ConsciousnessHe approaches the nature of consciousness from within that framework, arguing that ‚Äú[c]onsciousness isn‚Äôt an illusion, but it doesn‚Äôt point to any departure from the laws of physics as we currently understand them.‚Äù (p. 351)Regarding Frank Jackson‚Äôs well-known (within philosophy) thought experiment about ‚ÄúMary the Color Scientist,‚Äù Carroll concludes that in distinguishing between learning about the color red by studying versus learning about the color red by actually seeing red, ‚Äúwe have merely introduced an artificial distinction between two kinds of collections of synaptic connections‚Äù (p. 353). I more or less agree; this thought experiment is not really effective in highlighting the ‚Äúhard problem‚Äù of consciousness.The book goes on to address the thought experiment of ‚Äúp-zombies‚Äù: is it possible in principle to have an exact physical replica of a person, that behaves identically to them, but that is not conscious? If like me you think consciousness involves some mental properties that are not reducible to physical properties (at least, physical properties as ordinarily conceived), you may be inclined to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù, but that presents a dilemma. Either those mental properties have some effect on the physical world, or they don't. Either option has problems.If the mental properties are merely ‚Äúalong for the ride‚Äù (p. 356) - an epiphenomenalist view - why believe in them at all? I‚Äôm not sure the discussion in this book would have been enough to lead me to this conclusion, but I‚Äôm pretty convinced currently that epiphenomenalism makes no sense. The whole motivation for believing in mental properties is that we seem to have a direct awareness of them. But if the mental properties aren‚Äôt playing a causal role in the formation of your belief in them, why trust that belief? (Carroll‚Äôs podcast has an episode interviewing philosopher of consciousness David Chalmers, where Chalmers mentions this issue of where our belief that there is a hard problem of consciousness comes from, calling it the ‚Äúmeta-hard problem‚Äù.)So, instead, can we suggest that mental properties do influence physical things? Carroll warns that the Core Theory of quantum mechanics has already been established to a very high degree of confidence, and it simply does not leave any room for this. He expands on that objection in the chapter on panpsychism: ‚ÄúOne of the most basic things we know about the Core Theory is exactly how many degrees of freedom each particle has‚Äù (p. 364). You can‚Äôt just tack on new properties to the particles; we‚Äôd have found them already.Though I have no ready response, that argument isn‚Äôt enough to make me give up property dualism; the intuitive case against reductionism still seems too compelling. But, it‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôm failing to adequately appreciate the force of his argument because I don‚Äôt have a detailed enough grasp of the Core Theory. That‚Äôs not something you can reasonably expect to gain from a popular-level science book.Free WillIf the laws of nature determine the future, can we still have free will? In his chapter on the subject, Carroll takes the compatibilist view, answering yes. One thing I appreciate is the clarity with which he outlines the debate. I‚Äôve found that some proponents of free will take issue with the term ‚Äúdeterminism‚Äù because of the uncertainty that quantum mechanics adds to the world, but Carroll states the argument against free will in a way that highlights the irrelevance of such uncertainty:Quantum mechanics predicts our future in terms of probabilities rather than certainties, but those probabilities themselves are absolutely fixed by the state of the universe right now. A quantum version of Laplace‚Äôs Demon could say with confidence what the probability of every future history will be, and no amount of human volition would be able to change it. There is no room for human choice, so there is no such thing as free will. We are just material objects who obey the laws of nature.But he rejects the conclusion that there is no free will, because this argument mixes vocabularies in the way warned against earlier. Free will may be a useful concept in the same way that molecules and chairs are useful concepts, despite not belonging to a description of nature at its most fundamental level. I think he does a good job here of explaining why it still makes sense to talk about people making ‚Äúchoices‚Äù even if the world is deterministic - something that proponents of libertarian free will occasionally regard as hypocritical or nonsensical.Carroll is also right to point out that the significant difference between compatibilism and hard determinism comes ""when we confront the notions of blame and responsibility‚Äù (383), but I‚Äôm unsatisfied with his discussion of that subject. He seems to simply assume that if choice is (in the poetic naturalist sense) real, then assigning moral responsibility makes sense. Further, he thinks this responsibility depends on us not having the practical ability to predict people‚Äôs behavior accurately. This leads to the surprising conclusion that people could have less moral responsibility as neuroscience becomes more advanced:If our belief in free will is predicated on the idea that ‚Äúagents making choices‚Äù is part of the best theory we have of human behavior, then the existence of a better and more predictive understanding could undermine that belief. To the extent that neuroscience becomes better and better at predicting what we will do without reference to our personal volition, it will be less and less appropriate to treat people as freely acting agents. Predestination will become part of our real world.It doesn‚Äôt seem likely, however. Most people do maintain a certain degree of volition and autonomy, not to mention a complexity of cognitive functioning that makes predicting their future actions infeasible in practice.I think this obscures an important point. Free will is often used to justify retributive justice - punishment done not for the sake of deterrence or rehabilitation, but because the person deserves to suffer in exchange for the choices they have made. The idea that such punishment could be more or less appropriate based merely on our practical ability to predict the person‚Äôs choices seems absurd.MoralityCarroll provides a very clear and thoughtful exposition of the argument that there cannot be objective morality. There is a gap, he says (following Hume), between ‚Äúis‚Äù and ‚Äúought‚Äù that simply cannot be bridged. Science, therefore, cannot teach us morality, it can only help us more effectively pursue whatever goals we happen to have; ethical philosophy cannot teach us morality, it can only help us systematize and refine the intuitions about morality we happen to have.He is at least willing to face the distasteful implications of this head-on:The lack of an ultimate objective scientific grounding for morality can be worrisome. It implies that people with whom we have moral disagreements‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs Hitler, the Taliban, or schoolyard bullies who beat up smaller children‚Äîaren‚Äôt wrong in the same sense that it‚Äôs wrong to deny Darwinian evolution or the expansion of the universe. We can‚Äôt do an experiment, or point to data, or construct a syllogism, or write a stinging blog post, that would persuade them of why their actions are bad. And if that‚Äôs true, why should they ever stop?But that‚Äôs how the world is. We should recognize that our desire for an objective grounding for morality creates a cognitive bias, and should compensate by being especially skeptical of any claims in that direction.As he points out, this conclusion is less terrifying than people sometimes imagine. Whether there are objective moral facts or not, we can still reason with people who have similar core moral values as ourselves. And whether there are objective moral facts or not, we will often have to resort to other means of conflict resolution with people who have radically different moral values than ourselves - such as enacting laws to restrain them. Still, I do worry that many people would be less motivated to follow their own moral values if they stopped believing those values had a certain objective validity.(I remain a proponent of objective morality; see e.g. Ethical Intuitionism by Michael Huemer for a defense of that view.)Time & EntropyLast year I read (or at least, as Tyler Cowen recently put it in reference to a book by the notoriously inscrutable philosopher Heidegger, I ‚Äúlooked at every page of‚Äù) Carlo Rovelli‚Äôs The Order of Time, from which I learned rather less than I had hoped about the scientific understanding of time. One of the ideas I didn‚Äôt really grasp from that book is how entropy can help explain the apparent difference between ‚Äúpast‚Äù and ‚Äúpresent,"" without that difference being part of any fundamental physical laws. Carroll‚Äôs explanation of the concept was a real ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment for me.As I understand it, the idea is: the laws of quantum mechanics make no reference to time. For every valid change from one physical state to another, the reverse change is equally valid:Eggs could unbreak, perfume could go back into its bottle, cream and coffee could unmix. All we have to do is to imagine reversing the trajectory of every single particle of which our system (and anything it was interacting with) is made. None of these processes violates the laws of physics‚Äîit‚Äôs just that they are extraordinarily unlikely.Why is it unlikely for a shattered egg to unbreak? Well, each particle of the shattered egg can legally move in a bunch of different ways, which means there are a huge number of possible configurations that the entire collection of particles could end up in. But from the outside, most of those configurations are equivalent; the microscopic changes don‚Äôt alter the fact that it‚Äôs still a shattered egg. That‚Äôs what it means to say the shattered egg has high entropy - entropy is ""the number of different states that would be macroscopically indistinguishable from the state it is actually in‚Äù (p. 57). Only a relatively small number of configurations correspond to an unbroken egg, so if you pick one of the allowed transitions purely at random, you‚Äôll most likely be choosing one that goes from shattered egg to shattered egg, rather than one that goes from shattered egg to unbroken eggAn unbroken egg, on the other hand, has lower entropy, since most of the possible reconfigurations of its particles would make it broken. So a randomly selected transition is overwhelmingly more likely to be from unbroken egg to broken egg than from unbroken egg to unbroken egg.Imagine an empty universe, with a timeline that is a series of discrete instants. (Think of the timeline as having a ‚Äòleft‚Äô direction and a ‚Äòright‚Äô direction, but no inherent ‚Äòpast‚Äô or ‚Äòfuture‚Äô directions.) Plop a perfect egg somewhere, anywhere, on this timeline. Now fill in the rest of the instants on the timeline, with the only constraint being that, between every pair of instants in both directions, all the particles must move in accordance with the laws of physics. If you select at random from all the allowable states for each instant, you‚Äôll most likely end up with a timeline where the egg decays - in both directions from wherever you placed it on the timeline. This happens without any need for the laws of physics to make reference to a direction of time. Once you‚Äôve committed to having a low-entropy instant at a certain point in the timeline, you get progressively higher-entropy instants surrounding it.In our universe, the low-entropy moment is the Big Bang. Given that for whatever reason, the universe was in a very low-entropy state at that point on the timeline, it follows that the universe will get progressively higher-entropy as you get further away from that point. To us, that will make it appear as if there is a law stating that entropy increases as you go in the direction we call the future, but it‚Äôs really just that entropy is increasing as you get further away from the anomalously low-entropy point.At least, that‚Äôs my understanding of the theory. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs accurate but I find it fascinating. This interpretation yields an obvious question that I don‚Äôt recall being addressed in the book: on this model, if you could see back in time to before the Big Bang, might you see the history of another universe similar to our own, just with the directions of past and future reversed?The definition of entropy quoted above also raises questions - what are the precise criteria for ‚Äúmacroscopically indistinguishable‚Äù? Is it subjective? The Rovelli book I mentioned does assert that entropy is a subjective measurement, but I found its discussion of that mostly incomprehensible at the time."

Basically, I got enough to learn that Quantum Mechanics is really freaking complicated and that no one really knows for sure, as well as some other fancy ways to describe philosophical questions. I definitely think I need to re-visit this book (in a written form, as it is not something I recommend in an audible format), but after I read up more on the intro-level knowledge of the physics described."

Poetic naturalism is very much in accord with how I see the world. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised by how much new there was in this book; I had expected large sections of slogging through ""popular science"" versions of things I already knew (as an astrophysicist), but this was hardly the case. In fact, quite the opposite, and my main criticism was how quickly some chapters went, when I wanted the book to slow down and explain even more."
95,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56926561-ameya,5,"I came across this book since I was a regular listener to the author‚Äôs podcast . And I must say I enjoyed reading it.The book covers a wide range of topics right from physics to philosophy and ethics.To summarise the few parts that stayed with me were:-1. Thermodynamics dictates that both the yesterday and the tomorrow is likely have higher entropy than today.The reason we find yesterday to have lesser entropy than today is because day before yesterday had even lesser entropy. This goes all the way back to the Big Bang which can be said to be a very low entropy at state. An arrow of time is apparent because entropy is lower in the past . Cause and effect, memories of the past all get meaning because of this arrow of time .The author compares this to our notion of UP and DOWN . In free space they have no meaning but since we are located near a reference point of high gravity like the earth . We feel a notion of up and down.The Big Bang is an analogous low entropy reference point.2. The universe began with low entropy and is likely to end with very high entropy . Both states are boring . The interesting stuff such as life happens somewhere in between. This situation is compared to mixing of cream and coffee . Initially cream and coffee is separate- and entropy is low. When fully homogeneous the entropy is high . The complexity is high somewhere in the middle of the two extreme states . 3. The author presents an interesting viewpoint about what free will is and how to interpret it in terms of his poetic naturalism framework . 4. There is an interesting discussion about if ‚Äúought‚Äù can be derived from ‚Äúis‚Äù.It is somewhat confusing. Because ‚Äúis‚Äù is all there is . But the author makes good arguments about how it makes no logical sense to derive ‚Äúought‚Äù from ‚Äúis‚Äù.Any argument where ought is derived from an is , smuggles an ought to derive and ought . The author uses this to show that as humans we can‚Äôt depend on any external sources to derive our ethics . It‚Äôs something that we would do on our own tendencies . My own interpretation of this is - Of course everything is an ‚Äúis‚Äù, and even the fact that ‚Äúhumans are following a system of ethics‚Äù is an ‚Äúis‚Äù.But perhaps from the point of view of the humans the way they are coming up with the ethics is an act of ‚Äúought‚Äù. And if the point of view is taken as an objective one it becomes an ‚Äúis‚Äù . (This discussion is like a gestalt illusion effect)( review is a bit obscure. But it‚Äôs more like a mental note to revisit both the book and the review ) "

98,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35580990-aaron-bellamy,3,"The Big Picture is best described as a collection of philosophical, ontological, and physical thoughts, having begun in a state of low entropy, on its cumbersome way to a state of high entropy, in between which words have been gathered upon a page by sheer force of will. There is also a sad kind of (pun totally intended) ‚Äòpreaching to the choir‚Äô going on here. As I read, I kept thinking, ‚Äúwow, this would be a great text for some of my theist friends to read‚Äù, but alas, they don‚Äôt really read. And if they did, they probably wouldn‚Äôt be interested in reading this. And even if they did, they‚Äôd just cuddle up under the bed of ignorance with their pre-existing notions and swipe at me from the shadows like a feral cat. Okay, so that‚Äôs not fair, I don‚Äôt really know anyone like that, but mostly because I don‚Äôt know many people,‚Ä¶ probably because I say and write things like what I just wrote. Hmm. A pattern is emerging. Anyway, the real irony of preaching to the choir is: that it really is the only way to effectively preach at all; at least to most theists, in my experience. I am not a theist. There‚Äôs a word for this, even hidden in that last sentence, that I feel now has all this negative baggage associated with it, which is silly since it isn‚Äôt saying what someone is, just what they aren‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not purple either. If a theist were to sit down and really read this book and think about it, I believe it would open some pretty spectacular doors of thought for them, and not just because it‚Äôs a direct challenge to theism, it mostly isn‚Äôt. It is a challenge to construct arguments and conversations in such a way as to learn and grow as opposed to stagnate. I find that often, when bordering on any topic that has a theistic answer available, no matter the question, an element of willful blindness is present in the devout. Not always, but often. History provides enough examples of this to satisfy any need to list them here. Unfortunately, for me the Big Picture read more like the ‚ÄòQuick Overview‚Äô. These are bit size snacks of the hardest concepts out there, and though delicious, beg for a full meal. Certainly, Carrol‚Äôs point wasn‚Äôt to write the end all be all book of all the topics in here; that simply couldn‚Äôt be done. But what he ends up with felt repetitive and disorganized. It pains me to write that, because he explains things very well, using a very reader friendly style uncharacteristic to this type of book, and includes a surprisingly good sense of humor and some personal details as well; all of which I really enjoyed.But, we come back to that preaching to the choir. My knowledge of the sciences is enough that most of what I found in here to be a clear refreshment of difficult concepts that ultimately sent me to the bibliography for more. My knowledge of philosophy, consisting of a handful of undergraduate classes several years ago, is in a similar state. Carrol‚Äôs synopses are far removed from the mind bending experience of reading the originals, but enough to move to the next point. This simplification process almost certainly allows this book to be ingested by a larger audience, but likely one that has absolutely no interest in thinking about things of this nature. And those of us that do, honestly, need more than what is provided.A weighty criticism, I know, but I‚Äôd like to make a final note: despite these flaws, this is a quick, engaging primer for any budding thinker. I can‚Äôt think of a better gift (Christmas would be hilarious) for someone that is ready for a challenge, or even better, for a parent with an engaged and interested teen. If you‚Äôre already a novice physicist or philosopher, reading this may not change your life, but it certainly won‚Äôt hurt you. If you are open to rethinking some core beliefs, (including those presented herein!), and have the patience to follow through, this is a good start."

100,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7396031-ryan-curry,5,"I have finally finished The Big Picture.TLDR: I really really really liked this book. Anyone who hasn't read this book or really anything by Carroll needs to remedy that situation immediately. I imagine this book can quickly be explained as a state-of-affairs about many popular scientific fields. But it is so much more than that.I am pretty sure that everything I am about to write has already been written, likely in a much better way also.Regardless, here goes. I really enjoyed the way Carroll divided the book into six different sections.CosmosUnderstandingEssenceComplexityThinkingCaringThis structure allowed Carroll to cover an incredibly array of fields and ideas while still managing to connect everything. The Big Picture is Sean Carroll's pitch for Poetic Naturalism as a system for dealing with the world. I think he takes a huge number of good ideas that have been circulating around the scientific community and nicely brings them all together in one place. There were two tools that really made an impression on me in The Big Picture.The firs being Planets of Belief. This idea that different beliefs are connected to one another and that the accumulated almost like the different bits of matter that accumulate into a planet. A good explanatory quote from the book: ""A Planet of Belief is much richer and more complex that simply an ontology. An ontology is a view about what really exists; a planet of belief contains all sorts of other convictions, including methods for understanding the world, a priori truths, derived categories, preferences, aesthetic and ethical judgements, and more.""I found the planet of belief metaphor to be quite powerful and worth thinking about more. The other idea that really struck with me was the fact that we as scientists have different ways of talking about the same thing. One of the simpler examples Carroll gives is air temperature. We can talk about the individual atoms, and we can talk about the air temperature as an emergent phenomenon. He eventually applies this idea quite nicely to freewill. I enjoyed the way Carroll explains how this system works so well and the danger in switching between ways of talking about something.If we are talking about choosing a shirt, it doesn't make sense to all of a sudden start talking about what your atoms are doing.Obviously Carroll does a much better job explaining this.I really have no idea what I can say to make it clear how much I enjoyed this book. At one point while reading a thought occurred to me and the more I think about it, the more true it seems.If someone were to ask me who I thought my generation's Carl Sagan is. That being a communicator of science that just seems to have some special talent for making potentially challenging scientific ideas, clear and easy to understand. And further to that has an ability to instill an unshakeable sense of wonder in his readers ( at least this one ), I would confidently say Sean Carroll. I can comfortably say that this is the best popular science book I have read in some time, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Now that I think I have spent enough of my 3 billion heartbeats writing this. Seriously, read it. "
101,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22356256-kyle,5,"Wonderful book. I have been a fan of Carroll's style ever since I began reading his blog, and listening to any of his public lectures. As a fellow physicist (still a graduate student and in a different subfield), I find Carroll's views to be very convinceing. Perhaps I should be a little skeptical since I am sympathetic to the views (the book would agree); I think that Carroll does a great job of explaining how we know what we know about the world and why it isn't likely to undergo some sea-change. I also find Carroll's ""poetic naturalism"" to be a satisfying way of thinking about the world. I would actually like to see how others view his ideas. The idea that there are multiple models that are equally real, even if some are coarse-grainings of more (we shall say) fundamental models seems to me a pragmatic way of doing things. Asking what it means to be real in such situations seems to be a pragmatic decision, but I wonder if skeptics of this approach would consider it destroying the meaning of the word ""real."" I happen to agree with Carroll, but I can see why some would wonder if the most fundamental model is not what is actually real, and therefore everything else is a useful imagination on our part and not real in some sense.Still, like I said, I find the pragmatic real to be the only thing we really need to care about and I find the book a wonderful exploration of this idea. Carroll covers a lot of good territory (I was excited to see him talk about the metabolism-first idea in biology. This seems like an intersting line of research. Even if it is not a majority view, it seems like it could help understand some biology mysteries.) including biology, consciousness, purpose in the universe, ethics, and the likely ultimate fate of the universe. If you can't find something you'd like in that, then I am unsure why you would even be looking at a book like this."

Don‚Äôt let the science put you off. I deep-dived into the book, and I‚Äôm the guy who read ‚ÄúEinstein for Dummies‚Äù twice and still only grasped half of it. But I have a deep interest in the expanding universe, exoplanets, the search for extraterrestrial life, etc., so I read lot in the area. I also listen to Carroll‚Äôs ‚ÄúMindscape‚Äù podcasts, which I also recommend.Carroll‚Äôs great talent is presenting complex concepts for the reader who wouldn‚Äôt know quantum mechanics from a four-barreled carburetor. The book is not solely science. Sure, Carroll explains the physical nature of the universe, but his book is also a meditation on our place in that universe. So, there‚Äôs astronomy, cosmology, and physics, to be sure. But also philosophy.If you‚Äôve done any reading in this arena (Neil deGrasse Tyson, perhaps), you know that we‚Äôre literally made of stardust. But that‚Äôs not all we are. The reader may feel he or she is the tiniest speck of matter on an insignificant rock in a universe of unimaginable size. (Unless you can imagine a distance of 93 billion light years, one light year being 6 trillion miles). But Carroll is a scientist who can opine on the meaning of human existence and what to do during the three billion heartbeats of an average lifespan. He also provides a drawing of the Tiktaalik Roseae, the fish that crawled from the ocean onto the land 400 million years ago...and the rest, as they say, is history. Or perhaps anthropology.This is a book that lives up to both its title, ‚ÄúThe Big Picture,‚Äù and its subittle, ‚ÄúOn the origins of life, meaning, and the universe itself.‚Äù Highly recommended.Paul Levine"
103,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3322582-james,4,"Sean Carroll is my favorite popular scientist, he doesn't dumb things down and at the same time he is able to communicate very very complex ideas in a way that a lay person (like myself) can understand. On top of the fact that he specializes in the topics I find interesting (cosmology) and doesn't shy away from questions like ""why"" and ""what does this mean for us"".I realized while reading this book that this is the first real ""atheist book"" that I have ever read. I follow a variety of blogs from a variety of perspectives and have seen a number of talks from atheists. I have also read books written by self proclaimed atheists, but the subject matter of the book was not necessarily about atheism.Sean Carrol's ideas are interesting in that he is advocating for a positive replacement of Theism (as opposed to just discrediting Theism). He is making the case for Naturalism and this book explains his world view he calls ""Poetic Naturalism"". He is reacting to a more stronger form of Naturalism that seems to strip meaning from words we use every day, such as ""free will"" or ""consciousness"" or ""purpose"". Some would argue that since we live in a total material world that those things do not really exist. Where Carrol makes the argument that those things really do exist within their realm of applicability. It is an interesting idea that is hard to get one's head wrapped around. But he is not just asserting things and really tries to build a case for it.He challenged my thinking on a lot of issues; but what I really learned from this book are some different ways to view Quantum Mechanics.This is another one of those books I would love to go through with a group of people chapter by chapter discussing the ideas there."

Nevertheless, you better have an idea what the Universe is.In our understanding, weaved with stories and ideas, perspective is everything. This book is about putting things into context. Zooming out a bit. Sean Carroll wants you to take a breathtaking journey to the limits of the knowable universe. What can be seen from this perspective? What matter, life, consciousness seem to be? Are we more than just a bunch of particles bumping around? Is there any meaning out there?Science provides a fundamental description of our world in terms of elementary particles emerging from evolving quantum wave function. From this view, everything is just dead matter compelled to increase its entropy like a soy milk mingling in a cup of coffee. Still, it seems to be more to this story. Sean Carroll, a poetic naturalist, shows that such concepts as rocks, trees and our minds are real and should be treated as useful models describing the underlying reality. Life, set in motion by darwinian evolution, as well as our consciousness with richness of our mental and emotional states, can be perceived as a way for nature to organize itself, while on the fundamental level it‚Äôs just a manner of talking about particular physical states. By introducting categories like things, people and choices, we can learn more about our world than if we were just tracking its composing particles.Stories and ideas can be helpful. In a universe stubbornly refusing to reveal its meaning, the purpose and meaning are us to create. And they are real. Even if we just invented them a second ago."
105,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6026084-adom,4,"Nice shallow overview of reductionism, Bayes, physical theories, and the naturalistic worldview as applied to lots of different parts of the world. The main thesis of Poetic Naturalism seems fairly straightforward, but remains a nice label to have. I'm unsure whether it is at all controversial in the relevant circles.Things I need to look further into / think more about:- The book's secondary thesis that a huge amount of stuff is a result of the universe starting out low-entropy. I finished the book without a good understanding of the arguments for this.- The argument that one can never justifiably believe oneself to be a Boltzmann Brain, because -- I think this is the argument -- the scientific claims that support this conclusion are only trustworthy if there is a causal entanglement with your believing them and their being true, this relationship not holding if one's brain and ""history"" are merely the result of random quantum fluctuations. One possible objection I see is as follows: Perhaps some brain states and internal histories are more stable than others, such that introspection on the consistency... no, I think this one is wrong. Another: Perhaps the informational complexity of a large, self-consistent body of knowledge is larger enough to be more unlikely to spontaneously emerge than are larger set of particles which then ""generates"" the worldview, as in the typical case of humans (embedded in nature) generating the naturalistic worldview. I'm as yet unsure whether these objection are relevant, correct, or even make any sense, so I'll have to look deeper into the question."
106,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56270091-kumari-de-silva,4,"I read this book because I have been really enjoying the lectures I can find on YouTube by Dr. Carroll. He is a very accessible speaker on some really arcane subjects: philosophy and physics. I figured this book would be easier for me, a layperson, to read than some of his popular science titles. I really liked the philosophical parts of the book. I like read, and re-read and savor them. Dr. Carroll is very skilled at setting up a theory or an argument or a proof. There is plenty of food for thought. It's the kind of book that if you used it for a book club you might spend a year on it.I knocked off one star just because I'm a dummy. When Dr. Carroll really hits stride, talking about cosmology and quantum physics I'm a little lost. I read with my dictionary next to me, and even so I was puzzling over this ""many-worlds"" thing. I think I may have to listen to a lecture on line before I can properly understand it. And I probably will because I am burning with curiosity, but I wish it were a book that I could understand in a stand alone format. If you already know what the ""many-worlds"" theory is you will probably give this book 5 stars whether or not you agree with Dr. Carroll. He is the kind of intellectual who entertains many thoughts - - he doesn't pound away at people like Sir Richard Dawkins, and I respect Dr Carroll for that open-mindedness.Much of the book is devoted to explaining Baysian analysis which is worth learning how to do if you want to live a bigger, better, more interesting life, or even if, you just want to win at poker.

I enjoyed it because I'm a fan of his so I'm predisposed to enjoy his work. I had a friend who couldn't get through it.It's one of those books with a few good nuggets but only a few.His biggest contribution to the philosophical discussion is a concept he calls 'poetic naturalism.' It is an interesting idea because it's one step up from just 'naturalism' which is almost always derided in common parlance with phrases like, ""Oh so we are all just molecules in motion then?"" He makes the point that yes we are molecules in motion but that's not ALL we are. And he has other concepts like that in the book. Basically, there are terms that are reasonable to use in one realm and not another. At the macroscopic level, you use certain terms and at the microscopic level you use alternative terms. And similarly when we discuss the nature of our existence.I give him credit for broaching the subject. It just didn't seem like a blockbuster to me."

Ultimately aims to show how physics and life sciences (among other disciplines) present models that are sufficient not just for describing the natural world, but also what it means to be human -- without the need to resort to philosophies and religions of transcendence.

Now it's true that I only made it 20% or so into the book and it might have really opened up from there, but the whole meta-experience of talking about how to talk about science didn't grab me.I've read another of his books, ""The Particle at the End of the Universe: How the Hunt for the Higgs Boson Leads Us to the Edge of a New World"", and enjoyed that.

Their facts, mind you, I completely agree with, but their militant ""science or you're a fool"" dogma leaves me intellectually fulfilled and emotionally empty. I'm a moderate at heart: I don't like labeling myself, backing into a corner and then fighting everyone who isn't in complete alignment with me. Instead, I take joy in unification ‚Äì bringing ideas, people, philosophies together. Dawkins, Hitchens and the like never gave me tools to unify the mechanics of the natural world with ""emergent"" concepts like the concept of ""self"", nor did they help me bridge the gap with others - especially theists. Sean Carol's book tries to.Carroll introduces (or reinforces, if you're already there) some tough-to-swallow naturalist concepts: - humans are a complexity rising from an intermediate state of a low-entropy universe seeking its high-entropy final state, - time is not a fundamental building block of the universe, - a sufficiently powerful computer with enough information can predict everything that will happen in the universe‚Ä¶But while doing so, he compartmentalizes these concepts, and allows for other descriptions of the universe ‚Äì Newtonian mecanics, causality, memories, morality, free will, the color red ‚Äì to have importance and value. He gives macroscopic phenomena and vocabularies as much validity as their abilities to be useful in the domains that they operate. For example, when we shoot a rocket into space, we're not using string theory to get it there, we're using Newtonian mechanics, and it is valid and true - even though string theory describes the fundamental building blocks behind it. He calls this ""poetic naturalism"" ‚Äì a label I take issue with, but I'm not a fan of labels in general. Once this structured way of thinking is presented, the book dives into the typical heady questions usually encountered in debates about reality. For someone who's steeped in this stuff, much of it is familiar. But the review of the material is fun, and for me ‚Äì someone who studied computer science and physics at university ‚Äì it's neat seeing your favorite homework topics (Bayes Nets, genetic algorithms, Schr√∂dinger's equation) glued together into a continuum of philosophical arguments. That said, chapters start reading like a manual of defensive arguments against people with slightly different viewpoints attacking you at a bar. The inspirational feel dies quickly.In fact, about halfway through the book, waves of sadness came over me. Once in a while, Carroll hints at how amazing life is not in spite of, but because of how we've emerged from the process of the universe ‚Äì but it's nowhere near Sagan's ""we are made of star stuff"" feel-good messaging that people like Neal deGrasse Tyson attempt to carry the torch on. In the end, Carroll's not here to cheer you up, he's here to wake you up and give you a framework. But he's also not abrasively militant like a Dawkins.In the final section of the book, ""Caring"", Carroll does attempt to bring purpose and emotion back in - and rightfully kicks the whole thing off with a quote from Carl Sagan's wife. There are nice kernels of life philosophy in this section, and it truly attempts to spline the seemingly harsh edge between naturalism and finding meaning and guidance in your life. ""Water doesn‚Äôt stop being wet when you learn it's a compound of hydrogen and oxygen,"" he says. By his own admission, poetic naturalism isn't mean to supply this layer. This section, therefore, is much more about the schools of thought, and the challenges faced in creating these moral, ethical and inspirational layers of life. The true decisions on how to proceed is left as an exercise to the reader. Yet he does provide some guidance in the form of ""10 Considerations"". In the end, Carroll's framework can be considered somewhat moderate, as he does soften up the harsh edges of pure Naturalism. In doing so, Carroll falls into the state most moderates do ‚Äì everyone gets mad at him. After reading his book, I sought out critical discussions of it online. I found that non-poetic pure Naturalists are upset that he yields validity to macro (emergent) descriptions on the universe at all. Theists argue that he's ignoring the actual questions theology answers, and his definition of ""useful"" is arbitrary. But this is exactly what draws me in ‚Äì he's trying to reconcile the irreconcilable. He doesn't slam the door on theists ‚Äì he just creates a fair and uncaring framework in which they can play too, and shows them just how much work they have to do to have their ideas rise to the top.Back to the term ""poetic"". I believe this word should be saved for the layer that helps pick up where naturalism ends. For the masses, it's not enough to provide a framework and enumerate choices. We need to accept, comfort, guide, and inspire people with broader backgrounds, IQs, and needs. Has anyone taken something like the 10 Considerations and weaved them into parables and fanciful tales that help indoctrinate people to the school of thought? Is there a book of The Gospels to be had here? Carroll's drive to understand the universe is compelling for many, but it's not enough for most. Poetic naturalism's view of reality is difficult and stark, and we need a compatibility layer to truly motivate mankind with it."

But this book is not exactly a physics text, rather a philosophical manifesto of what Carroll terms ‚Äúpoetic naturalism.‚Äù A physicist putting himself in the shoes of a philosopher? Why not? There was a time when physics was referred to as natural philosophy, and it saddens me that contemporary philosophy and liberal arts in general have parted ways with STEM fields in the past century so much that differences often seem irreconcilable. It has led some scientists to arrogantly declare philosophy redundant, while some hotheads in humanities, including some of my acquaintances, attack scientists and popularizers of science for dehumanizing people and depriving them of meaning. Oh, well...  Sean Carroll, an outspoken atheist, tries to make naturalism (an idea that only natural, as opposed to supernatural or spiritual, laws and forces operate in the world) more palatable for humans who do need meaning in their lives. His version of naturalism encourages a variety of ways to talk about the world, using language dependent upon the aspect of reality being discussed. Carroll‚Äôs view vaguely reminds of certain features of the philosophy of pragmatism, which ridiculously claims that an ideology or proposition is true if it works satisfactorily, that the meaning of a proposition is to be found in the practical consequences of accepting it, and that unpractical ideas are to be rejected. Luckily, he doesn‚Äôt offer to adapt the notion of ‚Äútruth‚Äù to what is useful, like some philosophers do. In the last part of the book, Carroll enters the realm of ethics. I think this is the weakest part of the book. Carroll comes out swinging against well-motivated, even if unsuccessful, efforts to search for objective morality. He claims that science cannot help us in determining what is moral and what is not. Instead he offers moral constructivism, a poorly described framework that treads dangerously close to moral relativism.He defends compatibilist view of free will along the lines of philosopher Daniel Dennett. He also offers his own version of Ten Commandments, which are, of course, better than those found in the Bible, but, imho, worse than what you could find in Michael Shermer‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoral Arc.‚Äù Discussion of problems of studying consciousness is interesting, even though you‚Äôll find no new insights but it can be useful to read if you haven‚Äôt immersed yourself in literature on the topic. Few people do. But if you are not a nerd like me, you might find a lot of new things here :).  This book shines when Carroll returns to cosmology and physics. I found quite gripping the part on the origins of life. Discussion of the metabolism-first hypothesis was fascinating. An amazing quote ‚ÄúLife is nothing but an electron looking for a place to rest‚Äù (Carroll quotes Nobel Prize-winning physiologist Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi here). And, of course, the big hero of the book was entropy. It is discussed in length and helped me, a non-physicist, better understand its immense role in our universe.  I really enjoyed some parts of this incredibly provocative and ambitious volume. In other parts, the book was not quite convincing. But that‚Äôs fine. This is still a tremendous work and a really great text. You must have noticed that one of my favorite authors is neuroscientist/philosopher Sam Harris. I like his books and generally agree with him on many an issue. Known to be one of ‚Äúthe four horses of non-apocalypse‚Äù and one of the key figures of ‚Äúnew atheism‚Äù (whatever that is), Sam has an army of vocal opponents. Some (like Reza Aslan) knowingly twist his words and distort his views, trying to paint him as a right-wing enabler or even a racist. These days this is what you get for simply indicating that some religious beliefs are more dangerous than others. For instance, Jainism doesn‚Äôt have the same problematic dogmas as, say, Islam. However, there are well-intentioned and well-argued criticisms of Sam Harris‚Äôs views. To name a few, some came from Fareed Zakaria on religion (even though I tend to agree with Sam on this one), Kevin Kelly on AI, Daniel Dennett and Sean Carroll on free will. Quite a lot of worthy criticism came regarding Sam‚Äôs book ‚ÄúMoral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values.‚Äù Noteworthy criticism came from Thomas Nagel, Yuval Noah Harari and, again, Sean Carroll. Having read books by these authors, I have to say, they are careful thinkers, and they converge in many ways even if it first seems that they bitterly disagree. Some arguments get resolved. For instance, Dennett and Harris seem to have buried the hatchet. I don‚Äôt see why a compatibilist and a determinist couldn‚Äôt smoke the peace pipe. Harris also corrected himself regarding the role of science. He now says that it can contribute to determining our values. And by science he means not just hard science but also philosophy. So there you go. We need to listen to one another. THEN and only THEN moral progress is possible."

134,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52679566-matthew-gillingham,3,"To start, there are many aspects of this book I did find truly interesting and enlightening. Mr. Carroll is a good writer and intelligent theoretical physicist. He attempted a very comprehensive explanation of everything and did a generally okay job of connecting everything back to a natural world. The science is talked down (which is fine with me, because I am new to study Physics), but this turns into a book of philosophy. The discussion about quantum mechanics, core theory and field theory we very educational and gave me a great perspective on how the physical world works. However, as one gets further into the book his ideas begin to sound more arrogant and condescending to other ideas or explanations. He was quick and decisive to cut many other theories and destroy Theism to its very core. He explanations began with how the microscopic world works naturally and with change and become more complex through arrow of time (entropy) and emergent processes. This seemed to work in the beginning but then he began to contradict himself. Naturalism from my understanding only accepts the most fundamental explanations of the physical world. This means that anything above fundamental or 'emergent' is basically an illusion. Carroll takes this idea and adapts it to a ""Poetic Naturalism"" which is everything that is fundamental and emergent has a certain vocabulary or useful talk in their domain of applicability. In other words, if we can talk about it and it makes sense in the domain we are investigating it is real and okay to talk about. Unfortunately, this is where the book goes truly philosophical. I could go into explaining the Bayesian reasoning and Chinese rooms and transgender being talked about in two different domains, but the kicker is when he discusses consciousness and decisions. Within two chapters, right around part 6, he suggests the natural universe is already set and that we as people have free will to choose. He carefully tries to tread between explaining free will is truly physical and that we should be cautious when talking across multiple vocabularies. This seems rather convenient when trying to promote ""Poetic Naturalism"" to leave a legacy for himself. He explains that with all knowledge of the natural universe and equations to explain it we could accurately predict the future, however, we are too mentally incapable that we cannot accomplish this. Therefore, the way we talk about free will and choices is real, because though the path of the universe is determined we don't know it, so our decisions feel real. Then, in the very next chapter, he tries to inspire us that we can assign meaning to our lives by making it up ourselves through our decisions! This seems counterintuitive to say the least. If in reality, our universe is already in a way predetermined what's the point of making up meaning when no matter what we do is already going to be in accordance to what physics dictates in the natural universe. This is where the argument against me would be the do not use multiple vocabularies from different domains comes into play. Well, to be honest, this was done by Carroll when writing off free will in the first place. In my opinion, Carroll is a very intelligent and astute individual, though a little arrogant and overconfident in his ideas. However, its hard to for me to accept every aspect of what he said because he admits to not know everything about the natural world, but enough to have very low credences in certain profound beliefs. Which is a nice way of saying your ideas are dumb and nothing happens when you die. Which I may be able to accept and move on with my life. Nevertheless, because we are of the natural world and live within the natural world; I believe we will never fully understand the full workings of the universe, multiverse or existence. We cannot get out of the universe we are in and therefore are bound by its physics. This does not mean there is nothing else or that universe will just end in a cold abyss of existence and nothing will ever happen again for eternity. That seems to me to be a waste of existence, though Carroll would be quick to say, ""The universe doesn't care; it will just follow the law of physics."" Lastly, I will not dismiss the knowledge of physics or the natural world that I learned from the book and will continue to contemplate just how everything works. However, this book seems to be missing something. After, reading it I feel empty, meaningless and downright insignificant. Quite frankly, if Carroll believes every word of this I do not know how he gets out of bed in the morning. The lack of meaning or free will is disheartening, not inspiring. Do I keep asking myself why be me? "
135,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"I've seen Caroll's name pop up here and there, but never read or heard anything until I stumbled upon a clip of his in Joe Rogan explaining Laplacian Determinism, and I really enjoyed it. I liked his personality and I found his way of explaining engaging. I listened to the whole episode afterward, and at some point, he mentioned he had a book on the meaning of life, where he tried to bridge many disciplines together. That was music to my ears given I find that's always where the most value comes from if you do it properly. He also seemed to take philosophy seriously, which gave me some confidence that he might have something worth saying. The whole book is based on what he calls poetic naturalism. Which tries to be the bridge between a sort of reductivist nihilistic materialism and everyday life. What is ultimately real is the quantum world. Our everyday world is purely a human construct (chairs, love, nations), but a useful construct that we are right in regarding as real. A decent portion of the book is sort of a pop-science and pop-philosophy introduction. Although I don't mean that necessarily in a wrong way. It makes it pretty accessible and tries to provide a foundation of what he tries to argue later. A lot of it is to justify a naturalistic worldview, with a supernatural or religious worldview as the antagonist. I find this usually done very poorly. However, I found his approach a lot more humble and grounded than many famous new atheists like Dawkins or Sam Harris. Which I attribute to his above-average philosophical literacy compared to most in that community. Although Dennet is quite an accomplished philosopher, so maybe a good dosing of humility is also required. His Bayesian approach was particularly well-argued. Although not in such technical terms, that was always what drew me towards a naturalistic worldview when I was younger. It shows, to the extent possible, why that worldview is ""rational"" (or at least why it has some reasoning). I think it provided the best foundation for it out of anything that I have seen. It is mostly based on Hume and with a fancier repackaging and aided by modern statistics and scientific advancements, but he does credit Hume and his presentation of it was well done. The chapter on biology and the emergence of life was also incredibly fascinating and I learned a lot of new things.Nevertheless, despite many positives, I disliked certain things. For one, while I understand and value his approach to naturalism, I do think it ends up being a bit reductionist at times. And while I found him much humbler than most in his position, nevertheless there was a few cases where I thought he overstepped and could have handled the topic better. His understanding of religion is also not the greatest and often misinterprets what its trying to achieve and its role in understanding the role. Often trying to impose a materialistic worldview into a religious one, much like many on the opposite side trying to impose a religious worldview into a materialistic one. Neither works. This was particularly odd to me because he constantly emphasizes the point of that any model is useful for any given context. From Newtonian mechanics to Einstein's relativity, quantum fields, and even our everyday life, with things like relationships. Everything works in its own domain, but if you try to bring one language into another field, it breaks down. Yet he repeatedly mixed a religious and materialistic worldview.In addition, I disliked almost everything he wrote on consciousness. I understand where he comes from, and I think he argues his side well enough, but to be brutally honest I just think he is wrong. He tries to make as if the problems that we have in consciousness aren't problems at all and that's why they have been unsolvable. I didn't quite buy it. And unfortunately, consciousness permeates a fair bit of the book, since it's rather important to retain a coherent naturalistic philosophy. Overall, I quite enjoyed it. I think he did a brilliant job of combining several fields together, exactly what I hoped for. His writing is very good, and I found the structure of the book well organized. Presents science at its best and the appeal and reasoning of a naturalistic worldview against a supernatural one. I disagreed with some topics, but that's mostly disagreeing with his position than anything else. But I think he argued well for his side. Especially for those new to these types of topics like philosophy and religion and want to dip their toes, I think this is a brilliant book. "
136,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91599624-andrew,5,"Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist from Caltech, masterfully merges science, religion, and philosophy in this fantastic tour de force, investigating the origins of life, consciousness, and the universe itself.Carroll begins his work with a section titled ""Cosmos"", wherein he gives a very brief overview of the foundation of modern physics: quantum field theory. As best as we can tell, all of reality can be described by fluctuations in fields which permeate the whole of the universe. Carroll even dissects an equation in an Appendix which describes the interactions between our mathematical representations of quantum mechanics, spacetime, gravity, the electroweak force, mass, and more. (An equation which will be familiar to any physics graduate students.)Carroll espouses naturalism, the belief that all the laws and forces that explain the world ultimately have natural (as opposed to supernatural) causes. But he also notes that quantum field theory is just one way of talking about the universe. Different descriptions of nature are useful in different contexts; for instance, Newtonian gravity is extremely useful for describing books falling off of shelves, planets orbiting stars, and even for landing people on the Moon. But it fails to accurately describe the motions of objects moving close to the speed of light or near extremely massive objects (where relativity is required) and in the quantum regime (where no compelling theory has yet been discovered).This doesn't mean that Newton's theory is wrong, just that it's only applicable (and useful) in a particular domain. Carroll believes that useful theories are those that do a good job describing and predicting behavior of the physical world in a particular regime. Different theories can have overlapping regimes, but it can be dangerous to use the terminology of one regime to describe another. Carroll calls this philosophy poetic naturalism, introducing it early in this work and using it as a framework to tie together the rest of the book.Carroll touches on emergence, the idea that complex -- even unpredictable -- behavior can arise from a large system of simple components interacting via simple rules, and gives statistical mechanics / thermodynamics as an example. An individual molecule, for example, has certain motional degrees of freedom when it has a certain amount of kinetic energy available. A gas of a large number of these molecules has ""a temperature"", which is an emergent property of the underlying molecules' kinetic energies. It's difficult (even counterproductive) to use the vocabulary of individual molecules when trying to deduce a theory of fluid dynamics, but it's nonsensical to try to determine the ""temperature"" of an individual molecule. These theories describe the same system, but over different domains of applicability.Carroll discusses how emergence, combined with the boundary conditions of the universe (namely, extremely low entropy in the very early universe) allow complex systems to evolve over time without violating any known physical laws. The arrow of time and the phenomenon of emergence allow for the evolution of life, the complexity of the human brain, and even consciousness.""So what's the point?"" In his conclusion, Carroll tackles the question that many atheists face when asked to confront the apparent absurdity of a life without God. Carroll's answer is that there is no meaning to life save for the meaning individual humans ascribe to it. But the fact that human beings have evolved from these simple physical principles and exist to ascribe any meaning to the universe is an honest-to-goodness miracle in and of itself, no God required: ""our emergence has brought meaning and mattering into the world.""In the words of the inimitable Carl Sagan, ""these are some of the things that hydrogen atoms do, given fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution."""
137,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91651788-ben-jones,5,"1-10 Takeaways:1) The scientific community has done away with the idea of cause and effect. Not to say that there is no cause and effect but that cause and effect is not a fundamental principle of how the universe works. Cause and effect (unless in an emergent context) is a left over Aristotelian belief; but, we haven't updated our way of looking at the world (proud of myself for using the word ""Aristotelian""). Motion, for example, is better understood as forces ""doing their thing"" rather than effects having causes. 2) Holding onto the belief of cause and effect would regularly result in tracking causes all the way back to the erroneous ""unmoved mover"" (gap based religion/faith). 3) Laplace posited that the universe is not cause and effect but patterns. Laplace was the first to point out that you can predict what is happening to an object at *any* point of motion. The future and the past of an object are equally known because they are determined by the laws of nature (core theory equation). 3 is not the cause of 4; the pattern is just 3 and then 4 (the universe should be seen like this). There is not an impulse, enchantment or guiding force; instead, the universe is a series of patterns. 4) Particles Field Theory shows that all particles and forces relevant to everyday life are known. We can imagine other particles or forces but they do not exist/impact our everyday lives. 5) Emergence Theory says that an entity can have traits that its parts do not. For example understanding the world on a macro level through cause and effect, arrow of time, etc. is fine.6) Entropy always increases but complexity comes and goes. The complexity of humans at a point later in the timeline of the universe is compatible with the overall increase of entropy overtime. 7) Life is a feature, not a substance. Heat, for example, is a way to talk about molecules. Life, is a way to talk about molecules. Life is not a substance. 8) All questions in life could be answered by, ""because of the law of physics and the initial conditions of the universe""; but, on a macro/emergent level it is perfectly fine explaining cause and effect (for example, why is a giraffe's neck long?). 9) In the C. Elegan's flatworm, its neurons were mapped and one neuron was found to tell the flatworm if it was looking at itself or something else. This could be a good demonstration of what is consciousness/what is the origin of consciousness. 10) Mind Body Problem through the lens of Descartes is that there is a material body but an immaterial mind. Princess Elisabeth challenged Descartes, asking him to explain how the immaterial mind would influence a material body. Descartes could not (along with everyone else, for that matter) supply a satisfactory answer. We know all the particles and forces in play on the human body. 11) (Whoops, technically supposed to stop at 10) Carroll introduces what he calls ""Poetic Naturalism."" Poetic Naturalism is the idea that the only forces are the natural forces but that it is okay to see/understand yourself beyond particles and forces on an emergent level. If you were to see yourself as simply particles and forces then there is no room for freewill, right and wrong, etc.; but, on an emergent level, you can attribute to yourself freewill, right and wrong, etc. This is problematic for people who want objective answers about meaning, right and wrong, etc. because these things cannot be observed on a micro level. There will never be enough science to definitively prove meaning; but, you get to assign your own meaning to your life. 1-10 Questions:1) If you hold a certain faith, do you see your faith (deity, deity powers, etc.) as immaterial? If so, how do you explain your immaterial faith influencing you materially? 2) If you hold a certain faith, why do you choose it? Do you choose your faith as an explanation of the origin of life, a proper code of ethics for your life, because of community, because of personal experience, etc.?"
138,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015304-frank-jude,5,"Theoretical physicist, Sean Carroll, offers an amazingly detailed, coherent, and comprehensive survey of what physics has to tell us about ""the origins of life, meaning, and the universe itself."" Carroll is one of the most elegant, lucid and accessible of the current crop of science writers, perhaps the best since Carl Sagan, and like Sagan, he offers a humanistic, naturalistic view chock full of insights while connecting the dots from varied fields like history, philosophy, art, and science. He begins with a definition and description of the ""Cosmos"" as he details the fundamental nature of reality and the core particle theory, time's arrow and his particular worldview he calls ""Poetic Naturalism.""Quoting the poet Muriel Rukeyser, Carroll writes: ""The universe is made of stories, not of atoms"" and then goes on to say, ""The world is what exists and what happens, but we gain enormous insight by talking about it -- telling its story -- in different ways."" So what does he mean by ""Poetic Naturalism?""Naturalism comes down to three things, he says:1. There is only one world, the natural world.2. The world evolves according to unbroken patterns, the laws of nature.3. The only reliable way of learning about the world is by observing it.Basically, ""naturalism"" rejects anything supernatural, and says that the world is revealed to us by scientific investigation. The ""poetic"" aspect comes into play when we begin to speak about that world. It's three points are:1. There are many ways of talking about the world.2. All good ways of talking must be consistent with one another.3. Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.The stories we tell about that world are of three kinds:1. The deepest, most fundamental level: you and I are a collection of sub-atomic particles.2. The emergent, effective level: I am a man named Frank Jude and you are the reader of this review, each of us with our own histories of experience. An eliminativist would say that this level is just an illusion because what we are is simply a collection of sub-atomic parts. A poetic naturalist would say we are no less real for that fundamental level being true. We could speak about us getting up in the morning and making our coffee at that sub-atomic level, but it is more descriptive and helpful to speak about ""us"" waking up and making that coffee.3. The level of ""values"" where concepts of right and wrong, purpose, and aesthetics comes in to play. This coffee is better than the coffee made by Starbucks, and the music I am listening while drinking it has more depth and beauty than the shit played on AM radio.He follows this part with ""Understanding"" where he writes about how we learn about the world, critical thinking, belief, and what we can know about the world based upon the core theory. ""Essence"" covers quantum mechanics and does a good job of explaining why those woo-meisters (who shall remain nameless here) are either intellectually dishonest or simply do not understand what they are talking about. ""Complexity"" introduces emergence and as a poetic naturalist, Carroll doesn't minimize or discount the ""reality"" of emergent properties. With Part Five, he turns his attention to ""Thinking"" and discussing the emergence of consciousness, with a whole section looking at the so-called ""hard problem"" and philosophical zombies and other exercises that he shows ultimately fail to do what they are meant to do. He ends his tome with ""Caring"" where, as a naturalist, he refuses to pull any punches in his discussion of values and ethics.A brilliant tour de force, I recommend this to anyone interested in thinking about ""life, meaning and the universe itself!"""
139,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34910666-christopher-pope,4,"In the end this book was great. For the fact that I have never come across such a comprehensive exploration of metaphysical existence, this book alone is a winner. For the fact that this book is so well researched, supported, written, and fair/balanced make it an all time great. Well maybe not a classic, but still a great read. that‚Äôs not to say there weren‚Äôt flaws. Despite the extremely impressive diversity of opinion and supporting materials used here (from Einstein to Hume to Aristotle to Darwin and everyone in between), the self-proclaimed atheistic poetic naturalist of an author really evangelized his personal conclusions about existence a bit too much. In particular, there were a number of occasions (particularly as it related to God/theism and consciousness) where the author glossed over basic arguments and simply asserted his truth without context in favor of fallacy. Now I can‚Äôt expect an atheist to understand theism (and it‚Äôs VAST depth and breadth of philosophical schools) well enough to properly and fairly portray its defense here, but there were just enough glaring ‚Äúreally?‚Äù moments in some of the assertions about theism and consciousness to irk me. Especially juxtaposed to very intelligent fallacy-free discussion of other topics. It‚Äôs as though this clearly thoughtful, intelligent interlocuteur decided to turn on the middle school debate class switch in his brain only to turn it back off on the next page. With that said, overall, I was rather impressed at how fair and articulate this scientist was at being analytical and detailed about physics and scientific details while being equally adept at exploring and arguing philosophically. Even to his ultimate conclusion, he was able to reject theism and existential purpose without projecting nihilism in favor of ‚Äúpoetry‚Äù. He was able to convincingly air opinions of meaning, purpose, and value about existence while appealing to nothing but his own commitment to Bayesian existentialism. It was fair and honest about its subjective conclusions while still being willing to admit its potential faults. In the end there are always more questions to answer and plenty of looming discrepancies and inadequacies and unknowns in our universe despite the author‚Äôs sometimes absolutist assertions, but many questions herein are answered skillfully and satisfactorily.For that, and that alone I can‚Äôt hold this books flaws against it. But there‚Äôs so much more value here than just that: from being a well-written and engaging book to being an essential and exceptional volume of current metaphysical thought to having just enough detail to project expertise but not enough to bore to being surprisingly fair and balanced in (mostly) allowing the reader to understand both sides of an argument. I also really enjoyed the author‚Äôs commitment to staying founded in physical sciences while trying to tackle huge seemingly non-physical ideas. He did a great job at weaving philosophy and physics together in a rather convincing and enlightening way. This book was a fantastic mental exercise in all the right ways, and it‚Äôs a great one for both beginners and more experienced students of existential thought. It‚Äôs hard to not come away with some new ideas from this book regardless of your biases. Though, it should be clear to readers to not take these ideas as doctrine or without grains of salt. There‚Äôs a lot of good here, but a lot is ignorant of large are more nuanced arguments in favor or the simplified and conclusive picture the author is trying to paint. It‚Äôs still a pretty picture in the end, but one that admittedly isn‚Äôt absolute or complete I n its beauty. "
140,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"The Big Picture is a highly ambitious project and whether you agree with all the conclusions or not, you will walk away with many new understandings and marvel at its own internal consistency. In this book finally, we have a natural science professor trying to give his unapologetic, no holds barred, rationalists' view on the nature or purpose of existence. Unlike many other scientists (at least in public domain), he does not shrug off what is unexplained by sciences to the realm of supernatural. And unlike many other rationalist philosophers, the author can and does use exhaustive his scientific knowledge well to make genuinely interesting points. The author's overall construct is novel and impressive although it might be incomplete for an academic philosopher and good enough only for a popular science book. May be, it is not original either but it is for a book of this genre in the readings of this reviewer.The main conclusion, in my words, is that any consistent and falsifiable theory that tries to explain what is going on around in our world is a part of a naturalist's bag of things to understand the world. The following are the main provisos: - Such a theory should be valid in some ways to explain (past or present or future) a part of the world around us - It should be falsifiable with more evidences (explained through Bayesian priors)- It will only be valid in its domain of applicability. Bosons and fermions cannot explain how a cell functions or a theory of cells cannot explain how Facebook evolves - for instance Try explaining water pressure or properties through Hydrogen and Oxygen! - No model can explain all the emergent or manifested facets of reality. New characteristics emerge when one changes the scale (or context of things). This is clearly true when one is dealing with chemicals where compound products have wholly different properties compared to the underlying.The author talks about this being true across realms (from quarks to protons to elements etc all the way to galaxies or from atoms to cells all the way to life, consciousness and history).- And all such theories should be internally consistent.The book goes on to explain some of these island theories that explain existence. Through the usual bag of theories, including relativity, quantum mechanics, biochemistry and evolution, the author describes emergence of ever rising complexity amid perpetually increasing overall chaos (entropy). The author loses his way somewhat when he tries to apply systematic knowledge to human subjects like consciousness, morality, politics and other social/personal issues that have dogged philosophers from time immemorial. If consciousness, for instance, is an emerging phenomenon from physical brain states (like society from a group of individuals), is it totally wrong to talk about it in Cartesian dualistic way (for example once again, is water more than hydrogen and oxygen)? This is where many of the conclusions smack of dogma borne out of pre-conceived biases rather than a result of scientific inquiry. Many overall conclusions on the meaning and the purpose or the way to behave etc will likely warm all rationalist readers but for some conclusions at least, their foundations are as far away from a rational inquiry as in many other fields."
141,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/729074-james,4,"Carroll is a great writer: informational but not didactic, self-assured but not smug. I loved his point of view and would highly recommend this book to anyone, but I'm going to use this space to talk about my problems with the book rather than lavish praise upon it.Carroll argues for a worldview called ""poetic naturalism,"" essentially making a three-part case: (1) the human mind organizes and comprehends existence using stories; (2) science is our best way of telling those stories; and (3) the more our stories accurately reflect reality, the better job we can do of figuring out how to live our lives. The third part of this argument comes in sections 5 and 6 of the book, which focus on consciousness and ethics, respectively. Carroll doesn‚Äôt have a very good scientific theory of either consciousness or ethics (which is okay, because neither does anyone else), so he spends a lot of time caught up in overwrought arguments against fanciful thought experiments like ""the Chinese room"" and ""Mary's room,"" and a truly baffling chapter debating whether or not zombies are plausible (spoiler: they aren't).The point Carroll is trying to get across in the book (usually very successfully) is that the universe can both be one big monistic thing (i.e. a quantum wave function) and an experiential reality which we describe in narrative terms. Thus from a human perspective we should retain any stories or models which we find ‚Äúuseful,‚Äù even if we know they're not strictly ""true."" But of course usefulness is necessarily a subjective trait. For example, when discussing the existential crisis that has bubbled up in millions of minds upon realizing that humans are collections of atoms performing largely without conscious thought, Carroll dismisses it as mere ‚Äúgrumpiness.‚Äù His counter-example is that a theist who later becomes an atheist doesn‚Äôt find their experience of life diminished just because they‚Äôve stopped believing in God. The problem with this example is that it's plain wrong; a lot of people do find it hard to hold onto love or joy when their ontology shifts. There are many examples like this in the book, in which Carroll tries to empathize with other points of view but ultimately betrays his biases.Similarly, when Carroll grapples with questions of spirituality or the supernatural, his arguments are entirely too Western. The argument that the universe is one big uncontrived monistic thing overlaid with a bunch of contrived human stories is a foundational idea in many Buddhist schools of thought. I'm not trying to say that Buddhism is just a primitive form of quantum physics, but that it represents an ancient and popular mode of thought that Carroll entirely fails to engage with. At one point, he refers to Plato‚Äôs model of the mind as a rider steering two horses, and echoes Jonathan Haight's counter-argument that it is actually more like a person riding on an elephant; again, this is almost precisely how most schools of Buddhism depict the mind, and it would have given extra dimension to poetic naturalism as a philosophy to see it engage with something other than Western Christianity. These are just two examples I can easily access because I‚Äôm a student of Buddhism, but I‚Äôm sure there are many other examples that students of other spiritual or philosophical traditions might find."
142,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15571676-joy,5,"""Poetic naturalism is a philosophy of freedom and responsibility. The raw materials of life are given to us by the natural world, and we must work to understand them and accept the consequences.

Synchronic meaning depends on your state of being at any one moment in time: you are happy because you are out in the sunshine. Diachronic meaning depends on the journey you are on: you are happy because you are making progress toward a college degree. If we permit ourselves to take inspiration from what we have learned about ontology, it might suggest that we focus more on diachronic meaning at the expense of synchronic.

143,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7847330-ragavendra-natarajan,4,"‚ÄúThe Big Picture‚Äù is a towering exposition on naturalism - more specifically poetic naturalism. The idea of naturalism itself isn‚Äôt new. In fact it‚Äôs markedly ancient. However, Carroll brings his expertise of Physics to paint a very convincing treatise on naturalism (not the this naturalist reader needed much convincing), and makes a strong case for the ‚Äúpoetic‚Äù part of the philosophy.Carroll begins with how it‚Äôs useful to use different vocabularies to talk about different aspects of the world at different levels, although the vocabulary might not reflect the fundamental ontology. In particular, we see discussions about how ‚Äúcauses‚Äù and ‚Äúreasons‚Äù are very useful ways of talking about humans and the world as we know it, but they don‚Äôt reflect the fundamental nature of the world. The impersonal laws of physics do not allude or recognize causes/reasons. A lot of our notion of order/sequence of events, which in turn makes the vocabulary of ‚Äúcauses‚Äù and ‚Äúreasons‚Äù useful, can be traced back to the arrow of time - the fact that the universe is continually moving from a state of low entropy to a state of high entropy.We then spend time talking about how to understand this universe. What does it mean to truly know? Is it right to say that we ‚Äúknow‚Äù gravity just as well as we know the Pythagoras theorem? Since science is a based on observations through instruments/senses, how do we deal with the fundamental incompleteness in the knowledge? Enter Bayesian reasoning. There is no single, complete way of describing the universe. Different models are useful at different levels, and are helpful in their domain of applicability. The ideas of ‚Äúemergence‚Äù and ‚Äústrong emergence‚Äù are talked about in detail, which I found thoroughly interesting.The book then moves on to describe the current best ideas of physics that describe the fundamental nature of our world - quantum physics and core theory - and how these ideas together can completely describe everything about the world in its domain of applicability.The next section goes on to talk about the ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù phenomenon of complex life. This, to me, was one of the most fascinating sections of the book. Drawing a parallel between the emergence of apparent complexity during the process of coffee and cream mixing together in a cup, and the apparent complexity of the entire universe during the process of moving from the Big Bang to the final heat death of the universe was one of the big takeaways from the book for me.We then discuss one of the great all-time mysteries - consciousness - and how it can be explained by the framework of poetic naturalism which is a fundamentally physical philosophy affording no room for the non-physical. Since much of the science of consciousness is unknown, the arguments presented for naturalism have counter-arguments. Carroll does a fair job of describing differing viewpoints and refrains from definitive statements. We also encounter the great problem of free-will, its implications on actions and consequences, and how poetic naturalism advocates a compatibilistic view of the problem.Finally the book talks about how we can define meaning and purpose in this uncaring, impersonal universe as uncovered by naturalism. We talk about how there no objective morals and no inherent purpose to the entire universe, let alone our existence and our place in it (an unnerving prospect indeed!). But this isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it is liberating since it provides us with a blank slate to define our own morals and discover a purpose for our existence. A weighty responsibility but not one that is beyond us. This is Carroll is at his poetic best.This is a dense book which is chock full of ideas and concepts (most of which are well known). But the real value for me was that it helped answer, or at any rate clarify, a bunch of questions that I‚Äôve spent time thinking about. It is possible that I especially liked this book since it helped cement many notions that I already held but could not formulate with clarity, however, I believe this book can enjoyed by people from other philosophical backgrounds as well."

It makes me laugh every single time.Much like Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (one of the best books I've ever read), The Big Picture is a splash of very cold water on the face of anyone who thinks there is anything supernatural in the universe. I don't love reading about physics, but I accept the conclusions of physicists: the universe--everything in it, including me and you--is made up of particles. Particles interact in logical ways. Wave functions, strings, fields, whatever the quantum physicists want to call it all, everything is made of stuff. Beyond the stuff? Nothing. Entropy is real. Time--is it emergent, or fundamental?--passes. Goodness and meaning are ideas that we bring to our existence (again, shades of Yuval Noah Harari). Many of our ideas, like the Bible telling people not to wack off-- are not terribly useful. Other ideas are positive illusions: things people believe in to make themselves feel better, or to create meaning in their lives. And so on. Marcus Aurelius wrote that ""all that exists is, in a manner, the seed of what which will be,"" and he was more right than he knew. Everything that happens next in our universal reality depends entirely on what's happening right now. The miracle isn't that a god created us with souls that can win or lose eternal bliss by our adherence to rules laid out in old books, but that we are, as Carl Sagan said, a way that the cosmos knows itself. From the leptons and quarks and fields of our quantum stuff, our consciousness has arisen, and it is that consciousness that creates so many wonderful things: science. The Avengers. Cheeseburgers. Poetry. Bikinis. Monster movies. Philosophy. Coffee. Love.That's pretty amazing. The author calls all of this 'poetic naturalism,' and I think that's as good a term as I have ever heard. A hard book, but well written and interesting. Complex but not unbearable to read."
145,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16232688-ken-hainsworth,4,"I was first introduced to theoretical physicist Sean Carroll via his podcast. For his 100th episode he gave a brief summary of some of the ideas in this book. There are two main questions this book attempts to answer: 1) is naturalism the best explanation for the world around us, including the biggest one, our brains and consciousness itself? (Spoiler alert: he says yes). The second question is, given the naturalist worldview, is there any room for things like ""purpose"" or ""meaning""?Probably over three fourths of the book is devoted to trying to answer the first question, and he does a pretty convincing job. If you are coming in to this book with an already naturalist viewpoint on our universe, then you will still be pleased to find some unique concepts and explanations. For example, the idea of ""emergence"" and what he calls ""poetic naturalism"" are big themes throughout the book. An emergent phenomenon is one that uses a certain useful internally consistent description of the world, while not being the most absolute fundamental level at which these things can be understood. A really basic example is using fluid mechanics to describe the air in the room. Just because we know that the air is really made up of gluons and quarks and stuff, does this mean that ""fluids"" don't really exist or we shouldn't use them to describe the world? The same applies to cells, living organisms, and even human behavior, brains, and consciousness. All of this makes for some not so subtle pushback against the trendy idea in some circles that ""consciousness"" or ""choice"" doesn't exist in any meaningful sense. It's possible to understand that the world is made up of particles and fields on a fundamental level, and still accept that emergent descriptions about human behavior and life are useful and even essential ways of understanding it.Only the last few chapters are exclusively dedicated to discussing the ideas of purpose and meaning, and whether or not they exist. I really liked these chapters, and wish these ideas had been expanded a bit more. The bottom line is that even if ethics and morality are not built into the universe at an intrinsic level, they are certainly worthwhile endeavors. In fact, we need to do much more work than we are currently in making sure our ethical system catches up with the rapid technological and scientific changes occurring around us. My favorite answer to the question, does anything in life matter? ""The universe doesn't care about us, but we care about the universe. That's what makes us special."" ""Whenever we ask ourselves whether something matters, the answer has to be found in whether it matters to some person or persons."""
146,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46427523-kurt,4,"I picked this book up partly out of my enthusiasm for science and partly out of the name recognition for Sean Carroll. Like many books I‚Äôve been reading lately, there was much to love about this book and a few things that left me a little disappointed. First off, I loved the amount of information in this book. Carroll doesn‚Äôt talk over your head, but he doesn‚Äôt really dumb it down too much either. He gives a fairly good explanation of science‚Äôs current understanding of the origins of the universe and the origins of life. And I really like how Carroll has a easy-to-understand way to talk about entropy and it‚Äôs effect on complexity. I felt like the way that he addressed the various philosophical issues that have commonly arisen alongside these ideas were handled well, and were well balanced. That‚Äôs not something that you typically see in books of this nature. By coincidence, I had happened to be reading a Christian apologetic book at the same time as I was reading this. It made for an an interesting dichotomy. Unlike the apologetics book, Carroll isn‚Äôt shy about honestly addressing other points of view, and seeing how and why we might, or might not, have credence in certain ideas. He sets forth what we think is likely true, and isn‚Äôt ashamed to state what we have no clue about. There‚Äôs a real honesty about his writing, and at least a sense of the breadth of human knowledge on these subjects. One of my main complaints about this book, was also ironically something I kind of liked about it: I feel like it was too broad in its scope. On the one hand, it was kind of interesting to see how all of these ideas could flow together with Carroll‚Äôs idea of Poetic Naturalism. But on the other, I also found myself wishing I had just a little more information about the subject I was reading about, before I was jerked along to the next one. The chapters where this seemed to be the starkest where those dealing with consciousness. I‚Äôve become interested in this idea of how consciousness might be just an emergent property of a complex enough of a brain. I was kind of hoping I‚Äôd get a better sense of what that means, or how it would work. But Carroll didn‚Äôt provide much more information about it, beyond the basic idea of complexity and emergence. I guess that might really be the current state of the science around it. There‚Äôs still so much that‚Äôs unknown. But the fact that he was addressing something that‚Äôs so much less understood than all of the other topics of the book, made the last section feel disjointed and, at times, unnecessary. "
147,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11375563-michael-huang,5,"Lucid exposition of an entire belief system/world view Carroll calls poetic naturalism. Naturalism is the view there is a nature and it follows discoverable laws. Poetic refers to the fact you can have multiple compatible laws describing the same thing at different levels of detail. Which one is most useful is up to you. You have the poetic license to make such a choice.I remember Karl Popper was said to be the favorite philosopher of scientists and engineers. Carroll offers himself up as a serious contender for that title. Of course, a lot of the basic tenets are not necessarily new, but Carroll offers a latest iteration of update and interpretation. His analysis is sharp and to the point. Case in point, a lot of people jumped on the notion of fine-tuning to immediately re-embrace theism. Carroll will show you that the theism explains precisely nothing about the fine-tuning. In fact, you are just suffering from confirmation bias. When you read a typical philosophical work, there are almost always passages that get you more and more confused, even though ever so subtly. One concept/argument not yet well defined is expended to more and more sentences, each subject to some additional degree of uncertainty in interpretation. But voila, at the end of long passage, the conclusion is extraordinarily proved beyond reasonable doubt. And you are left none the wiser. It is when the philosophers use concrete examples when the ambiguity is minimized. This is the time when their non-clear thinking is exposed and can thus be debunked. John Searle produced the Chinese room analogy. Now we understand that he doesn‚Äôt comprehend the property of emergence. This is an unmitigated good thing for all involved. The readers need not worry there is some deep meaning the writing is conveying that we just didn‚Äôt get. The author can now update his/her knowledge to be more complete. The meaning of life or how to live your life are issues that come up a lot in philosophical writing. Carroll will calmly admit the knowledge of the nature doesn‚Äôt give you any conclusion. Here again Searle begged to differ and tried to use many sentences to prove one can derive ethics (‚Äùought to‚Äù) from what is. Carroll shows that Searle snuck in an assumption in one step of his ‚Äúderivation‚Äù. Even though poetic naturalism doesn‚Äôt give you a prescription on ethics, it does warn you away from the false complacency associated with the conviction that some morals are objectively the best. Overall, this is what you expect from a true scientist: you‚Äôll be told what we do and do not know."
148,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5961369-christopher-donaghue,3,"3.5This is a very disorderly book, jumping around a lot more than I would have liked. He is at his best when he talks about biology (surprisingly, considering he is a physicist), and at his worst talking about physics. He is a bully when it comes to physics; he has a couple chapters, as I recall, where he goes on about how there can never be total certainty, yadda yadda, but then he gets to The Core Theory and he brazenly announces that, in one thousand years, the Core Theory will be recognizable in its current, 2016 form; he claims that it is not going to be tossed out, though it will undoubtedly be made more precise over time. What the hell happened to ""we can never have certainty"" and ""everything human is subject to error and cognitive bias""?!?While this book is called The Big Picture, it really seems more like a bunch of snapshots rather than a single coherent image. Some chapters were just downright obnoxious to read, and I wanted to give up around chapter 20, but then it really picked up around chapter 30 and I began to really enjoy the book. Had the entire book been closer to the last half, I'd have given it a 5 star rating. Instead, I am giving it a half-way 3.5, between the 2-star beginning and the 5-star ending. But that is not to say that the last half is perfect! Oh, no; far from it. The last section of the book, in particular, I found fairly difficult to read. Not difficult in the e=mc^2 sense (which was somewhat the case at first, but he does a pretty decent job at explaining things), but difficult in the ""oh god are you really going to get into the meaning of ethics here?!?"" sense. Yeah, that's right: he jumps from physics, some history of science, biology, and ultimately to morality! I think this was the greatest mistake; here you have a decent book that is taking a good look at relatively objective science, and you end it with discussing deontology and consequentialism. I understand why, I just don't think it was the best idea.Still, in general, I wouldn't recommend against reading this book. There is a huge amount of information contained within a pretty small book, comparatively. He makes good use of thought experiments to elucidate otherwise more complicated issues in science, and offers a very masterful hand to guide the reader on the tour of the universe. It is a good book, but it is flawed nonetheless."
149,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51836314-kenneth-bachmann,4,"One must appreciate the enormity of this undertaking by Sean Carroll who is no doubt extremely knowledgeable in the sciences. His depth and breadth of knowledge in physics, cosmology, biology, and molecular biology cannot help but impress. His comfort with philosophical thought is similarly impressive, though increasingly it seems that many physicists have become philosophers, and many philosophers have become physicists. The book is a serious and scholarly effort to explain ""The Big Picture."" Each chapter is a sort of lecture, and the content must be appreciated for its accuracy and completeness. This book as a college course or series of courses for science and arts majors alike would, no doubt, be well worthwhile. Kudos to Carroll for this explanation of what is known, and how the knowledge of it can enrich human lives.It's hard to find a downside to this tome, though not impossible. I made the mistake, in my opinion, of ""reading"" this book audibly. It was read by the author himself. Even when I sped up the rate to 125% of normal, some of the chapters seemed to linger on forever despite the interesting content. My analysis is that Dr. Carroll should not have read the audible version of the book himself I should mention that I have read the paperback version of ""From Eternity to Here"" by Carroll, and it held my interest throughout.There's something about how Carroll speaks that detracts from his very good writing skills. The two most distracting features are his fairly monotonic delivery along with his natural tendency to end sentences with upward voice inflections rather than downward ones. I would simply recommend a hard copy or electronic version of the book rather than the audible version. The only other feature that I was mildly put off by was the arrogance that often crops up in books written by scientists who seem to believe that their current view of the world is the only view that is credibly possible. As most good authors do, Carroll assimilates his chapters so that they build to the punchlines at the end of the book in chapters 49 and 50. Those were good chapters indeed, though I was mildly amused that those chapters reminded me a bit of another, much lower-brow book, that took me only an hour to read, 'The Newstament"".All-in-all, this was a challenging read and a highly educational one."
150,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30303418-steve-agland,5,"I wish this book had entered the popular consciousness to the degree that The God Delusion or Sapiens has. This is the first ""big picture"" book (it's a genre) that I felt articulated back to me what I already believed when it comes to to the big philosophical questions of epistemology, ontology, the mind-body problem, free will, metaethics and so on. All these subjects are tackled clearly and persuasively, but in this case I needn't little persuasion. This was for me the ultimate ""reading inside the bubble"" experience. It's not a productive way to read - it's worth challenging your beliefs with contrasting viewpoints, of course - but in this case it felt valuable. Carroll explains what I believe better than I ever could.Carroll rolls out a well-planned, carefully argued map from fundamental scientific approaches to knowledge (Bayesian reasoning, empiricism) through justifications of high-level models like biology and psychology, to theories of the nature of consciousness, morality and meaning. He names his philosophy ""poetic naturalism"", which is naturalism (that the natural universe is all there is) extended with the notion that higher-level conceptual models for the world are just as ""real"" as the fundamental theories of particle physics and quantum mechanics.I felt like Carroll didn't elaborate enough on his choice of of the qualifier ""poetic"" for his variety of naturalism. I guess what he was trying to find a word like ""metaphorical"" or ""abstract"" but with looser connotations.Carroll's tone is wonderfully warm, clear and generous. He introduces all the major philosophical schools of thought during his tour of its many subjects, and treats them charitably, giving them carefully written summaries explaining their strengths and weaknesses, because explaining his own views.This is a book well worth reading, especially if you'd like an approachable explanation of how scientifically-minded, skeptical atheist type people see the world, without the venom or haughtiness that can be grating in other popular books by such folks.Or, if you're just looking for a rich and enjoyable tour of some of philosophy's trickiest problems, and a compellingly 21st-century and clear-thinking approach to dealing with them, this is the book for you."
151,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4417885-donovan-richards,3,"On OntologyWe all have a reason for being. For many, that reason sits below the surface of consciousness, chilling on a metaphysical couch, cracking open a beer. This reason operates in the decisions you make, no matter how aware you may be of its existence.For the philosophers out there, finding reason for being becomes systematized into an ontology, a formalized approach to purpose. Humanity divides itself in many ways. There are red ontologies and blue ontologies (in the United States at least); there are religious ontologies and areligious ontologies. There are consumer ontologies and conservationist ontologies. We‚Äôre pretty good at making systems that describe what we do.If I had to take a self-critical look, I would suggest my ontology orbits a narrative theological approach to life. I believe in the power of story to describe life and to give normative abilities to our daily life. I believe the narrative of Scripture provides an intriguing way of describing long-term generational narratives and purpose around life. It‚Äôs a good outline by which we can live, and if we take Pascal‚Äôs wager seriously, it‚Äôs also a no-brainer.Because of my ontological approach, I tend to avoid the typical faith-vs.-reason debates that have spotted our cultural map for decades. A culture warrior I am not. Even more so, I don‚Äôt even care too much about this relentless fight for truth. I believe in science, as a politician recently noted. I believe that science can unlock important discoveries that will benefit society as a whole. I don‚Äôt think a debate about our origins or where our environment might go does much for ontological purposes, especially from a narrative approach.On Poetic NaturalismAnd yet, I‚Äôm interested in hearing about ontologies that stray from mine. With The Big Picture, Brian Carroll presents an argument for poetic naturalism, an ontology that finds purpose in life, without relying on supernatural beliefs.An engaging and enjoyable read, The Big Picture spends little time fighting the culture wars. While I have a handful of small critiques about Carroll‚Äôs presentation of theistic views, on the whole I found him charitable to competing views. This book finds little in common with the Richard Dawkins militancy.‚ÄúBut there are biases on both sides. Many people may be comforted by the idea of a powerful being who cares about their lives, and who determines ultimate standards of right and wrong behavior. Personally, I am not comforted by that at all‚ÄîI find the idea extremely off-putting. I would rather live in a universe where I am responsible for creating my own values and living up to them the best I can, than in a universe in which God hands them down, and does so in an infuriatingly vague way. This preference might unconsciously bias me against theism. On the other hand, I‚Äôm not at all happy that my life will come to an end relatively soon (cosmically speaking), with no hope for continuing on; so that might bias me toward it. Whatever biases I may have, I need to keep them in mind while trying to objectively weigh the evidence. It‚Äôs all any of us can hope to do from our tiny perch in the cosmos‚Äù (149).With The Big Picture, Carroll develops his argument for poetic naturalism. He dives deeply into a philosophy of science and epistemology, making the case for why science is the most rational approach to observing what we are able to observe and why the troubles with absolute proof matter little when you live your life based on principles of Bayesian reasoning.While this line of reasoning covers the ‚Äúnaturalism,‚Äù component, the ‚Äúpoetic‚Äù component is a little fuzzier. Carroll suggests the many examples of where we use various modes of communication and language to describe the same thing. A person, for example, is a rational being capable of autonomous actions. She is also a collection of molecules, which is itself a collection of sub-atomic particles. Both descriptions of the same thing are equally valid. Therefore, we have a poetic approach to the ways we describe our world.‚ÄúPoetic naturalism sits in between: there is only one, unified, physical world, but many useful ways of talking about it, each of which captures an element of reality. Poetic naturalism is at least consistent with its own standards: it tries to provide the most useful way of talking about the world we have‚Äù (112).And yet, as I‚Äôm sure Carroll would expect, I remain unconvinced. If there‚Äôs one consistent element to humanity, it surely coincides with our ability to hold our beliefs dearly.On the Limitations of NaturalismEven though I affirm all of Carroll‚Äôs work and find his deep dive into the physical elements of our universe to be fascinating, I find his poetic approach and his naturalistic approach to be lacking.Of course, naturalism sets itself up to be limited.When I was taking a class on the history of the New Testament, I sat down with the professor during office hours to discuss the historical significance of the resurrection. Given the burden of proof for historical texts, I assumed the evidence we have points to a pretty strong case for what‚Äôs noted in the gospels. We know Paul wrote at least a few of his epistles, including 1 Corinthians and Galatians. These epistles point to a resurrection story and a confirmation of that start, nearly within a handful of years after the event. There‚Äôs nothing like it in historical texts.My professor walked down the line of reasoning with me, affirming me at each point. At the end, we agreed that the resurrection story emerged as early as 9 months after the supposed event. No other story in history can be traced as closely to the event it references.So did it happen? My professor says, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù When I curiously ask for an explanation, his response aligns with naturalism. The resurrection is an event unmeasurable by definition. As a historian, it would be irresponsible to suggest that such an event exists. We can only say that story emerged early. Not that it actually happened.This story points to my main question about naturalism. It constrains itself, rightly, to the measurement of the physical world. Likewise, by definition, any supernatural element in the natural world is likely immeasurable. Such occurrences would be unique if they happen at all. For this reason, they sit outside the realm of naturalism and many naturalists conclude against their existence.Let‚Äôs Be PoeticFor me, the poetic is an important ontological aspect to reconciling some of these potential elements of life. Simply suggesting that there‚Äôs nuance in life and that we make our own meaning, as Carroll does in The Big Picture, falls short for me. But of course, my worldview starts from a position of narrative theology.On the whole, The Big Picture is a worthwhile read. I enjoyed it and learned much about how naturalism can provide ontology for those who practice it. Recommended.Originally published at http://www.wherepenmeetspaper.com"
152,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,5,"The book cover doesn't lie. Carroll really does tackle the big picture, starting with the fundamental question of how to ascertain the nature of reality, to the origin and overall state of the universe, to the evolution of life, the appearance of consciousness, free will, and finding meaning in an uncaring universe. Throughout, Carroll's writing is lucid and approachable: these may be big ideas, but they can be understood.Some of the ideas to retain are:- There is no up or down in space. The reason we think ""up"" is so different from ""down"" or ""left"" is that we're very close to a planet that exerts a gravitational force on nearby objects. Likewise, there's no ""before"" or ""after"" at the level of quantum physics: you can swap a time axis for a space axis and the equations still make sense. The reason we think the past is so different from the future (or from left and right) is that we're very close to a point of very low entropy: the Big Bang.- Planets of belief: some beliefs naturally congregate: if you think that there's an afterlife for humans, then you likely think that there's an afterlife for dogs as well. And if you think that, then you likely believe in souls. Carroll calls these systems ""planets of belief"" (though perhaps an analogy involving a social network might have been better).- Poetic naturalism: this is the idea that there are many different ways of describing something that are true and, just as importantly, useful. It's true that a car is a collection of molecules obeying the laws of chemistry, or even as a collection of subatomic particles obeying the laws of quantum physics. But there are far, far too many molecules (or atoms, or fermions) to keep track of, so it's much more useful, and no less true, to consider a car as a collection of mechanical parts. What's important is that where they overlap, the different explanations be compatible.In the end, unsurprisingly for a scientist, he sees beauty and wonder in the universe, and hope in humans. What's remarkable is the way Carroll ties together all the elements of the journey into a coherent whole."
153,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39432996-andreas-happe,5,"The book describes the concept of ""poetic naturalism"", the idea that there is a physical world that we can observe and, while we might not understand all of its workings, can build effective stories about it. The best stories match our knowledge of the underlying earth and don't contradict each other. The world is; through stories we bring beauty and goodness to it.A large part of the book is about creating a story that does not depend upon a supernatural being. It's a tour-de-force over the universe's origin and end, time, entropy (hint: it always wins), how life came into being, minds and how consciousness might have developed, free will and how we can define morals without leaning on the guidance of supernatural beings.It tells a story about humanism, the desire to learn about the world and how to update one's beliefs. In that, it is not anti-religious but rather anti-blind-dogma. It tries to understand life by naturalism, without a reason to look beyond the physical world while being open that something else might be going on. It caught me off-guard with the hint that even if you're open-minded you should over-value uneasy new stories as you will be subconsciously be biased and de-value the new theory anyways.In that, it is honest, the author's ""confession"" that he would like to offer an afterlife but cannot do this is telling. He offers an example, how lucky we are as group, that we have found each other in the vastness of space and immensity of time, for a short period (of ~3 billion heartbeats).. and to cherish this thought.He finishes up a bit bleary eyed, stating that the distinction is not between theism and naturalism, but that the important thing is to care enough about the universe to want to understand it. All lifes are different, some face hardships that others will never know. But we all share the same universe for a precious few heartbeats. The clock is ticking.One quarter into the book I thought that I won't finish and let it be one of the few unfinished books in my collection. Then it caught on. In the end, it landed in my ""great books/reread"" collection. Funny, how life turns out sometimes."
154,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107220923-rahul-banerjee,4,"A well written book that (mostly) deals with Ontology in modern science. Sean carroll espouses a school of belief called Naturalism and adds his own ideas into it to eventually call it 'Poetic Naturalism'. Sean's belief is that even though the universe itself is (with an extremely high likelihood) governed by fully deterministic physical laws, it isn't very helpful to talk about different levels of reality using the same vocabulary of limited words and ideas. Different 'levels' of reality, such as microscopic and macroscopic worlds, consciousness etc all need to be investigated using different methods and different contexts. What is important is the nature of the investigation itself and here, Sean suggests the Bayesian approach, which is : Start with some prior beliefs about the nature of the world (theistic, atheistic, scientific etc), giving equal credence to all of them. Next, update your prior beliefs by asking the question, 'Given belief X is true, how likely is the world that we see every day?'. If the answer is something along the lines of 'not very likely', then reduce the credence of belief X and increase the credence of another belief Y that better explains the world as we experience it.As with most philosophical writings, aspects of Ontology, Epistemology, Ethics etc are discussed at length and often compared and contrasted with other belief systems. The writing is unpretentious and conversational and being both a professor of theoretical physics and a communicator of science, Sean speaks with knowledgeable authority and yet, never forces his beliefs on the reader nor ridicules other schools of thought (except perhaps the moral relativists).Irrespective of whether or not 'Poetic Naturalism' is your cup of tea, the book deserves a read because it deals with several deep questions of modern science, such as the Arrow of Time, nature of reality, Consciousness etc. I certainly had a good time reading it and pondering over the topics (and their consequences) myself."
155,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36507865-ernest-morozov,4,"I really enjoyed reading this book because it identified that science doesn't have all the answers but that there is no reason to assign super natural factors to the unknown. Our world is an intelligible mystery that will be uncovered through rigorous scientific inquiry in due time. While science can be used to explain our physical world, Carroll highlights that science is not a tool for developing morality. We want there to be objective solutions to our moral dilemmas in line with scientific discoveries or mathematical formulas, unfortunately that is not the case. Morality is constructed by human beings and we are responsible for what it means to be good. While it is unsettling to think that we are in it alone and that there isn't a super natural force to guide us, I feel empowered by the idea that humans can define our moral destiny. We can throw away dogmas and archaic rituals and adopt new systems of ethics combined with ancient wisdoms. We have the power to change for the better. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about reality and what it means to be human. Carroll elegantly summarizes the idea of Poetic Naturalism in the following excerpt. Enjoy!""Here is a different story. The universe is not a miracle. It simply is, unguided and unsustained, manifesting the patterns of nature with scrupulous regularity. Over billions of years it has evolved naturally, from a state of low entropy towards increasing complexity, and it will eventually wind down to a featureless equilibrium. We are the miracle, we human beings. Not a break-the-law-of-physics kind of miracle, a miracle in that it is wondrous and amazing how such complex, aware, creative, caring creatures could have arisen in perfection accordance to those laws. Our lives are finite, unpredictable and immeasurably precious. Our emergence has brought meaning and mattering into the world."" "
156,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15833800-jawshan-shatil,3,"As an advanced level reader and rational thinker, I started this book to see how does poetic naturalism resolves the puzzle of current scientific knowledge which can tell us about the coherency of science from different fields. Yes, I was aware of the fact that dark matter and dark energy is still in the domain of mystery, we still do not know how do these ""Dark"" staffs fit in the story of current quantum physics, i. e., their nature is still inexplicable by the current knowledge of physics. But I was more interested in what Sean Carrol has to say about consciousness or volition. I was quite perplexed by the lecture of Daniel Dennet, who says, we do not have anything of ""conscious"" inside us, the 'self' which can define ourselves as individual may not exist at all, the self is our illusion, just a mere byproduct of cellular molecular interaction inside ourselves. I wanted to ask Dennet, I agree with you that there is nothing sitting inside ourselves which defines ""us"". But can we call that byproduct of cellular molecular interaction inside us as consciousness which gives rise to individuality? Is there a 'self inside us' or not? Obviously, the next question, is there volition or free will? I was thinking what Sean Carroll think about these question? If I understand him correctly, he suggests, despite these philosophical and or scientific conflict, we can consult/accept common belief until science becomes more advance to answer these. I do not think, his philosophy of poetic naturalism can satisfy mind with critical thinking. I am okay with learning yes or no, I am okay with accepting yes or no, but being a naturalist, I am not happy to make a compromise with a common belief. It is better to think, it is unresolved, we need to wait for an answer instead of making peace with a common belief. This book is a good science hotchpotch, which does not actually offer anything better than naturalism. The name poetic naturalism does not offer anything new. "
157,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24870603-jan,3,"Very readable expos√© of scientific knowledge. It covers the same ground as many other books of the same nature, but makes the case for what Carroll calls: poetic naturalism. It's an attempt to reconcile science with our human experience. An attempt to make the cold facts and laws of science, without purpose or meaning, more palatable to us, whose lives are made up of feelings and values and strivings, of loves and fears and hopes. Carroll tries to resolve this contradiction by saying that our experiences are just as valid as physical explanations and descriptions of events, but on an emergent level. At the same time it's all completely reducable to the automatic behaviour of quarks and electrons. So in the end all our talk is still just, as he calls it, 'a manner of speaking'. A purely human way of talking about the elementary particles that behave according to deterministic quantum field theory. It's a worthy attempt, but to me Carroll never succeeds in bridging the gap. And he admits that when the chips are down, we just don't know, and it's a matter of choice. He employs Bayesian logic to argue that a completely naturalistic paradigm (be it poetic or not) is the most likely explanation for everything, but this is only true when you, as he does, assume right from the start that everything is ulitimately made of something called 'matter' or 'energy' or 'physical stuff'. When after all, everything is just a perception in consciousness. And we have no idea what consciousness is. It's impossible for us to step out of our own consciousness and see what is really going on. What reality is really like. Whether it's really impersonal and dead, or personal and mind-like. It's the same old conundrum of philosophy that goes all the way back to the Greek philosophers, and will probably never be solved."
158,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75048994-kenneth-taylor,5,"Just finished Sean Carroll's book ""The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself"". The book describes what Sean Carroll call ""Poetic Naturalism"" which is his version of philosophical Naturalism. Naturalism as the author describes it is a worldview where ""there is only one world, the natural world...there is no separate realm of the supernatural"". The book then goes on to justify this position and attempts to explain the universe's origin, morality and meaning. This book essentially explains my worldview so I was very excited to read it. I've read one other excellent book on Naturalism by Richard Carrier so that is what I will compare it to. I will honestly say this book is incredibly digestible for a subject that delves into science and philosophy and THIS would be the book I would recommend to a beginner on the subject. Secondly this is a book I could give to a theist without any fear of them feeling insulted (compared to a book like ""the God Delusion""). I would say Carrier's book ""Sense and Goodness without God"" is slightly more technical and more difficult to read. Two negatives on Sean's book is that I feel his chapters on the universe's origin left me wanting more. Chapter 25 Why Does the Universe Exist? is only 10 pgs. Chapter 36 jumps back into the subject when discussing fine tuning arguments but this is only 12 pgs. I'm used to reading entire books on the subject but luckily there is a nice recommendation for further reading in the back of the book. I also disagreed with Carroll on the Morality chapter in regards to objective morality but I'm biased by my early readings from Carrier. Overall this book is a gem that I will re-read and reference going forward and will recommend as a primer for anyone interested in Naturalism."
159,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4837058-chris,4,"While heavy on hard science and physics, the main thrust of this book is philosophical and existential. Throughout, Sean Carroll provides a contrast between naturalist (atheist) and supernaturalist (theist) worldviews, citing human scientific knowledge and support for the former over the latter. That's not to say that he is hostile or demeaning toward religious figures. Rather, he meticulously presents evidence and reason to argue for the philosophy of poetic naturalism, which is essentially the view that human beings are thoroughly part of the natural universe, not special or separate from the indifferent and immovable laws of reality, and that it is up to us (collectively and individually) to determine what is meaningful and purposeful in our finite lives.Personally, as an agnostic/atheist who periodically struggles with an existential crisis, I was emotionally torn as I read this book. It's a fascinating and engaging work, chock full of information and insight worth anyone's time. And even though I do not believe in an afterlife, I pretty much constantly hope I am wrong and that some sort of eternity awaits us. With that in mind, I sometimes felt intimidated and a little ""overlooked"" (for lack of a better word) of Carroll's casual and blas√© attitude toward the end of existence (both at the individual and universal level). I certainly didn't detect an ounce of hostility from the author, but as someone who finds contemplating existence and meaning emotionally difficult, I had a hard time digesting Carroll's matter-of-fact tone at points.All that being said, the final couple chapters do offer a freeing and compassionate bit of philosophy and (to a certain extent) advice that rounds of the book and a decidedly uplifting and energetic note."
160,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40492234-haur-bin,2,"A physicist trying hard to infer (Bayesian probability) everything in our universe through poetic naturalism - everything just simply exists. Started strongly with where author‚Äôs strengths lie i.e. laws of physics, Core Theory, quantum mechanics that explains how our physical world is constructed in both macro and micro level. Arguments started to get fuzzy when trying to explain how atoms and particles make living organisms - the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back for me is when author implied photons and atoms can have consciousness. The argument that living organisms are merely atoms ended extremely dissatisfying. Without a solid bridge between physics and biology, the future arguments on philosophical questions like, why are we here, what is morality, what is our purpose, is there a higher being, just ended up flat and unsubstantiated.An overly ambitious book which tries to explain everything using our still limited knowledge of our world. Case in point, author‚Äôs recognition of the difficulty to reconcile between Core Theory and quantum mechanics while selectively broad-brushed how the existence of soul or higher being cannot be proven hence doesn‚Äôt exist. By trying to bridge the unknowns using Bayesian theorem, author subjects all arguments down to his individual bias that if something cannot be explained through laws of physics, it is not real.Furthermore, in a bid to denounce religion, felt to me that author is trying to spread his own belief - the poetic naturalism. Philosophising through physics without addressing human emotions is like colouring a rainbow only with black paint."
161,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52137000-robin,5,"4.5 starsThis one wasn't an easy read. It started of pretty strong, not necessarily that much stuff I didn't know yet, but just making you actively think about the universe can be quite mindboggling. So I spend a lot of time while reading this imagining the size/age/etc of the universe and just trying to wrap your mind around the insane scales it operates in. Some chapters were definitely better than others, and sometimes he gets bogged down a bit too much in the specifics, and while those are definitely important, it doesn't really make for easy reading at times.I enjoyed the part where he explains why things like telekinesis, telepathy, etc are not really possible under the laws of physics as we understand them. It is a good way to make it very clear why all those people that claim to have supernatural abilities just can't actually have them.Some parts were explained very well and gave me some new insight into the workings of small (and large) parts of the universe. I liked the mixing milk into coffee example of explaining our current status in the universe and while I already believed most of the things that Sean Carroll Advocates, it's good for someone to articulate it better than I can.Overall I did really enjoy the book but part of it is because I kept getting lost in imagining the process of the universe expanding up until this point, and beyond, how it would be to observe this process happen. It's hard to put into words what exactly I think when fantasying about the universe but it comes down to trying to understand the size of astronomically large numbers, both in size and time."
162,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"I have to say it took me a while to figure out what Sean Carroll (research professor in the Department of Physics at the California Institute of Technology) was trying to accomplish in The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself. I suspect my prior expectations (that this would be a book about physics) led me astray. The book begins with the concept that objects can be described at different levels of detail. For example ‚Äì you can describe a cat in terms of elementary particles (say superstrings) or quarks, or atoms, or molecules, or combinations of molecules (chemistry), or in terms of the cat‚Äôs structure (biology), or organs (physiology), or behavior (ethology), or physical distribution (evolution and biogeography), or interactions with the ecosystem (ecology). Which level you choose will depend on the property of the animal you‚Äôre trying to study/explain. He then discusses Bayesian statistics, the idea that the true state of the world can be expressed in terms of degrees of belief based on the available evidence. Of course, physics is discussed (Newtonian, relativity and quantum theory), before an excursion into the biological sciences and later into philosophy.  So what‚Äôs the point? Carroll is outlining the basis of a worldview based on our current scientific understanding of the nature of reality. That worldview is known as philosophical naturalism (or poetic naturalism, though I prefer the former phrase) - the doctrine that the natural world is all there is. Thus The Big Picture isn‚Äôt so much a book about physics as I was expecting (except to the extent that physics informs the discussion), but a book of philosophy.  The basis of this worldview lies in Carroll‚Äôs claim that ‚ÄúThe laws of physics underlying everyday life are completely known‚Äù.These laws are encapsulated by the Core Theory, which explains the forces that effect all macroscopic, low energy objects. This isn‚Äôt to say that science has explained everything ‚Ä¶ there are many things that we currently do not understand. But that, the physical laws that affect our daily life (such as gravity, angular momentum and acceleration) are understood and that these concepts will remain valid 1,000 years hence. There are many conclusions that logically follow from this claim. For example, physics informs our understanding of the forces at work in the universe (gravity, electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces), thus we also know that telekinesis (the ability to move objects with your mind) isn‚Äôt real since it‚Äôs incompatible with known physical laws (or if you prefer a Bayesian approach, it has a likelihood of being true that approaches zero given the available evidence). In other words, for telekinesis to work it would have to utilize one of the known forces or would have to act through a force completely unknown to us at this time. Carroll is claiming that it can‚Äôt possibly be either since:1. If it acted through a force we already understand it could be measured and quantified scientifically. However, no such telekinetic force has ever been measured. 2. It could not act through an unknown force because we already know all of the laws of physics that makes up our everyday life. There can be no other unknown forces that act on human-scale objects.Therefore, telekinesis doesn‚Äôt exist.  You might ask ‚Ä¶ so what? No one believes in telekinesis anyway. Well, the same principle may be applied to other beliefs that are more widespread in society:Astrology can‚Äôt possibly be real. The forces exerted by planets distant from the earth are overwhelmed by the forces exerted by nearby objects. For example the gravity exerted by a person standing next to you is greater than the force of gravity that Mars exerts on you. Thus the position of Mars couldn‚Äôt possibly have any effect upon your daily life. Therefore, astrology is nonsense. I‚Äôm easing you into this, because this also holds true for more tightly held beliefs. Ready? Prayer doesn‚Äôt work, a god that interacts with the physical world doesn‚Äôt exist, there is no life after death, there is no absolute morality and life has no inherent meaning other than what you make of it. That wasn‚Äôt so bad ‚Ä¶ just like ripping off a band-aid. You‚Äôre now ready to put on your big boy (or girl) pants and face the world as it exits.  Of course, those who disagree with this approach typically claim that scientists assume naturalistic explanations a-priori coming to it through ‚Äòbelief‚Äô or ‚Äòfaith‚Äô in science that is indistinguishable from religious faith. But this is not the case. There is nothing inherent in the scientific method that excludes supernatural explanations. It‚Äôs just that no supernatural explanations have been found to exist. Thus scientists do not have ‚Äòfaith‚Äô that philosophical naturalism is true (to have ‚Äòfaith‚Äô is to believe without evidence). The data resulting from every reputable experiment done throughout all of history point conclusively to the fact that the natural world is all that there is. If you believe otherwise, all that‚Äôs needed is conclusive proof that the supernatural exists and the Nobel Prize will most certainly be yours (I‚Äôm not going to hold my breath).  In the latter portion of the book Carroll applies the principles of philosophical naturalism to the issue of ‚Äòconsciousness‚Äô and ‚Äòmind/body duality‚Äô, and concludes that the former is entirely consistent with the Core Theory, while the latter is not. Thus we may conclude that consciousness is an emergent property arising solely from the physical activity of the brain.  Carroll then discusses morality and shows that there is no external benchmark upon which an objective morality can be based. Instead, it is something we need to figure out as a society. To that end he proposes 10 Considerations (analogous to, but immeasurably better than the 10 Commandments) for constructing a consistent system of ethics (you have to admire his fearlessness).Overall, the book is good. Carroll has the intellectual breadth and depth to take on a big topic such as this (life, the universe and everything ‚Ä¶ what could be bigger?) and presents numerous compelling arguments that he backs up with scientific evidence. I will say that I found the book a bit dry at times as he argues for or against one philosophical point of order or another, but ignoring competing theories wasn‚Äôt an option and he manages, for the most part, to avoid becoming wrapped around the axle."
163,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/961119-clay-kallam,4,"Sean Carroll's book is aptly titled: It does indeed cover the big picture of 21st century scientific and, to an extent, philosophical thought -- but that is both its strength and weakness.If you haven't read any books about quantum mechanics, the origins of life, emergent phenomena or normative thinking, then ""The Big Picture"" will get you up to speed. If you've only read one or two, Carroll's engaging and informative style will neatly complement your knowledge and fill in some gaps. But if you've read more than a few such books, or subscribe to Science News or other such magazines, ""The Big Picture"" is more of a rehash than a revelation.Then again, of course, there are always things to learn, and Carroll's ability to tease out insights is impressive -- though his use of the term ""poetic naturalism"" to describe his belief system is a little, well, poetic. The idea is that all there is to the world is natural sciences and material reality, but we describe it in many different ways, using different ""stories."" I think ""narrative naturalism"" would be closer to the mark, as Carroll's view of the world is much, much more prosaic than poetic.It also seems to me that Carroll is too dismissive of what has yet to be discovered, and much like the authors who have declared the end of history, or the demise of art, it seems arrogant and presumptive to assume that we've got all of the basics nailed down.Still, ""The Big Picture"" is a worthy read, though its value is inversely proportional to how many popular science books you've read before you start."
164,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,4,"""When it comes to how to lead our lives, poetic naturalism has no fish to give us. It doesn‚Äôt even really teach us how to fish. It‚Äôs more like poetic naturalism helps us figure out that there are things called ‚Äúfish,‚Äù and perhaps investigate the various possible ways to go about catching them, if that were something we were inclined to do.""When this book is good, it is great. I did HSC Physics, and have read my share of physicist non-fiction(Hawking et al), and this was the first time I felt like I really grasped relativity at all. Carroll is blessed with the capacity to explain, and the book clearly and purposefully sets out the ideas. Combine with that his strong understanding of philosophy and comfort - no, joy - in combining the two and the book never ceases to be either thought provoking or readable. Carroll has ethics, and an approach to science which (mostly) lacks arrogance. He wants to share this, and he understands a dizzying array of knowledge.And if the rest of this review seems critical, it is in part because my expectations were so high. Carroll sold this as taking from modern physics, philosophy and neuroscience, bringing different fields together to pose a new approach. Poetic naturalism, however, turned out to be not-so-new, really, but rather the sane form of humanism: ""1. There is only one world, the natural world. 2. The world evolves according to unbroken patterns, the laws of nature. 3. The only reliable way of learning about the world is by observing it."" Now, I appreciate that in a post-Dawkins world, we now have to fight for a sane form of naturalism, one which is about embracing doubt and uncertainty, rather than hitting people over the head with fat evolution textbooks, but I guess I was still expecting something a bit more from this. Or maybe this, a powerful argument for a sensible approach that has done science well for centuries, is what we need right now. I can't fault Carroll for that.But the second quibble was just, well, Carroll's physicistness. Now, based on the above defined lifelong misunderstandings between physics and I, physicists may choose to ignore what I am about to say, but they should not. There is a certain parting from the observable world, into following perfect theoretical constructs that lead to highly non-intuitive, and more importantly, unprovable conclusions in the multiverse/string theory set. There is a set of assumptions here, ones which may well be right, but which could induce a little humility or at least acknowledgement that they *are* assumptions. Some physicists seem to live so entirely in the particle world, that they forget that the rest of it, the mechanical world, still exists. Caroll warns us about the head-spinnyness of understanding quantum entanglement, for example, but he does not acknowledge that this head spinnyness is because a lot of this still doesn't really make sense to humanity: the multiverse is a theoretical consequence of our current theoretical understanding, which assumes modelling can be extrapolated. I'm not saying it can't, for heavens sake I'm just a librarian, but the ""certainty"" with which string and multiverse theoreticians state their case exaggerates the extent to which we have a clue if we know anything at all. And sometimes, the way they dismiss disciplines rooted in observation and testing can be galling. And yes, I understand that no-one wants to phrase it like ""we really don't know much"", when there a bunch of pro-interventionist-god folk battering at scientific endeavour to accept explanations which have, honestly, long been ruled out as not taking us anywhere. But all knowledge comes from accepting diversity, uncertainty, contradiction: the possibility, nay, probability, of being wrong.The book felt like it spent so long arguing against idealist notions - and really, how many fundamentalists are going to read this? - that it had little space left to explore the lovely grey spaces, the potentials, in the bits of the universe that we can't yet see a clear coherance too.Carroll is disappointing here not because he is blind, but because he strays so close to the border: condedng with glee, for example, that time's arrow is a construct we have evolved to be dependent on (and possibly, hence, may never be able to disentangle ourselves from), that rather than there being nothing before the Big Bang, we just know that that is the point at which something we understand happened. But then, rather than exploring what possibilities this limitation might set up, he retreats back into certainty. Carroll speaks of the need to accept different ontologies to describe the world. That, for example, the heart is as real a thing as the particles it is composed of (the fact that we are even having this conversation tells you why physicists drive me nuts), and the language of heart, organs, body is as valid as that of electrons, etc. Yet he strays so close to a particle-centric view of who we are. The neuroscience is skipped over, focusing only on parts which mirror or imply quantum operations. He spends time dismissing the idea that being composed of particles denigrates our free will, that he does not tackle more interesting ideas about whether, if our decision making is diffused rather than centralised: if there is no central director in our brains, then can we be held accountable? Who is the entity that is responsible if we are multitudes? On a basic level, he used the example of ""telepathy"" to indicate how spiritual ideas can be disproved. But for starters, he's actually talking about telekineses, not telepathy, and secondly, he misses some interesting perspectives that he could have explored if he was talking about telepathy: 50 years ago, human didn't understand how powerfully we communicate through pheronomes. This isn't ""telepathy"" in the sense of the existence of a particle force we didn't know existed, but it was an explanation of a powerful form of influence we exert invisibly on each other. There is a lot yet to discover about how those pesky particles work in us and around us, and sometimes the ways we come to those answers might be a diverse paths - observation, explanation, testing, refinement can come from a myriad of disciplines.But for all those quibbles, I'm pleased to be on the same path as Carroll. This feels like my kind of thinking, and my kind of place. And seriously - grateful for the insight."
165,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15533495-eli,5,"Great book.Great communicator. I came to know about Sean Carroll by watching one of his debates with William Lane Craig and by some college lectures available on YouTube. I decided to give him a try as soon as I came to know about this book, because he seemed to me like a guy that stands out from many atheist scientists and speakers out there. ""The Big Picture"" presents a completely naturalist point of view of the universe; the most evidence-based view we can come up with so far. Its scope is impressive. He discusses many things, from theories in classical physics and particle physics (the basic underlying reality of the universe), chemistry, biology, neuroscience, psychology, social sciences, history, philosophy of religion, morality, epistemology, metaphysics, metaethics, etc. Overall, it is a well written book and in my opinion, pretty accessible for the layperson. It does not include complex equations (like Krauss' ""A Universe From Nothing"" does), except in the Appendix. I often found myself saying: ""that is an awesome and clever way to put it!"". You will find comments against traditional arguments for a god or a ""supernatural"" reality (about the ontological, cosmological, teleological arguments and religious rationale in general, including superstitious thinking about quantum mechanics.So, if you have the chance to read one popular science book a year, I really recommend you to try this one."
166,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24081766-michel-meijer,4,"The Big Picture by Sean Carroll describes his view on how the universe works, how we fit in and what we should do as human beings. Knowing him as a theoretical physicist, it is no surprise that the standard model of elementary forces and particles plays an important role in this tale. The Core model describes all relevant interactions on earth already for decades, and all measurements confirm the validity of it. Caroll goes then on: since we know the forces and interactions of matter and energy, there is no relevant place for something else. Ergo, bending spoons with your mind is not something that the model allows, knowing what we know. Also, the presence of a soul, a creater or a heaven is not necesary to describe the universe. Taking this as a model, Caroll starts to spend more attention to the philosophy side: Without God, what is the reason we exist, how does a social construct look like of atheist. What is conciousness, experience and how does that materialize from the brain. I am taking very big steps here, Caroll works down many details and elaborates on many aspects more.I was more interested in the hard science part of the story, but the moral part is certainly interesting, although it took significant more time to digest. I admire the detail in the book by quoting all kinds of philosophers and scientist on the existential questions. I think I will remember the final words: ""3 Billion heartbeats, the clock is ticking"" 4 stars"
167,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,4,"This quite ambitious book covers a lot of ground, generally to provide an explanation of the universe and life. It was really well written. At times he would dive really deep into physics and discuss very complex science. I found myself losing interest at times because of the depth he went into. But other times he scratched an existentialist itch I have. He spent a lot of time on philosophy and explaining to theists much of the error in their logic, if they're trying to use any. He argued in Bayesian terms why the scientific explanation for how the universe exists is the best and only reasonable explanation we have. I would definitely recommend this book on that basis, for someone interested in the scientific vs. theistic look at the universe and the meaning of life. Carroll discusses looking for meaning in life without the theist point of view, and that moral codes are a human invention, not something handed down from a higher being. He expresses many humanist thoughts. He calls himself a poetic naturalist, a term he coined. For example, he does not believe there is no free will (which could be explained in multiple ways, one being that down to the molecular level we are just atoms that are trained to act in the way evolution has created us), rather his poetic naturalism says this ""no free will"" is not a useful way of talking about a phenomenon that we seem to use quite freely everyday.

168,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13691498-michael,3,"It is all the rage lately for theoretical physicists to write books for a lay audience. It seems that the physics of the very large and very small are interesting because they are so counter-intuitive (curved space-time, black holes, quantum entanglement, etc.) Here is another entry and Carroll also has opinions on everything else so this book covers a lot of ground. There are 50 chapters and one (big) equation (in the Appendix). The theme that runs through the book is the idea that we can talk about lots of interesting things at more than one level. In the same way that a gas is a collection of atoms obeying the fundamental laws of physics but also an emergent phenomenon obeying Boltzmann's law we can talk about consciousness in terms of atoms and sub-atomic particles in the brain, or as psychology. This idea gets overused and sometimes seems to beg the question (e.g. There is no such thing as free will at the atomic level, but there is free will at the level of personality and intentionality.)End of review - beginning of rant.""They"" is a plural pronoun used to refer to more than one of something. It is not a PC device to avoid the issue of gender. I grew up using ""he"" as the pronoun for a person of unspecified gender and I have learned to use ""he or she"". Fine, I understand the point. But I'm not willing to injure the language and when Carroll uses ""they"" in this way it hurts my head. Does anyone care that this makes me uncomfortable? I didn't think so."

My first thought was that Sean Carroll had bit off more than he could chew and at best he would cover the big picture with a thin frame. But I was wrong and he covered the topic with museum quality displays of knowledge. It was a wide ranging look at the current state of affairs not only in the hard sciences such as physics but as much as possible in the soft science of human behavior from neuroscience to social relations. He seems to want to propitiate all points of view and makes you think that at different levels of reality it is okay to use different vocabulary that does not translate well from one level to the next. But he always comes to the conclusion that the naturalist explanation is the true description of life. No matter what topic you‚Äôre couching you argument in, ultimately all descriptions can not violate the core theory of quantum mechanics. He wants us to realize that the world and universe are impersonal and as a structure built from the impersonal substance of the cosmos we are free and obliged to define ourselves as we see fit during the nanosecond of our existence in the vastness of time. The book is quite enjoyable to read because Sean Carroll has an encyclopedic fund of knowledge and you never feel that you‚Äôre being short changed in any topic he covers. And if you‚Äôre a naturalist as Sean is you‚Äôll find the book quite reinforcing."
170,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75520859-linda,2,"I had a hard time understanding so much about this book. I thought this was going to be about the science underlying the universe, but all of it was used a reason not to believe in God. I am not a subscriber to any particular religion. In fact, I go back and forth whether even God exists, and if It does, what is his/her nature. So I felt tricked into reading an atheist's primer on why God doesn't exist when I thought I going to focus on the science of the Big Bang, the universe, evolution and such. In the beginning there was a lot about quantum mechanics, which I want to know more about, but just went right over my head. I don't blame the author, since it's been about 20 years since I've been in a physics class, and quantum mechanics is not known for being easy to understand. I will probably end up re-reading that portion. Then there was a lot about philosophers and using science and logic to talk people out of believing in God. Then at the very end he summarizes everything, part of which says ""it takes all kinds"", stating that he doesn't want to be at odds with religious people, but essentially says that they're believing a lie in order to feel better about their life. Guys, I just wanted science. Not an 420+ page essay trying to convince the people who AREN'T READING THIS BOOK that they're wrong. If he focused more on science, and less on an argument, this would have been so much better."

Regarding qualia in particular, he finds them a useful way of talking about the world, but his thesis is simply that of Democritus: ""by convention sweet, by convention bitter, by convention color; in reality, nothing but atoms and the void."" There's little more frustrating than an author who can clearly see and explain what the hard problem is, and then goes on to act like a functionalist explanation dissolves the question with some talk of emergent properties. You have to at least address why some complex computations in the brain are accompainied by qualia, and others not! He wants to allow the reader to meaningfully talk about concepts like god and spirit, but denies that they have any properties that would make the universe different than one in which such things didn't exist, such as an afterlife.His discussion of the arrow of time and entropy was the most interesting part of the book for me (he really is exceptionally good at explaining scientific concepts), but saying that everything stems from the universe starting in a low entropy condition felt rather like pushing all the things that have to be explained into one pile and saying ""nothing needs to be explained except the one pile.""

I‚Äôm trained as a lawyer, by way of studying philosophy. At first blush, the interest and the formal study seem miles apart ‚Äì the hard science of facts versus the soft ‚Äúscience‚Äù of supposition and truth-seeking (in all its myriad forms). But if you look a bit deeper, you quickly realize that the areas are actually exceedingly close ‚Äì especially when it comes to much modern scientific theory and fields of study like string theory, chaos, and quantum mechanics. There is a lot more truth-seeking of the philosophical, theory-of-everything, school in science than I think many people are comfortable with; scientists and science enthusiasts like facts and experiments, they live and die by replicability and reliability, and those aren‚Äôt words most people normally associate with law or philosophy. Not so Sean Carroll, as is exceedingly evident in his latest, The Big Picture.The book is subtitled ‚ÄúOn the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself‚Äù and believe me when I say Carroll covers all of them adeptly and without dumbing anything down. He is a much-lauded theoretical physicist, and it is not difficult to see why he‚Äôs received the accolades he has ‚Äì even if you, like me, are an amateur (and armchair) science fan and theoretician‚Ä¶ His theories are well presented and clearly laid out. That‚Äôs not to say they are simplistic ‚Äì they definitely are not. They are adroitly presented, with historical support and background, and are written in language that can be challenging to unpack but the unwrapping is part of what made the book so enjoyable for me. Too many ‚Äúpopular‚Äù science books are written in an overly simplistic fashion. I realize that a lot of theoretical science is exceedingly complicated; removing that complication isn‚Äôt necessary for laypeople, deciphering it is. And Carroll is a master at translating high-concept physics into accessible packets of information. You may need to reread some of the descriptions to truly grasp their layered complexity ‚Äì I certainly did. But the chapters and ideas are presented in manageable, European- rather than American-sized, portions so rereading did not require as much effort as it may sound like it would.Sprinkled throughout the book are philosophical as well as theoretical underpinnings for the ideas that are presented. The philosophy student in me loved these connections; I think they bring a lot of depth to the discussions of modern science theory and certainly inform the debates about reality and purpose to a level of sophistication I found fascinating. The explanations of these theories are crisp and clear and I think should be manageable to those for whom they are new. At the same time, as with the scientific presentations, the philosophical analyses and explications are high-level enough to hold the interest of people familiar with them. Carroll is quite adept at providing a narrative that balances expert- and introductory-level concepts. That is no easy feat ‚Äì it‚Äôs rather like tap-dancing among land mines, one false step and the whole thing is blown to hell. There is nothing worse than reading a scientific or technical book and suddenly realizing the author has left you in his dust ‚Äì or, equally irritating, to realize he has suddenly started talking to you like you were a simpleton. No fears about either here ‚Äì the book reads like a conversation with your favorite professor: you feel rather proud of yourself for holding your own, because you know you‚Äôve been treated like an intellectual equal even if you both know that you certainly are not‚Ä¶I recently read an excellent book about the history of lobotomy (Patient H.M. by Luke Dittrich). Early in The Big Picture, I found myself in an ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment about memory and causality and our experience of time. Carroll was discussing how we perceive time in the context of past, present, and future, and how our memories and the concept of entropy are a way of understanding possibility, time/causality, and interrelationships. [NB: I realize that is a vastly oversimplified statement that also manages to sound rather confusing, even knowing what I meant to say, but please forgive it ‚Äì is necessary for the point I‚Äôm trying to make that I say something, and I‚Äôve rethought and rewritten it several times and this is the best I can come up with, despite its limitations‚Ä¶] The gist of my realization had to do with the multiplicity of options available in the future, and how the presence of those unknowable possibilities renders our experience of the future distinct from the present or past, where the options are vastly reduced ‚Äì the connection to the lobotomy patient being that he lost his ability to form memories, which meant that for him, there were just as many possible options to the present (and even the more recent past) as to the future, which led me to a fascinating inner debate about what that meant for his experience of time.I realize this seems like a rather odd tangent; it is not meant to be. What it is meant to illustrate is the wide-ranging applicability of the theories and ideas Carroll is laying out in his new book. Within just a handful of opening chapters, the vastly big-picture theoretical physicist book was already not only interesting but also relevant. The book is full of such ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moments, covering as it does everything from memory and causality to the history of the universe to our interrelationships and experience of love and life. This isn‚Äôt a book for the faint of heart; as I‚Äôve stated, it takes effort to read, especially if you want to truly grasp the intricacies on exhibit. It is effort that will more than repay itself though. I suspect I will find myself coming back to the theories and concepts laid out by Carroll on a surprisingly frequent basis ‚Äì after all, the big picture, by definition, touches on everything‚Ä¶"

But with each one I read, I come to understand just a little bit more about things like black holes, quantum mechanics and string theory, just to mention a few that still go well beyond my layman's comprehension. But I do read them to the very end, not skipping over any pages when the going gets rough. In this awesome book that talks about so many deep topics from the 'big picture' perspective, I found many that are getting a little clearer with each book read. In his closing chapters he even gets into naturalism and his history of attending church in his boyhood days an dhow he evolved into his beliefs today. But that was just one of many very mentally challenging topics that I recommend to your reading. Well presented, this is a very interesting challenge to one's mental abilities facing everyday science that is so deep in its richness as we are learning more and more each year of the mysteries of our universe(or it is 'cosmos' - I still don't know the difference or even if t here is a difference in those two terms).see this and more than a hundred other organ donation/transplant related books - many with my personal reviews - at http://www.trioweb.org/resources/book..."
174,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5125781-fernando,5,"Great book. For the first time I see a top-notch physicist that is also well versed in the philosophical tradition. He does a very good job of putting (almost) everything in a coherent framework. Physical laws, knowledge itself, life, nature of mind, consciousness, morality, existential dread, and many other important topics.While I was reading the book I remember him regretting on social media that he didn't make clearer connection between his ""poetic naturalism"" and the notions of Pragmatism. It was sort of funny because just a couple of days earlier I was precisely asking myself that question. His description of poetic naturalism seem to fit very well what I had learned about American Pragmatism and was wondering why he had chosen to come up with another term. In any case, I think it works well for the general audience.I think it is a great book since most popularizers of science tend to be quite ignorant of the limits of science or just (unknowingly?) sweep under the rug the fact that we experience the world not as a bunch of atoms, but as human beings and we cannot escape the big questions, where science is of limited help. Nevertheless, we can still be rational about the pursuit of answers. I think many other scientists, like Dawkings or deGrasse Tyson, should learn from Carroll."
175,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25317263-austin-gaghadar,5,"Thought that this book was exceptionally well done, giving the reader a lot to think about and ponder regarding the larger questions of life. Building upon the historical relationship between science and philosophy the author does an amazing job of building the case for poetic naturalism as the optimal lens through which to consider the world as it relates to recent development in physics. Appreciated the authors ability to explain technical scientific concepts such as quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and the chemical and biological processes of life in a way that was comprehensible by a non-specialist such as myself. The idea of different ontologies or world views is a very useful way to talk about the linkages and segmentation between different opinions and camps of thought, touching on the notions of internal and external consistency to try to approach the quest for finding truth in this world. This book taught me a lot about both the scientific principles that underpin our world and the way that philosophers across different time periods and disciplines have acknowledged and addressed these quandaries. Finally I appreciated the practical bent of the considerations being discussed, with the focus often on how to integrate these ideas and arguments in to the way that you live your everyday life, to make the most of your 3 billion heartbeats.

176,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2521766-sushil,3,"Every few years, a scientist, typically a physicist, so overwhelmingly satisfied with the state of affairs in sciences, sticks their neck out to claim that the theoretical scientists are largely done theorizing and if the current theories fail to shed light on your little corner of darkness, there must be either something wrong with you or that patch of stubborn darkness is emergent (it must be getting rather crowded under that metaphorical rug!) if not entirely illusory. In other words, for example, if the consciousness doesn't quite jibe with the physical sciences in your opinion, stop messing around with the already Godly quantum mechanics to bail you out and definitely don't go around throwing in the salt of duality in any of its flavors to the perfect soup of the Standard Model to suit your palette. What such all-is-fine-with-sciences apologists won't tell the reader is that every bit of theoretical physics is under suspicion at this very moment.Sean Carroll no doubt does as good a job as can be done to explain the big picture using the established science. The book is worth reading just for that alone. This way when you come up with your own theory of consciousness, you can first hone your arguments against this inanimate book before embarrassing yourself in front of an animate audience."
177,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8544293-jonas-lindel-v,5,"Sean Carroll seems to get a lot of the big questions right and is an excellent communicator allowing the reader/listener to draw these (or other) conclusions himself/herself. From the Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics over the relationship between disciplines (poetic naturalism) to spot-on sober considerations about the existence of God, life after death, etc. (spoiler: these ideas just don't fit data).Perhaps because of the high standard, I was surprised on two smaller topics. First, Carroll only weakly supports utilitarianism as the overarching framework for a moral philosophy based on some easily-refutable classical objections, including the utilitarian monster, how to measure happiness, etc. I (and others) acknowledge these as potential problems but not as weaknesses since they hit with at least the same force in other frameworks. Also, utilitarianism fits well into the general Bayesian approach of the course. Add a loss function for happiness, and you are good to go!Secondly, as a neuroscientist, I found a few things inaccurate on that topic (too much functional localization), but nothing as to change the overall... picture... of a both fascinating and incredibly enlightening piece of work from Sean Carroll. I strongly recommend this (audio-)book and other works by Sean Carroll."
178,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288757-teresa,5,"If I could give this 10 stars, I would because compared to many of the 5 stars I give, this book far exceeds them all. Sean Carroll (one of my two favorite scientists with the same name) has an uncanny knack for explaining highly difficult concepts...like quantum physics...in a way that an average person with only under graduate classes in physics and math can understand. This is more than a book about physics (though I would argue what more does one need than physics???). It's also his thoughts and analyses of philosophy and sociology. I learns so, so much from this book. I bought both the audio book, narrated by the author, and the hardcover volume (well, okay, I didn't actually buy the hardcover; it was gifted to me by Anderson's Book Store where I gave a presentation on Women in STEM...thank you, Anderson's!), and I highly recommend that if, like me, you like to do house chores and enrich your mind simultaneously which you can do with the audiobook. Then, when you get a section which strikes you as particularly brilliant and poignant, you can pause the reading, take out the hardcover and mark that section for easier access later. This book made me think deeply in a way few other books have, and hence my wanting to give it more stars than Goodreads will allow. Have I mentioned that I'm a huge nerd? And proud of it."
179,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54060347-deepak-saxena,3,"If you are a fan of the tv series 'The Big Bang Theory', imagine Sheldon Cooper writing a book on the universe, the emergence of life, and examining questions related to faith. That's 'The Big Picture' for you. I say so because just like Sheldon Cooper, Carroll also looks at the world from a physicist's perspective. Carroll discusses various strands on universe, the arrow of time, quantum physics, complexity theory and the emergence of life, and finally moral philosophy. He is a gifted writer with the ability to explain complex topics in most simple ways. However, my problem with this book is that it tries to do too much at the same time. Especially towards the end, Carroll makes some honest observations, it keeps the reader wanting. If you are already exposed to science writing, you may enjoy this book. If you are not, I'll suggest you to first read specialised books on universe, on quantum physics, on the arrow of time (Carroll's own earlier book), on complexity theory, and then maybe come back to this book. Even so, if I'm interested in the philosophical musings of a physicist, I would go to Alan Lightman's 'The Accidental Universe' that I found more accessible and intellectually fulfilling."
180,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73877098-greg-lyne,3,"This is a well written and thought provoking book that gives the reader theories on many Philosophical arguments. The theories focus on almost exclusively a scientific perspective and the answers that Sean Carroll provides are centered around poetic naturalism. Although this is a great read with an easy to understand writing style, I find the book pretty one sided. The author states how much we don't know about our universe and ""The Big Picture"", yet uses the theory of poetic naturalism to confidently answer these questions. It is great to read about different theories, however I find the theory to be stated too confidently. For example, the author states how much we don't know about our universe, but then states with certainty how naturalism and science can almost completely explain the universe. I am not saying this is a bad thing, if you believe that naturalism is without a doubt the answer, this is the book for you. The author is a very good writer, however if you are looking for a book that details a broader spectrum of theories and ideas, this is not the book for you. This book is definitely worth reading in order see the universe's questions answered from a perspective of naturalism. "
181,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37471666-hannah,2,"First few sections, pretty decent. All downhill from there, especially in the audiobook. I really wish the author had not chosen to read his own book, as any respectable narrator would look up how to pronounce words in fields that are not their own. Not Dr Sean Carroll! His mispronunciation of reasonably common biological and philosophical terms was jarring and unpleasant, making me doubt his knowledge of the fields. In terms of the content of the book: also pretty boring. Nothing novel coming out here, just a materialist who appreciates a good story naming their worldview ""poetic naturalism"". The philosophy included is the sort covered in intro courses and the first couple weeks of a philosophy of mind course. The biology is poorly covered and the author even has the gall to suggest students are scared off of biology due to terminology directly after pronouncing adenine wrong and not explaining at all the naming conventions of enzymes he's discussing. Maybe somone who knows no biology or philosophy would enjoy this book. I pushed myself through the audiobook because it was easy listening given I knew all of the material except some of the modern physics. Wouldn't recommend to any scientist or philosopher."
182,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,5,"So many different disciplines and topics are packed into this book. Philosophy, metaphysics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, Core Theory, morality, ethics, and psychology are all included. I think the overall topic is poetic naturalism, of which Carroll is a proponent. Carroll's writing is to be commended for ease, flow, and use of analogies that make sense. A large part of the book is about how to connect our descriptions of the quantum, classical, cosmic, and human levels of reality. How does our description of fermions and bosons also describe a table, the motion of planets, and human emotion? The quantum world just does not jive with our everyday experiences so how can they both describe reality? Carroll takes the reader on a journey through each of these realms from the smallest to the largest to us humans. The last two parts of the book then delve into consciousness, thinking, and meaning. He touches on religion, morality, ethics and all the other seemingly nebulous aspects of being human. I enjoyed his view on these philosophically difficult questions. I am not sure if I am completely sold on his explanations but they are solid, well thought out, and convincing. "

First half of book deals with science, mainly particle physics, thermodynamics, some biology and chemistry, which provides building blocks to explain higher order and complex entities. It moves towards philosophy, and culminates with commentary on consciousness, free will, and morality. Although the author doesn't admit he is an atheist, his stance is to explain everything using his philosophy called poetic naturalism, leaving some of questions about soul, consciousness, etc tentatively answered - they are the entities that evolved as things became more complex and it depends on the way one chooses to describe things - as human as collection of atoms. Author's tone is gentle and language kind (unlike authors like Steven Pinker who goes ballistics towards anything they disagree with), but the content might still annoy people with religious bent. Memorable quotes from the book:‚ÄúThe purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide.‚Äù""We are star stuff which has taken its destiny into its own hands.‚Äù"
184,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63873795-julian-stanley,4,"It's one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read. Reality is composed of two things: the natural world and inner states (caring, meaning, purpose, etc). The twist is the inner states are ultimately physical states as well, thus part of the natural world.I would be curious to see a theist's response to the writing; something more substantial than ""faith"" or ""belief."" I have a counterargument, though it cannot be assigned a high credence.This is the crux of Carroll's viewpoint: Bayesian reasoning. From empirical evidence, the natural world came into being and trudges along without any external, sentient forces guiding it. Human beings are part of it, but we add flavor and color to the universe by our capacity for caring, yearning, and loving. These emergent inner states we have are no less real just because they ultimately result from impersonal laws of physics.That's Carroll's view anyway. Read and decide for yourself. As Carroll puts it: ""if our goal is to understand, we are on the same side.""This book is probably best for those curious about naturalism, and wish to know its deepest merits."

A ‚Äúship‚Äù instead of ‚Äúa collection of atoms‚Äù.3 - Value descriptions. Right and wrong, morality, goals, beauty. These are descriptions that science is less capable of describing.This is a big science book in the spirit of Carl Sagan‚Äôs famous book. Sean Carroll asks big questions and uses science to answer them (after all, he is a theoretical physicist), but he accepts the limits of science and our current understanding of the universe. But it‚Äôs more than just science; he takes the poetic naturalist‚Äôs view that you can talk about the nature of reality without having to go down to the most fundamental quantum mechanical descriptions. There plenty of room for philosophy without contradicting our understanding of the fundamentals.It‚Äôs a fascinating, sprawling book. It seemed a bit too broad as I was reading it, but after it percolated for a few days I appreciate how comprehensive it is.

It is essentially naturalism which states that the world is only made of stuff that obeys the laws of physics. The poetic part refers to our different ways of talking about these collections of atoms. If you take a gas chamber as an example. It only contains individual atoms and air molecules. At the atomic level, there is no such thing as temperature or airflow speed and direction. These concepts only make sense when describing the system at the macroscopic level. The author argues that these higher-level descriptions are not wrong due to not being based on the core theory. They are the best way to describe the emergent phenomenon. It would not be convenient to give a daily weather forecast talking about atoms, fields, and forces.The same idea can be extended to beliefs, thoughts, emotions, people, and consciousness. People are just a collection of atom obeying the laws of physics. Does it make sense to saw people make decisions? The author argues that it does since we appear to do so at the emergent level of human beings but not at the atomic level."

The continued focus on Bayesian reasoning was appreciated--and as someone who's spent years studying Computer Science, this was familiar terminology that helped ground the argument for me. But I've also been reading pop-science books for most of my life now, and didn't feel like there was anything tremendously groundbreaking or mind-bending here. /start_opinion/ Carroll's strength as a rigorous, and detached analytical/scientific writer, also holds him back from adding just a *bit* more flair and bravado that would make this work truly memorable and, well... more exciting. /end_opinion/There's a lot of ground covered here, and Carroll does an excellent job as both writer and teacher, but I guess I was expecting something a bit more mind-expanding, (or even a bit scientifically radical) based on the title. I'd almost look at this like an introductory textbook, as much as a pop-sci beach book. It manages to work from both angles, but I also wish it was more focused from only one."

The lack of an objective scientific grounding for morality is something to deal with, something that needs discussion and for which secular people are thirsty for knowledge. Carroll is a good grown up voice for this task. As promised by the title, Carroll covers a lot of territory. Rooted in naturalism, ""a philosophy of unity and patterns, describing all of reality as a seamless web,"" this proved a good reader in cosmology, the core theory, complexity, and to an extent philosophy of mind and moral philosophy. Carroll presents a compelling strategy for talking about how you go from quarks and quantums to what is right and wrong. Astrophysics is nicely wed with evolutionary theory here, with lines resonating. ""Our anatomy reflects the accidents of our evolutionary history,"" applies almost metaphorically to all forms of life, of space and time."

Really. Finding meaning in the existence of the universe, life, consciousness, morality, prescriptive ethics, free-will (or lack thereof) and the finality of death can all be inferred through Bayesian reasoning, and Carroll introduces the concept of ""Poetic Naturalism"", which is essentially useful ways of talking about the world at different levels at the same time according to their appropriate domains of applicability. This has huge implications because although the fundamental laws of physics don't describe things like chairs, people, time, or the rules of basketball, they do exist in the sense that they are useful ways of describing our macroscopic reality, and as such they are knowable."

The discourse was certainly interesting, but not quite in the mind-blowing way that Greene's book was for me. I was already familiar with most of the topics covered by Carroll, but there were still some new and interesting ones: coarse-graining, emergence, Laplace's Demon, etc.This is a wonderful book if you are interested in learning more about the philosophical implications of physics. I think it would have been better for me to read Greene's book after reading this one first. ""The Big Picture"" is much more foundational, which is perhaps why I felt that it was underwhelming.Still, I will definitely be checking out more by Sean Carroll, because I love his ideas and he's always an interesting podcast guest."

The author talks through some pretty heavy stuff: the origin of the universe, quantum physics, the evolution of sentience, the afterlife (or lack of one), moral philosophy, and more; and explains how poetic naturalism is consistent with what science tells us about the world.The scope of this book is immense and the subject matter is mind-meltingly dense at times, but he has a way of writing that makes things understandable to a layperson. (The only part that completely went over my head was the description of the core theory of quantum mechanics which forms the appendix--something he admits is grad-level physics.)I can see myself re-reading this, and probably getting even more from it the second time round."

As explained toward the end, his movement from a self defined ""believer"" and grandmother following churchgoer to a non-believer was a gradual one. What the ""Big Picture"" sets out to do is to reconcile his way of seeing the world as propelled by unseen and unfeeling forces with the feeling and seeing world we believe we inhabit. I found the first parts and the last parts most enjoyable. The middle parts bogged down in the sciences a bit for me. Core theory and the quantum realm could have been treated much more succinctly. But the more philosophical parts on morality and logic are most enjoyable and enlightening. My interest here though no doubt stems from my own background in philosophy and my own identity as a non-believer. The physics majors out there are likely to feel the opposite. "

Sean Carroll goes deep into fundamental questions. What is the universe? What is time? What is life? What is existence? What is consciousness? What is value and meaning? Where do we come from? All of these questions are being addressed using scientific approach, empricism, and skepticism. ""The universe is not a miracle. It simply is, unguided and unsustained, manifesting the patterns of nature with scrupulous regularity. Over billions of years it has evolved naturally, from a state of low entropy toward increasing complexity, and it will eventually wind down to a featureless equilibrium. We are the miracle, we human beings. Not a break-the-laws-of-physics kind of miracle; a miracle in that it is wondrous and amazing how such complex, aware, creative, caring creatures could have arisen in perfect accordance with those laws.

My brain, possible due to age, can not absorb this material (and it takes up a decent portion of the work). I was far more receptive to the issues revolving around Morality and Ethics, and the author did a great job of explicating important considerations especially if you have left behind the presumed insights of religions. This book does a better job than most in addressing issues that always seem one arms length beyond my reach, and I am happy to have read the book.

Some uniquely emergent to just human-level domains of applicability and others fundamental to the inner-workings of the universe that should not be called out from their capability where their is little insight to be gained. We can tell ourselves numerous stories (the poetic in poetic naturalism) that do not need to be tied to fundamental physics but that, with rigorous reasoning can still help us to understand the conditions of consciousness, meaning, free will, morality, and love. Carroll does not write prosaically like Lightman, has fewer novel concepts than Deutsch, and the philosophy debates he has with the Moral Landscape of Harris fall flat, but he tells of a compelling big picture that is intellectually honest and usefully pragmatic where mystery, physics, and research intersect."

And while the author is explaining the universe & the nature of reality, he is also deftly skewering religious beliefs, that is, any beliefs in anything that is not material. Quite a contrast to the furious attacks of writers like Sam Harris & Christopher Hitchens! Part One: Cosmos, includes his approach to the universe, what he calls ""poetic naturalism."" Part Two: Understanding, & the remaining four parts are Essence, Complexity, Thinking, & Caring.

Why are we here? Why is there life? What is reality? What is consciousness? Why is there something rather than nothing? Sean Carroll provides a brief (relative to what I'm assuming is the vast length at which he could have answered these questions) summary of what we know up to this point regarding these big questions and many more, plus what we don't know, and what we are still looking for. The reading requires real concentration, and though he's writing for non-scientists, there were still a lot of concepts that I don't think I'm going to grasp. But even the most difficult concepts spur wonder and thought that are endlessly fascinating, and give me perspective, humility, and vast gratitude in my presence and part in the universe. "
198,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67015896-j-j-falco,5,"Sean Carrol is now one of my heroes. The Big Picture brings together nearly all types of intellectual thought (there's nothing mathematical that was new to me) - science, philosophy, logic - and shows perfectly how each on its own cannot define reality. Together, and with good-faith effort on the part of the thinker, they describe reality while translating it into something humans can make sense of. Hence, the perfect title of the book.It's truly beautiful. We don't need magic or fantasy to feel wonder. There's no need to ascribe some overarching purpose or meaning to existence as a whole. We exist. That's all that matters. Reality is what it is and it's up to us to ascribe meaning and purpose to our own individual lives. Theoretical physicist, Sean Carroll, couldn't have ended the book any more perfectly or beautifully:""Three billion heartbeats. The clock is ticking."""

I didn't totally agree with everything that was posited by Poetic Naturalism, but as a Cognitheistic Panthiest I certainly agreed with 97% of it. Not sure how someone without a scientific background would relate to it, but the basis of the core theory and how it relates to ""All your thoughts on God"" seemed very well expressed. The rest is just me not agreeing with mainstream Physics. I don't believe the superposition is real - I think it is an artifact of our measuring system. And although that wouldn't change the equations we use it in, it does have an impact on the future of the Universe, the origin of Dark matter and ultimately the essence of Cognition as the natural order of the Universe. Very thought provoking and was quite addicted to the next level of his discussion."
201,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76693507-jonathan-bechtel,5,"I finally got around to reading this gem. This is my first Sean Carroll book and he writes with such an agreeable ease, almost like you two are having coffee while he explains quantum physics to you. The chapters are short but are packed with good quality subjects to chew on. I highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially people like me with no real background knowledge, no extensive background knowledge anyways, of physics or anything quantum. He makes a great case for poetic naturalism, that this life is all that there is, so it's up to us to give it meaning and purpose. No afterlife, no behind-the-scenes ultimate string puller. Just the awesome laws of physics and the ways of talking about it and the grand emergence of us humans and the meaningful ways we can make sense of reality. All in all, a fantastic read. "
202,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86703779-chrissy,4,"this book goes deep. Not easy reading in many respects but it will challenge your thinking about such subjects as the meaning of life and the Universe. To me it is more about philosophy than science, but it very effectively links the two into a collaborative association. Fair amount of theology included as well. In my opinion, a very badly needed book that makes a valiant and mostly successful shot at explaining how we come to know things and to find meaning in that knowledge so science can become more than just facts and figures and incomprehensible jargon that, quite frankly, turns a lot of people off. As a biologist (actually ecologist) I found the book to be an important perspective on trying to link so many different views into a unified thought ""ecosystem."" Highly recommended and well written book on the meaning of existence."
203,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40731421-zaque-eyn,5,"Having read Richard Dawkins, this book proved to be a very great companion to the things I learned from the former. What I most enjoy about this read is the scope of information it brings to light, while telling the story about us Humans in such a way that is not only insightful, but brings verifiable facts into play in such a way that is not dumbed down. Of course one can always make the argument against this type of science and dispute it‚Äôs validity... however the author invites us to expand our minds and offers counter arguments against his arguments so that one can have both sides of the science to determine what it is that they should, or want to, believe. But like Richard Dawkins, if you take the belief that these science based facts are not true it is really hard to defend against them as the author points out the flaws in the arguments against them. Very compelling read, insightful and full of fascinating information that broadens our understanding of what it is to be Human. "
204,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3111883-evan,5,"Rather than chronicling the development of the universe from the Big Bang to the present, the author embarks upon the rather daunting task of showing how the current laws of physics, known physical forces, quantum mechanics, and the Core Theory are sufficient to explain everything (at least within the applicable context of this universe). Additionally, he tackles questions of origin, faith, self-perception, morality, and consciousness from the scientific perspective; maintaining an objective view and relying on the aforementioned laws, forces, and theorems to explain as much of these subjective topics as possible. And somehow, he manages to do so in an engaging and conversational tone, enabling the non-particle physicist to actually digest and enjoy this near-500 page book without suffering an aneurysm."
205,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51787523-jamie,4,"The Big Picture is a wonderful coalescence of science and philosophy, the stitchings of which provide edification and calibration to the human condition.Though Carroll‚Äôs scientific descriptions may lack the clinical splendour of predecessors Feynman and Sagan (but let‚Äôs face it, they‚Äôre tough acts to follow), his inquisitive ardor has fashioned an ecstatic read nonetheless. The bounty of truth eclipses illusion. Life is beautiful not in spite of but because of its transience. Meaning can be constructed with rationality, dignity and grace, unadulterated by the absence of a deity. With the publication of The Big Picture, Carroll has contributed a worthy verse to the naturalist rhapsody, echoing the sublime sentiment expressed best by our old pal Charles Darwin:‚ÄúThere is grandeur in this view of life.‚Äù fuck yea there is, charles. "
206,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15993983-sophia-emille,4,"Very interesting and educational. Carroll employs an incredibly wide range of scientific and philosophical concepts and theories, beginning with the microscopic/atomic levels of the universe and progressing to consciousness and morality in human begins, to essentially argue that the universe and humanity do not require any external/divine origin in order to exist and keep existing. On that same note, Carroll himself remains very respectful to all other beliefs, and to theism in general, considering he‚Äôs writing from a naturalist perspective. Ultimately, he concludes that human beings themselves are the miracle: the fact that ‚Äúsuch complex, aware, creative, caring creatures could have arisen in perfect accordance with [natural] laws‚Äù is a miracle in and of itself, which I found both beautiful and hopeful."
207,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76660734-felipe,5,"Sean Carroll goes a long way to explain how several existencial questions can be understood in light of the current scientific understanding, and in this way provides an accurate ""way of talking"" (his poetic naturalism ontology) about our mundane experiences and how they fit into the bigger picture (as put in his title). I've been following Sean's lectures for a while, and it always amuses me how he manages to address these subjects in a very simple and straight forward way, extinguishing the ""wiggle room"" that is often used by people who misappropriate scientific vocabulary to reach invalid conclusions, specially in regards to supernatural phenomena, life's complexity amidst a chaotic universe and the role of quantum physics in our everyday lives. A must read for anyone who enjoys the wonders of a naturalistic view of the universe."

It shows in subtle way the author is inclined towards a certain belief and nudges the readers towards that.The topic - inconclusive, lacks direction though the TOC is made really impressive ( selling point). It's like a philosophical lecture without an objective.Fair attempt to merge science with spirituality but falls short, probably due to a degree of biase, or lack on understanding it limit of knowledge or experiencetowards anything spiritual. Simply put noon believer.Definitely a lot of good points and learning to take away though in parts.Not something I would like to refer again or read another one of the author."
209,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23234680-bob-mackin,4,"This is an ambitious book in which Physicist Carroll describes his philosophy of ""Poetic Naturalism"". Unlike many of the books by modern physicists in which the author espouses strict reductionism, claiming that we'll be able to deduce all knowledge from the laws of quantum physics, Carroll recognizes the existence of emergent phenomena and the importance of looking at problems at the appropriate scale. He demands only that they be consistent. The book was strongest in the first 2/3, where the focus was on science, and faltered a bit when he ventured into consciousness, free will, and morality, and finding one's purpose. It seems he couldn't make up his mind whether his objective was to present his philosophy or to debunk theism and he got stuck somewhere in between. Regardless, it was a good, thought-provoking read."

From life's meaning to consciousness and evolution, Carroll delivers an educated, thoughtful response to all of these different fields of human inquiry. I'm a Christian theist. Carroll's book has given me much to think about, not so much in not thinking God exists anymore, but about how I now better understand the other side's position. I hope to learn more so that I am better able to understand the naturalist, to converse with him, and ultimately to eloquently share why I think the way I do. Great read. Can't wait for more. "
211,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7201581-brent-davies,1,"The science was quite fascinating and he obviously has that part down, however he blatantly misses the mark in his arguments against God and his role in the universe. IÔ∏è am not writing this review to get into a debate with the atheist scientists in his camp, but IÔ∏è have to stand and say there is a place where pure science and pure religion are one. God‚Äôs ways are not our ways and we don‚Äôt understand all the mysteries of the universe and the creation yet because God wants us to live in this fallen world by faith. He does want us to strive to understand its workings and learn as much as we can but don‚Äôt be so full of yourself as scientists to think that you understand it all because of what you can see and understand at this point."
212,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6974552-kent,4,"This is a very nicely written book. It's about many different things, but in a nutshell I would say that it is a pop physics book, but written from a philosophical standpoint. He mainly writes from a standpoint of poetic naturalism, which is seeing the physical world in a naturalistic way, but also knowing that there are many different ways to tell each story. You cannot describe someone by knowing every atom they are composed of. Things are much more than what they are composed of. He goes through the book talking about the meaning of life in a cold universe with quantum mechanics and core theory, but still being able to find purpose. It's a great read overall and filled with physics and philosophy. "
213,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43986941-sonya,5,"When I first heard about this book, not long after it came out, I figured I would no doubt like it. Like many other books I want to read, it sort of got pushed to the back of the line because I had so many other things to read...then, it came out as a $1.99 BookBub deal on Kindle, and I got it!I can honestly say it was even better than I'd hoped. Dr. Carroll deftly weaves together a ""big picture"" from across the various scientific disciplines of quantum mechanics, biology, chemistry, evolution, neuroscience, behavioral science, and adds a thought-provoking and fascinating (to me, anyway) philosophical inlay of human consciousness. For those who enjoy reading about everything science and philosophy, you won't be disappointed!"
214,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83308431-daniel-innes,5,"An exceptional read. Given how much Sean Carroll bit off, I found it to be very manageable and insightful. Tieing up all of our current worldly understanding into a neat package is no mean feat and one which I appreciate greatly. Importantly, I found that I gained a more succinct perspective on each of the topics in the book, each adding to the overall picture.The quantum mechanics almost always goes over my head, but every time it does I become more familiar with how weird and unintuitive it is. The description of the emergent properties of macro-scale systems explained a lot for me, especially in the way that poetic naturalism gives credence to the reality of useful concepts. A very good reminder of the power of taking a step back and marvelling at it all."
215,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48629227-mallen-baker,5,"For me, Sean Carroll hits the sweet spot with this book - he gives a compelling narrative that eases you into some of the scientific principles to be discussed, but then he doesn't spare you the detail that you need to at least partly grasp the complexity and often the astonishing magic of the topic at hand. I came away with several new areas for future reading to dig deeper, and with a great sense of perspective for what we know about universe, and how much there is still to know (much of which we will probably never fully uncover).It's a book to give you wonderment, and to whet the appetite for more. Thoroughly recommended to anyone looking to explore the big questions and not afraid to reread a paragraph occasionally to be able to absorb some serious detail."
216,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53446876-the-wordsworm,3,"I received an ebook advanced-copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Thank you to NetGalley and Penguin Group Dutton for providing me with this copy.The Big Picture brings together physics and philosophy to consider some of the big questions of life, the universe and everything. This could have resulted in an unwieldy lump of a book, but this 480-page beast has been broken down into well thought-out sections and manageable chapters which walk you through Sean Carroll‚Äôs thought-process.The book seeks show how our scientific understanding of the universe can explain how the universe came into existence, how life was an inevitable consequence of the laws of physics of this universe, and how consciousness is an inevitable consequence of life. But it is also more than this; it is a thesis for independent and critical thinking, and a reassurance that a meaningful and moral life can be found within (and perhaps could be a logical consequence of) a naturalist state of mind.The book begins with the cosmos, which seems like a fairly intimidating place to start, given its size and complexity, but is in fact a gentle introduction to the tone and style of the rest of the book. It takes us through the fundamental nature of reality, where Carroll shows how ontology affects observation. This leads neatly to a definition of what Carroll calls ‚ÄúPoetic Naturalism‚Äù. From here causality and the arrow of time are defined and explained, not only in terms of the words we use to describe them, but also in terms of physics, particularly at a quantum level. This is an important foundation to build as it leads to an explanation of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, which together explain both memories and causes, and thus how human beings experience space-time.From this foundation, the book progresses to a section entitled ‚ÄúUnderstanding‚Äù. This explores the different ontologies we employ in order to make judgements about information and form opinions about the things we believe to be true. Carroll presents a number of ontologies, followed by analyses of their virtues and disadvantages. The tone of analysis is logical and evenly weighted, ultimately leading to a conclusion that the Bayesian approach is the most even-handed.The Essence section explores what we know about the universe, explains the quantum realm and how to interpret it. A definition of the Core Theory is the presented, from which Carroll describes what we are made of, what the world is made of, and why the universe exists. From this deep physics, he then discusses scientific understanding of the body and soul, and death.Complexity explains the intricacy of the universe as an inevitable outcome of the laws of physics. Entropy, the force which takes the universe from a state of order through a gradual decline into disorder, is described using the example of cream being mixed into coffee. This lovely visual example shows how as an extremely organised state of particles (the cream sat on top of the coffee) is subjected to entropy (stick a spoon in and give it a quick stir) the coffee particles and cream particles become arranged in a complex and beautiful way before the process completes and the cream particles are evenly distributed within the coffee particles. From here it explains how the universe as we currently observe it, in all its wonderful complexity and harbouring of life, is a natural state to find ourselves in as our universe transitions from extreme order into disorder. You can probably tell ‚Äì this was my favourite section of the book.Part five explores consciousness, and the enigmatic structures that are our brains. This naturally progresses into a discussion of artificial intelligence, and explores the question ‚Äúcould a computer become conscious?‚Äù and ‚Äúhow does consciousness arise?‚Äù Carroll doesn‚Äôt claim to have all the answers, but does clearly explain what science knows so far, where the gaps are, and what can reasonably be inferred until further scientific knowledge is gained. In seeking to address the questions surrounding consciousness, Carroll acknowledges that ultimately we are all built from inanimate particles, and postulates on various trains of thought that might prove useful directions of enquiry.The final section moves away from physics, and sits itself firmly in the realms of philosophy. Carroll asks how we can find meaning in our lives while existing in a universe that keeps moving without apparent regard for our existence. He gives his views on spiritualism, and how those who prefer to live by a naturalist ontology can find meaning and fulfilment. This leads to a discussion of the various incarnations of the Ten Commandments, and Carroll‚Äôs offering of the Ten Considerations. With these in mind, he seems to suggest, we can find both personal fulfilment and make the world a better place.The physics in this book is fascinating. I enjoy reading popular science books for the joy of being introduced to new concepts. The Big Picture covered a lot of concepts I had read in other books, but shed new light on them, showing the consequences of those concepts on the world we observe.It was heavy reading, requiring a lot of focus in order to keep track of the sheer volume of information and to fully understand each argument and concept. In a month where my reading time has been fragmented and brief, keeping up with this book was hard work. It definitely requires a time commitment, and I think would be more easily read over a shorter time span. It is an intriguing read, and has left me with plenty to think about."
217,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25528896-tom-lous,5,"Like his namesake Carroll leads me through the rabbit hole towards my realisation that I'm a so called 'poetic naturalist' myself.What I like most about this book that there are no presumptions and every supposition is held to the highest scrutiny. Through these discussions the facts and fiction of many stances on different subjects are compared and it's hard not to come to the same conclusion as Carroll. Of course this is where the books leads you, but the book feels sincere and very conscientious.I'll probably have to reread this many times to catch all the subtleties, but in general I can recommend this book to everyone."
218,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9898446-david-teachout,5,"Carroll sets out to do what I considered nearly impossible: a comprehensive, concise and approachable description of known physics and the role it plays in every layer of the human experience. He succeeds and does so in a way that will have you asking more questions from a position of the sheer joy of discovery. If you want a well-articulated, poetically masterful explanation of naturalism and the state of the natural sciences, I can think of no better book to start (and for most end) on than this one. This is not just science, it is a testament to the power of philosophy to guide the human path towards understanding the universe and our place in it. "
219,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14291907-jimagn,5,"Sean Carroll was already one of my favorite authors. The Big Picture secures his standing among the elite. His writing is clear, lucid, and full of examples and models that leave me feeling relieved and satisfied with my understanding. His humor is evident throughout, as are his passion for science and love for those in his life. I read this as an ebook on loan from my local library and regret that I now don't have a copy of my own. I found myself saving quotes that I can refer to later. I'm not sure I've ever done that with any other ebook on loan. I highly recommend reading this book ... But you might want to get your own copy."
220,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18576003-betsy-d,4,"Goodreads' blurb describes the book well. I think I understood almost all the physics, since much of it was a review for me. He tries to make it all accessible. He makes a good explanation of how science can account for everything around us and about us, though he relies on saying that consciousness is an ""emergent property"" of what physics and biology have learned. Not a detailed explanation of how it emerges. No supernatural intervention required, as I believe. He says it leaves us to make our own purpose and morals. I basically agree with that, though much is made for us by culture. I recommend doing that work in n open-minded community."

We are the miracle, we human beings. Not a break the laws of physics kind of miracle; a miracle in that it is wondrous and amazing how such complex, aware, creative, caring creatures could have arisen in perfect accordance with those laws.

The author's style is clear and filled with sharp reasoning and worthwhile examples. This is a book that makes you think and isn't afraid to introduce questions without giving you all the answers. I walked away with far more knowledge than I began this book with."
223,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,1,"Although the description of the book never attracted me in the first place, Sean Carroll is such an excellent writer, in particular an excellent writer of popular science both in book and blog form, that I decided to give it a whirl. Well, I'm not quite sure who the target audience for this book is, but what I am certain is that it is most definitely not me. The first 3+ hours of the audiobook consistently lulled me to sleep with Intro to philosophy 101 observations on causality and the terminology employed to discuss it, both elaborated at great lengths, to the point of losing patience and no longer giving a fig about what the rest of the book is."
224,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10756779-wayne,5,"This was an excellent book. Sean Carroll introduced Poetic Naturalism and showed how it was compatible with the natural world we see and how theism isn't. It's heavy on physics as you might expect from a theoretical physicist. But I had no trouble keeping up. Though, if you fancy yourself up on quantum mechanics, the Appendix A will be a treat...Importantly, Carroll doesn't just show how theism isn't compatible with the world we see, but offers how one could live a moral, well-lived life without theism. It's fairly long, but broken up into digestible chapters (roughly 30 min each in audio format). Which is good since it gives you lots to think about."
225,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49349428-bryan-d-hopkins,4,"This was a painful, yet rewarding read. Sean Carroll did an excellent job making his case for Poetic Naturalism, but I wanted something more objective. I think he‚Äôs a brilliant thinker, just disagree. His willingness to have his cake and eat it too is painful to listen to as someone who has made their peace with determinism. Compatiblism to him is basically don‚Äôt be a dick atheist determinist. That should go without saying, but I can understand that he is speaking from a well established context. We need to move towards more honest explanations of human behavior for very real reasons. Sean doesn‚Äôt seem in a hurry to reconcile fantasy and reality, but I don‚Äôt blame him. It‚Äôs hard. "

It is immensely interesting and definitely a book that will blow you mind with the scope that it covers. I‚Äôve read many science books and have yet to find a mainstream one that offers a clearer insight into the Second Law of Thermodynamics that this book tackles so successfully. That alone is worth reading the book. Having said that, it covers so much more from quantum mechanics to Bayesian Logic. I also really just appreciate Carrols love and fondness of Science. It really shows in his writing and I think a lot of people would really GET something out of it, even if it‚Äôs not what you intended to get."

Carroll start with the most fundamental problems in philosophy of asking ""what exists"" and ""how do we know"". He then writes about the start of our universe, basic building blocks of matter, strange phenomena in quantum physics. With a solid ground in physics, he builds on how life could've arose on Earth, and how all living things have evolved through natural selection. Then we tackle one of the most puzzling problem we have yet encountered, the problem of consciousness. He surveys major struggles in philosophy of mind and finally presents a humanist worldview on ethics."

Write about what you know, Sean. That‚Äôs why I bought the book. What animus drives you to delve into dismissing theology? Your basic argument throughout the book went like this: Science provides a better explanation of origins than does religion, so religion should be dismissed. You make the mistake of discussing theology only through the eyes of physics. Just like I wouldn‚Äôt want a Jesuit priest to explain quantum field theory, I don‚Äôt want a physicist to explain theology. "
229,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1006288-donna,3,"Interesting and somewhat understandable for the casual listener with a marginal scientific background (nothing since undergrad classes). Here's what I don't understand - how a brilliant, well-educated scientist can claim to be open-minded, that there is a possibility of multiple universes and that there are laws of physics that may be amended (much like Newton's law of gravity) in the future can claim without equivocation that there is no possible way that there could be life after death. And of course anyone who doesn't agree just doesn't get it. Still, it helped me understand the Universe just a little better. It's readable even if I didn't agree with everything. "

It's called the big picture for a reason; it touches on a wiiiiiide swath of human knowledge and discovery over the centuries. But because of that it can't go into much depth on any particular topic. For some readers this might be enough but i found it a bit lacking and had to force myself to power through it at times.Bottom line: it's a good primer on the history of human thought and has Carrol's usual easy-going style, but it might leave you wanting more."

I understand the reality of our universe far better now than I did when I started reading- in particular Bayesian reasoning felt revolutionary to me. I had a guide through the reading, someone with a far stronger physics background than me, and that created a unique experience where this was as much a conversation between the two of us as a read.

This book is broken down into six sections: Cosmos, Understanding, Essence, Complexity, Thinking and Caring. Eventually the author delves into science after a long discussion on Philosophy.  The end of this book is a personal narrative on moving from Christianity to naturalism. This is definitely one of the better parts of the book. This spiritual discussion could stand out as it's own book. "

The author is a Caltech physicist who is writing about the intersection of science and philosophy. He does a great job of talking about how science works and what's knowable,provable and observable. He's pretty clear that science is never settled. He also talks about consciousness, life and even zombies (as part of Turing tests). Makes me wish I was smarter. The quantum field theory discussion is hard to follow on audio, that's par of why I bought the print book. This was really fun. "

Somehow addressing complex topics of physics and various metaphysical ideas in a sensible and sober application of language that simplifies as it defines. The chapters are short and digestible, Carroll's sentences sharp and clear. Instead of feeling baffled by the language of physics I felt comfortable and eager to follow Carroll through his demonstrations and precise arguments for the compatibility of a pluralistic and complex human reality based in a soundly physical universe.

Bought it at Irvine Borders Noble and expected really high to the book, as I was captured by its short chapter by chapter pace, and most of the topics such as the origin of universe and us are also my interests. However author focus too much on philosophy and too less on science. And his repeated statement of poetic naturalism is really too boring and also annoying.

He repeatedly sets up straw men telling the reader what religious people believe and then shows using his philosophy of poetic naturalism how deluded those religious people are. It's evangelical atheism, and it's not very well done. And if that weren't enough, he misexplains entropy so much so that I wonder if he really understands what entropy is."

One thing that I didn't like about this book is his constant bashing of a 'straw man' God. It gets tiring after a point. We get it, God is not an old man in the sky. "

Instead, a lot of philosophy, almost all of which I had studied extensively in the past. I especially liked the detailed discussion about the beginning of life, and appreciated the approachable language. "

He deals with the hard problem of consciousness, mentions ""The Purpose Driven Life"", and debunks panpsychism. The time is thoughtful and irenic, different than Dawkins. I was slightly disappointed by the brevity of his chapter on existential therapy. I'll definitely be reading more of his books."

Carroll hits on just about everything here from ancient philosophocal dilemas to wacko quantum mechanics theories. I really enjoys the way this book made me think, I highly recommend. I give a 4 star only because I think he gets a little too scientifically in depth on equations and thing like that lol."

Though these words may come from a brilliant thinker, my take is this is jumbled and rambling to the point where I tended to disagree with the authors points because I resented the stream of consciousness-like trails he pulled me through. Too brilliant for a little editing?"

Each of us will have a last word we say, a last book we read, a last time we fall in love.‚Äù"
297,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105995025-bertram,5,"This books is somehow an introduction to almost everything. An introduction to various fields within physics, ideas within philosophy as well as general science. Carroll asks some very hard questions and manages to answer them faithfully. Whether you agree with everything or not it's a great kick-start for a think about all the big questions. Wonderfully written."
298,0525954821,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349067-mary-anne,5,"Carroll is clear and fairly easy to understand without much heavy physics or math, yet he discusses serious topics such as physics and philosophy that are nowadays usually kept apart. He argues as a self-avowed atheist with the compassion of a religious person, for as he maintains, we do not need religion and a fear of an afterlife to live a moral life. "

So, I just had to listen to his latest book on Audible. I quite like the way he frames his ontology as Poetic Naturalism. I can see myself buying the actual book because there are parts I would like to reread to gain a better understanding."
