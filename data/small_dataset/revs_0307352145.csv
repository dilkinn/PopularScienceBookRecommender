“There's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.”
I read this book for the same reason most people read this book: I am an introvert. I have always been an introvert, and it's a fundamental, sometimes limiting, part of who I am. I've learned to deal with it better over the years - learned to clasp my shaking hands together during presentations, force myself to breathe normally and keep my voice steady, even force myself to make the first move in social situations. Unless you are also an introvert, you probably won't understand the efforts I have to go to (and the psychological strain this puts on me) just to behave in a way that is considered socially acceptable and is desired by employers.It's actually caused me upset and distress for many reasons. Firstly because I find it hard to cope in the many situations where bright, outgoing personalities thrive. Secondly because it's just considered a negative trait. Look at magazines, look at books like How to Win Friends and Influence People, look at job applications asking for ""people persons"". I remember reading teen magazines in high school and seeing stupid articles about how to attract boys - confident, dazzling personalities are a necessity! - and feeling a very real blow to my self-esteem.But I have accepted it as an unfortunate fact of reality for years - the simple conclusion that being introverted is a bad thing. Not a terrible thing, and definitely not an impossible thing to cope with - technology billionaires are often introverts after all - but something limiting (like a lower intelligence) that I must constantly battle against to make it through this world.Until I read this book.Susan Cain uses facts, statistics and her own case studies to show that introverts are greatly successful and powerful, not in spite of their introversion, but because of it. She compares different types of businesses and teamwork to show how extroverts and introverts each excel in different types of business environments. For example, extroverts often lead businesses better when there is little input from other team members; whereas introverts thrive in situations that rely on the input of a team because they are more likely to listen to the other members and implement their ideas.From Harvard Business School students to Ivy League professors to Rosa Parks, Cain looks at the different types of influence introverts and extroverts have. She does not place favour on one or the other, but instead portrays a view of the world in which both have an extremely important part to play - it just so happens that the extroverts tend to be ""louder"" about it. It's an important, engaging book that pulled along even a lover of fiction and fantasy like me. And, though comforting, it is still a respectable study that achieves more than just making introverts feel a little better about themselves. The findings speak for themselves and not only serve to please a shy little weirdo like me, but also make a lot of sense.An important read for introverts and extroverts alike.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"

On sundays I often join the walking club for a long 25km walk, but I prefer to do it alone (and oh, all the pity looks you get!). The idea of surprise parties makes me sick to my stomach, and any event where a thousand people are together is possibly even worse. I dislike small talk, but I probably hate even more how nervous I get when I have to do it. I can feel sad for a bruised tomato no-one wants to buy (hey, he tried his best too, not his fault someone dropped him!), and while everyone else goes to the modern, light apothecary across the street with the super nice people always happy to help, I go to the dark and older one who never has clients (how else will he survive?)Turns out I'm not that weird. I'm just a full blood introvert. And yet, I'm not what you think. I'm not particularly shy, I'm not the grey bird that never says a word and everyone forgets she's around. I'm very opinionated and quite stubborn, and when amongst friends I know well, I can be the loudest person in the room. But still I'm introvert. After being with friends or colleagues, I need recharging time. I need to be alone. I (almost) always think before I talk. I enjoy getting to the bottom of things, I enjoy detective work. And I can go on and on.While reading this book, on occasion I was nodding so hard I thought my head might fall off.There were very little eye-opening surprises in this book, and even a few things I didn't agree with or I would have hoped for her to explore more. Even a few occasions I thought she was idealizing introverts. This book was not perfect, but somehow i feel that it was important for me to read it.Overall, it was quite liberating. I'm not that weird! About a third of us on this planet (and on a website as Goodreads probably a LOT more) are more or less like me - not completely like me, I'm still unique (I insist!)But that might not be an issue. Though some of you might recognize some of my examples above, I've never met someone before that can feel bad for a bruised tomato. So maybe i'm still little weird, and my own unique self. Hoorah"
2,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-extremely-stable-genius,4,"March 6th was Super Tuesday and I live in that Oh-so-much-talked-about-battle-ground-state of Ohio. I work the elections as a Ballot Judge, which means I hand out the ballots to the voters and give them instructions. I get to talk and talk, for 13 hours straight *sigh*. I try to make it entertaining for the voters, myself and the others I work with because of its repetition, but by 7:30 pm when the polls close I don’t think the language I was using was English.My spiel went something like this…….Me: “Hi. What ballot can I get for you today?”Voter: “Uh…….what do you mean?”Me: “Today we have, Democratic, Republican, Libertarian or Green (I have never given out the last two)”.Voter: “What’s a Green party?”Me: “I’m not sure, but there is next to nothing on their ballot.”Voter: “I’m and independent (code for embarrassed Republican) can’t I have both a Democratic AND Republican ballot?”Me: “No, you must declare one and you will be that party until the next primary. Ohio is a closed primary state.”Voter: “Uh….then give me a *whispers* a Democrat one.”Me: *loudly* “Democratic it is! Take all this to a table and vote, when you are done bring everything back to Rosemary in the red sweater by that machine. Make sure to tear off the stub on the bottom of the ballot…….the one that is marked “do not detach” when you come up to the machine. If you don’t, you will make Rosemary angry (a very sweet and very old woman) and you won’t like her when she’s angry. She will cover you in I Voted stickers.”This resulted in lots of chuckles, but I did it 301 times. I was drained. I slept for 12 hours that night. Twelve. Grant it, I got up at stupid O ‘clock to get to the polls by 6 am and maybe had 4 hours of sleep, but I was just a shell my former self. I am an introvert. Introverts and extroverts are most easily determined by how their energy is drained and how it is refreshed. Extroverts are drained when they have spent too much time alone, and the opposite is true for introverts. So for me, my life force was gone.In the United States our culture is biased towards the extrovert. We are about the loudness, the out there, the utter insanity if you will. In school “poor Johnny is so quiet, he needs to come out of his shell.” I want to scream “Leave him alone…..he’s FINE, he likes his shell!” School rooms now do this Pod thing where they pull four desks together and make these poor kids work as a team. WTF? No way would have that “concept” worked for me and it’s not working for introverted kids.“There’s no I in team” and that is a damn dirty shame.I haven’t worked in an office setting in years, so when I read in this book that office places are arranging offices areas with an open concept, everybody face to face with no walls. Workers going about their day, shooting the shit, getting ideas……brainstorming (which doesn't work). Who in the hell thought that one up? What a nightmare. What if I only tolerate a certain co-worker……now I have to stare at his annoying face all day, every day? How is anything ever accomplished? Companies are beginning to realize this mistake and are changing things up. Google (I think it was them) designed their offices with food, bathrooms and the like all in the center, like a town center, with offices around the edges. It is designed for casual meetings where ideas everyone figured out in their quiet offices are shared and expanded.Introverts are a third to half of the population. Many of these don’t even know they are introverted, because of the push to be extroverted has made them fool themselves into thinking they were extroverts.Another interesting thing I learned from this book is that extroverts are motivated by rewards. They work toward things, and take risks if need be to get to the goal of getting that reward. Extroverts are soooo happy when they get the reward.Introverts are motivated by fear. So they do things more cautiously, careful not to mess things up in the process of getting to a goal. That sounds like me. It’s doesn't sound cool that I am afraid to F things up, but I am.This book is interesting, whether you are an I or an E. Because if you’re not an introvert, odds are you know and love one.Also posted at Shelfinflicted"
3,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly,3,"In a twist that will surprise precisely no one, this book spends a fair amount of time cheering for introverts. What were the odds, right? I assume if you're picking this book up you're on board with that to a certain extent, and likely something of an introvert yourself. This book is certainly for you-or for the perplexed extrovert or ""pseudo-extrovert"" that might be confused by your supposedly mysterious ways. It's a sort of shield, a blockade, a set of reinforced walls that Cain feels it is necessary to throw up around introverts (particularly American introverts) to protect them from the ""Extrovered Ideal,"" of American socialization. The tone of the beginning of the book is thus rather defiant, like Cain is screaming back at everyone she has ever felt pressured by to go to a happy hour or to a dinner party when she had much rather just read a book instead. There's some of this kick-back throughout the book, with plenty of cathartic/sympathetic/rather relatable war stories from introverts just tryin' to make it in an extrovert's world. It is particularly meant to speak to introverts in the high flying business, legal, and/or educational world, where a premium is put on socializing, teamwork, constant connection and multitasking (I am speaking here particularly of the rarefied worlds of Big Law, Wall Street Finance, and Ivy League academia). It's a very career and work focused book, with a surprisingly frequent focus on the bottom line about what traits introverts are more likely to have and how these should be recognized at the top tables in all fields. Her argument, based on one scientific study after another throughout the chapters (deployed like so much artillery), is that introverts tend to think more deeply about problems and persist for longer in trying to solve them. Introverts are supposedly more likely to care about the feelings of others, to make excellent compromising leaders, and to be excellent negotiators (Cain's particular area of expertise) based on their ability to seem soft and actually be tough at the same time. She scorns the merely ""shy"" as extroverts in disguise who share extroverts' traits and want the spotlight but who are just too scared to get it (she would never say this outright, but it is clear that she believes they don't deserve the secret introvert password and is determined to keep out the riffraff). She argues that the extroverts in powerful positions she has seen are more likely to take unjustified risks, to get hopped up on testosterone and the thrill of the chase, to listen to the loudest person in the room, and to walk all over introverts.She readily admits the nuances in these sweeping generalizations. She also admits the worth of extroverts and how introverts greatly enjoy and need their company, both professionally and personally. In addition, she also talks about some legitimate times when introverts may devote time and energy to being extroverted (if they care about something enough- ""Free Trait Theory""). Finally, and in the part that I most appreciated, Cain talks a bit about the ""Situational"" theory of personality- that is, that people's personalities can be completely different in different situations, times and around different people. Therefore, there are very few ""pure"" introverts or ""pure"" extroverts. She also admits that the way that these generalized ""traits"" play out may look very different and may, after all, not be very predictive in any direct way. (Many extroverts may have excellent impulse control, or introverts who care deeply about a cause may act frequently and completely out of character in order to fight for what they believe in.)However, the space devoted to these arguments is much, much smaller than the space devoted to proving, endlessly, how awesome introverts are and why the professional world should value them and stop trying to tell them that they have to be like extroverts because I'm okay and you're okay and it takes all kinds and a village to make the world go round.And honestly? This is a message that's happening to hit me at the right time, when I'm involved in a workplace with a whole lot of extroverts surrounding me. I did find it useful in my particular mindset where I am actively waging a struggle to define my own style in a new profession, since introversion is a part of my identity. I also thought that some of the studies she cited DO make a lot of sense and should be more widely looked at (like the ones that talk about why it's a good idea to ask people to provide feedback and brainstorm online rather than in big meetings or why introverts with closed door offices are more productive or some of the advice to parents about how to cherish their introverted child). I also think that it's nice to have someone sounding the alert that someone speaking quietly is not wrong by default- turn on cable news for thirty seconds and you'll be reminded why that is important.And yet, despite the evident time put into this book, and despite my bias towards it, I couldn't shake the feeling of cynical questioning of what felt like a great deal of pop psychology and arguments made based on feelings, anecdotes and newspaper clippings collected into a narrative. It felt like a file you might keep to make yourself feel better and to express an important part of your identity, rather than a research paper and I'm sure it was aiming at something closer to that crossed with an advice column. There's such a lot of speculation in here, and lots of scientific studies without citations or countervailing evidence brought into play. (For example, it certainly didn't help that the minute after I read one of the more fluffy scientific studies in here about how we Americans as a culture are more drawn to people that display significantly more traditionally dominant body language in pictures I saw it in an issue of Marie Claire in a box near the back of the magazine reconfigured to be about women being attracted to men and how you've gotta look aggressive and Manly to get us ladiezz don't you know?) It just seems like a book written for a specific audience that you can rely on to make that leap to ""just know"" what you mean because they've got an emotional bank of misunderstood years and moments to draw on. In short, it appeals to an ""emotional truth"" built on hundreds of pages of stories and studies that may or may not add up to anything at all. On the one hand, it's maybe okay to create a space for a ""community"" of sorts to feel and process some of that- on the other hand, it will drag down the overall quality of that work into something closer to a melancholy history crossed with a dinner party argument. Therefore, despite its strengths, and despite the personal enjoyment and help that I have taken from the book at this particular time, I can't rate it as more than an above average read. An intellectualized comfort read for introverted professionals, really, if such a specialized category really exists. I can't rate it higher when I feel like one good scholarly journal review would take the whole theory down, especially when it feels like an argument for corporations to pay introverts more a lot of the time. Nonetheless, a lot of interesting questions asked, a lot of self-reflection inspired. Recommended for my fellow introverts if you're at a place where you feel like something like I described above might be helpful to you at this time. Otherwise, I'd say you could skip it or just watch her TED talk instead."
4,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"[Original review, Dec 29 2016]This book, which I had had recommended to me by many friends both on Goodreads and in real life, says plenty of useful and worthwhile things. Using the words not quite in the sense common among academic psychologists, Susan Cain distinguishes between ""extroverts"", whom she characterizes as loud, thick-skinned people who prioritise social interaction, assertiveness and gregariousness, and ""introverts"", quiet, thin-skinned people who prioritise sensitivity, harmony and understanding. She points out that a third to a half of all people are introverts; though many of them have learned how to masquerade successfully as extroverts, since American society encourages extrovert behavior to the point where many introverts feel there is something wrong with them. Why do they prefer to sit and read a book when they could be out making useful business contacts? Cain give reasons to believe that the difference between introversion and extroversion may well be related to underlying brain physiology, and hence beyond the individual's control. But more importantly, she argues that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being introverted. Society needs sensitive, risk-shy introverts just as much as it needs brash, risk-tolerant extroverts. In fact, it may need them more.I find most of the above plausible, though I don't know enough about neurophysiology to be able to say how solid those parts are. What disquiets me most is that the book needed to be written in the first place. It seems to me to say more about modern American society than it does about the differences between introverts and extroverts. As Cain says, many societies - she particularly singles out Asian societies - do not place the same premium on extroverted behavior. If you're an Asian teen, it's regarded as normal to spend your time studying rather than partying. The same is true, though to a lesser extent, of many European societies. Cain's approach is gentle and indirect, but she certainly succeeds in showing how grotesquely skewed the US has become. When a member of an evangelical church says he is only interested in recruiting extroverted people and adds that he's sure Jesus was extroverted, I can't help feeling that something has gone horribly wrong. Even more memorably and presciently (the book was published in 2012), Cain asks at one point how America could have got the idea that the ideal personality type is that of a successful real estate salesman.How indeed?___________________[Update, May 31 2018]A remarkable passage I just read in Gwendolyn Seidman's widely cited paper ""Self-presentation and belonging on Facebook: How personality influences social media use and motivations"" (2012):Extraversion is related to several belongingness-related constructs. Extraverts have more friends, higher quality friendships (Asendorpf & Wilpers, 1998) and more satisfying romantic relationships than introverts (White, Hendrick, & Hendrick, 2004). Thus, it is unsurprising that extraversion is associated with greater Facebook use (Gosling, Augustine, Vazire, Holtzman, & Gaddis, 2011; Wilson, Fornasier, & White, 2010) and more friends (Amichai-Hamburger & Vinitzky, 2010; Moore & McElroy, 2012; Ryan & Xenos, 2011)."
5,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58160628-emily-books-with-emily-fox,4,Very interesting non-fiction about introverts.Definitely could relate with a lot that was said and loved learning more about the advantages of it and how to deal with being an introvert!
6,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,4,"What an affirmation! While listening to this book, I was constantly reminded of Al Franken’s Saturday Night Live character, Stuart Smalley, and his mantra, “I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and doggone it, people like me.” Well, those who understand me do. Full disclosure, according to the Myers-Briggs Personality Test, I’m an ISFJ.There were so many points of affirmation for me—things I intuitively knew. Things I’ve tried to share with others mostly to no avail. This book supplies all the data I need to support my case. Unfortunately, I don’t think the people who need to read/listen this book (extroverts) will.The book is not an “introverts are superior” diatribe but rather an explanation of how we can leverage personality types most effectively. There is no right or best personality type but like life in general, we need to understand each other for more harmonious relationships. Whether these relationships are family, work, or social, applications of understanding are documented throughout the book.There was one example in the book that hit particularly close to home. Although SAT or IQ scores do not support it, people who talk more are perceived as leaders. And, which personality type talks more? Extroverts. Now, assume that both extroverts and introverts have an equal amount of good ideas. Who is going to get their way more? Extroverts. This could be dangerous because they’re going to get their way more meaning that many of their bad ideas are also going to be implemented.Oh, another thing I intuitively knew but now have support for is brainstorming sessions. Studies show the larger the number of people involved in a session, the less effective they are. A 9-member group is less effective than a 6-member group which is less than effective than a 4-member group which is less effective than a 2-member group. The suggestion is to conduct brainstorming sessions electronically. Collect comments and then share them anonymously and build from there. One of the reasons is that most introverts are better writers than speakers.Other examples from the business world give tips for how both introverted and extroverted leaders can best work with their subordinates of each type. Take advantage of each of their strengths. Such as how studies show that introverts “inspect” and extroverts “react”. Neither adjective should be taken as derogatory but instead as strengths. Allow introverts time to examine and solve. Studies show they are more persistent trying to solve unsolvable problems. The famous introvert, Albert Einstein said, “It is not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.” My hero.A final word on the narration—fantastic. If you have the opportunity to listen rather than read this book, I would strongly recommend going with the audio format. Kathe Mazur does a perfect narration in a “Quiet”, calm, soothing voice. Very appropriate “in a noisy world that can’t stop talking”. "
7,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent,3,"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is about being an introvert in today's society.Confession time: I'm a tremendous introvert. I know you're all thinking something along the lines of ""What? A guy who reads constantly and writes over a hundred book reviews a year is an introvert?"" Shocking but true. I could easily go days without human contact. At parties, I'm the guy hanging out near the food or snooping through the host's books or medicine cabinet. I could go into more detail but since I have a feeling most Goodreaders are also introverts, I'll skip it.Basically, the book is a flashing neon sign that says it's okay to be an introvert. Susan Cain chronicles her own struggles as an introvert, as well as showing how America went from being about character to about personality, right around the time movies and TV started getting popular. It covers introverts in all areas, like corporate America, and how introverts are treated in other societies. There's a lengthy section on raising introvert kids, which a lot of parents could use instead of shoving their kids into the shark-infested extrovert waters.Honestly, I could have used this book as a teenager, when people were constantly badgering me to go out more. Scientific discoveries and works of art are rarely made by people who are constantly talking. Cain covers topics like being an introvert in the business world, where people who talk the loudest get their way more often than not, something I see every day in cubeland.Actually, the book gave me insight into the behavior of some of my family. Until he retired, my dad was crabbier than Red Foreman all the time. I used to think he was just an angry asshole but now I think he was an introvert with nowhere to unwind. Now that he's retired, I see how much alike we are. He's actually pretty friendly as long as the visits don't go too long. Susan Cain's writing style is engaging. I felt the repeated examples may have padded the book a bit. While I felt validated by reading it, sometimes it felt like a book a kid named Matthew, who happened to be missing a finger, wrote about how nine-fingered Matthews are the best at everything. I liked it but most of what Cain says seemed pretty obvious. There are no mind-blowing revelations for introverts within. I do recommend extroverts read it, however. 3.5 out of 5 stars."

9,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/886144-brigid,5,"You can also read this review on Flying Kick-a-pow! ReviewsThis is a bit different from what I typically read and review. I don't often read non-fiction, but when my mom got this out of the library and I read the inside flap, I knew I would have to give it a shot. It sounded like something I could relate to and possibly benefit from … and it was. As soon as I started it, I was totally engrossed. And as I made my way through the entire thing, I felt like I was learning more and more about myself.My whole life I've been an introvert. I keep to myself more than the people around me do. I tend to prefer reading/writing to partying. I'm very self-conscious about speaking; when I talk in front of a bunch of unfamiliar people, I stumble over my words and blush and feel like a moron … hence, I usually opt not to speak at all unless someone forces me to and/or speaks to me first.I've grown used to labels like ""shy"" and ""quiet,"" to the rude questions like ""Can you talk?"", ""Do you speak English?"", and ""Have you been in this class the whole year?"" The confrontations and notes from teachers/professors are expected by now. ""You need to speak up more in class,"" ""Don't be shy!"" etc. Just thinking about it right now makes me want to punch a wall. People act as if it's some magical switch I can turn on and off. They think I don't talk much because I'm incompetent, because I'm lazy, because I'm a bitch, because I think I'm better than everyone else. People who know me well can see I'm none of those things (at least, I hope I'm not), but for a lot of people it seems to be a challenge to understand that. It's not that I blame them, because I think it's hard to comprehend what it's like to be an introvert if you haven't experienced it yourself. But still, it's frustrating.What makes being an introvert so hard is that––especially in the US––we are held up to what Susan Cain calls the ""Extrovert Ideal."" That is, we are told our whole lives that the ""ideal"" person is an extrovert––outgoing, confident, well-spoken, etc. Extroverted people are thought of as being more important, more authoritative, and more attractive. If you are a shy, you are more likely to be seen as weak, a pushover, a bad leader, an awkward/unattractive person. We're constantly told that in order to succeed, we need to stand up for ourselves, push others out of the way, be the loudest, take the most risks. If you're a shy/introverted person, you are constantly told that you need to change––that if you continue to be quiet, you're never going to get anywhere in life. You won't get a good job, you won't succeed, no one will want to date you ... you name it. Needless to say, I hate being shy. I'm tired of always being told that I need to speak up more, that I just have to be more confident. It's like, do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I enjoy not being able to say what I want to say, that I feel totally idiotic every time I open my mouth, that I don't even want people to look at me because I'm so self-conscious? Trust me, if I could, I would be more confident. If I could just shut off all the thoughts in my head, I would gladly speak up more often. But I've always felt like my brain just wasn't wired that way. People act as if it's as easy as just speaking up, that the leap from being introverted to being extraverted is as easy as, ""You know what? I'm just not going to be shy today! Yay!""And … yeah. It's not like that at all. It's like, when I'm surrounded by people I don't (or only barely) know, I just go on lockdown. My mind doesn't generate things to say. My mouth refuses to open. I just completely freeze up. And it's not that I don't want to participate in the conversation. I wish talking was easy for me. I do want to contribute. Yet, there's this voice in my head telling me to not say anything, and to just sit back and observe.So, obviously, this is a very frustrating trait to have. It holds me back in a lot of social situations. I have trouble making friends (although I do have friends, so don't worry). I've managed to live for two decades without ever having a boyfriend. My grades have suffered. So on and so forth.I've struggled with this my whole life, I constantly beat myself up about it … I've always wondered what the hell was wrong with me. Why couldn't I just magically gain some confidence? Why couldn't I just suck it up and be a more social person? I've spent my whole life trying to find something to blame, some reason why I've always been like this. Is it because I'm part of a large family, and therefore I've always felt like I should just keep my problems to myself? Is it because I grew up in such an academically competitive town where there was too much pressure to be the star student? Of course, there must be various contributing factors. But according to Cain's book, it may be due more to nature than to nurture than we may think.Cain discusses several studies that relate introversion/extroversion to sensitivity. And apparently, people with more active amygdalae––a part of the brain that plays a significant role in processing memory and emotional reactions––are far more likely to be introverts. People fall roughly into two groups: ""high reactive"" and ""low reactive."" If you are a more high reactive individual, you are more likely to:- React more strongly to stimuli––new sounds, meeting new people, seeing disturbing images, etc.- Be more empathetic towards other people- Be very observational, notice small details- React more emotionally to artwork/music/books/etc.- Be more prone to emotional problems like anxiety/depression- Be very sensitive about what other people think of you, and therefore become timid in social situations where you don't know many peopleThis isn't to say, of course, that more low reactive people don't experience these things, it's just that it tends to happen on a lower scale for them because their amygdalae are not as sensitive. Also, high reactive does not automatically equal introverted and low reactive doesn't automatically equal extroverted, but research suggests a strong correlation between the two traits. But what's most important to realize about levels of reactivity is that they can't be controlled. Cain discusses one study in which infants were tested for how reactive they were to stimuli––and a majority of high-reactive infants grew up to be introverts, while the low-reactive infants tended to grow up to be extroverts. It's studies such as these that suggest we don't choose introversion or extroversion; they are built into our DNA. One can easily fake one or the other. That is, you can be an introvert and still speak a lot and socialize frequently––it's just that, as an introvert, you will be more drained by social interaction. Because introverts are often more high-reactive individuals and therefore react more strongly to stimuli, a room of new faces is much more exhausting to process than it would be for someone who is more low-reactive. I could go on and on about this, but of course––if you want to learn more, I highly suggest reading this book. There's a lot of fascinating information about the subject.Quiet seriously changed the way I think about myself. I still dislike being shy and introverted for many reasons. But after reading this, I also know that I might not have the same creative and observant traits that I have now, if I were extroverted instead. And more importantly, I know that it isn't my fault for being this way––and that millions of people face the same struggle that I do. I don't know if I can say that I really accept who I am, at least not yet. But at least I feel like I understand it a lot better.Over all, I think this book is well-written and well-researched, and Cain narrates it with heart and humor––drawing from her own experience as an introvert alongside her studies of the subject. I thought Quiet was brilliant, and I recommend it to introverts and extroverts alike. ~ Flying Kick-a-pow! Reviews ~"
10,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia,5,"As you can see, i've been mixing up my reading lately, THIS ISN'T ROMANCE YAY!Quiet is a fascinating book about the prejudice that our society faces against introverts, and why it's unfounded, and how, as an introvert, you can overcome that, as well as just KNOW yourself better. I never really classified myself as such before, but reading this, I understand why, if I'm exhausted, all I want to be is alone, and how I'm extroverted only when I can control my environment and how that's a THING! If you're shy or are unsure, this is a great read. I think you'll discover something about yourself, that's why I've recommended to a lot of people lately! "
11,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5119730-yvonne,5,"Thank you, Susan Cain, for writing this remarkable book! As an introvert who has always been regarded as not only quiet, but also timid and weak, this book is very refreshing. It puts into words what many introverts know intuitively; strength does not have to be loud, in your face, or aggressive. Strength and conviction can present themselves quietly without sacrificing effectiveness. Through impressive research, Ms. Cain clearly demonstrates the importance of both personality types and the value of introversion. I only wish that I could have read this book when I was younger so that I would have been more confident and accepting of my own nature. After reading it now, I do feel that I can better articulate the importance of my role in society and take pride in the contributions that introverts have made throughout history."
12,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10171516-jessica,4,"ive seen this book pop up on my feed quite a bit recently and, even though i read it years ago, i cant believe i never posted a review for it! better late than never. lol. a quick google search will show that anywhere between 25-40% of the worlds population are introverts and i feel so proud to be considered part of such an outstanding group. this book didnt necessarily teach me anything i didnt already know about myself, but it was very neat to see how i can turn my introvertedness into a strength, especially when so many consider a more reserved nature to be a sign of weakness. and because i could relate to literally everything in this book, i have constantly returned to it from time to time over the years, revisiting marked pages, highlights, and notes i made when i first read it.i found this is to be a very informative, eye-opening and thoroughly researched book. its a definite must read for all of my fellow introverts!!↠ 4 stars"

I am an introvert and PROUD!
I am sure this is not totally surprising considering my huge love of books and writing. I am also sure many users (if not most of us) are introverts here on Goodreads. And Susan Cain is one of us and she celebrates it. This is a book about our strengths, and our weaknesses; it is a book about realising that although we do not fit the ideal model for success, we can still be dramatically successful given the right circumstances and a chance to shine. We are the creative thinkers and the critics. We are the over analysers. We are those that prefer to retire to the inner-workings of our own world when we’ve had enough of people and society. We are those that would rather think than talk. And that is our greatest weapon. 
“There's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.”
I am going to talk a little bit about me and my own experience. I have done jobs that are characteristically more suited to extroverts. For many years I worked as a theatre front of house manager, overseeing large teams in an extremely busy entertainment venue. I also worked as a running-shoe salesman in a top-end sports shop offering great customer service and advice. What made me effective in such roles was my ability to keep a level head and analyse the situations I was in and then make the best response after thinking things through. I lead from the back. My approach to management was always subtle, but it worked. My point is, and Susan Cain’s point is, we can do all the same things extroverts can do. We will just do them a little bit differently. She does not say that introverts are better people. She does not say that the extrovert ideal is necessarily wrong. What she advocates for is another side of the story, another ideal and another type of person who can use what they have to their own advantage once they understand their worth. 
“Don't think of introversion as something that needs to be cured.”
And this is so important to understand. We need to embrace our introvert nature because it makes us unique and more in control of our thoughts and emotions. I truly wish I understood this simple fact at a younger age because I spent many years miserable as a teen because my personality did not compute with what was considered ideal. So, this is an excellent book and I feel that it will be of immense use to many people, not just introverts. In order to succeed as a species, we need to recognise – and celebrate – the simple fact that we are all uniquely different. 
Some of the most brilliant of people have been introverts

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestQuestion: How do you know if someone is an introvert?Answer: They're going to fucking tell you.Right now, it's very popular to be an introvert. There are various introvert webcomics, TED talks about why introversion is so great, and numerous people who will tell you that they are an introvert and subject you to discussion and analysis of what this means with the same enthusiasm of someone who reads horoscopes. People confess to introversion with the same kind of humble bragginess as self-obsessed artists who roll their eyes when you compliment their art and say it was ""just a sketch.""It's true that being quiet or shy (note: these are not the same thing) used to be considered a bad thing. I grew up at the height of ""party culture,"" when all things club or frat were popular. Jersey Shore was on TV, skirts were short, hair was frosted, and everything was superficial and light. If you couldn't fizz and glitter like a sparkler in everyday conversation, you were weird and everyone hated you. I was weird, and people were not fans of me. I wore all black, read Anne Rice, and listened to Evanescence and The Cure while pondering why all of my classmates were idiots. My scorn probably didn't help, but there was absolutely no way at the time I could have fit it, or been happy doing so.Skimming through the reviews, I noticed I was one of the few self-professed introverts who despised this book. I thought that was interesting, but it's not completely unforeseen. I actually self-describe as a ""social introvert"" or ""false extrovert."" People who meet me for the first time think I'm very extroverted. I can be very loud and chatty, and organize a lot of social events in my office or with friends. But I'm also very uncomfortable in certain social situations and as much as I enjoy being out, I'm sometimes secretly delighted when plans are canceled and enjoy spending time by myself.It's been a while since my psychology days, but there is a chemical basis for introversion and extroversion. One of these lies in the sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous systems. People who are introverted have a lower threshold for being overstimulated, and when they reach that threshold, feel drained and must rest. People who are extroverted, on the other hand, have a lower threshold and need to seek out stimulation in order to get the bar up. If they don't get stimulation, they feel sluggish and depressed. I thought the neurotransmitter in question was dopamine, but a quick Google makes it look like the neurotransmitter in question is actually acetylcholine. #TILI have taken issue with a lot of these pop psychology books. I wasn't a fan of THE SBUTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A F*CK, which seemed like the self-help version of snake oil, and recently also read SNAKES IN SUITS, which was like a Lifetime movie wearing science like it was a pretty dress. This one had a bit more science, but Susan Cain definitely spent way too much time cherry picking her arguments and the end result was me having a bad taste in my mouth and wanting to roll my eyes.I guess I have a few take-away points here. 1. Introverts and extroverts serve different functions in society. Neither is an intrinsically good or bad trait, and they are not binary. Like many human characteristics, these exist on a spectrum.2. We live in a social society, and acting antisocial to coddle your introversion makes you look, well, antisocial (confrontational, against society) instead of asocial, which is just wanting to be left alone.3. It's probably true that a lot of introverts were responsible for inventions because they spent a lot of time alone, but this is not the only type of genius or the only form genius takes. As I said in point #1, humans exist on a spectrum, and there are many different shapes of brilliant minds out there.4. People enjoy belonging to groups. That's why horoscopes are so popular, and why people post their Meyers-Briggs results on their dating websites. We live in an in-group vs. outgroup society - yes, you too, introverts, jeez - and enjoy feeling as though we belong. Introverts like calling themselves introverts because it makes them feel a bond with other introverts (seriously, just read the comments sections of any of the positive reviews for this book), which promotes bursts of probably dopamine.5. The author seems to be claiming that extroverts have the natural advantage and are mean to introverts but then spends a big part of the book shitting all over them. Hypocrite. At the end of the day, you should take books like these with a grain of salt. They're definitely more self-help geared than scientific, in my opinion,and a lot of the arguments and conclusions feel cherry-picked. Introverts may enjoy reading it while vigorously patting themselves on the back, but we as a society are moving in a direction where this is starting to feel kind of redundant and narcissistic.1 star"
15,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,5,"This book blew my mind. I loved it so much that I wish I could give a copy to all of my friends and relatives.Susan Cain does an excellent job of explaining the different strengths between introverts and extroverts, and the history of how America came to idealize extroverts. I agree that as a society we tend to value the gregarious go-getters, the loud talkers, the forceful presenters. But Cain's book reminds us that societies need introverts, too — the thinkers, the listeners, the people who look before leaping. The long, long, long list of introverts in history includes: Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, George Orwell, Marcel Proust, J. K. Rowling, Lewis Carroll, W. B. Yeats, Warren Buffet, Steve Wozniak, Charles Schultz, Al Gore, Rosa Parks, Gandhi...As an introvert, I found the book comforting and inspiring. But extroverts who are in relationships with introverts or who are parents of an introvert would also do well to read this book. The author has good tips for how to handle introverts, especially children.""Love is essential. Gregariousness is optional ... Use your natural powers -- of persistence, concentration, insight and sensitivity -- to do work you love and work that matters. Solve problems, make art, think deeply. Figure out what you are meant to contribute to the world and make sure you contribute it.""Update April 2015I read this book about two years ago, and I think it has been the most influential book I've read in years. Cain's book profoundly changed how I viewed myself, others, and our various roles in society. I have recommended this book to numerous friends, and some of them commented on how grateful they were to have read it. I will add managers and supervisors to the list of people who I think should read this book, because it helps to explain some workplace and group dynamics. While the writing isn't perfect (I remember Cain meanders a bit), I'm leaving my rating at 5 stars because of how powerful and inspirational this book has been."
16,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine,5,"Once upon a time there was a woman who dreaded the staff meeting roundtable, when each person had to share what was good or bad or on their professional plate that week or in their personal life. All five, nine, fifteen pairs of eyes would be upon her as she forced her voice to carry down the table, knocking off as few words as she could to express, “Everything’s great!” before turning her flushed face to the colleague beside her. This same woman could take the stage before an audience in the hundreds at a conference and deliver a speech with poise, loving every moment she was in the spotlight. She’d spin around her shopping cart to avoid meeting an acquaintance in the produce department at the grocery store, then host a wine dinner that night for twenty strangers, her joy bubbling as much as the Champagne she poured, explaining to the assembled crowd the difference between méthode traditionelle and transfer method of production. She could spend hours waiting tables at a busy restaurant, engaging in happy grace and good humor with dozens of customers, but the thought of a Friday night party at a friend’s, hanging out in a kitchen drinking beer with a few people from work? She’d feign a sudden flu or a last-minute family obligation to avoid hours of mindless chatter.That I am an introvert is not news to me. I can’t recall when I first took the Myers-Briggs personality type test, but I should have INFJ tattooed on my forehead, for the results never waver. And at some point, I got the message that being an introvert doesn't mean I'm shy, for I am not; it doesn't mean I'm not a risk-taker, for I am, or that I don’t form deep personal attachments, for I have many. What it does mean, among many things, is that socializing wears me out. I abhor chitchat, loud people, group projects and “going out.” It means I love to lose myself in solitary endeavors. It means I love process, not reward. It means I’d rather just sit and listen. And when I have something to say, please be patient. I’m not a fast talker, I pause a lot, searching for just the right word. And even then you’ll probably have to strain to hear me. Unless I’ve thoroughly rehearsed my responses, I’ll never deliver my thoughts with articulate confidence. There are parts of Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking that made me laugh, even as tears stung my eyes. Knowing that I prefer to be alone—that I have little tolerance for casual social situations—never released me from feeling that I needed to overcome my social awkwardness and impatience, my thin skin and tendency to fret about the future and things beyond my control. I thought these were faults, not characteristics of a personality type shared by millions, most of us existing in contemplative, considerate silence. Through research, anecdotal interviews and personal experiences, Cain explores the ways introverted personalities manifest themselves in the workplace and personal relationships. The section on “highly-sensitive” people struck home. 
The highly sensitive tend to be philosophical or spiritual in their orientation, rather than materialistic or hedonistic. They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions—sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy, and fear. They are highly empathetic…with thinner boundaries separating them from other people’s emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world
 Yes, please. Reading this, I realized one of the reasons I tend to shut myself off and away is because I am overwhelmed by my own helplessness to change the world. I take things so personally and feel them so deeply that I become frozen in place, not knowing how to translate feeling into action. When Cain discusses her professional epiphany, I had another laugh/cry moment. Hers was realizing that she was never cut out to be a corporate lawyer; mine, a university and corporate administrator. There are many aspects of our professions in which we excelled, rising quickly through the ranks. But neither of us is cut out for committee work, for schmoozing and glad-handing, for blowing our own horn—all required in legal circles, ivory towers and boardrooms. I loved the one-on-one time I spent counseling students, building relationships with individual faculty, developing administrative processes and procedures, doing research and yes, presenting at conferences and leading workshops, for which I rehearsed and prepared weeks in advance. But I knew I’d never rise to the ranks of the one in charge; I simply wasn’t built for the social demands and networking required of a Director. So, for fifteen years I left job after job just at the pinnacle of power and success—always the Bridesmaid, never the Bride. I never really knew why, except that something was inherently wrong with me. At last, I accept nothing is wrong with me; denying myself the opportunity to advance was recognition that moving up meant moving into roles for which I was constitutionally not suited. Now I am a writer. And a happy little clam. I work to create niches of social balance to avoid complete isolation—I belong to a book club, a writer’s group, I volunteer, meet friends for coffee. Social media is a great release for me, because I only talk when I want to, I have all the time in the world to construct my thoughts (which I can edit later!) and no one is looking at me as I speak. Quiet has given me permission not to regard my limited in-person social circle as evidence of a failure of personality, but as respect given to my true nature: “Love is essential: gregariousness is optional.” In some ways, working through the theories and examples in this book is exhausting and dispiriting—if I’d had a better understanding of how I function best, would I have made different choices? Yet, the most important choices I’ve made—excelling at and loving parts of my profession that I’m built for and not being swayed by extrinsic rewards to pursue paths for which I am not; the dogged determination that puts me in front of a keyboard every day with few indications that I will be able to make a living doing what I love—I’ve stuck to my temperament. My life’s path hasn’t been without its stumbles, but even without knowing quite what makes me tick, I've been true to my nature. This is Cain’s consistent and loudest message, delivered with the gentle power of an introvert. A Manifesto for Introverts (from Quiet)1.	There’s a word for “people who are in their heads too much”: Thinkers.2.	Solitude is a catalyst for innovation.3.	The next generation of quiet kids can and must be raised to know their own strengths.4.	Sometimes it helps to be a pretend extrovert. There will always be time to be quiet later.5.	But in the long run, staying true to your temperament is key to finding work you love and work that matters.6.	One genuine new relationship is worth a fistful of business cards.7.	It’s OK to cross the street to avoid making small talk.8.	“Quiet leadership” is not an oxymoron.9.	Love is essential; gregariousness is optional.10.	“In a gentle way, you can shake the world.” – Mahatma Ghandi"
17,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,4,"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain is a 2012 Crown publication. I’ve seen Susan Cain’s ‘Ted Talks’, video and knew I would have to read her book, it was just a matter of fitting it into my schedule. As an extreme introvert, this book definitely feels like a form of validation. See? There is nothing wrong with me. There are other people out there just like me, who avoid social situations at all cost, would rather take a good beating than speak publicly, who feel drained after social occasions, and who must have alone time. There are people who, like myself, tried to fake an extrovert personality, but were miserable because it. In a world that is increasingly group oriented, that recognizes the loud, outspoken, forceful personality over the quiet, soft spoken, unassuming temperament, this book is a Godsend. But, while the book explains the tendencies of the introvert and offers some theories on how people develop this type of temperament, and how to cope and compromise in order to fulfill your job duties and family obligations without suffering an overabundance of anxiety or develop depression or a dependence on medication, this book is also a must read for extroverts!Yes, that’s right… extroverts should read this book too, so they can understand that colleague, sibling, or spouse, or child who is quiet, craves alone time, avoids social situations, and would rather not waste time on small talk.  How can employers create a workplace setting that brings out the best of both temperaments? Many people work better and are far more productive when working alone, and have much to contribute, but are often drowned out by the constant cacophony surrounding them. While I agree with nearly everything the author writes, most of the scientific studies and analogies were only moderately interesting and highly debatable. I don’t know if I agreed with all those findings, and this particular section of the books was just a little bit dull. Not everything mentioned here will pertain to every single person who identifies as an introvert. Taking the informal quiz, I answered nearly every question with ‘Yes’, but there were several traits that I do not own, so this is not a ‘one size fits all’ course, and doesn’t try to be, but I think the author covered a tremendous amount of relevant material any introvert can use and relate to. I would not consider this book a ‘self-help’ book, but the author included a few tips and exercises one can use to ease social anxiety and learn to work in groups and speak publicly. There is also a section for parents who may worry about an introverted child, and how to encourage that child, not change them. Overall, I am so happy to see the problems introverts face in an extroverted world, addressed and brought to the forefront. 4 stars"
18,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"Most of this, to be honest, is self-explanatory, but the rest is a fairly comprehensive exploration of how extroversion became a public ideal back in the 1920's, replacing the power of character with personality and the social stigma that has ever since been placed upon people who don't seem vibrant and ebullient. It shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone that 1/3 to 1/2 of all people are introverts, but because we live in a society that places a premium on everything non-introverted, most of us have to fake it to make it, and with that comes exhaustion and misunderstanding, whether with our bosses, our intimates, or with ourselves and our own natures.This book tells us to relax. Be ourselves. Value what you value and understand that some people aren't naturally conflict avoidant, that they like to express anger, surround themselves with a bunch of shallow social jostlers, and that we oughtn't judge our extroverted peers when they jump into decision-making strategies that sink ships and endanger the lives of everyone around them just because they couldn't be bothered to think things through before opening their damn mouths.And please don't judge all the sheep that are impressed by the aggressive blowhards and follow on their every word because they're just so damn charismatic, either.It's okay to think and spend some time alone from others. Really. It might just be the salvation of the world if enough of us just throw off the yoke of social expectations or the stigma of shyness and just get prepared, build up all our talents and reserves in peace, and strike when the time is perfect. We're not unobservant, after all. We just have little patience for bullshit.And even if society has taught us to lie our asses off whenever we're expected to be gregarious and social in all those damn shallow ways that others tell us are the only way to make it in this world, don't despair. The High Social Monitoring we do is a coping mechanism that we've had to develop PRECISELY because we're considered social pariahs. Oh, and GoodReads is a hotbed for a grass-roots introvert revolution. I don't think anyone here will have any real difficulty cultivating contacts and building their networking, because, after all, we're all discussing things that are very important to us and we're diving deep into the material, wallowing in our talents and our passions, and when we rise, And Oh! We will Rise!We will rise like the phoenix from the ashes of social scorn and we will scour the world of all those who would ever deny us our right to sit in silence to read our favorite book or sit in silence to write a chapter in our next brilliant novel.We Will Overcome!(Aside: Some interpretations of this book are mine only and should not be associated with the author.)"

I've always 'kept' this one for myself ( yet I've bought extra copies a few times and have given it as a gift). I feel everyone benefits from this book..'everyone' ... and the process of reading it is a fabulous journey too! Rating: 4.9. Why not a solid 5 star rating? At 'times' I felt the author (an introvert herself), painted a slanted side of the extrovert. [these were just 'small' between-the-line-gut-feelings I felt 'sensitive to']....However:This book is 'excellent'. Its interesting as can be -informative-important- and enjoyable. ...A fast read even 'with' sitting at a table taking notes. (I took 8 long pages of notes)-- it was pure 'joy'....(engaging with this topic). Much to think about, to remember, to discuss. Our book club will talk about this book together Oct. 20th (can't wait). All teachers and parents would benefit from reading this book. *Everyone* would benefit reading this book!I'd suggest this book to EVERYONE!!!"
20,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,5,"Quiet entered my life at a particularly low moment. Allow me to set the scene: I had been on vacation for a week and a half. We were in Colorado, visiting my husband's family, some of whom I had met before, others whom I had not. I knew I wasn't going to be entirely comfortable being around people the whole trip- I'm a huge introvert and I'm self aware enough to know that I need downtime, and quite a bit of it, to feel as if I'm functioning normally. But I didn't realize that my husband, who is just as introverted as I am and who I was counting on to help me through all of the introductions, dinners, conversations, etc, was going to immerse himself in Pokemon Go a majority of the time and essentially leave me to my own devices. As Susan Cain would say, he found a ""restorative niche"" for himself in a digital world. It was hard on me as I didn't have that escape.So, here we are, visiting a friend's home and my daughter, who strangely enough is a huge extrovert (the exact opposite of her parents), is struggling. She's tired, out-of-sorts, and throwing a sulk every ten minutes. I'm meeting yet more people, trying to hold trite conversations, and steer my child, all the while just wanting to retreat into a cave and not talk to anyone for a very long time. Honestly, I felt that way before we reached the party, but things seemed to get much, much worse the moment we arrived. It had been building over the course of the vacation, but that day, my internal clamor reached a boiling point. My husband was oblivious to my growing discomfort as he's catching Pokemon, again. (I don't mean to sound bitter here, but I suppose that I am.) I had forced myself for ten days to be social, keep the smile on my face, keep everything flowing smoothly. To my horror, I realize that I am about to have a panic attack in the middle of this crowd of people, more than half of whom I don't even know. I grab my keys and leave.I drive a couple blocks away, castigating myself for not being able to handle it and just pissed because, once again, like many times in my childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, I feel like I'm failing at life because I'm not a social butterfly. I can't stand to be around strangers for extended periods of time. I've always been this way- overly sensitive to others, noise, motion, events. I really dislike groups, parties, places where I have to circulate with a bunch of people who don't know me or care about anything that I have to say. The tears fell down my cheeks as I opened up my tablet and began reading this book. And I discovered that about half of all people are just like me. Thank you, Susan Cain. Your book gave me the courage to drive back to my friend's house and face the rest of the evening. I am not a pariah. I am an introvert and perhaps I can do a better job figuring out when I've reached my socializing limits before I meltdown.Many of the positive attributes of introverts which Susan describes, I totally have, I've just never considered them as worth the trade-off of the extroverted personality. I notice small details, have a great memory for conversations and events, long past the time when others forget such things. I think carefully about problems and people, devoting time to taking apart small nuances of books and movies, that other people don't even consider, which makes me a good reviewer of media- perfect for my job as a librarian. Susan nailed my general feeling about myself in the introduction: ""Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man's world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are. Extroversion is an enormously appealing personality style, but we've turned it into an oppressive standard to which most of us feel we must conform."" pg 34 ebook. Yes!My role at the reference desk calls for an extroverted personality but I muddle through it, because I care about the job and helping others. Usually, I come home from work, totally worn out and in need of quiet time to unwind. Susan helped me understand that sometimes ""faking it"" is worth it, if it for a cause that means something to you and that others do the exact same thing that I do. Pull out the mask for the job, but then allow yourself the freedom to be who you really are at home: ""According to Free Trait Theory, we are born and culturally endowed with certain personality traits- introversion, for example- but we can and do act out of character in the service of ""core personal projects."" In other words, introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for the sake of work they consider important, people they love, or anything they value highly."" pg 391 ebook.My favorite parts of the book were about sensitivity and social situations. Take this passage: ""...maybe we didn't choose ... social accessories at random. Maybe we've adopted dark glasses, relaxed body language, and alcohol as signifiers precisely because they camouflage signs of a nervous system on overdrive. Sunglasses prevent others from seeing our eyes dilate with surprise or fear; we know from Kagan's work that a relaxed torso is a hallmark of low reactivity; and alcohol removes our inhibitions and lowers our arousal levels. When you go to a football game and someone offers you a beer, says the personality psychologist Brian Little, ""they're really saying hi, have a glass of extroversion."" pg 277 ebook. I may use that in my life. ""Please hand me that glass of extroversion.""I also really enjoyed learning the differences in thinking: ""Introverts and extroverts also direct their attention differently: if you leave them to their own devices, the introverts tend to sit around wondering about things, imagining things, recalling events from their past, and making plans for the future. The extroverts are more likely to focus on what's happening around them. It's as if extroverts are seeing ""what is"" while their introverted peers are asking ""what if.""  pg 323 ebook. Yeah, I do that too.I can't recommend this book highly enough. It saved an evening for me, but more importantly, it changed the way that I view myself. There is power in knowing that you're not alone. Again, thank you, Susan Cain. Some read-alikes: The Introvert's Way: Living a Quiet Life in a Noisy World by Sophia Dembling (for introversion) or Furiously Happy: A Funny Book About Horrible Things by Jenny Lawson (for more instances of social anxiety)."

And so, as a long-time (although fairly gregarious) introvert, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Not much of it was truly surprising, but still, it's nice to read a book that validates the way I tend to operate anyway.

22,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,2,"Shhh, I'm taking some quiet time.Kidding! I'll be honest. I avoided this book the first time it appeared, when the buzz had it popping up all over. But my introversion has been more than a bit disrespected lately and I was feeling a need for some affirmation. Alas, I'm not sure I found much helpful here.Part One is 'The Extrovert Ideal,' and looks at how the change from the 18th century ideal of personality to 20th century cult of personality emphasized extroversion as a valuable workplace trait. I liked the concept of the two, as the cultural evolution from one to the other makes a great deal of sense, but I'm not sure how accurate that may be. I feel like Americans--and perhaps everyone--has always been responsive to extroverted, charismatic people. Actually, that highlights an error in Cain's thinking, that she frequently conflates traits. To give her credit, she admits from the beginning that there is no uniform definition of 'introversion.' At page 11, she finally defines her terms, but she unfortunately tends to define them in terms of examples:""Still, today's psychologist tend to agree on several important points: for example, that introverts and extroverts differ in the level of outside stimulation that they need to function well. Introverts feel 'just right' with less stimulation, as when they sip wine with a close friend, solve a crossword puzzle, or read a book. Extroverts enjoy the extra bang that comes from activities like meeting new people, skiing slippery slopes, and cranking up the stereo.... Many psychologists would also agree that introverts and extroverts work differently. Extroverts tend to tackle assignments quickly. They make fast (sometimes rash) decisions, and are comfortable multitasking and risk-taking... Introverts often work more slowly and deliberately. They like to focus on one task at a time and can have mighty powers of concentration. They're relatively immune to the lures of wealth and fame.""It's some slippery stuff, because she ends up conflating a number of characteristics, and that's where it can get really fuzzy. This lack of specificity also means relying on anecdotes of how introversion is a helpful trait. Later in the book, she does bring in studies about 'reactivity,' a genetic-based trait that she prefers to call, 'sensitivity.' I've seen the term before, in The Highly Sensitive Person: How to Thrive When the World Overwhelms You, and a lot of it comes from research on reactiveness/responsiveness to stimulation and how that is then interpreted. To be sure, it's interesting stuff, but it doesn't necessarily apply to all introverts, as she points out, ""about 70% of sensitive people are [introverts]"" (page 145). After backtracking to explain the evolutionary basis for selection of sensitivity, she then attempts to tie sensitivity and conscientiousness together. It's a thin, tenuous line to get from introverted to evolutionary sensitivity to conscientiousness and then imply that that's the kind of person you want in your company. As singular issues, each of these is well-presented. She usually cites one researcher and gives an example of a famous person who changed the world with this trait (Eleanor Roosevelt represented the introverted, sensitive and conscientious person). But it feels like both sloppy logic and false aggrandizement. As an introvert, I no more want to be 'special' for these qualities that presumably go with my genetic and personality tendencies than I want to be disrespected.For no particularly good reason, except the fact that it described me better than I've ever been described before, I'm actually a fan of the Jungian-based personality assessment. I think I particularly responded to the Jungian analysis because rather than the two-axis basis, there's other traits that also affect how we interact with the world. I actually think there's quite a continuum between introversion and extroversion, and that these tendencies can be modified by learning, as Cain rightly points out in Section Two.So, about Quiet. I don't think it really added anything to my understanding on introversion and extroversion. In fact, I think it fell into a more extroverted (as she would say) analysis of having to prove the worth of the trait and using famous figures to support her examples only added to that perception. Quiet didn't give me the acknowledgement I was looking for, really, just a lot of cheerleading that I'm (still) a good person for being an introvert. Hopefully, for those new to discovering their introversion, this might encourage them to both understand and respect their approach. Just don't look for many tips. Read this book if:1) You suspect/know you are an introvert but feel badly about it2) You are an extrovert who doesn't get why introverts don't just get out more.For a more rigorous analysis, check out Kelly's review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
23,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi,4,"This book spoke directly to my soul, to the core of my being.If you’re on this site and reading this, you probably enjoy time alone to read, think and recharge your batteries. It’s not that you’re anti-social, you just prefer having meaningful conversations with one or two people rather than being stuck in a room with a loud group talking about... nothing. Susan Cain’s book will validate you and make you feel you’re not a freak. You don’t need “to come out of your shell.” In fact, there are more of us out there than you’d think. “Introverts” – even the word has negative connotations – make up somewhere between ⅓ and ½ of the population. Cain, who trained as a lawyer but discovered the corporate world wasn’t for her, provides a fascinating look at how current society champions the extrovert ideal. People who speak quickly and loudly (even if they’re not saying much) get praised and promoted. Team-work is encouraged, and there’s no “I” in team, now is there? But introverts, those quiet people who are trying to focus while people are blabbing all around them, have a lot to contribute. Yet they're often ignored.Early sections of the book are devoted to closely examining this extrovert ideal, in a hellishly hilarious Tony Robbins motivation seminar; in the running of a super church; and in studying how Dale Carnegie altered the social landscape with his gung-ho bible How To Win Friends And Influence People.Cain looks at the science of temperament, showing how differences are evident from childbirth – an extended bit about “high and low reactive people” is fascinating. She also shows that introverts might actually be physiologically more “thin-skinned” than extroverts, and how introversion and conscience are connected.Understanding personality types isn’t just theoretical. It has practical applications. Cain suggests how the extroverts in the business world may have caused the 2008 Wall Street crash. And her look at other cultures – Asia, for instance – demonstrates that the extrovert ideal isn’t a universal phenomenon. I found the sections on how introverts learn how to become “fake” extroverts absolutely mind-blowing. There are stories of wildly successful professors and even sales people you’d never classify as introverts but are. I understand this. I think any introvert living in this society has learned, by necessity, how to be more gregarious – through confident voice, posture, attitude – even though it’s not necessarily in his or her nature. I’ve delivered public talks, sat (and talked) on many panels, go to gala openings and for several years had to chat weekly on national TV, always extremely well-prepared (de rigueur for introverts)... but I never really felt or feel completely at ease in these environments. I have to decompress afterwards with close friends. Or go home and read a book.One of the most valuable lessons Cain teaches us is to follow our instincts, especially concerning work and love. To go against our natures could be fatal.Cain also offers up inspiring examples of introverts throughout history: from Rosa Parks and Eleanor Roosevelt to Steve Wozniak and Mahatma Gandhi. Each one is instructive and remarkable. The book gets bogged down near the end by illustrations of how introverts and extroverts can get along. And at times there’s a bit of over-compensating rah-rahing for the underdog. But it’s not introvert = good, extrovert = bad, and after all, most of us aren’t exclusively in one camp or the other. (Plus: is an extrovert really going to read something called Quiet?) This is a remarkable book, and essential reading for teachers, employers and parents. And for all of you thoughtful friends and readers on Goodreads. "
24,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9889835-matthias,3,"Part I: Prelude to the reviewPart II: The review________________________________Part IPrelude: An introvert walks into a bookstoreI read a review on this book today and decided I had to buy it right away. I consider myself somewhat of an introvert, even though not everyone around me agrees on that, because you know, I talk to people and can be pleasant at the same time. Convincing people there's more to the introvert-extrovert distinction than that hasn't always proven easy.I was hoping this book would prove my point, at the very least for me.I went to the Waterstones branch in Brussels, which is a ten minute walk from where I work. I had to be back in thirty minutes, giving me ten minutes at the store itself to look for the book. Yes, when I said ""right away"" earlier, I meant right away. Not half a day could wait.I go in the store and proceed up to the first floor to check out the non-fiction segments. I do not find the book. I put my head and neck in every possible angle, scanning the shelves from every possible perspective, to no avail. Surely, I must be looking in the wrong shelf. Maybe it's downstairs, because they have a table of bestselling non-fiction there as well, so maybe it's there. Yes! I make my way back down and I look and I find nothing. I've been in the store for at least 7 minutes now, so running out of options, I approach two people working for the store, rudely interrupting their conversation which I was trying to avoid intruding upon earlier.They inform me that the book should be there on the shelf, the one I had checked earlier. I pretend I didn't check it earlier and thank them for their kind and helpful information. I go back to the shelf with renewed confidence I would find it this time. Angles. Perspectives. Cold sweat. Alas. I return to the employees, sadly noting that my interruption seemingly meant the end to their conversation, and inquired again. The lady says it's a completely white cover (as opposed to the cover I was subconsciously looking for because of the example I had seen on Goodreads) and mentally kick myself when she escorts me to the shelf to point it out. But, to her consternation and to my relief, it isn't there. Did I check downstairs? I cautiously respond in the affirmative. She will check the computer, she's certain there are copies available. And... Computer says Yes! Victory! It's in the store, but probably still in the storage room. She asks me to wait while she goes to fetch it. I'm already running out of time (I had ran out of time four minutes prior, to be exact), but quietly thank her for her enthusiasm in helping me. She returns five minutes later, visibly having gone through physical efforts to help me out. The copy she hands me is damaged, dirty and it has a sticker on it which I know won't be removed without further damage. In short: the kind of book I avoid buying in all circumstances. I smile, I thank her, and buy the book. Now I'm here, late at work, and with a brand-new dirty damaged book beside me.Yes, this book is proving I'm introverted alright. Yay me. Or maybe I'm confusing lack of being assertive with introversion. Whatever the case, this book will teach. It has already begun doing so, in any case. ________________________________Part IIReview of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking We're amazing and we know it and we don't clap our hands.Before I started reading this book, I was hoping it would do two things: 1. tell me what I wanted to hear 2. tell me what I needed to hear.It gets three stars because it told me what I wanted to hear. This book is the voice of those who are disinclined to use theirs: the introverts. It puts the introverts under a shower of compliments, in the kind of spotlight we're comfortable in: a generous ode that we can absorb from the comfort of our own cozy corner in our own cozy homes, telling us we have a value in this society.This may seem like a ridiculous reason to give stars to a book, but I think it's a good thing that someone gave attention to a group of people who are not used to, and not always comfortable with, getting so much positive feedback. I can imagine it being a helpful outstretched hand to those introverts who have felt misunderstood, out of place or underappreciated. A hand which shows that what they have been struggling with wasn't just inside their mind. It's a fact that society, being largely built on communication and intense interaction, can seem unfit for those who prefer the thinking-mode and absence of interaction most of the time. So on a personal level, this book definitely can have its value. I say ""can"" and am basing my rating on this potential, though for me personally it wasn't such an eye-opener. I think on some level I've always been very secure about my introversion, despite some practical problems as described in the prelude. In a way I find it funny to think about myself operating like that. I surprise myself in these moments, because before those moments I have this sensible and ideal scenario playing out in my mind and after those moments I'm this rational guy being perfectly capable of seeing how ridiculous I was. But that doesn't prevent me from being ridiculous in the moment.Another reason why this book didn't always work for me on the personal level is because it went too far with the compliments. Consider the following excerpt:""If you're an introvert, find your flow by using your gifts. You have the power of persistence, the tenacity to solve complex problems, and the clear-sightedness to avoid pitfalls that trip others up. You enjoy relative freedom from the temptations of superficial prizes like money and status. Indeed, your biggest challenge may be to fully harness your strenghts. You may be so busy trying to appear like a zestful, reward-sensitive extrovert that you undervalue your own talents, or feel underestimated by those around you. But when you're focused on a project that you care about, you'll probably find that your energy is boundless.So stay true to your own nature.""At that point I had a little introverted vomit.It's not an all-together bad book, but segments like these really bring it down for me. Segments like the above read like a cheap horoscope-zodiac segment at the end of some teenage magazine. There's only so much of the ""what I want to hear"" that I can take before I start wondering if there's any truth to it.On a societal level, I don't think this book is as important as it has been made out to be. Introverts indeed consist of a big part of society and thus have helped form it. I'm of the belief that society can't progress by itself. Nothing can be ""expected"" from society. Society shouldn't cater to any particular group, it's the particular groups that have to find or fight for their place and evolve themselves, in turn engendering progress in society. I think introverts have done a very fine job of this before this book came around, and some anecdotes in this book are proof of that. Introverts have thrived in our world, and will continue to do so. Should education systems be reformed to cater to us? Should work environments do the same? I'm not convinced. Proposals like that make the introvert look like an easily damaged little flower, crushed under the weight of these rigid systems, while I think it's exactly these rigid systems that allow introverts to identify themselves as such. So if the point of this book was patting the introvert on the shoulder to say ""You're amazing"", it does that well. But to go from there to ""You need a society that takes better care of you"" is a leap I had difficulties in going along with.There are some practical pointers for introverts, showing how, when or if we should change our behavior to function well in society or, more importantly, in personal relationships with friends, family and partners. The ""need to hear""-portion of the book, so to speak. I think most of the solutions offered have been found instinctively by introverts around the world, but I found it nice to hear there's actually a word for ""restorative niches"". Remembering my long bathroom brakes when I worked in an open office space has become a little less awkward. Getting more familiar with these concepts definitely makes it a lot easier to give this further thought and find ways forward in my sphere of relations. An important problem I have with the book is its premise: ""the introvert/extrovert divide is the most fundamental dimension of personality"".Susan Cain makes it sound like a truism. Maybe it is true, yes. But I have to say ""maybe"" because I don't feel a premise this crucial has been sufficiently backed up.The author tries to do so, referring to experiments and studies where 28% of a group consisting of people possessing an amygdala that is 11% larger than average were 62% more inclined to respond in such and such a way to such and such incentives. The academic back-up felt like a whole lot of cherrypicking. But all those cherries put together did give the impression that they're the only fruit available, giving the idea that the extrovert/introvert divide is indeed inescapable.This leads me to anoher problem: the divide between introverts and extroverts created by the narration itself. It's true, the author sometimes goes out of her way to compliment extroverts as well, mentioning some of their strengths, but that's just the thing: she has to go out of her way to do it. It shows all the more clearly that the natural discourse, through offhand claims and implicit associations, presents the extroverts as ... ""the others"". And if you picture them as the others, naturally all compliments given to introverts can be read as affronts to the extroverts. I can easily imagine some of the examples and assertions leaving a sour taste of any extrovert's mouth reading this book. (at least when these mouths aren't too busy blabbering about the weather ;-) )Should I hold all this against this book specifically? Truth is I have a problem with most non-fiction books (especially self-help) for this reason: they are written to make a point. A very specific point that they keep getting back to, ad nauseam. The more you hit a nail on the head, the less there's left to see of its point. At least for me. Chesterton says it a lot better:“People wonder why the novel is the most popular form of literature; people wonder why it is read more than books of science or books of metaphysics. The reason is very simple; it is merely that the novel is more true than they are.”― G.K. ChestertonI felt this was true in this case as well. I showed ""Quiet"" more patience because the topic is something I really care about and gave a lot of thought to, but in the end it's Chesterton's way of thinking that prevailed in my experience of this book.That said, the three stars are definitely deserved for all the good this book has done for the introverts, in recognizing that other introverts are going through the same thing and in valueing themselves. I just wished it would have described a little less of what we wanted to hear, and would have done much more of what we needed to hear. But maybe we don't ""need"" to hear all that much, anyway. We're amazing and we know it and we don't clap our hands. "

She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.عنوانها: «سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در دنیایی که از حرف زدن باز نمی‌ایستد»؛ «سکوت: قدرت درون‌‌گراها در دنیایی که بی‌وقفه حرف می‌زند»؛ «قدرت سکوت: ‏‫قدرت درونگراها در جهانی که قادر نیست از سخن گفتن باز ایستد!»؛ «سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در جهانی که از سخن گفتن نمی‌ایستد!»؛ «سکوت»؛ نویسنده سوزان کین؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هشتم ماه سپتامبر سال 2017 میلادیعنوان: سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در دنیایی که از حرف زدن باز نمی‌ایستد؛ نویسنده سوزان کین؛ مترجمها نرگس جوادیان‌قمی، نعيمه اعتدال‌مهر؛ تهران، انتشارات منظومه نگاران ؛ 1393؛ در 292ص؛ شابک 9786009433605؛ موضوع درونگرایی و برونگرایی - روابط بین اشخاص، از نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 21معنوان: سکوت: قدرت درون‌‌گراها در دنیایی که بی‌وقفه حرف می‌زند؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین؛ مترجم: سیمین موحد؛ تهران کتابسرای تندیس‏‫، 1395؛ در 366ص؛ شابک 9786001821929؛ چاپ دوم 1396؛ چاپ سوم 197؛‮‬عنوان: قدرت سکوت: ‏‫قدرت درونگراها در جهانی که قادر نیست از سخن گفتن باز ایستد!؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین‏‫؛ مترجم ناهید سپهرپور؛ ویراستار طاهره خیرآبادی؛ تهران نوین توسعه؛ 1395؛ در 389ص؛ شابک 9786009684311؛ چاپ دوم 1397؛عنوان: سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در جهانی که از سخن گفتن نمی‌ایستد!؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین؛ مترجم درسا عظیمی؛ تهران البرز‏‫، 1393؛ در 373ص؛ شابک 9789644428982؛ چاپ دوم و سوم 1395؛ چاپ چهارم و پنجم 1396؛ ‬چاپ ششم و هفتم 1397؛عنوان: سکوت؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین؛ مترجم: روح‌اله صادقی؛ کرج، در دانش بهمن، 1395؛ در 460ص؛ شابک 9789641741978؛ فهرست: دیدگاه‌هایی پیرامون کتاب قدرت سکوت؛ یادداشت نویسنده؛ پیش گفتار؛ دو قطب شمال و جنوب خلق و خو؛ بخش اول: برون‌گرای ایده‌آل؛ 1- ظهور «همکار دوست داشتنی توانمند»؛ چگونه برون‌گرایی به ایده‌آل فرهنگی تبدیل شد؛ 2- افسانه‌ی رهبری کاریزماتیک؛ فرهنگ شخصیت محور، صد سال بعد؛ 3- وقتی همکاری خلاقیت را از بین می‌برد؛ ظهور تفکر گروهی جدید و قدرت کار کردن به تنهایی؛ بخش دوم: بیولوژی شما، خویشتن شما؟ 4- آیا خلق و خوی ما سرنوشت ماست؟ ذات، تربیت و فرضیه‌ی ارکید؛ 5- فراتر از خلق و خو؛ نقش اراده‌ی آزاد (و راز سخنرانی در جمع برای درون‌گراها)؛ 6- «فرانکلین سیاست‌مدار بود، اما النور براساس وجدان سخن می‌گفت»؛ چرا به خونسردها بیش از حد بها داده می‌شود؟ 7- چرا وال استریت سقوط کرد و وارن بافت ترقی کرد؟ چگونه درون‌گراها و برون‌گراها به نحو متفاوتی می‌اندیشند (و دوپامین تولید می‌کنند)؛ بخش سوم: آیا همه ‌ی فرهنگ‌ها برون‌گرایی ایده ‌آل را دارند؟ 8- قدرت نرم؛ آسیایی–آمریکایی‌ها و برون‌گرای ایده‌آل؛ بخش چهارم: چگونه عشق بورزیم، چگونه کار کنیم؛ 9- چه زمانی باید خودتان را برون‌گراتر از آنچه واقعاً هستید، نشان دهید؟ 10- شکاف ارتباطی؛ چگونه با تیپ شخصیتی مخالف خود صحبت کنیم؟ 11- پینه‌دوزها و ژنرال‌ها؛ چگونه بچه‌های ساکت را در جهانی که نمی‌تواند صدای آن‌ها را بشنود پرورش دهیم؟ نتیجه: سرزمین عجایب؛ یادداشتی در وصف فداکاری؛ یادداشتی درباره واژه‌های درونگرا و برونگرا؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 13/04/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

“Introversion – along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness and shyness – is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology. Introverts living under the Extrovert ideal are like women in a man’s world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are.”
I came across the author of this outstanding book when we studied for our Library studies last year. We were to present on the topic “What are you passionate about”, and my friend presented on this topic by firstly going to the author's Ted Talk. This talk is in a nutshell an excellent summary of this book. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0KYU... I recommend this as ‘required watching’ before delving into this book, which is serious and requires vast concentration to take away with you the gamut of information that took the author five years to research and present to us.Essentially, Susan Cain worked successfully in what would be an extremely extrovert profession for ten years, before realising this is not the fight she need not be fighting. Imagine being a Wall Street lawyer! Susan states, in a quote I love in relation to reflecting on the lives of her friends and classmates who she envied (in her own quiet way I imagine).
“My college classmates who’d grown up to be writers or psychologists. Today I’m pursuing my own version of both those roles.”
 I’d say she has found her perfect mix. This book is full of information from many professionals and psychologists leading in their field of expertise. I can wholeheartedly understand this book taking five years of research and writing. On introverts as leaders 
“Because of their inclination to listen to others and lack of interest in domineering social situations, introverts are more likely to hear and implement suggestions… Extroverts, on the other hand, can be so intent on putting their own stamp on events that they risk losing others’ good ideas along the way...”
A fascinating concept is that of high reactivity and low reactivity, beginning at birth. Amygdala is the scientific term. Babies that react wildly from early days of life with dilated eyes, higher cortisol levels (stress hormone), flailing arms and legs etc, shows that they are more likely to ‘feel’ to new stimuli. From visiting a fun park to the first day of school, experiencing the ocean for the first time, of course the list could go on and on. Loud noises, a large group environment. There is a reason for reacting to these situations! The research is not this simple, but this is my take home layman’s explanation. It explains 
“sensitivity to novelty in general, not just to people.”
Studies have gone into such depth that high reactivity and sensitivity has been related to such specifics as blue eyes, allergies and hay fever. Very interesting! Food for thought for this reader. It could be said that I am proof of this. This would be relatable to many: 
“Her favorite part of the day was the quiet ten minutes when she walked to the bus along the tree-lined streets of her neighborhood.“
 This is so important to many people. I will put my hand up for my children’s sports drop off straight after work to get the return journey to drive home solo to have 20 minutes of my audio book, aka peace. It is fascinating that this book has taught me so much about myself. The down side of this is the intense self observance I have been carrying out while reading the book. I guess it’s a good thing but I am tired! I have not stopped observing myself and others. I tear up when I see kindness, listen to an emotional speech, when someone says something particularly nice, hear sad news, or just witness sincere acts or words. I’m not simply ‘soft’. I am fascinated by all of this. 
“...about sensitive people is that sometimes they’re highly empathetic. It’s as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people’s emotions and the tragedies and cruelties of the world.”
 It is also a common trait to be ultra observant of others thoughts, feelings and actions.This book has validated certain behaviours of mine. I won't go into details but I am understanding intricacies of my behaviours. Avoidances, not wanting to engage in social media.. nor wanting to be out there like so many others do. I cannot stand the Facebook gloating, the pushing of the 'perfect life' stuff. I really do think so many people do not understand this side of things, but I dare say those will not read this book. American culture is drilled into deeply here, this is not the interesting issue for me personally, but I can see this is an excellent cultural acknowledgment or opinion of the American way of life. Obviously written from an introvert’s prospective, but this is not too uneven. Extroverts would not feel unheard reading this book, either. This book would appeal greatly to those who feel they are quiet reflectives or those who live with and/or parent children with sensitive and high reactive children. Softly spoken ideas are offered to be taken on board if desired. Do we need to vigorously brainstorm and discuss at all times? Or would those who are more quiet be missed out on all together? This has its downside as ideas may be unheard, or lost all together. Also at the younger side of the spectrum, cluster our youngsters in groups together in the classroom, and some of our young people will not cope with this and the assumed way of learning for all will not suit all. Hopefully teachers all around the world can draw these children out and allow them to contribute in their own way. Much in the same way as open planned offices may not be conducive to all adults, either. A lot to ponder on. This really is a great book, one the author I hope would be proud of."
27,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina,4,"My kids claim that I am the biggest introvert ever. I could spend entire weekends reading without talking to a single person. I avoid social events so that I can watch sports on tv, one time even turning down the chance to hear Ron Chernow speak so I could watch Monday night football. If I am around people for a few hours, I declare myself officially done for the day. With these traits of being an introvert extraordinaire, I was giddy when the nonfiction book club decided to read Quiet by Susan Cain as one of its monthly reads. A corporate lawyer turned introvert advocate, Cain would finally unlock the mystery of why introverted people such as myself do better alone or in small group settings than in large public gatherings. Needless to say, I joined in the group read of Quiet determined to find out more about introverted people and what makes us go. Cain’s premise is that if it weren’t for introverts, the world would be devoid of many inventions, writers, and other creative minds. Dr Seuss was an introvert. So were Emily Dickinson, J.D. Salinger, and Albert Einstein, among others. Steve Jobs was an extrovert but his business partner who designed a personal computer was an introvert. At first I thought that Quiet would be the history of famous introverted people and what each has contributed to the world. As one who devours biographies, I would have been happy if this was Cain’s primary goal in producing her book. Yet, soon after listing famous introverts, Cain proceeds to delve into the history of psychological personality studies and how behavioral theorists tested children to see who is an introvert and who is an extrovert. Starting with Jungian theory all the way to present day, Cain showed how both nature and nurture play a role in comprising people’s tendencies. In her research, Cain has discovered that one in three people are introverted by nature, more of us than one originally thinks. While I would have rather the book focus on famous introverts than scientific studies, I did appreciate Cain’s personal anecdotes. A corporate lawyer who feared public speaking, Cain tells readers how she used various coping mechanisms to get her through her work. Some worked, some did not, and eventually she changed careers. What she devised while in her research for this book is that both introverts and extroverts use free trait associations to help them in uncomfortable situations, in layman’s terms, they act opposite of what their nature normally would. It was in this chapter that I thought that maybe I am an extrovert after all because I do love to talk; however, just in small groups. In school I often volunteered answers, but I did poorly in large group settings. My volunteering answers was what Cain refers to as my free trait association for me to act extroverted enough to get through my academic day. The fact that behavioral scientists have devoted studies to this gives me hope that future generations of introverted students will not have things as bad as I did. As a parent, the chapters I found most interesting were the ones referring to raising an introverted child. Americans by nature are the most extroverted nation in the world. A nation of immigrants, go getters not afraid to move across the globe and start anew. By default, schools are designed with extroverted students in mind, even though, as Cain points out, that one in three people are introverted. Teachers today have been told to mix activities with both extroverts and introverts in mind, with some activities catering to both groups of people. Cain does encourage parents that if they can, to visit schools ahead of time. This is not feasible for all, but I did feel encouragement that teachers at the key grades of fourth and eighth, usually found in studies, are developing some group, some partner, and some individual activities so that introverted students do not feel lost in a sea of people throughout the day. If only school for me had been that easy. Cain also contrasts the Asian and Caucasian cultures, pointing out that learning is valued in Asian communities, citing a model community of Cupertino, California. With a public school system primarily Asian, these students excel, only to experience culture shock when they leave for college and then enter working society. Some Cupertino parents have even chosen to commute to China for weeks at a time because the American business world is too fast paced and people oriented for them. Cain also interviewed college students to see how they adapted, some remaining as total introverts, whereas others used free trait associations to excel socially at their colleges. She points out that the Asians have a strong tendency to be introverted and Americans have dubbed them the “model minority.” While Asian students do well academically, the working world continues to be a struggle for them, unless they learn how to adapt to American culture. Like any people, some Asians act like extroverts whereas some are happy as introverts, reflecting society as a whole. Within our nonfiction book club, we had a variety of opinions about Quiet. Some members enjoyed the scientific studies more whereas others preferred the history and parenting sections the most. As one who wanted to find out if I am a true introvert or just someone along the spectrum, I found the entire book intriguing. There was some repetition toward the end, perhaps because Cain ran out of things to say. She is an introvert after all, and maybe she grew tired of presenting introverts to the world. Like many of us introverted bookworms at the nonfiction book club, perhaps Susan Cain decided toward the end of this book to end her free trait associations and act like the true introvert that she is. 3.5 stars rounded up "
28,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20955173-sean-gibson,4,"The only thing less surprising than the fact that a book that extols the virtues of nerds who read books has generally favorable reviews on a site populated with nerds who read books (myself included) is that broccoli tastes as bad as it smells.While it’s certainly possible to cherry pick data and case studies in a way to support virtually any contention (give me an internet connection and a couple of hours and I could put together a pretty solid case, backed up by compelling proof, that the Illuminati embedded subliminal messages in the Gummi Bears theme song in order to make left-handed men over the age of 60 spank themselves anytime someone called them Sally), Cain makes a cogent argument that the Western world’s prioritization of what we generally perceive as extroverted tendencies has not only disadvantaged a large segment of the population (perhaps as much as half), but that we can, with some relatively easy adjustments, not only make life easier for those people, but enable them to contribute to society in an even more meaningful and powerful way. I don’t live squarely on the introverted side of the spectrum, but I’m certainly much closer to that end than the other, and many of Cain’s points—particularly about the stress and strain of operating in a workplace that doesn’t often allow sufficient time for deep thinking or solo reflection—hit home. I felt her points even more acutely, however, as the parent of a burgeoning introvert, and Cain offers up a number of helpful suggestions for helping young children adjust, adapt, and thrive in environments such as school and team sports that seem tailor-made for extroverts. I wish all CEOs and business leaders, people who design office layouts, educators, coaches, parents, and broccoli sniffers would read this book. Even if Cain occasionally goes a little too far in extolling the virtues of introversion, her logic is sound, and she persuasively makes the case for rethinking how we go about work, education, creative activity, socializing, and life in general. (Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go stuff some padding into my underwear so that when someone calls me Sally in 20 years and 9 days, I don’t bruise my tender, bubble-shaped junk compartment.)"
29,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1198255-madeleine,3,"Like the friend whose brutal honesty is never immediately welcome but reveals its necessary truths the more you bitterly and obsessively try to prove her wrong (in your head, of course, always in your head because no one else understands, damnit), this book made me confront things about myself that I always kind of knew but glossed over with conciliatory explanations. I am, according to the battery of Myers-Briggs tests that Dr. Internet has administered to me (and that offer the same result no matter how cleverly I think I've outsmarted the aforementioned countless variations of personality assessments), of the INFP persuasion, just like Virginia Woolf and Sylvia Plath were presumed to be, along with many other notable people who haven't killed themselves (like Tim Burton, Billy Shakes and Albert Camus). All sources stress that it's one of the rarer personality types, which at least begins to explain why I feel so interminably weird compared to other people all the time. But I think my introversion also comes with a tinge of self-loathing, for as much as I dislike the idea of being around crowds of people to the extent that I always took those commercials advertising a pill to treat social anxiety as a personal attack on my personality, my stuttering, socially awkward self who identifies with the fictional characters and real ideas populating book after book better than the world beyond my front door is also maddeningly, desperately eager to be the center of attention. Not that I always know what to do with that attention once I get it, as it's fun for about five minutes before the urge to dive for solitary cover re-assumes control. And I think I tend to resent well-adjusted introverts a little for their totally-alien-to-me experience of being comfortable in their own skins.Which brings us to my biggest problem with this book: The author was entirely too present in this study on introverts. I know, I know: My reviews have gotten to be so totally about me that I feel like a hypocritical dick lobbing such a complaint at this presumably well-meaning book. When I read This is Your Brain on Music, I got so pissed off at the reviewers who complained similarly about how Levitin frequently drew on his own experiences because, c'mon, personal experience counts for something while lending a sense of credibility to the research conducted and the conclusions made: The difference, I think, is that Levitin used himself to bring a high-minded concept down to understandable terms for those of us lacking scientific minds whereas Cain sometimes seemed like she just wanted to talk about herself. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but that would have made a better blog than a book. By falling back on her own brand of introversion, it felt like she was both negating the argument that the personality type expresses itself in an inexhaustibly many ways and also even alienating other expressions of introversion to a degree.Actually, I wasn't always crazy about the kind of people Cain used as examples of introverts who were able to overcome their crippling shyness or need to be alone (because shyness isn't always an introvert-specific trait, as this book did teach me) to function -- nay, thrive -- in the vast, sometimes overwhelming world beyond their rich inner landscapes. I mean, for a book subtitled ""The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,"" it would make sense to use Harvard Business School students, Ivy League professors, academic whiz kids on the cusp of high school and everything after, neuroscientists and Wall Street investors (to name a few) to illustrate the victories that can arise from harnessing one's naturally unassuming, slow-to-action instincts and applying them to real-world scenarios. And that was reassuring and motivating and helpful, sure, but what would have been a little more helpful is seeing how an everyday introvert with a quiet job and a simple existence confronts life's obstacles when confrontation does not come easy. (And, yes, there is a whole section on the ordinary workplace and how open floor plans and the elimination of boundaries and this emphasis on group work and collective brainstorming that are all so in vogue really aren't all that conducive to brilliance and happiness and cohesion and all that. But that was more of an academically detached observation than a personal reality.)I really didn't hate this book. Really. I didn't love it but it did force some personal insight on me that I've probably been needing to hear. Like how facing down one's own unique hell, like public speaking (which, hi, have I mentioned that I stutter?), isn't, like, fatal and is worth overcoming. And that just because the Western ideal favors extroverted characteristics doesn't mean it's better -- and that, in fact, a lot of how I approach the world (I'd rather not talk unless I have something worthwhile to say; I don't want to assert myself at the risk of disrespecting the greater whole) is mirrored in the traditionally Eastern approach. That the person speaking the most or first or loudest is rarely offering the best ideas, as a facade of overconfidence often hides an array of interior doubts. That knowing to pick one's battles and proceeding with a quiet assurance is a strength in its own right. The penultimate chapter was nothing but an exploration of how extro- and introverts complement each other and how the two seemingly at-odds personality types can look inward to identify their outwardly differing approaches to the world. As most people are not like me, it did offer some perspective shifts that I found to be genuinely helpful wisdom in terms of how my perception of myself and others doesn't always align with what they either see or know to be true. For one glorious moment, it even seemed like Cain was talking directly to me in addressing the way that the real-life introverted wife of an extroverted man tended to emotionally distance herself from an argument, as she thought she was keeping herself in check while he thought she was shutting him out, which is a difference in interpretation that never even crossed my conflicted mind. I had perused the table of contents before reading even a word of this book and actually groaned when I saw that the final chapter explores ""how to cultivate quiet kids in a world that can't hear them,"" which I figured would read like a laundry list of all the ways my parents failed me. And, I mean, it did, of course, but after recovering from bursting into tears almost immediately at the beginning of the chapter (because, man, was it ever hitting too close to home), I realized that it was only ostensibly advice for nurturing introverted children so they can happily grow into their places in an ill-fitting world: It was really, truly a comforting pat on the back that reached into the past to assure my inner child (the part of it that isn't a perverted little teenage boy, anyway) that she was never as alone and misunderstood as she felt. And if this book had more of those moments, I might have actually wound up loving it. "
30,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3621230-angie,5,"A must read for everyone, not just introverts. Susan Cain, former Wall Street lawyer and self-described introvert, investigates how introversion has become dangerously scorned in the current American ""Culture of Personality."" I had not fully realized how drastically our cultural values have shifted--and how much American society pushes us to conform--until reading Cain's book. To prove her point, Cain visits American bastions of extroversion promotion, including Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, Dale Carnegie, Wall Street, and Tony Robbins conferences. She talks with pioneering psychologists and neurologists to explain the studies behind concepts like the dangers of group think, the ability to delay gratification, or the trait called sensitivity. She profiles famous and less-well known introverts to show how the studies play out in real life.Though the many of the activities I'm drawn to (and the things that cause anxiety) scream classic introvert, I have always considered myself an extrovert and frequently put myself in situations where extroverted behavior is valued. However, since quitting my job and globe-hopping for the past two years, I've been surprised (and disappointed) by how often the constant stimulation, new people, and change can drain me--and by how I often feel an overwhelming need for alone time.I found myself relating to many of the points Cain discusses and have since concluded that I'm much more of an introvert than I had thought. (I promise that this isn't just because she does a good job of highlighting all the positive things about introverts!)So for that, I am grateful to have read Quiet, though I can't quite believe it took reading a book to figure that out about myself! I am seeing my preferences in a new light and have much understanding and acceptance regarding the things that interest me (and those that cause me stress). I've been having trouble narrowing down 'what I want to do with my life' and this book has helped me more than any other, because I finally feel like I can accept that the things I really enjoy are just a part of me and can't be ignored. Though the personal application will differ, I suspect many people will come away having learned much more than they expected, if not about themselves, then about people close to them. I had always thought of extroverts and introverts as being on distinct sides of a line, when in fact it's much more of a sliding scale (or perhaps better as two scales: percentage introversion, percentage extroversion). Because we have been culturally pressured and trained to admire extroverted behavior, many of us may be dangerously ignoring our introverted characteristics. This was a game-changing book for me, and I suspect it will be eye-opening to most people who read it."
31,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,5,"I love reading on Friday nights, writing on Saturday afternoons, and having quiet get-togethers on Sunday. But I also enjoy giving presentations at school, tutoring peers in writing, and interacting with various people online and in real life. I'd describe myself as an introvert (and my Meyers-Briggs personality type agrees), though both introverts and extroverts would enjoy this fascinating book by Susan Cain. She provides an intriguing, in-depth perspective on introversion, its connotation in contrasting cultures, and the psychology behind it.A profusion of the nonfiction I've read has contained too much of something - too many random anecdotes, too much scientific jargon, too many unnecessary statistics or explanations. But Quiet has the perfect blend of personal anecdotes, interesting analysis, detailed explanations, and compelling statistics. Cain references various studies conducted by psychologists and discusses several aspects related to introversion, such as the extrovert ideal, how extroverts and introverts can compliment each other and work together, nature v. nature, etc. Here's one passage about sensitive people (who tend to be more introverted) that struck a chord with me:""The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they're highly empathic. It's as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people's emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and TV shows; they're acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior. In social settings they often focus on subjects like personal problems, which others consider 'too heavy'.""I guess I have an excuse for exposing so much of myself on my blog, huh? Anyway, Cain delves into other subjects that are intellectually stimulating too, such as the three things she thinks are important in identifying one's personal project. She even brings up the relationship between Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other famous historical figures.Overall, highly recommended to everyone curious about their own temperaments and how to embrace their natural personalities. One of the best works of nonfiction I've read.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

Also, it was interesting to hear what you can do to help someone with stage fright preform at their best.However, I felt the book repeated itself. Many times I wondered what new information could possibly be discussed, and a lot of times there wasn't really any new information. It just talked about the same material in a circle from a different angle.A lot of the time I felt like this book was written so introverts could feel validated for being an introvert and that they weren't anti-social. They just need socialization in a completely different way than extroverts."

It's perhaps not a surprise that Susan Cain, the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking identifies herself as an introvert. Being quiet, introverted or shy is still seen by many as a problem or handicap to overcome so I can see her motivation for writing it.One this book's premises is that in the last 50 years or so, the Western world moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality, which according to the author has given an advantage to people that enjoyed outgoing, uninhibited personalities. We tend to admire and reward people that exhibit the most gregarious, outgoing traits of extroverts while at the same time undermined and misunderstand those that are most typically seen in more introverted individuals.
Introversion is really about having a preference for lower stimulation environments. So it's just a preference for quiet, for less noise, for less action. Whereas extroverts really crave more stimulation in order to feel at their best.
The author explains that Introversion is a spectrum, and that most of us don't fully fit into an introvert/extrovert definition. It also provides a sort of ""survival guide"" for introverts to help us learn how to better deal with the pressures of living in a world that for the most part rewards those that are extroverts.
Many people believe that introversion is about being antisocial, and that's really a misperception. Because actually it's just that introverts are differently social. So they would prefer to have a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed to going to a loud party full of strangers.
This book helped me understand myself better, identify those traits that makes many of us ""introverts"" different and learn how to use them to our advantage, both on our professional and personal lives. The book is entertaining and well written. If you are interested in learning about introverts, perhaps because you feel like one or someone closed to you does, this book might be of interest to you.After reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking my conclusion is that the world needs both extroverts and introverts and that we all have a role to play.Here's a link to the author's TED TALK which is sort a summarized version of the book:http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_t..."

And the whole idea about needing time out to recover from socialising - I always thought I was just a bit odd, haha.The criticisms that are quite rightly levelled at this book about preaching some kind of binarism between extrovert and introvert are understandable, and am I'm sure that we are all a little too complex for a poorly designed set of questions to provide any sort of sensible analysis or categorisation (would still like to see the questions though...) Most people will be surely be somewhere close to 'ambivert' even if they know themselves to be introverted at heart. For me a major part of young socialisation and growing up was learning to act like an extrovert, if nothing else just to stop people trying to 'bring me out of my shell' or constantly asking what's up as I am 'being quiet'."

For years people have been telling me to come out of my shell and to be more outgoing and I realized I had definitely playing the role of pseudo-extrovert all this time! I enjoyed reading the fact that we introverts actually have power and hidden strengths. The list of famous introverts surprised me, Rosa Parks, Al Gore and Gandhi in particular. The book also shared some insight into the thinking patterns of extroverts. All in all, it was an interesting book though the end did drag on a bit."

37,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5470914-sam,1,"This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks. Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much. The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid. Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted. Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science. "
38,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"I expected to love, love, love this book. After all, psychology is one of my passions. Also, I am always interested in hearing from some group. And this is saying, ""We, the introverts, are speaking out.""However, the book was neither as powerful nor as interesting as I was hoping....Cain does a great job of blending together different aspects. The three main angles she uses are:1.) Famous people who were introverts. She usually starts her chapters with a story about a wonderful famous person we all know and adore - and then explaining how they were introverted. Rosa Parks, Dale Carnegie, and Eleanor Roosevelt are some of the examples she used.2.) Case studies. This is the real life introvert ""Jane Doe."" She was on this job and thought she would have to quit because she just wasn't outgoing enough. Then she learned that being an introvert was like having a secret superpower! And then she used her introversion to overcome all obstacles! Now she's rich and/or happy. Success!3.) Science - hard and soft. Cain uses both psychology and biology to try and explain the differences between extroverts and introverts. She also explains why introversion might be valuable in evolution and natural selection. She has a fascinating chapter on culture, which emphasizes that although extroversion is worshiped in the USA, many Asian countries value silence, reflection, and understanding over cheerfulness, enthusiasm, and talkativeness. ...This book is at it's best when Cain is exploring how introversion is a valuable and worthy trait or way of being. When she journeys into different places to see how introversion is treated differently there. When she explores how introversion can be a survival aid in the wild and how introverted people can be powerful in their own way.It's exciting and interesting to realize that extroversion - while venerated in America - is actually seen as crass and dumb in many Asian cultures.And it's fun and cool to see different theories of how introverted people and animals are strong in Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. I liked seeing different species and the benefits and drawbacks they experience from being extroverted or introverted. And I enjoyed seeing how introversion could be a kick-butt evolutionary trait which is often overlooked or thought to be something that needed 'killing off.'I thought about 2/3 of the book were weak, though. For instance, I already know enough about famous figures and do not particularly want or need to read a short biography or story about them. Another thing that bugged me were her ""real life introversion stories."" Here is how an introvert struggled. Here is how he learned to embrace his true self and be happy/rich.The whole book just felt like a big pat on the back. ""Don't worry, introverts, you're okay! Everything's okay! It might seem like the world hates you, but use your strengths! You are really amazing.""And it's not even like I DISAGREE with this message, it's simply that I was expecting more than a rather thinly-veiled self-help book. P.S. I really like the page or two that Cain dedicates to exploring Moses (an alleged introvert) and Aaron (his extroverted mouthpiece). It is also interesting when she lightly touches on whether or not the Church and modern-day Protestants shun and punish introverts as not doing the Lord's work. I like when she questions whether Jesus was an introvert or extrovert (covered in one paragraph, very shallow) and questions whether the Church is pushing an incorrect message on it's followers. (""Real Christians proselytize! How can you be a REAL Christian if you are not gregarious?"") I also like when she uses the teachings and life of Gandhi to emphasize that passivity is NOT submissiveness. All these subjects were things I wished she'd explored in greater depth."

All these adjectives and more describe my experience with this amazing book.I'm very much an introvert. I try to avoid social functions as much as possible, but I do love meeting every so often with my dear friends one-on-one. If I do end up at a party, you can bet I'm the one keeping the corner warm. I am an avid reader, a knitter, a sometimes writer, a nerd, and an engineer. My idea of a perfect evening is one spent in the comfort of my apartment, cat in lap, book in hand, coffee at my side. My idea of a perfect vacation is one where I can go to my favorite coffee shop and read. In college, my favorite classes were Differential Equations (in which I, the only female, got a perfect score on the final), Physics, and Fluids. Ever since elementary school, I dreaded a school performances, such as Christmas programs or poetry recitals. At work meetings, I am more likely to listen to everything and be note-taker than I am to present or volunteer ideas.Lately, my boss has said that I need to step things up, become more ""out there"" and confident. Inwardly, I despaired. Wasn't I working hard enough? What was holding me back? Why couldn't I just blurt things out in meetings? Why did I constantly sound nervous, even if I really wasn't? Was there any hope for me to change?And then, like a sign from heaven, I saw this book in the ""New Books"" display at Barnes and Nobles (BTW, I happen to swing by the bookstore at least once a week during lunch - sometimes to purchase, but mostly to pass the time). I remembered a friend had read this and really enjoyed it, and I figured it would help me figure out myself.""Figure myself out"" would be an understatement; it's as if this book were written specifically for me! Cain breaks down what it means to be an introvert. Turns out despite what my sister is constantly telling me, I'm not weird (alright, not too weird). I have talents and skills. I have a place. And it's not my fault I can't always speak up and make my voice heard. A lot of it is because of how our workforce, our employers, our coworkers, our society functions. Our biology, our parents, our surroundings make us the introverted beings we are. It's just that school and work and the outside world try to tell us that being quiet, that listening and ruminating over things is wrong, that we should be quick to speak and blurt whatever is on our mind.I've known I was an introvert for a while, but it was so refreshing and liberating to learn that there were others with my ""problem"". That I wasn't alone. And, most importantly, I can overcome, nay thrive, in this Extroverted world. And that is the second gift Cain gives us in this book: how to be an Introvert in an Extrovert world and not want to choke yourself at night.I feel like, after reading Quiet, I have a plan for facing my ""work problems"". I feel like I can take the challenge my boss has placed in front of me and succeed. Although a part of me still wishes I could crawl back to my desk and burrow there, I think this book has given me the tools and encouragement I need to speak up.If you are an introvert, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you aren't an introvert, this is a great book to understanding how they think and act. I'm definitely passing this along to everyone I know."
40,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Years ago, my division manager at work had everybody in the division take the Meyer Briggs personality test. Then we spent time in a workshop, to understand the implications of our personality types. One of the dimensions of the test is extroversion/introversion (E or I types). This book offers a very satisfying account of what it means to be an introvert. Generally Western cultures admire extroverts, while Asian cultures admire introverts. Both types of personalities offer value to society. Groups of people who are introverts are best with an extroverted leader, while groups of extroverts are best with an introverted leader.Many introverts find it difficult to live in a society that values extroversion more highly. As a result, many introverts pretend to be extroverts in certain social situations. But they cannot maintain this pretension indefinitely, and at some point in time they must ""recharge"" their internal batteries with quiet and solitude. The book makes a major point here: It's perfectly OK to pretend to be an extrovert for periods of time--as long as you do this while you are working at something that you truly love.The book has useful practical advice for introverts. If you are an introvert and your husband or wife is an extrovert, there is much to be said about how to maintain or improve your relationship. If you are raising a child who is an introvert, it is important to understand how to encourage the child to follow his/her innate abilities.Back in the 1940's and 1950's, Alex Osborn was plagued by the lack of creativity in his advertising agency. So, he wrote some books introducing the concept of ""brainstorming"". The idea is for people get together in groups and toss out ideas without fear of ridicule--the more ideas, the better. The problem is, in the 1960's, studies showed that brainstorming is not efficient; you can get more, good ideas if people simply think creatively in solitude. Committees simply are not as productive as the sum of individuals working alone. We are so inculcated with the idea that brainstorming is best--but this is really just a reflection of the dominance of extroversion in our society. "

I was hoping for a bit more knowledge or ‘self help’ regarding being an introvert in an average every day life, Not as an award winning introverted lecturer, or an introverted Lawyer or CEO."
42,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"It is stated at the start that this book’s purpose is to improve a reader's relationship with others. The book can thus be viewed as a book of the self-help genre. Its aim is to advise introverts on ways by which they can improve their relationships with extroverts, and vice versa. It compares behavioral traits of both introverts and extroverts, showing in what ways they are similar and how they differ. The author mentions books about and summarizes studies related to extroversion and introversion, conducted over the years and up to today. The book begins with a quick test by which readers can determine where they stand on the introvert / extrovert scale. The test takes only a few minutes and gives the reader an immediate connection with the topics to be discussed. Both my husband and I took the test. We both received the same score, indicating that we are both strong introverts. It is interesting to note that although we had the same score, we did not answer all questions in the same way. This led to a lively discussion and a fun start to the book! Twenty questions are to be answered with a yes or a no. The book demonstrates clearly that in America it is the extroverts that hold sway--in the government, in business and in most educational institutions. It is an important and valuable statement that is being made. This is often to the detriment of introverts and to society as a whole. While the author professes the importance and value of both the introvert and the extrovert way of thinking, given the suppression of introverts in society today, it is introverts she lauds most, giving example after example of their accomplishments. I didn’t need to be convinced. For me, it is OBVIOUS that society benefits from the presence of both. The book verges on becoming a manifesto for introverts. This appeals to me no more than society's pronounced favoritism of extroverts! The book accomplishes well what it has set out to do, but I am rarely enthused by books of the self-help genre. It does advise readers on how their relationships can be improved. It also explains how schools can be adapted to better suit the needs of introverts, without hampering the situation for extroverts. I do however find much of the advice given as being rather obvious. The sections I like most are those that are scientifically oriented. I like for example the parts about how the brain functions; sections about the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex and the connection to dopamine are interesting. Many studies are referred to, but how exactly each was performed is skimmed over in too brief a manner. We are told what the results have for implications, but skeptic that I am, I was not always convinced! I need more details. To add depth, opposing points of view should have been added. Intuitively, I agree with the conclusions drawn, but I would have preferred more solid proof. Too many generalizations/simplifications are made. Over and over again we are told that so and so was an introvert and so and so an extrovert. This is all too simple! Individuals are mixes of introvert and extrovert qualities. Instead, an analysis of the tangled mix of traits that make up real people is what I was looking for. At one point Moses is classified as an introvert! This was just too much for me. The author swiftly classifies famous people as being either introvert or extrovert with little analysis of their specific character traits. I find this too categorical. We are told that Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, would never have written the books she wrote and become the ""bold thinker"" that she became had she not been left alone to read books in her youth. Where is the proof in that?! The author generalizes and simplifies all too often. The book is directed primarily toward Americans. I do not appreciate this slant. There is only a brief discussion of Asian American immigrants. Asian Americans of Chinese background are classified as introverts. Europeans are in a bunch grouped with Americans. I would have preferred a more in-depth, nuanced analysis of national and cultural differences.I wish the book had been more globally and more scientifically oriented. It has too many generalizations. It is basically a self-help book, a genre that does not appeal to me, so I guess it is not so bad that I nevertheless felt it to be worth reading. I would have preferred more in-depth analyses concerning how individuals are complicated mixes of introversion and extroversion. We are not one or the other, as was so often stated in reference to the people mentioned. The narration of the audiobook by Kathe Mazur started out very fast, but eventually she slows down. Her rapid speed had me chuckling at the beginning. Why? Because it is the extroverts, not us introverts that talk fast! Didn’t the producers of the audiobook realize the incongruity?! We introverts need time to stop and think and time to examine the ideas floating around in our heads. The narration is easy to follow once Mazur has slowed down. She has a soft, pleasant voice, a perfect match for introverts, the central protagonists of the book. The question is how many extroverts read this book. It is interesting to think about why this may be so."
43,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,5,"This book is very insightful and informative. I watched Susan Cain's TED talk once and I was fascinated being an introvert myself. As a kid I was shy, serious, studious with a little bit of social anxiety and although as I grew up, I outgrew my shyness and got more confident socially, there have been many situations where I questioned myself. Once when I was out on a trip with a big group of college friends, everyone was getting along so well and they seemed to be having so much fun together but I felt so lonely and left out and I was like, ''What's wrong with me''? Turns out I'm just an introvert. Then, I found this book. It describes in detail what introversion and extroversion is and what are the traits associated with both personalities. Where in most areas (or cultures), the introversion or shyness is viewed in a negative light, the writer states that it's an essential trait and how powerful it could be and it should be valued just as extroversion is. I found this book very interesting to read because she presents her ideas by using data gathered from case studies, research and her own personal experiences and from other people. She has also provided analysis of many famous personalities and how their temperaments shaped their actions and how essential their role was. Many definitions are provided for introversion-extroversion and how our genes and our environment play a role in shaping our personalities. There is no personality type better than the other but creating a balance is very important to bring out the best in both. The message in short is- value your individuality and do things the way you want and not because you have to conform to certain cultural norms. It also tells how both personalities can strike a balance between both traits. Also, both extroverts and introverts can lead a fulfilling life without changing their core values or trying to be someone they are not, the power lies in knowing who you are, what your abilities are and using them to the best.After reading this book, I feel like I can understand myself a little better now, what my motivations are and what makes me the way I am. I recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts as it can help them understand the qualities in themselves and in each other."

45,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1230817-lori,5,"I'm really excited about all the works about introverts that's been coming out lately, I think mainly because of this book. I'm not sure if extroverts would have enjoyed this book as much as me, because Cain works hard to prove the merits and necessity of introverts in our society, while down-playing all the reasons why we should have an extrovert ideal. In fact, I think some extroverts would feel a bit offended at this book. But I don't care. I've lived my whole life feeling like there was something wrong with me. I need to speak up, get out there, sell myself, basically become something that I'm not. This book made me realize there's nothing wrong with me, and that I actually have strengths that my extroverted friends, relatives, etc., do not. Instead of constantly seeing myself as disadvantaged because I suck at small talk, don't know how to talk myself up in interviews, and am just a shy person, I just feel like I know myself better. I think teachers should read this book. And I'm going to stop, because this isn't so much as a book review as a blog post or something. This is a total self-help book for introverts. Thank you Cain!**I should also say that Cain uses extensive research and interviews to show the strengths of introverts, so it's actually a pretty scientific book (though made so that it's easy for the every day person like me to understand). I was really surprised at the amount of research done on the differences between introverts and extroverts, especially because the research often shows introverts in a good, positive light, unlike what most people think when they hear the word introvert.

First of all, as far as the audio format goes, they couldn’t have chosen a better narrator. Kathe Mazur’s voice fits the tone of the book perfectly–quiet and measured, yet firm. I basically just want to listen to every audiobook she’s ever narrated. Back to Quiet –I think Susan Cain did a stellar job of exploring the introverted personality type. She sites a number of studies and scientific theories to support her thesis that introversion is an undervalued trait in modern American society. Introverts have just as much to offer the world as extroverts and their unique strengths must be utilized for a society to be truly healthy.

47,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"When I was young, my grandfather, an intelligent farmer, used to call me an introvert, as I sat happily in the corner, spending my free time reading books or writing in my notebooks. I looked up at him, I believe I was around the age of eight or so, with crinkled eyebrows. He explained what it meant. But I didn't have a puzzled look on my face because I didn't understand the word, I was puzzled because he said it like he disapproved. Like it was a bad thing. My aunt, the doctor, immediately came to my defense and said, ""Janine, just tell him that you're not an introvert, you're just introspective."" That became my motto in life. I said it often, mostly because I felt those were big words and others would think I was smart. I never thought about it much later in life until I read this book. Cain talks about the virtues of being an introvert but how society has come to prize the personality traits of the extrovert. Being a pretty extreme extrovert, at first, I didn't think this book was for me. But then I thought back to when I was eight, and realized with shock and I wasn't just a person who could be both, although I was, I am, but I went from one extreme to the other. When I was a child, I was the most introverted person I know. Using the word shy to describe me didn't cut it. I would skip class altogether if I was even a minute late, to avoid the fear of having to walk into the classroom with everyone looking at me. Speeches had me thinking thoughts of jumping out of trees just to break a bone so I could get out of giving the speech. Now, I love nothing better than walking into a room full of strange people. It's just a room full of fifty new friends! And talking in front of people? I have to hold myself back in group exercises just so I don't hog the limelight. How did such a huge change occur? I'll tell you how, because of work, school, and problems socially, I was forced into it. As I began to read this book, I saw a lot of truth in what Cain was saying. Extroverts really are prized now, not just socially but in the workplace as well. At the last company I worked for, I sat in cubicles, was encouraged constantly to hold meetings and ""group think"" up ideas. How different it would have been if I was allowed even one hour a day without interruptions! What has made us so concerned with having these qualities? I am homeschooling my children and every time I come across someone who disapproves it's always because of lack of ""socialization"". My five-year-old son has no trouble talking to anyone and being friendly, I think he gets it from me. But he also loves to play by himself. He might get this from me as well! He creates his best Lego creations when left alone for hours at a time. Why is this a bad thing? As Cain points out, some of the best innovators of our time were quiet thinkers. And we might not have had some of those great inventions or works of art had these people been forced to ""socialize"" as children instead of left alone. And really, what is the big deal with needing socialization being such a big part of schooling? Why can't it be found outside of school? I recently watched a documentary about the current school systems and, as most people know, we (The United States), rank very low in all areas of education. In fact, when American children were tested in various areas against other countries of the world, we consistently ranked on the bottom in almost all areas except one. Can you guess what it is? Self-confidence. American children are said to have the highest self-confidence compared to all other countries. How do we explain this to our children? We're idiots but we have pride! Is this because we're placing such importance on making our children extroverts? Some of the case studies Cain uses to show examples of her theories kept me riveted. She also had a twenty question test in case you weren't sure where you stood. The more traits she gave as examples of introverts and extroverts, the less sure I became of which I was. Ask anyone which I was as a child, they would have said introvert, hands down. Ask anyone I know right now, and in a second they'd say extrovert. So I took her test to see where I stood. I thought I was only doubting myself, and that it would show pretty conclusively that I was an extrovert. But in fact, I was split almost exactly down the middle. I love meeting new people, and often feel energized at the end of a big party. But I also get rejuvinated from having alone time every day. Even back in college, when I was one of the most social people around, my roomates all knew that they risked certain death if they bothered me during my ""break time"". I have no problems going to movies alone, and one of my favorite things to do is go out to lunch or dinner at a nice restaurant with a good book as a dinner companion. People look at me weird, but I could care less. Whenever I go out or have a party my motto is always ""The more the merrier"". So where did I stand on this chart? The advice for public speaking for introverts wasn't going to help me. And to say I should have quit reading the book halfway through because I considered myself an extrovert would have had me missing out on some very interesting information. I really enjoyed this book. And I disagree that this book is only for introverts. I think the biggest benefit this book had for me is the eye opener to how we have been pressured to become more extroverted over the years and how we see this change everywhere, from schools, to the workplace, to advertising, to even moralistic behavior. I think all can benefit from having a greater awareness of this personality trait in everyone they know. If you're an extrovert, wouldn't it benefit you from having a better understanding to where your introverted team leader is coming from? And another realization for me, is how I know see my son, who has the tendency to play alone. I now am more aware of how I treat him, and make sure I no longer fall into that stereotypical reaction of ""Why don't you try harder to make friends?"" routine. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert, and if this book has any major theme, that's it. That being said, even though I very much enjoyed this book, I only gave it three stars for a couple of reasons. First of all, I feel like the middle of the road people such as myself were somewhat ignored. Where do we stand? How do we relate better to people and situations? Then there were the case studies. As I mentioned earlier, they were very interesting and really helped in relating to the particular example's Cain discussed. But after a while, they became tedious, and didn't hold my attention as well as the first half of the book. I still think many can benefit from reading this though. It was fun, and I look forward to discussing it with my book club.  ClassicsDefined.com"
48,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"I never really thought of myself as introverted until relatively recently, within the last year or so, when I declined an invitation to go out with a group of friends to the bar and one of them said ""Fine, be introverted then! Hope you enjoy sitting home alone with your cats!"" (She meant it in a teasing, only partially bitchy way, but I didn't take offense. I DO enjoy sitting home alone with my cats.)My semi-bitchy friend actually helped me define a big part of myself. Until then, I just thought of myself as ""the most anti-social Libra ever"", and poked fun at myself for not wanting to go out all the time, or being overwhelmed by loud, boisterous people, or needing time to just be alone - what my boyfriend calls ""cave-dwelling"". I made these things a joke because, according to society, it's not normal to want to spend so much time alone. I'm supposed to be a fun, out-going social butterfly. The thought exhausts me. So, when I read this, it was like someone opened up my head and singled out these aspects of my personality and then wrote them down. It was fascinating to read this book and learn about myself. I see things about my past in a completely new light. Like the situation above. I'd be more than happy to sit at home with a few friends and drink, but going to a bar to drink among a huge crowd just held no appeal. Or like how I approach my work. The sections of this book pertaining to corporate expectations and office structure were fascinating to me, and really allowed me to look at my job and approach to work differently. I'm a good employee and good at my job, but I don't aspire to be in the limelight. I don't MIND recognition or attention for a job well done, but it's not something I seek out. So, when I was recently offered a job with a new company, I had my choice of being in a ""client liaison"" position or a ""analysis and testing"" position, and I took the latter, even though it's a position with less recognition and lower pay. The thought of having to constantly be professionally social with strangers gives me anxiety, though, so it was a no-brainer for me. But when I discussed my decision with friends, they called me crazy to have turned down the higher paying position. As though money is the only criteria worth considering. (A point that this book makes well.)I'm going to miss the job I'm leaving though, because it did give me a kind of structured socialization. I get along great with my team, and there, I'm far more socially outgoing than I would be otherwise. I've worked with many of these people for several years, I trust and respect them, and they are people I consider real friends. Soon I'll be working 100% from home, so my social interaction will be drastically reduced. I may be introverted, but I do need that interaction. The hard part for me will be actually initiating it. I have a tendency to, uhh, forget to be social. I forget to call and text people, even though I mean to do it. But being social is just never at the forefront of my mind. I'll have to work on that. But then there's online communities, which is a completely different world. I have always been more open and (dare I say it?) chatty online than in my ""real life"" social interactions. Maybe it's the anonymity, or the fact that it's text-based, or the fact that the community I'm in here is one that is full of like-minded people with similar interests. People I can relate and talk to easily. I don't know, but I'm quite different online than off. Offline, I don't really do chit-chat, or small talk, and I'm often at a loss as to what I should say in a light social situation, despite there being 10 dozen possibilities running through my mind. I usually settle for silence, though, because by the time I've thought through a plethora of ""Nice weather"" or ""Your hair looks nice"" nothing comments, it's been an awkwardly long time, and I know it, and anything that I say at that point would just sound forced and fake, so I just... don't. That feeling that I just mentioned, about feeling forced and fake, is such a strong one for me that it sometimes overwhelms me when I really don't want it to, and it often feels to me like I come across as being cold and unfeeling when I really just don't know what to say to show how affected I really am. It was only when the book started talking about being 'sensitive' that it started to click. I've always been overly affected by emotionally charged situations. If you read some of my reviews of tear-jerker books, I mention this frequently. I remember when I was a kid, there was a show called Rescue 911 that my mom liked to watch. It was always some traumatic situation - a car wreck or an injured hiker or a woman trapped in a housefire, etc, and the show focused on the EMTs and firefighters and police called out to help. That show would always make me cry. Always. Every single episode. It didn't matter whether the people made it out OK, or if they all died, I would be in tears. I could just imagine how scary it would be and I had such respect for the kind of people who could deal with that kind of trauma every day and keep it together enough to help. It would all just overwhelm me, and I would cry. My point here, and how this relates to my last paragraph, is that my dad would often poke fun at me for getting upset over the show, and so I learned to hide that I was upset... oftentimes laughing to cover it. Laughing. As I got older into my teens, I just stopped showing that sensitivity in front of others at all, and unfortunately, that's carried over into my adult life. So now, when I feel strong emotions, it's easier for me to let them out when I'm alone, even though it makes me seem heartless to not show them when it's appropriate. Like at my grandma's funeral earlier this year, when my entire extended family was crying and talking and interacting, and I was stoically sitting in the pew, just thinking about her and how much I'll miss her. After the service, when I was alone, I completely lost my shit. I loved that woman, dammit. She was awesome.Anyway, if you're still reading, sorry for the overshare. What I'm getting at is that I loved how this book made me feel normal. It's well-researched, well-written, and engaging, and I'm incredibly glad that I read it. I think that it will... maybe not CHANGE my life, so much as improve it. I now know more about why I do certain things, and that's empowering. I can relate better to my boyfriend (an extrovert), and in my new job, and in social situations. And I can try to work on the things that I now recognize hinder me more than help me. Definitely a fascinating read. Highly recommended. "
49,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"So...Just read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, (2012) by Susan Cain, Crown Publishers.I liked this book, and why not -- an in-depth defense of people like me! Although I confess, I never thought that introverts would need to be explained to extroverts. I thought we were self-evident, and it was the other, noisy, dominant half of the world that was inexplicable. (They still are.) It possibly needs a companion volume -- Noisy: the hegemony of people with nothing helpful to say who still won't shut up, or something. (Cue reality TV, talk radio, and horrible crush parties with loud music, where you couldn't hear anyone even if they were interesting.) Anyway.This made a curious juxtaposition with my last-read book Fossil Horses. MacFadden, a scientist, argued like a scientist; Cain, a lawyer, argues like a lawyer. I discern the differences even as I appreciate the advocacy. Cain develops her case through illustrative anecdotes, and references to science, psychology, and history as needed. Very readable. I confess, I hadn't thought of extroversion as the American cultural ideal, even as I have witnessed plenty of the cited behaviors. My world tends to be divided practically into ""people who read"" and ""everybody else"", which cuts unevenly across the extrovert/introvert divide, with the obvious bias.I sort of want to go out and press this book upon ""everybody else"", but one sees the inherent problem with that. I hope its message can cut through the noise somehow, nonetheless.Recommended.Ta, L."

I once again learned that every path has a value, also a quiet one and a whispering voice is not less valid, just less loud. Basically already that is more than enough to recommend it.If you consider yourself an introvert and doubt your own worth in comparison with more outgoing or established people, this is for you.If you are in any way interested in the introvert - extrovert spectrum, this will give you some very good understanding. For me the Quiet Revolution is a bit over the top, but that came after the book and doesn't make it any less valuable. "

"
52,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"I feel sure Quiet will become the benchmark book on the topic of introversion. This is because it not only thoroughly explains introversion but champions it. It’s a book by an introvert for introverts, to help them understand themselves and feel proud of who they are. It’s also a book for extroverts, but especially those extroverts who are convinced that introversion is a flaw. Cain will have them wishing they were introverts. Quiet is inarguably biased in favor of introversion, but that’s the point. Up to one-half of Americans are introverted. It’s absurd that introversion is scoffed at as much as it is. The time has come for the introverted label to be a compliment rather than a criticism. This book is a leap in that direction.Cain covered many facets of introversion, from the intriguing “highly sensitive” subset (which describes about 20% of all introverts) to differences in the Eastern and Western worlds to the introverted child (specifically in the classroom, which favors extroverts). Also explored is the age-old question of nature versus nurture and brain differences between extroverts and introverts--plus more. I greatly enjoyed the Eastern versus Western section. America, and the Western world in general, has what Cain dubs an “Extrovert Ideal.” The opposite is true in the East. Whereas in the West, introversion is viewed as a weakness to be conquered, in the East, it’s considered a strength; extroversion is frowned upon, viewed as something that must be tamed. The general sentiment is that extroverts are overwhelming people, wasting others’ time with empty chatter. It’s in this section that Cain profiled Don Chen, an Asian-American student studying at Harvard business school, a very extroverted place. He’s the embodiment of introversion and must feign extroversion daily to get through his classes and general life as part of the school. Feigning extroversion is draining, and Chen needs solitude every day to recharge. This is how it is for all introverts, and Cain stressed repeatedly that it’s not a defect, just a difference. Chen has an intimate group of friends (entirely Asian-American save for one introverted white American man). He’s keenly aware of the differences between his little group and his extroverted classmates. He notes how frequently the extroverts participate in classes while he rarely does and how boisterous they are when together in the cafeteria. Though he admires some of their qualities, he mostly doesn’t understand them. In his mind, they disrespectfully waste classmates’ and professors’ time with their talk, failing to get to the point quickly. If this section sounds borderline racist, it isn’t. Rather, it recognizes that different cultures value different qualities and is a powerful example of introversion as a desirable trait. Chen’s story is one of many in this enlightening book. To support all points, Cain profiled real people, some living, some dead (such as Rosa Parks and Dale Carnegie). The (carefully indexed) research is fascinating in itself, but the real-life examples supporting her research are vital. They round out Quiet to push it beyond dry textbook. I’d read a lot about introversion before reading Quiet, and I bypassed this book for years because others said it offers nothing new on the topic. Readers who’ve read numerous books on the topic or have researched the topic extensively may feel this way. I didn’t. In each chapter, I learned--and was utterly engrossed. Introverts will find Quiet relatable and affirming. Extroverts will find Quiet demystifies introverts thoroughly and will appreciate them more. Both will find it extremely illuminating."
53,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36434323-melindam,4,"3,6 starsWell.... as I am an introvert, I obviously need to comtemplate before writing a review, right? :)But all in all, I am glad I listened to this book. The narrator was excellent.Also, it was a very interesting, insightful, informative read and of course there were lots of issues raised to which I could totally relate, even though sometimes I was a bit confused about what Susan Cain was ultimately trying to prove.I wish I could have read this book as a I teenager as well as my extrovert mother! :)I am from Central-Eastern Europe, so of course not all things ""translate"" directly into how society is working in Hungary as opposed to how things are in the US, but the personal issues are there and are quite universal."
54,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose,5,"This has been probably the one review I've been most intimidated to write for the longest time, and it's not because Susan Cain's ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" isn't a strongly asserted and powerful work. I could sing its respective praises for days. The fact of the matter is - this book really hit me at the heart of my core for so many measures in my life as an introvert. I find it hard to expound just how much this book had an impact on me personally.I could tell you about many things about my person that embody me as an introvert. That I'm quiet spoken and don't speak unless I have something important to say. That small talk isn't something I'm comfortable that I'm not fond of confrontations (though many of you have read my extended written rants about various matters of controversy with very little hesitation). That I tend to spend time alone to recharge my batteries even when I'm called to do things in any scale of extroversion. That my emotional intelligence is very high and I can sympathize/emphathize with people for matters of their experience (though this also makes me highly sensitive).For most of my life, I've been told that these very natural matters of my disposition were wrong. And goodness forbid did that make my life complicated because I didn't feel like people understood who I was. I was even led to believe that I was actually shy, not introverted (many people confuse the two, there is a difference.) Yet the more I learned about the dynamic of introversion and extroversion and how they functioned, I realized that the fundamental difference between them were the derived sources of energy that one functions with in day to day living. That there's nothing wrong with being introverted versus extroverted in a society that - in mainstream notations, champions the latter.This book had me thinking for days after I finished it.I liked that Cain's narrative focuses on the positive contributions and the inherent strengths that lie in introversion because it's widely stereotyped. That stereotyping actually harms our society more than we ourselves may realize in the daily grind, not just individually. By trying to mold people into one acceptable standard, we often lose out on what unique strengths and contributions one may have from going away from such a standard. Narratives like ""Quiet"" have relevance not just in recognizing the distinct psychological functions and differences we have as individuals, but also in the relationships and contributions we have in our professions, our activities, and even wider perceptions of our society in general.I appreciated the expansion on famous figures like Rosa Parks in terms of her backstory and identity as an introvert and how that shaped her responses (I'll have to pick up ""Quiet Strength"" at some point). I also appreciated hearing Cain's own struggles with coming to terms with her introversion, and even the story of the Harvard Business student. There are so many individual stories in this narrative and Cain gives a thorough examination of the details within. It's amazing just how much work and thought went into expounding these issues and individual narratives. This narrative examines introversion not only as a social construct, but individual - delving into narratives of biological, psychological, and sociological importance. There's an examination on the level of intorversion among different cultures, how introspection is valuable to creativity versus ""groupthink"", how extroversion and introversion are not mutually exclusive (and situations that call for each). I came out of it all with not only a fresh perspective on how valuable introverts are to the fabric of society, but also a greater sense of self-worth for my own traits. And that's something to be thankful for. My hope is that with more people who pick up ""Quiet"" and realize how important our individual attributes are, that it'll provide for more opportunities to be creative and to value each other in our relationships regardless of differences, for our unique strengths regardless of how their expressed or from where they come.Overall score: 5/5 stars"

My credentials include cheerfully working from home, getting overstimulated in quiet libraries, and keeping in touch with my closest friends almost entirely by snail mail. I have been known to feel oversocialised sitting in a darkened room, listening to people two rooms away watch a film.As far as a lot of media is concerned, I may as well be a pet hamster. ""Care for your introvert."" Try not to interrupt them. Don't go in their nest while they're sleeping. Offer them a way out when you're at a party, in case they run out of carrot sticks and want to go home. I may as well also be a complete rarity: a third of people don't get hissy when you take their carrot sticks away; come the fuck on.So, what I liked about Quiet was that it didn't make me feel like a special snowflake or someone's hamster.But also... the section on introversion in leadership and the workplace has actually boosted my confidence a lot (apart from being really interesting). I've worked for a few people, and the times it's worked best have been the times where they give me a broad, bullet-pointed list of what they want to have happened by what time, and then they go away until that time. The best boss I ever had used to say it was a good day if we never spoke to each other except when one of us brought the other coffee - and I was inclined to agree with him. Faced with common-sense-logic, which seems to say that 5000 feedback sessions and an open-plan office with communal ball-pit are what millennials are looking for, I wanted this narrative. It was useful to hear. Maybe it's less useful if you're the sort of person who's been reading this sort of thing for years. For me, it was a helpful reminder.I remember a little interesting neurological detail, but not a lot - I can get more than that keyword-searching the Scientific American website, if I want to - and a fair bit of interesting historical anecdote. I remember coming away with a renewed respect for anyone who parents, especially by themselves, as well as a sense of purpose about working for myself and by myself - which I'm happy to say I'm now doing. It turns out, a lot of the time, that people who contract you for work over the internet don't really give a shit about your sparkling and gracious personality. They just want to know you're conscientious and you know what you're talking about and you'll do things when you say you will. I vaguely credit Susan Cain with giving me the impetus to go and do what I want to do, and not to feel like I have to be constantly nice to people I don't know. Now I just think, it's okay, I have character, and then put my headphones back in."
56,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5524572-kristin-hackett-superspacechick,4,"As a self proclaimed introvert, I've been meaning to read this book for so long. My sister in law gave me a copy for Christmas so I prioritized it as a January read and I'm so glad I did. I really enjoyed the in depth look at what constitutes an introvert vs. an extrovert. Quiet even redefined the meaning of the word sensitive for me. I've never considered myself sensitive before but to pull a quote, ""highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They’re often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee... Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments—both physical and emotional—unusually deeply. They tend to notice subtleties that others miss—another person’s shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.""- this is 100% spot on for me. While I do agree with a lot of what Susan Cain wrote, I do think it's difficult to classify people into only one of two categories. She did stress that just because someone is an introvert, it doesn't mean that 1) they got there the same way as someone else or 2) that both people will have exactly the same traits. There are still variables to consider. Overall, I loved that Quiet is a celebrated look at introversion and the strengths that those with introverted qualities possess. There were a few anecdotes that weren't the most interesting (or relevant like the chapter on raising children), but I still found value in reading them. "

She has helped me understand myself more and I am glad of that. Introverts don't like novelty and the first day of school is usually traumatic as mine was. As children, introverts like to daydream, play inside and their feelings are easily hurt. ""They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. . ."" They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy and fear."" They "". . . tend to speak softly because that's how they prefer others to communicate with them.""Shy people hate confrontations and will avoid them at all costs and the author believes it is better so. ""Scores of studies have shown that venting doesn't sooth anger; it fuels it.""This is a great book for people who have always felt that their shyness makes them less worthy than the more gregarious in the world."
58,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,2,"Why is it that the “ideal” person is extroverted? That we pride social skills and being outgoing? All while a deeply gifted thinker who prefers to be in his/her head is described as lacking these traits. Looking at it from an evolutionary standpoint, there is a reason why introverts exist, so why do we rate it as second best? Being a true-blue introvert, I turned to Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a world that can’t stop talking” to answer these questions (and maybe propose new ones). Susan Cain divides “Quiet” into four main sections with the first focusing on the history and description of the rise of extroverts, the differences in leadership styles of introverts and extroverts, and the myths surrounding them. This section begins “Quiet” with a slow and unmemorable beginning. Cain focuses more of an effort on real-life case studies versus actual scientific studies, bypassing any professional data or even her own opinions. The studies which are mentioned are not “earth-shattering” in depth nor do they truly correlate to her hypothesis. In fact, much of the hypothesis is lost and the flow is not seamless or clear. On one hand, this makes the reading understandable and accessible for the less scientifically-inclined reader, but to others craving more research; Cain leaves something to be desired. Some of Cain’s examples which could be perceived as “witty” (Craig Newark of Craigslist fame, Dr. Suess, and Moses from the Bible) are underdeveloped and also lose connection with the hypothesis. Cain is often abrupt and cuts herself short. Furthermore, many of the chapters begin in the same exact way (both format and creativity) which is tedious and creates a loss of interest. The second section of “Quiet” describes some of the brain and neurological aspects of introverts featuring more science than the first section. Cain’s work is a bit more compelling in this respect and certainly more interesting. However, it still isn’t clear what she is trying to prove as she mostly just describes how introverts “are”. Plus, most of the findings are self-explanatory and even obvious. Again, the reader will not be blown away. I have read MANY “brain books” (psychology/neurology, science, and biology) and generally, I am left both flabbergasted and repeating information I’ve read to anyone who will listen. This was not the case with “Quiet” as only a small dose of information felt standout. As the second portion progresses, Cain does present tests and experimentation results more confidentially (however, there is a lack of elaboration). The third section of “Quiet” is comparatively shorter, as Cain explains the conformities and values of the Asian cultures while in the fourth section, Cain offers tips and lifestyle adaptations for introverts in various areas such as work, romance, parenting, play, etc. At this point, “Quiet” appears to be more of a self-help book. The latter end of the book is overly focused on parenting and schooling of children causing me to feel alienated and distanced (having no children). Furthermore, the “Conclusion” is weak and sums up the book which actually reinforces how few points are made. Simply, “Quiet"" is not what I expected. Instead of explaining “why” introverts are the way they are; Cain described “how” they are with an absence of data I would have preferred. All in all though, it has been confirmed (which I already knew) that I am indeed an introvert."
59,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A lance is broken for the needs of introverted people Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Whether one opposes the sanguine with the phlegmatic nature, the wild daredevil the thoughtful inventor or merely the introversion the extroversion, the temperament is and remains in specific proportions decisive for a human being. The author has re-examined this fact with an unconventional approach, opening up exciting and critical viewing angles. Times are changing. In the 19th century, it was still commonplace to be modest, humble and unobtrusive. Starting from the advertising industry in the 1920s and 1930s, it continued to run to the idealistic goal of total superficiality. Ads began to play with people's fear of the negative connotations of ominous, alien observers, and the appearance and ability to attract more and more attention. The new religion of narcissism was supported by an entrepreneurial mentality that understood handshaking qualities, dazzling rhetoric, and slick eloquence as signs of business qualification.Thus, when the loudest and most risk-taking specimens of the managerial species, elite colleges that encourage elbow mentality-driven, superficial behavior, occupy key positions, one or the other financial market collapse is no longer surprising. The flowers of this development on the example of today's America could seem bizarre if the consequences were not so serious. Thus, adjectives such as shy and quiet or just hints of a sly-boy mentality are dismissed as entirely negative and peculiar. Whether in school, work or private life, who does not understand playing on the highly sophisticated keyboard of interpersonal communication, quickly falls through the typical rust. Sensitive children, even as babies, are prone to intensified reactions to external stimuli, are more empathetic and need seeming timidity as a protective mechanism against a formally overwhelming universe. At the same time, individuals naturally endowed with a more robust psychic scaffolding sound lighthearted, but also more emotionless, to their surroundings.Parents of quieter, a manageable circle of friends their naming and lonely hobbies devoted children are remembered, not only subtle, the importance of popularity and dazzling charm. However, very peculiar that silent children are put under depression or misanthropic suspicion, while too vital, joyful young people are sedated with Ritalin. If the favors of loneliness have been well into adulthood, there is a wide range of seminars that can enhance eloquence, demeanor, and be talking skills to the point of sales genius. Several relationship problems are likely based on the well measurable differences between different natures, even by MRI. While extroverts can bathe in crowds every awaken minute and shy away from loneliness, the relationship is reversed by introverts. This involves interpersonal explosives in itself when the mantra of the attractive opposites once no longer pulls, and the supposed truce of the relationship beginning is over. Additional spontaneous emotional responses provoke the fact that extroverts interpret specific aggressive behavior as interest and attention while introverts feel injured and attacked. Assessing the damage caused to the economy by incorrectly designing work processes and their surroundings is difficult or even impossible. If one adds the increased disinclination of introverts in a loud open-plan atmosphere, including the wasted potential, because gifted thinkers find no peace to work out ideas and concepts undisturbed, the overall economic damage can be immense. The cultural differences show a contrarian approach of the Asians, where a European-American behavior style is considered a stupid waste of time for listeners. Tranquility and contemplation have a different meaning, superficiality and the glorification of narcissistic principles are considered less desirable. Another, quite thoughtful approach.Eine Lanze gebrochen für die Bedürfnisse der introvertierten MenschenansammlungsvermeiderOb man dem sanguinischen das phlegmatische Naturell entgegenstellt, dem wilden Draufgänger den nachdenklichen Tüftler oder schlicht der Introvertiertheit die Extrovertiertheit, das Temperament ist und bleibt zu bestimmten Anteilen maßgebend für einen Menschen. Die Autorin hat diesen Umstand mit einer unkonventionellen Herangehensweise neu beleuchtet und damit interessante und kritische Betrachtungswinkel eröffnet.So ändern sich die Zeiten. War es im 19 Jahrhundert noch gang und gäbe, bescheiden, demütig und unaufdringlich zu sein, begann, ausgehend von der Werbeindustrie, in den 1920er und 1930er Jahren, ein bis heute andauernder Lauf auf das ideelle Ziel der totalen Oberflächlichkeit. Anzeigen begannen mit der Angst der Menschen vor negativen Assoziationen ominöser, fremder Beobachter zu spielen und das Äußere sowie die Fähigkeit zu gefallen, immer mehr ins Rampenlicht zu rücken. Unterstützung fand die neue Religion des Narzissmus von einer Unternehmermentalität, die Handschlagqualitäten, blendende Rhetorik und aalglatte Eloquenz als Zeichen betriebswirtschaftlicher Qualifikation auffasste. Wenn auf diese Weise immer die lautesten und risikofreudigsten Exemplare der Managerspezies, von zu ellbogenmentalitätsgesteuerten, oberflächlichen Verhalten animierenden Elitehochschulen, Schlüsselpositionen besetzen, verwundert der eine oder andere Finanzmarktkollaps gar nicht mehr.Die Blüten dieser Entwicklung am Beispiel des heutigen Amerikas könnten skurril anmuten, wären die daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen nicht derart gravierend. So werden Adjektive wie schüchtern und ruhig oder nur Andeutungen einer Eigenbrötlermentalität als durchwegs negativ und absonderlich abgetan. Sei es in Schule, Beruf oder Privatleben, wer nicht versteht auf der hochkomplexen Klaviatur zwischenmenschlicher Kommunikation zu spielen, fällt leicht einmal durch den sozialen Rost.Sensible Kinder neigen schon als Babys zu verstärkten Reaktionen auf äußere Reize, sind einfühlsamer und benötigen die scheinbare Furchtsamkeit als Schutzmechanismus gegen ein sie mit Eindrücken förmlich erschlagendes Universum. Gleichzeitig wirken von Natur aus mit einem robusteren psychischen Gerüst ausgestattete Individuen unbeschwerter, aber auch emotionsloser auf ihre Umgebung. Eltern ruhiger, einen überschaubaren Freundeskreis ihr Eigen nennender und sich einsamen Hobbies widmender Kinder werden, nicht nur durch die Blume, an die Wichtigkeit von Beliebtheit und blendendem Charme erinnert. Doch sehr eigentümlich, dass stille Kinder unter Depressions- oder Misanthropiegeneralverdacht gestellt werden, während allzu vitale, lebensfrohe junge Menschen mit Ritalin sediert werden.Sollte sich die Favorisierung der Einsamkeit bis ins Erwachsenenalter durchgeschlagen haben, gibt es eine breite Palette an Seminarangeboten, die Beredsamkeit, Auftreten und Plauschkompetenzen bis hin zum Verkaufsgenie steigern können. Etliche Beziehungsprobleme dürften auf den, auch per MRT gut messbaren Unterschieden zwischen verschiedenen Naturellen basieren. Während Extrovertierte jede wache Minute in Menschenmengen baden könnten und Einsamkeit scheuen, kehrt sich das Verhältnis bei Introvertierten um. Das birgt zwischenmenschlichen Sprengstoff in sich, wenn das Mantra von den sich anziehenden Gegensätzen einmal nicht mehr richtig zieht und der vermeintliche Waffenstillstand des Beziehungsbeginns vorüber ist. Zusätzliche spontane emotionale Reaktionen provoziert die Tatsache, dass Extrovertierte bestimmtes, aggressives Verhalten als Interesse und Aufmerksamkeit interpretieren, während Introvertierte sich verletzt und angegriffen fühlen.Den für die Wirtschaft entstandenen Schaden durch falsche Konzeption von Arbeitsabläufen samt deren Umgebungen einzuschätzen mutet schwer bis unmöglich an. Wenn man die verstärkte Krankheitsneigung Introvertierter in lauter Großraumbüroatmosphäre inklusive dem verschwendeten Potential, weil begnadete Denker keine Ruhe finden, um Ideen und Konzepte ungestört ausarbeiten zu können, addiert, dürfte der gesamtvolkswirtschaftliche Schaden immens sein.Die kulturellen Unterschiede zeigen eine konträre Herangehensweise der Asiaten, bei denen ein europäisch-amerikanisches Gebaren als unhöfliche Verschwendung der Zeit von Zuhörern gewertet wird. Ruhe und Kontemplation haben eine andere Bedeutung, Oberflächlichkeit und die Verherrlichung narzisstischer Prinzipien gelten als wenig erstrebenswert. Ein anderer, durchaus in Erwägung zu ziehender Ansatz."

""Why shouldn't quiet be strong? And what else can quiet do that we don't give it credit for?""
Where has this book been all my life? Rarely have I felt so understood by a non-fiction book and rarely has a book made me feel that self-assured. Quiet is a book about introverts. The ones who enjoy and seek their own space, the ones who prefer working on their own, the ones who like to create but not self-promote. I have never questioned being an introvert. I will look forward to a day in solitude just as eagerly as next weekend's party and will make time to go for walks or read books just as I will for my friends. It's what I feel like doing and being alone is something I genuinely enjoy. And while being aware of that, for a long time I still kept wondering if what I was doing was strange, somehow wrong. People around me didn't seem to spend as much time in solitude, nor did they want to. Why was I different? Should I be putting more of an effort into changing?If these are questions you've asked, too, this book will make a lot of sense to you. Susan Cain has done thorough research and presents a perfect mixture of studies, explanations and anecdotes to show how introverts and extroverts just have different comfort zones - and how both is valid. The downside of being an introvert is that we live in a society that is dominated by extraverts. Cain puts it well:
""We all empathise with a sleep-deprived mate who comes home from work too tired to talk, but its hard to grasp that social overstimulation can be just as exhausting.""
I think introversion is often confused with general shyness, yet its not the same thing. Quiet does a good job at showing how there are shy extroverts and outgoing introverts. It's more about where you charge your batteries for energy - an introvert will need a break from socializing, while an extrovert will thrive in the company of others.
""Nor are introverts necessarily shy. Shyness is the fear of social disapproval or humiliation, while introversion is a preference for environments that are not overstimulating. Shyness is inherently painful, introversion is not.""
There's room for thought as well. Traditional school systems are mostly suited for extroverts: brainstorming, group exercises and active participation in class are not only advised, but mandatory to get good grades, yet it is worth considering that some people will do better working on their own and might struggle with being part of a class day after day. I consider this book a must-read for everybody who falls on the spectrum of introversion and even if you do not, Quiet can help you understand the third to half of the population that do."
61,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6278820-inge,4,"This book is just a tad more personal than a regular textbook, but the author clearly knows her stuff. It felt very reassuring to read, really comforting, that it's okay and perfectly natural to be an introvert and here are 50 studies to tell you why.I love this book and what it stands for."
62,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20790913-ammara-abid,4,"Relatable, very relatable, though I am not completely misanthropic. But I need this book. Informative, well researched & amazingly written."
63,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/841949-tracey,4,"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking kicks off with the tale of Rosa Parks. The author imagined – and maybe I did too – that Miss Parks was a stately woman with a bold personality who could stand off against a bus full of people, an irate driver, and the police, and win – but she wasn't. She was small, and quiet, and tired, and simply refused – quietly – on that particular evening to comply with a stupid rule. And the author asks ""How could you be shy and courageous?"" This surprised me. Aren't the shy inherently courageous? What extroverts do without thinking – from asking questions in meetings or class to going to parties – introverts see as hurdles to be got over. Extroverts have to be brave in extraordinary circumstances. The shy have to be brave every damn day.This sets the stage for the book. I learned quite a lot, but questioned some of the conclusions and directions the author went with, and in the end I can't say I feel the power the subtitle mentions. It's possible, and I see how – but it's a hard row to hoe, and all the other metaphors in ""Hard Knock Life"".I should say, before I begin to maunder and meander about the book, that Kathe Mazur does a lovely job of the reading. She maintains a mostly neutral tone, so that her voice merges with the work; she disappears into the narration, for the most part. I'm curious about how her style would work with fiction; with non-fiction it's perfect.I scored 19 out of 20 in the evaluation quiz in this book's first chapter; my only diversion from pure introversion (sorry 'bout that) is that I do like to multitask. I don't like to just watch tv – I'll be on the computer at the same time, or sewing, or something, anything. I hate driving with just the radio on now – if I don't have an audiobook in my ear I feel like I'm wasting valuable time. But even this might be a result of living in an extroverted world; I've had to learn how to multitask in my jobs, and it's sloshed over into life. Being an introvert (with the addition of shyness, which, I find, is not the same thing – just shoot me now) … For me, that means that almost every morning when it came time to go to school I would feel sick. I had a ridiculously high absentee rate, because in general school was hell for me. I liked the classes, loved the way the world opened up a little every day, even kind of liked homework sometimes. But being expected to participate, being called on whether or not I raised my hand, having to participate in the group projects and readings-aloud and other torments teachers love to devise … Having to cope with my classmates, even those I considered friends… When I was in my mid teens I saw Dead Poets Society for the first time, and I was shattered. I was, I am Todd Anderson (only with much better parents). The wonderful, fictional Mr. Keating recognized Todd's limits, and knew how to move him past them. I never met the teacher who cared to do that – I never had a Mr. Keating, or even a Neil. (If you don't know what I'm talking about go watch the movie. Yawp.)In elementary school, in high school, in art school, had I been outspoken, had I been outgoing, had I at least been able to speak up and say ""Oy! Over here!"" – things might have been different. I wasn't able. Knowing that without a drastically different setting things I couldn't have been able – that alone made this a worthwhile read. ""At school you might have been prodded to come 'out of your shell'—that noxious expression which fails to appreciate that some animals naturally carry shelter"". Well, yeah. And prying a snail out of its shell will have disastrous results for the snail.And then there's work. The same thought processes go on in the average manager's minds as in the average teacher's: reward the ones who successfully walk the line between conformism and aggression, and pay attention to the ones who make you pay attention. Three words: ""Team-building exercises""… the mere phrase makes me queasy. Why don't managers realize that the reason these things build camaraderie is because it unites everyone in their absolute loathing of the moronic and grating waste of time that they are? How does anyone think they're a good thing? Or, at least, that they're a good thing for everyone?There is a section of the book which focuses on the Harvard Business School, and everything this author says about the school makes exquisite sense in terms of W's attendance there. For me, for introverts in general and those poor buggers who matriculate their introversion, it's another circle of hell. The title of an article from the HSB newspaper is quoted: ""Arrogant, or Simply Confident?"" Er. If you have to ask … Heh. If you have to ask, you might be an introvert.A bit of an aside, from this section: ""'It is approximately 2:30 PM, October 5th,' the students are told, 'and you have just crash-landed in a float place on the east shore of Laura Lake, in the subarctic region of the northern Quebec-Newfoundland border.' Um … huh? Newfoundland is an island, and so doesn't exactly share a border with any province; Quebec borders the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Also, this furthers a stupid stereotype that Newfoundland is glacial and filled with walruses and igloos. It's really not. Perhaps they meant Labrador? Also, Google Maps shows the lake is something like 13 hours from the coast. What idiot wrote this scenario?Part of what helps make people successful, or perhaps simply a characteristic of successful people, is in their speech patterns. ""Verbal fluency and sociability are the two most important predictors of success, according to a Stanford Business School study."" Also, talking fast is seen as a good thing. Well, as the Mythbusters say, there's your problem. When I talk fast it's obviously nerves, not aggression or confidence. And, sadly, I'm one of those who waits for an opening to speak. I despise people who begin talking before I've finished a sentence – shockingly, customer service reps do it all the time; I've gotten into the habit of just finishing anyway. For me, it doesn't matter if the person I'm speaking to has just said something moronic (for instance, that Lake Laura is on the border of Newfoundland) or brilliant or anything in between that requires a response from me, I will wait for a pause before I interject. It's what I was brought up to call ""politeness"", and also ties into my own reserve. Apparently, what I see as basic manners is actually a hindrance to my success. Oh dear.I unfortunately did not make note of who said it, but here's a quote that's sending me (and this review) on another tangent: ""I'm sure Our Lord was [an extrovert]""… Really? How odd. I suppose every group tries to claim Jesus as one of their own, but I've never thought of Him as an extrovert. Charismatic, certainly; not shy, by any means; confident – well, sure, with God on His side… but extroverted? I really hesitate to class Christ in with some of the huckster evangelists making millions off his name.Okay. Anyway. Another quote:""Embarrassment reveals how much the individual cares about the rules that bind us to one another. … It's better to mind too much than to mind too little.""That's interesting. And it's true – the ones who are never embarrassed are the ones you have to be wary of. My sociopathic ex-boss was never embarrassed.

- Or waiting rooms ...
It suggests … that sensitive types think in an unusually complex fashion. It may also help explain why they're so bored by small talk. If you're thinking in more complicated ways … then talking about the weather, or where you went for the holidays, is not quite as interesting as talking about values or morality. The other thing Aaron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they are highly empathic. It's as if they have thinner boundaries, separating them from other people's emotions, and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and tv shows. They're acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior. In social settings they often focus on subjects like personal problems which others consider ""too heavy""….
And""The description of such characters as ""thin-skinned"" is meant metaphorically, but it turns out it is actually quite literal … skin conductance tests … High-reactive introverts sweat more.""Fabulous. Shoot me now. Yup, this book is all about me. (Except I love Criminal Minds, and when I spent a solid week a while back catching up on Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones I tended to walk away from my computer dazed at the enormous body count.)I've gone through my life saying – or at least thinking – Don't you see that? Don't you hear that? Well, now I know – they, whoever they are at any given moment, might not see or hear – or feel or understand – whatever it is I do. I've said elsewhere that my sociopathic ex-boss loved to refer to me on every possible occasion as the office's ""bleeding heart liberal"". And here I learn that that hasn't been entirely a choice with me. I am wired to cry at Hallmark commercials and well up when someone else – even a complete stranger on tv – cries.Yay. Bloody amygdala. Bloody pain in the arse amygdala.How nice – how calm and unstressful and unteary – it must be to function at a lower level of empathy and heart-bleeding.I loved the tidbits about the ""Griselda moods"" of Eleanor Roosevelt – ""named for a princess in a medieval legend who retreated into silence"". Rosa Parks and Eleanor Roosevelt – having two such standouts among ""my people"" makes it all seem a little less dreadful.I loved the example of ""The Bus to Abilene"": ""about a family sitting on a porch in Texas on a hot summer day and somebody says, 'I am bored. Why don't we go to Abilene?' When they get to Abilene, somebody says, 'You know, I didn't really want to go'. And the next person says, 'I didn't want to go – I thought you wanted to go' and so on…. The Bus to Abilene anecdote reveals our tendency to follow those who initiate an action – any action."" The ones who speak up control the actions of the rest – especially those of us who hesitate to express an opinion.This was a fascinating book; it was enlightening; it was clarifying. As I said at some point earlier, it is good in a way to know that, for the most part, I couldn't have handled a great many situations in my life very much differently. I’m wired to behave as I do. Also … knowing I'm not alone in this is, I suppose, also good. The introverts are the ones who don't network and make a splash, which means you can be in a room with ten introverts and two extroverts and it's the latter pair you – and the introverts – will remember later. Whereas each of those ten introverts will go away thinking they were the only ones who were uncomfortable and itching to get out. What a shame. If those ten introverts could get together, they might have a better time. Then again, getting together is antithetical to their nature, so … basically? The upshot? It sucks to be an introvert.On the whole, though, I'm not sure what reading this accomplishes. It's startling to read (listen to) a really damned accurate description of my own personality, and to learn that there have been scientific studies done on people exactly like me to find out why we are like me.It's nice to have confirmation that there are scientific reasons why to me the word ""party"" does not mean thisAnd that there are plenty of other people who feel the same way.I think I understand better now why some people love Bosch and death metal and bull fights, when I prefer Vermeer and Billy Joel and the Puppy Bowl.But I don't really need validation. I'm old. I've (finally) reached a point in my life where I know my limits, know when I can push them and when I'd be better off not, know how to fake it when I have no choice. ""Power""? In a world which disregards those who don't push themselves forward? No."

In terms of how well-argued and well-balanced it is, I might give it 3 or 4 stars. But from the standpoint of how much it helped me to be ok with myself, I'd give it close to 5 stars. This book sets out to defend the value of introversion from a culture that pushes extroversion as the ideal. It's not a dichotomy of hermits vs. partygoers. Rather, it's about how people have different optimal levels of external stimulation, with extroverts thriving at a level of stimulation that tends to wear out introverts, and introverts thriving in low-key situations that extroverts might find boring. It's a spectrum, though, and one of the surprising and valuable things I learned is that I'm not as extreme an introvert as I once thought. The book also points out that introversion and extroversion are not the only things that determine whether someone seems friendly or shy, because other factors (e.g., anxiety, acting, etc) can play a deciding role. The book begins with a fascinating history of how Americans came to be obsessed with winning friends and influencing people, and critiques this mentality with abundant evidence for why introversion is both natural and useful. I was surprised to learn that introversion can be pretty reliably predicted based on infant behavior, with highly-reactive infants likely to become introverted adults. I was equally surprised to learn that even birds and fish seem to have some version of extroverted and introverted individuals, with each type flourishing under different environmental conditions. I like the idea of different evolutionary niches for different personality types, which collectively help make the species more successful and robust. Needless to say, this still applies to humans no matter how many times we're told - by parents, teachers, bosses, and the media - that everyone should aspire to be vocal and gregarious and thick-skinned. Humanity needs sensitive, thoughtful, observant types just as much. A lot of the book is devoted to strategies for how introverts can make the best use of ""quiet power"", in the workplace and at home. A few of the highlights:- Introverts make good leaders for active workers.- Open office plans are the work of the devil (i.e., harmful, exhausting, and distracting) and should be avoided.- Everyone needs to find ""restorative niches"" during the day, which are situations where a person is able to recharge in their own way.- Introverts and extroverts obviously approach conflict differently. What's a sign of respect for an extrovert can be terrifying for an introvert. But by keeping in mind what the other person is feeling, a middle ground can be reached.But what I found most useful was the simple acknowledgment of introverted thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In social situations, I used to have a constant internal background chatter of self-loathing, but this book did a lot to counteract that. ""Ugh, why do you always sit in the corner at meetings and have so little to say? Because from here I can observe both the speaker and the audience, and the fact that I think about my words means that people actually pay attention when I say something."" ""Ugh, why can you never join big conversations at parties? Because I don't enjoy big conversations. And that's fine. I'm sure there's someone here with whom I can have a more in-depth one-on-one conversation. The loudest fastest voices don't always have the most interesting things to say.""It's not a perfect book, though. Its discussion/praise of non-Western cultures is a bit shallow, and I suspect correlation and causation were mixed up as a result. Also, I would have liked to see more exploration of the downsides of being an introvert, and how a person might handle those issues. It talks a lot about the fear of public speaking, which the author struggled with for a long time. While the book gives useful advice for how to deal with that (talk about things you're passionate about, prepare well, and treat it as a creative exercise), that's not the only (or even the biggest) internal struggle that an introvert is likely to have. Even so, this book had a positive impact on me. It left me happy that I'm an introvert; I like to listen and observe and imagine. It also left me happy that there are extroverts in my life, who bring people together and who prod me with emails, texts, and phone calls at times when I'm prone to vanish too deeply inside my own head.

65,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"Vindication for introverts everywhere!I enjoyed Quiet in much the same way that I enjoyed Kathryn Schulz’s Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error: both are broad, multidisciplinary studies that go deep into the psychology and physiology of why we are the way we are. Although Western culture values the “Extrovert Ideal” of people skills and self-promotion, Cain reveals that one out of every two or three Americans is an introvert (so much for the myth of universal American friendliness!). By nature introverts are thinkers who work slowly and deliberately and prefer to focus on one thing at a time; they enjoy deep discussions but not small talk.My favorite parts of the book tour those places where extroverted leadership is most expected – a Tony Robbins self-help seminar, Harvard Business School and an Evangelical megachurch. I found her discussion of introversion in relation to religion particularly astute. “I’m sure our Lord was [an extrovert]”, she heard one priest say.Cain traces the idolizing of extroverts to 1920s America, when what she calls the “Culture of Character” was replaced by a “Culture of Personality.” Gradually it began to seem that private behavior, discipline, and honor counted less than the impression one made in public. The rise of glamorous Hollywood stars, as well as the self-help gospel found in books like Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People (1936), fed into the charismatic personality cult that has required nearly all U.S. presidents (bar, perhaps, John Quincy Adams) to be extroverts. By contrast, many of the most successful CEOs (including Bill Gates) could be termed introverts.One of Cain’s recurring themes is that artists need solitude to do their best work. As Franz Kafka wrote (in a January 15, 1913 letter to Felice Bauer), “one can never be alone enough when one writes.” Independence can be conducive to creativity and allows time for “deliberate practice” – after all, experts estimate that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to achieve greatness in an artistic field. Cain also cites Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, a hybrid artist-scientist figure, who contends that “Artists work best alone.” Modern workplaces may prioritize teamwork and the benefits of open-plan working, but for introverts to get their finest work done, they must have time and space to concentrate on their own projects. Although Cain conveys a reassuring “I’m okay, you’re okay” message for introverts, backed up with plenty of strong evidence, at the same time she notes that there will always be occasions when introverts need to stretch themselves to achieve their goals. According to the “rubber band theory,” we can all choose to broaden our personalities – but only so much. Even shy people can fake extroversion to some extent; as Cain argues, “introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for the sake of work they consider important, people they love, or anything they value highly.”If introverts’ work requires them to challenge themselves significantly (by doing public speaking, for instance), they will need to find what Cain dubs “restorative niches” where they can withdraw to be themselves, whether that be a literal nook (a quiet, private office, if you are so lucky as to have one – even now women need Virginia Woolf’s proverbial ‘room of one’s own’), or more metaphorical solace in tasks like writing, reading, and researching. Acting ‘out of character’ for too long can cause an introvert to suffer stress and illness, so it is important to acknowledge one’s natural tendencies.Parts of the book are less interesting: Cain is not as good at describing scientific research, and her chapter on parenting introverts bored me. But in general I found it to be a fascinating and long-overdue exposé that should help many people to understand themselves, or their friends, family members and colleagues.(This formed part of a Bookkaholic article entitled ""Is Reading Selfish?"")"
66,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1876075-cara,5,"When I was in 5th grade my classmates and I had this activity we had to do. We all had paper plates taped onto our backs, and we had to go around the room and write positive things about each person on their paper plate. During the middle of the shuffle I remember distinctly that the teacher said not to only write words like nice, smart, and quiet and to try and be more creative with our word choices. I remember that once I took off my paper plate nice, smart, and quiet were the words mostly written on my paper plate. Even then I knew that for some reason that wasn't what you wanted. But why?I am sure a lot of introverts have hundreds of their own stories like this, and I could have told any other stories. Now I don't tell that story to show I was mistreated or that my life was just terrible (my life is in all accounts wonderful), but to show how deeply embedded extroversion is in our society, especially in the U.S. In the book Cain gives insight of why some people are introverts and what they have to offer the world. She backs this all up with loads of research and gives us some personal accounts, so we as the reader can connect the data to real people. There are so many interesting insights and things I feel I could even put into my own life. I appreciated that she never puts down our extroverts. We seriously need our ball-busters too!Granted, my view of this book was bound to be positive, and I would wager a lot of people who are avid readers are introverts, so it's no surprise this book has been so well received. But it is apparent how much time and care was put into this book. And every time I would think well.. what about x,y, or z? She would have an explanation at the ready. The real power in this book is that it empowers introverts not to feel shame for who they are. We need all kinds of people to help solve our world's problems ,and I know it sounds kind of hokey but it's so true. And that maybe being quiet isn't such a bad thing after all. Side note: I also loved the Ted Talk Cain gives as well. Twenty minutes well spent.Read for POPSUGAR challenge 2015: A nonfiction book"
67,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,4,"What? The word ""extrovert"" is layman's spelling for the real world ""extravert""? Just another ""extra"" you learn about the verts, for those of you a little green on the topic. Anyway, Susan ""Not Raisin'"" Cain's book has broad appeal as she uses examples from the business world, child psychology, education, law, etc. Introverts will like it more than extroverts (duh), but I guess the publishers were OK with that because introverts are 30-50% of the population.Anyway, there's a lot of science and especially psychology (notice I separate the two) here, so you'll learn the latest thinking on why you are the way you are. A lot of it has to do with the amygdala, which has been in the news a lot on the brain science front. By the time you're done reading, your limbic systems will be quite limber. Neo-cortex will be geared up, too. But you still will prefer weekends alone to booked weekends, reading books to dinner parties, and not answering the phone to running like an idiot to pick it up (well, assuming you have a land line and a corded phone like I still do, and that's probably one hell of an assumption).I like how Cain took trips to witness speakers, seminars, college courses, etc., for inclusion in this book. It gave it a ""You Are There!"" feel. She also interviewed some professors and psych gurus of note, too, none of whom I'd heard of (but, again, I'm a bit tone deaf in psychology). Granted, not all parts of the book are equally interesting, but you get that in any ""survey course-like"" book that covers a lot of real estate like this. My favorite section is the one comparing eastern cultures (lean strongly to quiet, studying, and introversion) to western ones (lean strongly to noise, socializing, and extroversion). Insightful stuff there, especially her interviews with Chinese-American high school students who feel like strangers in a strange land (cock an ear and listen to that obnoxious chant: ""USA! USA!"").My advice? If you're an introvert, read it and be quiet. And if you're an extrovert? The same, if your stimuli-seeking brain can hold it in that long...."
68,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/791419-teresa-raetz,1,"What a lost opportunity this book was for me. I am an extrovert who admires introverts. I'm reasonably sure I was raised by one and I married one. I agree with the basic premise of the book -- that the world is skewed toward extroverts and that introverted qualities are needed and even superior in some situations. It's just a shame that the author couldn't articulate those strengths without insulting extroversion at every turn. I lost count of how many times in the first 60 pages she refers to extroverts as ""loudmouths."" I also questioned whether she understands the concepts of extroversion and introversion because she spends an inordinate of time talking about lots of things that had me asking, ""What does this have to do with introversion?"" For example, throughout the book, Cain confuses introversion with shyness, even though she admits the research shows they are not the same. The author also rather dramatically misinterprets some important research to support her points. Oddly, she tells a long story about meeting the researcher (Jerome Kagan), somewhat admits that she is misappropriating his work, and then continues to do so. Finally, Cain paints a picture of extroversion that I simply don't recognize in myself or most others I know. For example, she spends a lot of time talking about how much we love and are good at public speaking. (Huh? Is she familiar with the studies where people commonly cite public speaking as more feared than death? Yes, she is. Does that matter? Apparently not.) To prove this point, she goes to a Tony Robbins motivational event that sounds, honestly, like a cult that would have me sprinting for the parking lot. I believe my exact words were, ""THAT'S what you think extroversion is and that's where you go to try to understand it?!?"" I could go on, but suffice to say I gave up the first time at 60 pages, at the encouragement of my husband who got tired of me talking to (OK, sometimes yelling at) my e-reader. I gave up again at page 122 for good. This book could have been so much more. What a disappointment."

Fortunately, I have read enough books in the ""self-help"" category to not do that; instead, it receives only two stars. This book overly simplifies the world into the Extroverts and the Introverts. This binary perspective of the world is then reinforced with anecdotes and speculations. It lacks depth, it is not scientifically sound, and it misleads. No person is one thing. Frequently, self-help books dwell into an overarching theory to explain human behaviour in order to demystify life and its rules. Yet, if you simply step back and review the historical fact that binary philosophies are incomplete and hide important details, you will quickly realize that this book also has the same flaw. It is not an uncommon form of writing though. This approach can be found in ""The Growth Mindset"" and ""Fascination"" in which the authors are again splitting the world into ""Growth Minded vs. Fixed Minded"" or ""Fascinating vs. Not Fascinating"". It simply does not work. If all I am saying is true, why are others giving it a high rating? Well, because it is written to make you feel good. You read it thinking ""Oh Wow! I'm an introvert, and according to this book introverts are fantastic! I love this book!"". Do not be mislead. Make sure you complete the picture by complementing the ideas presented in this book with psychology theories and business practices for a more pragmatic approach. "
70,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7425446-julie,3,"What can I say? Overall I liked this book as it confirmed what I already knew, that I’m a classic textbook introvert, and after all, who doesn’t appreciate reading something that makes you feel normal? So for that it was somewhat like comfort reading. Much of the book, however, I felt applied more to the working professionals and as a stay-at-home mom I found little I could relate to and therefore lost interest. I enjoyed the final chapters on relationships and child rearing tips as they resonated the most with me. I would have liked more elaboration on the personal stories and how extroverts and introverts can understand each other. The best thing to me about reading this book was the self-affirmation aspect but I think it would be a more worthwhile read for those around me to have a better understanding of what makes introverts tick."
71,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83052474-macy-novels-at-night,5,"Great book for the introvert to better understand themselves, but also great for those trying to understand the introverts in their life. To all those seeking to better understand themselves, such as I, it is OK to be yourself and navigate through this world not trying to change. We all feel like we need to be someone else at some point, or to improve who we are by changing. This book was a justification that we can be who we are and it is ok not to feel like changing is the only option. Be who you are and love it! There is no personality the same, and that is ok, we can learn to live with each other and just be ok! I also loved when she stated all of the education and work she had done just to figure out that it was not for her, and she is following her dreams. That is exactly where I am in my life and I needed to hear that. I am so happy she followed hers, and wrote this for us! "
72,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,1,"I normally try not to give books one star, but when I saw today that Goodreads users voted this the Nonfiction Book of the Year I decided that I should broadcast my contrarian opinion. I only hope that my shy, introverted voice doesn't get lost amid the noise of those windbag extroverts who won't shut up with their rave reviews. I finished the book several months ago and I can only recall the most glaring problems. Most notably, the book included this horrible passage: ""{Extroverts'} skin is literally 'thicker,' more impervious to stimuli, cooler to the touch."" This sentence literally ""made me vomit"" all over my paper-thin skin. Second, Cain's most demonstrative example of a self-actualized introvert is Rosa Parks. While I do not intend to trivialize the accomplishments of Rosa Parks, I think we introverts hope that we don't have to find ourselves in a move-to-the-back-of-the-bus situation before we can effectively utilize our special skill sets. What is the lesson here- that while an extrovert may become a CEO of a corporation, an introvert is likely to be the person repeatedly victimized by that corporation until other extroverts take note of the introvert's quiet dignity and start a movement to oust that CEO? If I am lucky, that introvert could be me! While this book might be of use to parents trying to figure out what is wrong with their weirdo kid, it actually made me a little bit ashamed of myself. Reading it was the like receiving a Certificate of Participation in the game of life. Sure, I might be more thoughtful than other people, but no one is going to listen. "
73,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3963686-james,2,"For a book that's about introverts, by an introvert and for introverts, it sure does go on about extroverts. As an introvert, I wanted to read a book about how introverts can survive in an extrovert world. But more than half the book is given over to explaining why extroverts are favoured in school, business, sport, mating, society and the world at large. The scientific research is interesting but intermixed with the most baffling claptrap that seems to be symptomatic of 'turns out' journalism. The book opens with Rosa Parks and closes with Charlie Brown. Much of it read like it had come from the same cookie-cutter mould as any number of American self-help books. I even started to check off the usual suspects in my head. For example let's:- Address the audience as America, talk about America as if it's the world and America is the sole subject of the book. Because we Americans as Americans must America, America, America.- Cite Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat on a bus as the bravery of one person acting alone (Rosa Parks was a remarkable woman but this version of events is wildly historically inaccurate)- Quip that the apple wouldn't have fallen on Isaac Newton's head, if he wasn't an introvert, as he wouldn't have been sitting under the tree (this story is apocryphal and the apple incident never happened)- Talk about characters from the bible as though they're actual historical figures - Use unscientific case studies and composite examples of 'real people' as universal proof- Throw in anecdotes about American presidents, business men and celebrities - Use the phrase 'It turns out' repeatedly to introduce whatever whacky notions we've decided to assertMaybe I'm just sick to the back-teeth of reading American self-help books. But the further into the book I got the more my heart sank as I realised it contained little of practical use to introverts. There's a chapter on how to raise introverted kids, and a lot of lip-service paid to the unique qualities of introverts, but very few survival strategies and almost no advice on how to make the best use of your introverted nature. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert and introverts shouldn't have to pretend to be more like extroverts to get on in the world. This book is important insofar as it gets people talking about introversion at all. But if you're an introvert it's probably of more use to the extrovert in your life than to you — unless you beat them over the head with it to get them to be quiet whilst you read.You can buy the book here.

74,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6051061-t-d-whittle,5,"I love this book. If you are an introvert, I suspect you will love it too. Cain is reassuring if you have ever felt worried or guilty about your tendency to prefer your own company―along with your books and your cat―to that of others. Have you ever found yourself saying something like this to your significant other? ""No, it's not that I don't like X and Y. I quite like them. I just need to be alone this evening (all winter, actually), except for you. And the cat. Anyway, we did a social thing already this week."" I should just write that on a sticky note and tape it on my forehead. Fortunately, my husband and I are both introverts, so he understands me. But he is still more social than I am, almost always. I think I burnt myself out socially living in large, densely populated cities for so much of my life and then spending years as a therapist.Susan Cain has chosen excellent topics to explore, and she is engaging and eloquent. I found her easy to connect with. I think it helps that she is an introvert herself (an insider, so to speak). I know a lot about this topic already, but I had never thought about the deep sociological effects of introversion vs. extroversion: how introversion, when compared to extroversion, came to be seen as a pathology rather than a difference. The history of extroversion's takeover in the U.S. and its impact on all areas of public and private life, from religious practices, academia, the workplace, and community, to relationships in our private lives and how we view ourselves, makes for very interesting reading.Highly recommended for fellow introverts and the extroverts who love them."
75,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6476980-rebecka,2,"Ugh. Finally, this is over. I'm happy to announce that the last 20% of the book consist of notes, because even without those extra 20%, it was still too long. In the beginning, I was very positive about this book. There were quite some interesting facts to start with, lots of ""oh, really?""'s and so on. Then the author's voice started to get to me.This is a non-fiction book. There is no need whatsoever for detailed descriptions featuring way too many adjectives of each and every person mentioned. The ""shy"", and ""passionate"" and ""frail"" and ""freckled"" people who populate this book, ""Greg"" and ""Mary"" and ""Susan"" and AAAAAH can't they just be ""Subject A"", ""Subject B"" and while we're at it, can we please stick to the facts? Can we drop the cozy let's-get-to-know-these-people atmosphere and just get rid of perhaps 50 pages of unnecessary filling material?Already at perhaps 25% I was getting pretty fed up with reading about how introverts ""cherish"" (GHGHGH) ""deep"" and ""thoughtful conversations"". How they need to ""unwind"" and ""let go of all that tension"" and a million other annoying euphemisms. What about us introverts who just like some goddamned quiet, few but shallow conversations and who can't hide our contempt in the face of ""heartfelt conversations""? We're feeling pretty left out here. Still, if you can stand all the annoying blabbering, there are some interesting pieces of information in this book. One thing actually surprised me, notably that extroverts are better at analyzing social situations and estimating the mood etc. of their conversation partners as they are part of a conversation. Based on my experience, I would have thought it was the other way around. I get the impression extroverts are often oblivious to social cues! Another good thing to know is that brainstorming doesn't work and people are more creative if they are left to think on their own. That part of the book, with insights into how corporate leaders are using really shitty theories as a foundation for how their personnel is coordinated, was interesting.Of course, it's also praiseworthy how the author criticizes modern schools for their insistence on constantly making people talk and work in groups, but that particular chapter more or less made me furious because of the style it was written in, i.e. the ""how to make your introvert child bloom"" part that I, ehem, may have skimmed through...So, all in all, this was a sometimes interesting - but mostly just really annoying - book that was, at times, giving off way too many self-help vibes."
76,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27613955-ashley-reid,4,"This was a great book. I think more people should read it. I will be recommending it to people in my family, especially the ones who think being an introvert is somehow stopping them from living up to their potential.This was also good for helping me understand my own introversion, and showing me that it's okay to be an introvert, it's just others that need to understand it more."
77,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5355311-quirkyreader,4,This was a rather intriguing book about the “introvert personality”. I put that phrase in quotes because I lean more towards being an introvert but my autism sometimes erases that. So I look at this book with a different perspective.
78,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"Hmmm...is it any wonder this book is so popular on goodreads?We goodreaders' common interest in -- obsession with -- reading suggests that a disproportionate number of us are introverts. But less obviously, although goodreads is technically a social network, according to this book introverts apparently prefer socializing online to partying in real life and are more comfortable expressing themselves in writing than in verbal conversation. Therefore, many active social network participants are actually introverts. So that's a more cynical hypothesis about why this book got such a high goodreads rating, but I don't think it's the only explanation. The book is well-written and provocative, with a wide-ranging discussion about the American extrovert ideal and how that can be a poor fit for introverts. When I think back to different mishaps and misunderstandings I suffered in the workplace which I attributed at the time to my own limitations, it didn't occur to me to consider the possibility that I was an introvert being held to an extrovert ideal. It was interesting to learn about the creative ways introverts find to contribute professionally without sacrificing their personality needs.The ramifications of the extrovert ideal for introverts though, go beyond the professional. Your conflicts with your spouse and/or issues with your child may be a function of introversion/extroversion misunderstandings. An extroverted friend or loved one can think it's okay to blow off steam by yelling; a highly sensitive introvert recipient can take the yelling far more personally than is warranted. And so on.Like many good non-fiction books, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking occasionally felt repetitive and longwinded and my audiobook ADD kicked in at times. Having said that, this was very enjoyable overall. While personal relevance was definitely a factor, I found the book generally entertaining and interesting. Highly recommended."

It explains the differences between the two basic types of personalities and how to fit each in to better our lives. Have you heard or said ""Come out of your shell"" "" You're too sensitive"" "" You need to overcome your shyness"" ""You'll never make it if you don't stand out"" ? I did and it stung.How can I not love a book that makes me feel better about myself ? I have spent much of my life fighting to overcome my ""shyness"" or my uninterested feeling towards parties. In high school I was labeled a loner, even though I was on swim team, surfed, sailed, and skated around town all the time. I was active, outgoing adventurous but not socially needy. In college I just wanted to study the courses alone in the library the classroom was stifling to me, and study groups, oh no never. As an adult and parent, I've learned to play the extrovert but the stress is headache worthy.I am the mother of two adult introverts and one extrovert. I worried when they didn't want to go to group events. I know, bad mom. I have tried to get them to be more like society expected. I placed them in social situations that were difficult because I was told they needed it. I wish I had read this book years earlier, I understand it now. Luckily they stayed true to themselves and I gave up fighting.While reading this I was amazed at the awesomeness of introverts. We are so underrated and unappreciated by society. Ms. Cain goes into detail of the positive attributes and contributions introverts and extroverts bring to the table of life. She offers steps of adaptability without losing who someone is. The steps are so easy, so comfortable. I bought this on audio I'm purchasing the printed version so I can highlight"

Instead, I made it through about 85 pages of specious generalizations, poorly defined terms, and a suspect premise. The fact that extroverts tend to dominate human societies is nothing new - certainly not sufficiently novel to justify this ""self-empowering"" guide to introverts who want (presumably) to reap the social benefits of extroversion. That the author works as a life coach for dissatisfied introverts in the business and academic worlds should have been a dead giveaway, but I read this on the recommendation of a friend, and failed to exercise due diligence. Frankly, I think most introverts (such as myself) will find this book unbearably condescending, and drop it like a hot rock."

The book, however, started going all over the place. It is 1100 pages long and only needed to be about 300. Too bad, as this is such an interesting topic.Update: 1/30/15. Of the joys of a new Kindle...showing me I had read 1100 pages! No, this book is 352 pages. How about if I say the 352 pages felt like 1100!"
82,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22308947-dimitri,5,Think before you speak. Read before you think. You can't be an introvert and not give this five stars.
83,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7198893-jonathan-karmel,3,"There were a couple of things in this book that rang true to me. According to this book, introversion is a “fixed trait,” but introverts can benefit from “self-monitoring” and putting on an extroverted persona to achieve personal goals that are important. It’s also helpful for introverts to create “restorative niches,” periods of time when they can be alone and “recharge their batteries” by doing something of interest by themselves.In relationships, an introvert may speak quietly and unemotionally during an argument, because of a psychological need to avoid conflict, and the person the introvert is arguing with may think the introvert is “checking out.” Likewise, an introvert may have trouble dealing with a partner who expresses anger and frustration in a highly emotional manner. It’s helpful to be aware of these different styles of communication.Overall, however, as an introverted, Jewish, lawyer from the Hudson Valley who went to an Ivy League college, I was surprised that I mostly couldn’t relate to this book at all. Since this book has received a lot of good publicity, I thought it would contain a lot of insightful information about the way introverts experience life in a culture that idealizes extroversion. Instead, I found the book to be more of a memoir of one particular introvert - the author – whose experience I don’t think reflects that of introverts in general.At the very end of the book, after the chapter titled “Conclusion,” there is a three page “note” on the words “introvert” and “extrovert,” in which the author explains that she’s not using the word in the way “contemporary personality psychologists” use the word. Referring to the “Big Five” personality traits, she states that her use of the word “introvert” includes not only introversion, but also “openness to experience,” “conscientiousness” and “neuroticism.” She (sort of) admits that there is no scientific basis for correlating introversion with these other three personality traits, but then she states that there’s a basis in literature for the generalization that introverted people also fall on the “sensitive/nervous” side of neuroticism, not on the “secure/confident side.” Then she makes reference to the ancient and completely discredited theory that there are four “temperaments,” and she suggests that this book was about people who are melancholic and phlegmatic, not sanguine and choleric.Putting aside the fact that even under the four temperament theory, I don’t think it’s the case that melancholic people were considered more likely to be phlegmatic, I found that overall, the theories in this book were just based on the subjective experience of the author and had no scientific validity. Personally, I could relate more to a book about introverts who fall on the secure/confident side of neuroticism. The four parts of the book create a coherent shell (Part 1: The Extrovert Ideal; Part 2: Your Biology, Your Self?; Part 3: Do All Cultures Have an Extrovert Ideal?; Part 4: How to Love, How to Work). But within that shell, I found the information to be poorly organized. The author has obviously read voluminously on the topic, but the book appeared to me to just be a compilation of her notes presented in somewhat of a haphazard manner.What exactly is the author’s thesis? Our country idealizes Jack Welch more than Bill Gates, Ted Turner more than Warren Buffet, Franklin Roosevelt more than Abraham Lincoln – really, how so? Introversion has a biological basis (the amygdala of an introvert is different). On the other hand, Americans valued introversion more during the Age of Character, but began to value extroversion more during the Age of Personality that emerged in the 20th Century. “High-reactive” or “sensitive” types tend to be introverted. Yet Asian-Americans as a whole value introversion more than non-Asian-Americans according to this book. I know the titles of Parts 2 and 3 of the book are phrased as questions, but what are the authors answers to these questions? They seem to be all over the place. In the chapter subtitled “Why Cool is Overrated,” the author describes her experience at a gathering for “highly sensitive people” in California. Although she enjoyed the experience, she concludes: “there is such a deficit of the social behavior we call ‘cool’ that I began thinking someone should be cracking jokes, stirring things up, handing out rum-and-Cokes. Shouldn’t they? . . . I’m glad for the ‘cool’ among us, and I miss them this weekend. I’m starting to speak so softly that I feel like I’m putting myself to sleep.” With empowered introverts like these, who needs marginalized introverts?The suggestion that advocating for the power of introverts is somehow comparable to the civil rights struggles of introvert-Rosa Parks or introvert-supporter-of-Marion-Anderson-Eleanor Roosevelt is just silly. Introverts may be annoyed by the profusion of loud televisions at gyms, airports, doctor’s waiting rooms, elevators, etc., but I think it’s quite a stretch to suggest that introverts are being discriminated against. The book states that introverts get better grades in school and states repeatedly that one-third to one-half of all people are introverts. Is it really possible that we live in an “extroverted world”?In my opinion, this book is just an amalgam of second-hand knowledge about stuff related to introversion (some of it only vaguely related, such as the habits of fruit flies). The author’s theories are supported more by cherry-picked anecdotes than scientific evidence. I think a book written by an actual psychologist – perhaps even an analytical psychologist – might have a more insightful theory about introversion.There are many things this book could have discussed but did not. For example, if our educational system makes class participation part of a student’s grade, how should class participation be measured in a way that would not favor extroverts? How exactly can introverts use written communication via the internet to harness their power in ways that are not possible using only local, face-to-face communication? How can we re-design waiting areas to ensure that there is a quiet, well-lit space where people can read or do some other activity that requires concentration, without being bombarded by unwanted sensory stimuli?Finally, I found this book to be very culturally specific to well-off people from industrialized countries. I doubt this book would have much relevance to most people. I guess the word “world” in the subtitle is just meant to refer to the “world” of the author."

You know the type: those perky people who take the podium and say things like ""Before we start, shake hands with and greet at least three people you don't know."" Arrrrrggggh. Like it's not already taking every ounce of energy I have to sit here in a room full of a hundred strangers.Cain confirms with data from various studies what I've observed time and again: In group/committee situations, those who speak with assertiveness and eloquence get their ideas implemented. Those who aren't so bold or persuasive are largely ignored, even if their ideas are demonstrably better than those of the loudmou--- er, extroverts.Cain also discloses that Harvard Business School teaches its students to speak with absolute conviction, even if they're only 55% sure they're correct. I would recommend this book for everyone, but I can't imagine most extroverts bothering, since the U.S. is already set up to cater to them. So I'll recommend it for the introverts, who could likely use the pep talk it delivers."
85,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,5,"  “Persistence isn’t very glamorous. If genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration, then as a culture we tend to lionize the one percent. We love its flash and dazzle. But great power lies in the other ninety-nine percent”  Wow. Can I just say this book has changed my life!?  This book was freaking phenomenal. It was enlightening and helped me understand myself better in myriad ways.  Just like a lot of other people, I watched Susan Cain's TED talk about the power of introverts and what she said during the presentation really spoke to me. I am, without a doubt, the classic introvert. For as long as I can remember, I always felt very isolated from the rest of my peers. In high school, I never recognized that my distaste for small talk and parties was linked to an innate part of my being. I prefer to spend the vast majority of my time alone. I am perfectly content with spending my day reading, writing, and studying. When I took the MBTI, I was like 90% introverted. Was I surprised? Nope. Still, despite being an introvert, I need to socialize with others, BUT when I do engage in a conversation, I want it to be a highly stimulating and deep topic. It is only after I get to know a person on a deeper level that I can enjoy having small talk with them. I understand most people on Goodreads are introverted themselves, and probably empathize with the confusion I felt for most of my life. It was not until I graduated high school that I understood why I am the way I am. Taking courses related to personality psychology helped me connect the dots about why I interact with my environment the way that I do. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is an informative book. Although it is filled with personal anecdotes, most of the book features different case studies and research projects that have been conducted to understand human behavior. Although I enjoy reading memoirs and biographies, most of the non-fiction readings I do are for school, so getting into this book was a bit challenging, but once I became used to the writing style I did not want to put this book down. I learned a great deal about myself, as well as how I can interact with others who have a different personality type than mine. The terms ""introvert"" and ""extrovert"" in this book are told from a cultural perspective. People who identify themselves as soft-spoken, deep, quiet and so forth, will find themselves identifying with the introvert personality type whereas people who believe they are vivacious, outgoing and so forth will identify with being an extrovert.  In essence, Susan Cain is comparing and contrasting the paradigm of the man who acts and the man who contemplates.  But the author acknowledges that personality psychologists believe that some of the characteristics that are identified in this book are not part of the introvert/extrovert spectrum, but rather within the categories of ""openness to new experiences"" and ""neuroticism"".In this book, Susan Cain presents us with people throughout history like Rosa Parks, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Mahatma Gandhi  who were quiet, but formidable and persistent when driven by a good cause.  Despite these great influencers, in the West, we continue to believe introvert and fortitude are antonyms. But why? And where did this notion come from? Cain answers these questions in the book. Something that I found fascinating was all the biological mechanisms at play that influence our temperament. I always assumed I was introverted as a result of my upbringing and South Asian cultural background. However, I learned that introvert brains work differently than extrovert brains, and this is crucial for us to understand. No matter where we fall on the spectrum, we have a balance of personalities in our society for a reason. There are positive qualities to both, but often being an introvert is stigmatized - especially in Western culture. I also realized the advantages of being an introvert because I always viewed my true nature as a drawback. In the book, Cain states that academia is full of introverts and it is not because one temperament type is smarter than the other. Introverts and extroverts have the same IQ results more or less. However, what sets introverts apart is our ability to engage in deliberate practice and flow. We can spend a lot of time in solitude while delaying gratification - an essential quality for any type of academic success. And since we do not crave as much social stimulation, we can spend more hours on studying because everybody only gets 24 hours in a day and how we use those hours can sometimes be linked to our temperaments. But I walk away from this book with a greater understanding of who I am as a person, and how I can still succeed despite having a soft-spoken demeanor. I guess the reason why I found this book to be life-changing is because I often felt isolated. When I first started university, I despised the small talk during orientation week and I just wanted to run back to my dorm, read books and face time with a close friend. I always knew what introversion and extroversion meant, but this book contained so much profound information that it helped me make sense of who I am. I recommend this book for those who are introverted themselves or are close to an introvert and looking for ways to support them. It will enable introverts and extroverts to understand how they can use their temperament to their advantage. There are always many paths to a fulfilling life :) I wanted to end this review with a quote I found in the book by Kafka that I loved!  “You said that you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess; the utmost of self-revelation and surrender, in which a human being, when involved with others, would feel he was losing himself, and from which, therefore, he will always shrink as long as he is in his right mind.... That is why one can never be alone enough when one writes, why there can never be enough silence around one when one writes, why even night is not night enough”  "
86,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5706631-mj,4,"Quiet could easily have been a doctoral dissertation. It is that well researched and uses a wide and diverse variety of sources. It is cross-referenced throughout and a real bonus is its extensive resource summary for future reading and exploration. The good news is that it is not a dry, academic paper. It is a well written, lively read. Susan Cain has apparently wanted to be a writer since she was four but at first detoured to train and practise as a corporate lawyer, specializing in negotiation. She admits that if she couldn’t be a writer she would choose to be a psychology researcher and is fascinated by human nature. The book, seven years in the making, definitely demonstrates her research capability. It is the backbone of the book along with Cain’s obvious passion for her subject matter.The book is easy to read and filled with real people and real life examples who bring the topic to life. The writing is always thoughtful and thought provoking, sometimes kind or humourous and often fierce. You can tell that Cain strongly believes that introverts have been given a raw deal, are undervalued and have much to offer the world.Cain makes a strong case illustrating that the current North American culture in particular is skewed heavily in favour of accommodation, influence and success for extraverts. (Did you catch that? A light bulb flash moment for me - you can even spell it “extra” vert rather than “extro” vert if you wish. Now how “extra” special and skewed is that, especially considering how powerful words are?) The book explores the differences between extroverts and introverts - primarily differences in how much stimulation their true nature requires to be at its best or optimum level of being and doing. Cain documents the strengths of introverts and the type of activities they are especially good at.Anyone who reads this book will better understand a large percentage of people in the world; either one out of every three people or one out of every two people, depending on how recent a study you use. Either way, introverts make up a large part of the world. That in and of itself, suggests they should be included not discounted and encouraged to continue with their valuable contributions. Interestingly enough there are introverts and extroverts in the animal and insect kingdoms as well and the culture of many countries can also be categorized using the same introvert and extrovert differentiation. Parents, teachers, coaches, bosses, partners, co-workers, friends, political and business leaders and anyone who is in contact with introverts in their daily lives (pretty much the whole world) should read this book. Reading by the way is a very introverted undertaking – going within, for quiet stimulation to refuel rather than looking outside for stronger, more active stimulation to get recharged. The writing in Quiet is excellent and flowed very easily. In addition to solid informative research, it was a very enjoyable read brought to life with numerous anecdotes and stories. Basically, Quiet is a celebration of introversion. Anyone growing up or grown up, who heard themselves described as an introvert or who prefers the company of one or two close friends rather than large, social groups of friends, or who likes in depth conversations one on one or with a few people rather than group chit chats with many people interjecting, will see themselves in this book and celebrate. Anyone who doesn’t fit into the introversion category, based on the odds, knows someone and probably an important someone someone who would be categorized as an introvert. For this reason alone, Quiet is worth reading for insight into such important people in your life. I’d recommend that you make some quiet time for yourself and read Quiet – Goodreads Choice Award for Best Nonfiction for 2012."
87,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"An old Robert Benchley joke says ""There are two kinds of people in the world: those who divide the world into two kinds of people, and those who don't."" The author belongs to the former. Dividing everyone into just two types leads to oversimplifications and stereotypes that muddle things as much as they clarify. This book was supposedly based on years of research synthesizing all that is known on the issue. Instead, it is written in a chit-chatty style with many anecdotes from the author (""Let me tell you about when I went to see Tony Robbins!""). The scientifical bits are self-contradictory and over-reaching (Introverts are often blue-eyed and Asians are generally Introverts). ""Quiet"" can serve as an entertaining superficial introduction to personality types if you are unfamiliar with the topic. Otherwise, books like ""Please Understand Me"" or ""Do What You Are"" for jobs or ""Nurture by Nature"" for parenting, have been out for a long time and are more complete and useful.

An excellent book, providing informative research and giving profound advices to parents, teachers, and introverts themselves. A must read book for those who are interested in psychology."
89,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845928-owen,4,"If you've ever been called or thought of yourself as introverted, quiet, sensitive, shy, aloof, antisocial, ... the list goes on—then you owe it to yourself to read this book. It has flaws—it crams in an awful lot of material and doesn't always make interrelations clear—but it's the best book I've read yet for understanding how I'm different from most people and what I—and they—can do about it.The validation starts early, on page 4: ""Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man's world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are."" Cain doesn't harp on the incongruity that women are a majority, unlike introverts, but this tossed-off analogy gave me a new perspective on feminism and male privilege, as well as the extra challenge of being a male with this ""female"" trait.I was a very early reader of Elaine Aron's book The Highly Sensitive Person—I was at what must've been her second reading, in Palo Alto, and then took a seminar with her in SF—and that book really helped me understand myself at the time. But it also provided a too-attractive label for others to interact with rather than actually dealing with the real person. In Quiet, Cain talks a lot about Aron's ideas—HSP is another trait that overlaps with introversion etc.—but she starts from Jerome Kagan's original label of ""high reactivity."" Aron probably does too, but if I'd lost that term over the last 15 years. And it's useful in how it clarifies the relation between the individual and the world: it's not just the individual's susceptibility but the world's insistence, and it's not just feelings but any new sensation. ""What we're really observing is a child's sensitivity to novelty in general, not just to people"" (102). Knowing that I react easily to stimulation is very different from knowing that I am sensitive. (Other labels for the same trait include ""negativity"" and ""inhibition,"" but I doubt I have to explain how deforming and disabling they are.)Reading Quiet prompted a gillion other ""duh!"" moments. For instance, ""An audience may be rousing, but it's also stressful"" (90): How rarely do we hear that acknowledged? How often is it assumed all an artist wants is an audience? Or the fact (152) that HSPs enjoy small talk only after they've established a deep connection with someone; for us, it's not a relaxing way to ease into things, it's a frustrating waste of time playing a (difficult, deceptive, meaningless) social role. Or the very simple observation that ""participation [in social exchange] places a very different set of demands on the brain than observing does"" (237). In other words, I am not weird for not liking large-group discussions, where in addition to thinking of what I have to say I have to pay attention to what everyone else is saying at the same time and how they're reacting to what they hear etc etc; nor for not liking the phone, where I get no non-verbal cues whatsoever yet have to participate in real time.Other new insights:—p. 81: ""Deliberate Practice is best conducted alone"": This is a necessary corrective to the impression left by Malcolm Gladwell and his ""10,000 hours"" theory (which actually isn't his, apparently—another false impression he's happy to reap the benefit of). The simple fact is that Deliberate Practice cannot work in groups; only you can determine the challenge most compelling to you.—p. 142: Low reactivity (as opposed to high reactivity/sensitivity/etc.) generally correlates with people whose skin remains cool. So the ""cool"" people really are! And it makes sense that I am both easily embarrassed (and I blush) and occasionally a ""hot head"" with anger about some minor circumstance. Embarrassment, by the way, is ""a moral emotion"" (144): it means you care about what other people think. Think about it: the most common opposite of ""easily embarrassed"" is probably ""shameless,"" and that's definitely not a compliment.—p. 212-5: The whole concept of low and high self-monitors, which is not the same as extroversion/introversion but overlaps as a tool for categorizing and stereotyping people. Low self-monitors like me, who don't pay attention to how we're seen by others (except when forced by an extreme, i.e. angering or embarrassing, situation), dislike charades, improv, arguing for a position not our own, adapting our behavior or opinions to situations or people. High self-monitors are better liars. Shameless liars?—p. 231: ""Introverts like people they meet in friendly contexts; extroverts prefer those they compete with."" In other words, extroverts take your resistance as a sign of engagement. This is how bullies think. Bullying, at its core, may just be an extreme or misguided extroversion—and that's why our extrovert-dominated society has trouble seeing and stopping it.In later chapters, Cain discusses how those of us addressed by her book, whatever the label, can adapt to a world—or at least a dominant culture—that tends to see us as somehow or other defective. Play to your strengths, she says, work against your type for things that matter to you—but for once she acknowledges that ""It's not always so easy, it turns out, to identify your core personal projects. And it can be especially tough for introverts, who have spent so much of their lives conforming to extroverted norms that by the time they choose a career, or a calling, it feels perfectly normal to ignore their own preferences"" (217). Yes! For some of us, being told as a child ""You can be anything you want!"" has been more of a curse than an invitation.Quiet is organized to be read, not for ongoing reference. It's essentially journalism, not a single focused argument, not a how-to guide, definitely not original scientific research. Reading it gave me lots of things to think and learn more about, but I'll go to other sources. Still, I've been reading about myself in various forms for decades and I've never felt as many moments of recognition."

Quiet : The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking (Audio) by Susan Cain, read by Kathe Mazur2012, 10:39 (352 pages in hardcover)listened Sep 2-14, Nov 1-2Rating: 2.5 stars 	The low rating is meant to express how annoyed I was. Disappointed really. Cain has a nice point for all of us introverts in the world. She makes an argument that we are overlooked, and under-appreciated because we are so quiet. The business world is basically ready to run over introverts and actively looks for and promotes the most extroverted extroverts (think Enron). The classroom, at least in the United States, encourages extroversion and discourages any signs of introversion. The world is against us. And yet, we play valuable roles throughout all levels of society and it is aspects of our introverted character that allows us to do that. This is an introvert's manifesto.The problem is that Cain is so smug about this and she really oversimplifies. She tells us story early on about a quiet lawyer who is finally placed in a lead role, and she excels. She was smart and she was better prepared and calmer and more thoughtful than the other people in the room. This introverted hero turns out to be autobiographic - Cain is Ms. Perfect. As the book carries on, the reader slowly realizes that Cain thinks all introverts are basically like her, and that all extroverts are basically shallow yapping idiots. She never comes out says it, and she always makes qualifying statements about extroverts, but also she never corrects the impression either. It’s there under the text as the background argument. It’s not only unfair to non-introverts, but actually very unfair to introverts too. We are not all so quietly perfect as she likes to think we are. As the book carried on, this bothered more and more.For me that overshadowed all the many very interesting parts to the book. Cain did a lot of research and presents a lot of interesting information. She talks a lot about introverted children (although I don’t have any. My are insanely extroverted. And, another bitter note, she spends a lot of time on the problem of extroverted parents with introverted children, but not a single sentence on the problem of introverted parents with extroverted children.)One of the most interesting factoids I pulled out of this book was the comparison of introverted and extroverted managers. Overly extroverted managers excel at motivating employees, but they get in the way of their better people and actually hold them back. Introverted managers struggle with unmotivated employees, but generally help their better people excel more. I’m not sure I agree with her analysis. She doesn’t bring up the possibility that introverts may simply stay out of the way more and let people be. But still, it’s interesting…and I can relate. There is a place for an introverts manifesto, but it doesn't require such an unbalanced take. There is a wide and interesting and useful psychology around introversion. I would have liked a more carefully balanced view."

She delves into the physiological and psychological make-up of introverts and extraverts in a Western society where the ‘Extrovert Ideal’ has prevailed and we are all expected to sell, even ourselves.The author talks from personal experience, and subjects herself to multiple ‘experiments’, meets with subject matter experts, and interviews introverts over several years. She talks mainly about the US and, to a lesser extent, Asian American population in a bid to introduce cultural differences that promote/demote introversion. There was little reference to gender-specifics, which I expect would account for some of our differences, certainly in today’s western societies. The author careful avoids common pitfalls by: treating introversion/extroversion as a fuzzy logic scale - we are who we are and that’s perfectly fine; understanding the situational factors that can cause everyone of us to act outside of our true self, either consciously or unconsciously stretching our natural abilities; promoting freedom of thought rather than presenting a guru-like approach - « Agressive power beats you up; soft power wins you over ». Susan Cain is clearly driven and delivers a message of hope to introverts. Even if ‘Succeeding’ may mean marching to the beat of our own quiet drum, this isn’t a self-help book, it is a thought enabler, based on facts (historical and present), figures, and detailed accounts and interviews. I needed time between readings to process the dense information and many references. But then again this is not my preferred genre. I made my way from being a shy, sensitive, introverted child, quite content to walk in the playground alone, lost in thought and daydreaming, to an adolescent rebel and the grown-up pseudo-extrovert I am today. I just had never realised the extent to which I had lost my connection with that quiet, curly haired little girl.This book has changed the way I see myself, and, although this was not the grippiest read for me, I feel compelled to give it a whopping 5-stars for being such a well-researched eye-opener."
92,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5632120-zaphoddent,1,"The only good thing I can say about this book is that it serves as a one stop collection of references to more intelligent analysis of the topic of introversion. The book itself  brings nothing to the table. Worse than that, by cherry picking data to support her generalizations, she does introverts a huge disservice. She actually manages to make introverts sound like weaklings which I feel insulted by. Her implication that introverts are superior, sensitive beings who absorb every negative slight to slowly destroy their psyche is just ridiculous. In Chapter 11, she gives ‘insights’ for parenting introverts - Don't tell your kid she's shy, be a role model by greeting strangers in a calm gentle way, don't pick over-aggressive kids as playmates, let your child know gently that tugging at your pant legs is not okay, instead let him know speaking up quietly is better to get attention. Three simple rules will help: Smile, stand up straight and make eye contact? - What the bloody hell? In the real world, all that is just obvious basics of good parenting! She actually says “make sure you're not imposing your own dreams on your kid” Well, no shit!  Chapter 8 is probably her least balanced chapter. She discusses how studious the Cupertino Asians are and is positively salivating about how great they are. Reading this chapter, one would think that all Asian kids are born studious introverts and sadly have to make radical adjustment when they face the terrible extroverted American life. Presumably, the only extroverted Asians she met were the ones that were sadly changing their core beings to fit into American society! There’s no discussion of the pressures faced by the kids to succeed at the expense of exploring other aspects of life.  I wish I had read the conclusion chapter first which basically sums up the book. From her bullet points on the insights she felt she had provided, I’d have been able to see she had nothing more than already well known ideas and I’d have skipped this one. Save yourself the trouble and copy down her references to read instead. "

I typically avoid popular books, films, music etc. And because the author isn't a psychologist. I'm pretty cautious about my sources. And because I had a lot of other things to read. I love reading.The irony is so obvious in retrospect. If you love books, steer clear of cocktail banter, love deep conversation, hate bright and shiny, groupish, joinery shit, than you, like me, may qualify as an introvert. It's not a bad thing. It's a good thing, and this book is FUBU (for us by us), or BUFU (by us for us) depending on how you roll.This is such a big hearted, normalizing, useful, game changing read. I hope you get over your ""too smart for popular psychology"" self a read this (very smart and well done) book.After you're done, you may be kicking yourself that you didn't think of it first. A book for, by and about bookish, cerebral, sensitive (in the good way) types. Who knew it would be such a huge hit? You'd almost think the author was a Machiavellian marketing genius, if she wasn't so dang sincere and genuinely likable (from a distance of course)."

Every piece of information found here is something I wish I'd known in junior high school, high school, or even college. And I wish my parents had known more about when I was even younger than all that. I finished the book with mixed reactions though. On the one hand I feel completely validated, in a way I've never been able to grasp before, and I feel like there are definitely some simple things I can change about my life now that will help me become even better adjusted to daily existence. But on the other hand, it's so frustrating to see all of this so late in life (relatively speaking). If I had understood these things about myself, about many of my friends, about so many people I came into contact with, I think I could have enjoyed my childhood and early adulthood instead of constantly hoping for things to change. I can only hope now that I can still figure some of this out."

I particularly like the section on how introverts can act like extroverts when it is important to them - this is how I do public speaking. But I need at least a day to recover afterwards.

It is partly a self-help book in showing married couples of different types how to compromise between social functions and quiet activities. The author is an introvert and cites anecdotes from her personal history. While she offers the idea that people fall at different places on the introversion-extroversion continuum, most of the book focuses on the two extremes. It certainly provides food for thought and can help improve communications between those with different temperaments. It will be interesting to see if her ideas can make any headway in corporate America."
99,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15493045-lisa,4,"An evocative and compelling start of a revolution to unlock the power and understanding of introverts.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️SUMMARYAt least one-third to one-half of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to socializing, and working on their own to working in teams. Many of society’s great contributors are introverts: Rosa Parks, Gandhi, Chopin, Theo Geisel, Warren Buffett, Steve Wozniak and Eleanor Rosevelt. In QUIET, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue the traits and capability of introverts and she shows us how much we lose in doing so. She offers advice to introverts and urges changes in the workplace, in schools and in parenting.“The secret to life is to put yourself in the right lighting. For some it’s a Broadway spotlight; for others, a lamp lit desk.REVIEWWhat if everyone was an extrovert? According to composer Allen Shawn “A species in which everyone was General Patton would not succeed, anymore than would a race in which everyone was Vincent Van Gogh.” Introverts are needed for their creativity, careful analysis and thoughtfulness. Susan Cain does a superb job at identifying the strengths and weakness of both introverts and extroverts. There were several things I liked about this smartly structured and thought-provoking book. Cain provides a clear explanation of the societal benefits of introverts with real world examples throughout history. QUIET is weighted with research in biology, psychology, and neuroscience demonstrating the value of introverts.Of particular interest were Cain’s chapters on extroverts who are the parents of introverts, and the issue of schools and classes being designed in such a way that favors extroverts. Having raised a introverted son, I can certainly attest to the exhaustion my son felt after a day at school. QUIET is essential reading for introverts, parents of introverts, and spouses of introverts. It should also be read by teachers, counselors, and employers, so just about everyone! This is a worthy addition to any library.Author Susan Cain Went to Princeton University and Harvard Law School. She is an introvert who practiced law for seven years before becoming a writer. she is cofounder of Quiet Revolution and has also written Quiet Power; The Secret Strength of Introverts.

She uses good examples from her own experiences and mentions numerous research studies and results.” ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ A.M. “A talented and well researched author who explains the special gifts of introverts, who comprise one-third to one-half of the population.

This is a book based on science and studies of the brain, but for me it felt like a self-help book of sorts. I'm not big on self-help books in general, but I feel so validated after reading this book. Some of my ""quirks"" are really part of being an introvert, and being introverted is rooted in the way our brain functions. For example, I can go to a party and be ""the life of the party"" but afterward I am exhausted and need a lot of quiet down time. I internalize others' pain and suffering...yes so I need more down time. I am a competent pianist, but have to deal with annoying illogical stage fright. The scientific studies she writes about are fascinating. I already know how I respond to certain stimuli and situations, but now I know why I do...my brain is wired that way...and it's nice to know I'm not alone :)"

I was interested in this book because I knew I was an introvert and wanted to learn more about it, and what I got in return was significantly deeper than that. Susan Cain encourages her quieter readers to embrace the added characteristics that are often grouped with this tendency, and the result was a cultivation of confidence. I was thoroughly engaged while reading this, having finished it in a day. Its section on sensitivity was particularly relevant to me, as I'd been unaware of the acknowledgment of the term, the number of studies conducted about it. I felt unexpectedly accepted, recognized by an outside entity, while reading Quiet. It was empowering. It was a relief. "

104,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5717792-scott-rhee,5,"It's sometimes hard for me to believe that I'm an introvert (an assessment based on my own observations as well as a Meyers-Briggs test I took before I got married) because I am pretty social and enjoy being around people. Of course, this type of thinking---equating introversion with anti-social behavior---is, according to Susan Cain in her wonderful book ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"", part of the residual societal anti-introvert indoctrination. Being an introvert does NOT mean one is anti-social. It also doesn't mean one is ""shy"". Indeed, the word ""Introvert"" can still have many negative connotations in the minds of most people, especially in the fields of business, finance, law, entertainment, and politics (fields in which extroverts still predominate), which it shouldn't because, as Cain demonstrates through anecdotal evidence as well as hard scientific data, introverts are the ones who tend to get things done, and/or done right. They just tend to do it quietly, often without fanfare or even credit. According to studies, somewhere between one-third and one-half of the world population could be described as introverts. Some regions of the world (Asia, for example) have a heavier population of introverts because, culturally, they value introverts over extroverts. It is the complete opposite in this country, a country that is blatantly pro-extrovert. Cain calls the American obsession and glorification of extroversion ""'The Extrovert Ideal'---the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha, and comfortable in the spotlight. (p. 4)"" Introversion, on the other hand, ""is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology. (p. 4)"" We, as a culture, seem to idolize extroverts when, in fact, historically and statistically, it is usually the introverts who have given us the most beautiful art and literature, the most innovative scientific inventions, and the most profitable business practices. Cain's book is loaded with fascinating interviews and stories, as well as hard data, that supports the theory that introversion is unjustly dismissed in this country, often to the extreme detriment of the rest of society. In one of the more fascinating chapters in the book, Cain looks at the Wall Street Crash of 2008, a monumentally devastating event in American financial history that, she argues (fairly convincingly), could have been prevented or at the very least lessened had the loud-mouthed action-oriented extroverts leading the companies actually paid attention to the bookish, soft-spoken introverted number-crunchers in their midst who, for some time before the crash, were sending memos, e-mails, and trying to get a word in edge-wise with warnings about rampant spending and bad spending that could potentially lead to exactly what happened. Ironically and sadly, many of these quiet harbingers of doom were actually criticized after the fact for not bringing the information to the attention of their bosses.Part of the problem is what Cain calls ""the myth of charismatic leadership"", a cultural belief that often equates charismatic behavior and attitudes (confidence, talkativeness, assertiveness, aggressiveness) with superior intelligence. In truth, there is no difference in the intelligence levels between introverts and extroverts. Unfortunately, what tends to happen, especially in group settings (an environment in which introverts naturally feel uncomfortable to begin with) in which ideas are being brainstormed, introverts often feel hesitant to contribute or are quickly dismissed by the more assertive and charismatic members of the group. Thus, potentially good ideas are drowned out and lost. Several studies have proven this phenomenon to be accurate.Another interesting fact that Cain points out is from a well-known study of some of the best-performing companies of the late 20th century. Without exception, every single best-performing company had the same thing in common: Their CEOs were all introverts. Unassuming, thoughtful, often described as ""taciturn"" or even ""eccentric"", these men and women preferred to lock themselves away in their office to work quietly rather than work in group settings. What do introverts do better than extroverts? One of the key factors, according to studies, is the ability to listen. An introvert is more likely to actively listen to the ideas of others when making a decision, as well as actually implement those ideas. An introvert is also more likely to designate jobs and duties to people they think are more qualified rather than take on the job themselves simply to receive the credit. The Extrovert Ideal doesn't just effect the world of business and finance. It can also have a negative effect within politics, education, and evangelical Christianity. Cain interviewed several pastors, members of clergy, and church members to see how the Extrovert Ideal has impacted the church. Not surprisingly (to anyone who has ever attended a church service), church clearly caters more toward extroverts than introverts. Flamboyant singing, being forced to ""greet-and-smile"" with your neighbors, not-so-subtly glorifying and extolling those congregants who have gone out into the community or taken mission trips: all of these are things that most introverts find uncomfortable and even painful. Worse, they sometimes feel that they are looked down upon for their introversion. For many introverts, church is ""a religious culture that sees extroversion not only as a personality trait but also as an indicator of virtue. (p. 70)""Basically, Cain laments the sad fact that many introverts in this country are made to feel guilty or somehow less-important than extroverts because of their personality style, especially when mounting evidence suggests that introverts contribute a great deal to society. Cain, an introvert, never resorts to an anti-extrovert mentality. (Perhaps due to the fact that she's happily married to an extrovert.) She makes the point numerous times that extroverts and introverts have a lot to teach each other. In her own relationship (a model for introvert-extrovert couples, which are quite common apparently), she has learned from her husband to be more outgoing. Her husband has also learned from her how to be more introspective and less impulsive. ""Quiet"" is one of those books that I can't recommend highly enough. Everyone should read this book. At the very least it might help extroverts to realize why introverts act the way they do sometimes, and it may help introverts realize that they have nothing about which to feel embarrassed, ashamed, or guilty. "
105,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3106785-beth-bonini,5,"I am fairly conversant with psychology, and the kinds of tests (eg, Myers-Briggs) that determine personality type - for instance, whether a person is more extroverted or introverted in temperament - but I still found Quiet to be a mentally and emotionally transformative reading experience. Some of its analysis as to why America has become the most extroverted nation in history, and how the ""cult of personality"" developed, was also very insightful. Cain wrote this book several years before the 2016 presidential election, but so many of her findings really helped me understand the otherwise inexplicable: in other words, how someone like Donald Trump could be elected as president of the United States.I am not an obvious introvert because I have a chatty and confident social manner. I'm far from the stereotypical 'nerd' who avoids human contact as much as possible. But in many important ways, I am a classic introvert. One of the valuable things that Cain does is both broaden and refine the definitions of what an introverted temperament looks and acts like. An essential difference between introversion and extroversion is whether social contact gives you energy (a ""buzz"") or drains you. I have known, since I was a very young child, that being with people drains me - even if I am enjoying that contact. I am really uncomfortable at cocktail parties, large sporting events and any situation where I feel obligated to make superficial chit-chat. I'd rather send a text than talk on the phone, but I do enjoy intense one-on-one conversations. I dislike noise in general, and find certain noises almost unbearable. I'm conflict averse and very sensitive to the feelings of others. I relax by being alone with a book. Before reading this book, I don't think I have ever fully appreciated the cultural pressure I felt to be extroverted, or conversely, experienced so much acceptance of my own natural temperament.What Cain does so skilfully is describe - in laymen's terms, but with the backing of scientific research - why a balance of 'extroverted' and 'introverted' qualities is needed for everything from personal relationships to education to business culture. She shows that introverted types can learn some of the positive aspects of extroverted behaviour - and indeed, that those behaviours can be key for being an effective communicator. But she also points out that extroverted 'confidence' can be misplaced, and more like arrogance, and that there is much danger is always following the person who shouts loudest and seems most convinced of his or her own beliefs. Having grown up in America, and being used to its ways, I was very intrigued by Cain's comparison of a typically extroverted culture with the more introverted Asian cultures. I was struck by the idea of 'relationship honouring': the innate cultural belief that it is worse to embarrass someone else than to be embarrassed oneself. How 'foreign' that is to the average American, although it used to be the very core of good manners. Introverts tend to be more susceptible to guilt, and they often are more concerned with the value of moral behaviour. They tend to think before they speak, and to consider a situation more carefully and from all angles. They tend to be risk-averse and more analytical, which actually makes them more successful in jobs in the financial sector - although many practises of the last 20 years have rewarded risky 'extroverted' types instead. They are not as concerned with 'vanity,' popularity and external rewards. (I think we can infer that Donald Trump is definitely not an introvert.)As I was reading this book, I felt like there were just so many people I wanted to share it with. It gives so much insight to how parents can more sensitively raise their introverted children and honour their strengths while encouraging them to develop the weaker areas of their character. It also made me understand how difficult it can be for my older daughter to be the only extrovert in a family of introverts. Although there is quite a lot of business-oriented information, which may not interest everyone, I think this book is a must-read."
106,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5932159-ishraq,4,"I have always felt that I'm a little bit different from my peers and friends. I've always been the quietest person in the room, the less to talk, not interested in initiating chit-chat with others, feels discomfort in large groups, the first one to leave a gathering and didn't mind being alone with myself for long time but yet when I talk, people do listen carefully and give me their full attention that makes me feel a little bit anxious.It was until recently that I realized that I’m not a weirdo or different, but I have different traits of personality and this kind of personality has a name: Introversion. Introversion is not something new, Carl Jung discussed this personality long time ago but it was until recently it started to have a global recognition. Susan Cain defines introverts as people who prefers quiet and less stimulating environments than others, listens more than they talk and think before they act on the contrary of extroverts who are open and react highly in stimulating environments, feels more comfortable with a large group of people and under spotlights.Being an introvert myself, reading this book didn’t come with something new to me except that it validated how I feel and react as an introvert. I think because I took some time accepting myself as I am before reading this book made me want to jump through pages very fast maybe because I found that the scientific researches and psychological work aimed at convincing the others that introversion has a scientific background for them to accept us rather than for me to accept myself.I listened to almost all the talks and discussions Susan Cain had on this topic at YouTube and I had very high expectations from this book but I was somehow a little bit disappointed. I think the book was well written and supported with statistics, experiments and researches on many topics related to this personality type but it needed more headings and sub-titles as you might read very long passages and sometimes you need just a new subject to wrap up everything you have just read. In her defense for introverts, I think un-intentionally she was spreading the message that introverts are idealist and the misconception of the west (especially in the US) regarding the idealist extrovert.The last two chapters about the communication gap between introverts and extroverts and how to deal with your introverted child were the reason I gave the book a high rating. The chapter that talked about workplace was really awesome and hit me the most as I do myself hate open space work places and I was the first to get a divider to my cubical in the office. I highly recommend this book for people who are new to this subject and need a better understanding of introverts that communicate with and for me I think I need to have a better understanding of extroverts in order to maintain a better relationship and communication with them."

Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.Opening: The date: 1902.

Susan Cain offers up an incredibly engaging, comprehensive look at introversion. She takes a multidisciplinary approach to the concept of introversion in a culture where we are often measured against an ""Extrovert Ideal"" - in the workplace, schools and social settings. She offers workable, empowering solutions to introverts, parents of introverts, managers of introverts. It's not a self-help book; she is a pragmatist. She offers ways to honor who we are but also offers up ways to still function successfully in social situations, work, marriage and friendship.Highly recommended to all introverts and plenty of great information for the extroverts out there too!Side note: I would have possibly given this book 4 stars if I'd not heard her speak recently. Her speech was incredible and more concise than the book. As a result, I thought a few chapters could use a little editing but this book and her speech so resonated with me personally, I bumped up my rating to 5 stars.Lastly: a tiny quibble--in the end, she offers possible advice to introverts who may be unhappy in their jobs.

As an introvert myself (an INTP to be specific), I believe I've adapted a reasonable extroverted persona for everyday activity with the attitude that there is something to gain from each interaction. Nonetheless, when I receive an invitation for a party my instinct is to politely decline with a white lie unless within my circle of good friends, which I will attend. This book has provided evidence with people's experiences from young to old as well as social experiments for answers about temperament, shyness & personality traits attributed to introverts and extroverts. Many important mentions include Rosa Parks, Obama, Gandhi, Warren Buffet & Steve Wozniak. A great insightful read for introverts & extroverts alike.

It was well researched, well written, and well edited. Susan Cain starts by looking at the history and the culture in the United States to help put into context how we moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality. She looks at the characteristics of introverts and extroverts from a physical, psychological, and biological viewpoint and discusses that we are not all one or the other but a mixture of both. Cain looks at how introverts and extroverts function in school, the work place, and relationships; how to value the strengths of both personality types; and how to work together to get the best results. This book gave me a better understanding of myself and the people around me. and is beneficial on both a personal and professional level. Highly recommended!"

No, people don’t understand/believe that because how can I be? I’m not shy, I don’t sit in a corner, I’m the funny one, a ranter who is fluent in sarcasm and can hold her own. And she who is from the tiniest of families (current count 7) married into the biggest, loudest, most extroverted family on planet earth (current count approx. 1,038,428). And they love their gatherings.Generally, being introverted doesn’t make my life too difficult but the lack of understanding and appreciation of my ways does, and I’m certain a good percentage of my wonderful hubby’s family think I’m aloof or just a weirdo for breaking out in a sweat when it’s time to leave a gathering and the hugs and kisses are imminent. If only I could get them to read this, to give them an insight as to what life as an introvert is like. 
”Without people like you, we will, quite literally, drown.”
Susan Cain highlights through case studies and facts, that success can and does come as a result of introvercy. Introverts are of as much value as extroverts and there’s plenty of room for us all. Deep down I know this, but after another family gathering which has left me drained and a bit down-in-the dumps (but loving my nephew’s girlfriend hard because it seems after 18 years I‘m no longer the lone introvert), re-reading this 6 years on from when I first picked it up has reminded me that there’s abso-fucking-lutely nothing wrong with me. And that’ll do me. "
114,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,3,"I listened to this book because I have heard some very good things about it. Also I consider myself very much an introvert and wanted to hear what the author had to say about us. She actually had quite a bit to say, maybe a little too much because I decided to speed through a couple of the last chapters. The beginning confirmed what we readers already know -- that bookworms (and authors, scientists, computer geeks, artists, etc.) are mostly introverts, gratefully, as their need for alone time is the main reason for the existence of our favorite books (and inventions, computers, paintings, etc.).It also confirmed that one may be considered shy but convince oneself to try, successfully, to change that. Not all are successful, and not all will even attempt it.So many stories were regaled, I couldn't possibly absorb them all, much less repeat them. I'm glad I read it but it was less amazing than I had hoped."
115,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5246491-suzanne,2,"I'm an extrovert. To give you an idea of just how far over I am on the extrovert side of the spectrum, in one of the companies that I previously worked for, we did some team building based around our Myer-Briggs profiles and at one point, the trainer asked the extroverts to go to one corner of the room and the introverts to the other. I was closest to the extrovert corner so immediately stuck my hands up in the air and started dancing around calling ""Extroverts over here! Extroverts over here!""But I also am: married to an introvert, the daughter of two introverts, the mother of an introvert and co-worker with a whole team of introverts (a new situation for me as I've previously worked in extrovert-dominant companies). So, when an introvert friend of mine said that she loved this book and kept saying ""Finally! Somebody who gets what it is like to be an introvert!"" while reading it, I was intrigued and interested. Essentially, I opened this book with a mind eager to learn more. Unfortunately, I ended up feeling like I was the enemy. This quote in the Introduction chapter captures the sentiment that snakes through the whole book:""Introversion - along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness - is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology. Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man's world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are. Extroversion is an enormously appealing personality style, but we've turned it into an oppressive standard to which most of us feel we must conform.""And another example (although here Cain is quoting someone else):""If ""fast"" and ""slow"" animals had parties, writes the evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson, ""some of the fasts would bore everyone with their loud conversation, while others would mutter into their beer that they don't get any respect. Slow animals are best described as shy, sensitive types. They don't assert themselves, but they are observant and notice things that are invisible to the bullies. They are the writers and artists at the party who have interesting conversations out of earshot of the bullies. They are the inventors who figure out new ways to behave, while the bullies steal their patents by copying their behavior.""""So, extrovert type animals are ""bullies?"" And in Chapter 7, ""Why Did Wall Street Crash and Warren Buffett Prosper?"" she seems to be making the case that it's all because of extroverts that we ended up in our financial mess! To be fair, Cain does actually want both sides to get along and there are several times where she extols the virtues of both introverts and extroverts and the need to have both in this world, just more in balance with each other.My biggest problem with the book is that I didn't feel she answered questions that she set up for herself. Take Chapter 5, for example. This is called ""Beyond Temperament. The Role of Free Will (and the Secret of Public Speaking for Introverts)."" The chapter makes the argument that you can choose to stretch yourself out of the personality that you are born with, but you can stretch only so far. We learn how a key difference between introverts and extroverts is a preference for stimulation. If an introvert is in too noisy an environment, they don't function at their best. An extrovert needs more stimulation to be firing on all cylinders. As public speaking is a stimulating activity, ""introverts can find their attention impaired just when they need it most."" And the ""secret"" to public speaking? Lots of prep, and talk about topics that matter deeply to you. Umm, I think that's advice that works for everyone.Chapter 3 ""When Collaboration Kills Creativity"" was interesting. It reiterated some of the findings that I've read in other books - that group brainstorming is not as effective as we've all thought, for example. But I hadn't heard of The Coding War Games. This was a study of more than 600 developers in 92 companies to identify the characteristics of the best and worst computer programmers. What they found was that the top performers ""overwhelmingly worked for companies that gave their workers the most privacy, personal space, control over their physical environments, and freedom from interruption.""The chapter on parenting an introvert was interesting but reinforced what I already knew rather than giving me specific advice/new approaches to consider. (Sorry, that sounds more arrogant than I intended. I guess I have an interest in all of this so Quiet was not my first introduction to personality research.) My son is the type of kid who starts reading a book if a playdate goes on too long. (He's 11.) When he first started Kindergarten, he went immediately to the book corner and started reading while all the parents and kids were milling about, talking and waiting to say goodbye. Reading is his way of dealing with over stimulation and we support that with a ton of library books lying around the house at any given moment. I guess overall, my disappointment was that there were a lot of sweeping statements about extroverts and introverts which then didn't get backed up. I felt like each chapter jumped around a lot and you'd get to the end and wonder what the key points were."

“Don't think of introversion as something that needs to be cured.”

I didn't realize that the world had it out for introverts but maybe it's just my problem for missing it?Based on this book's gross generalization I'm neither an introvert nor an extrovert. While I am an introvert at my core, my personality is also sprinkled with characteristics that are attributed solely to extroversion. Apparently I'm the 
Divergent
 in Cain's world which is divided in these two factions: introverts and extroverts. I found little use to the book. Barely any insightful information is provided. Like I said, it was overall just a gross generalization. Cain's view of the matter is seriously biased. I am all for protecting and cherishing introversion, after all, I am mostly introverted. And I have had that held against me on occasions. I felt wronged, of course. Nonetheless, I was quite taken aback by the villainization of extroverts. Cain portrays introverts as these perpetually misunderstood geniuses, who need to be handled like delicate flowers, who would fix all the world's problems if only they would be allowed to take over. Because introverts are such good folks. And extroverts are these loud, stupid, intimidating assholes who never listen to the voice of reason, who only care about themselves and always try to manipulate everyone for their own gain, therefore they are those who will bring on the Apocalypse. Even when she makes some feeble attempts to give extroversion some credit it always comes out as a insult that's masked a compliment. The truth is, throughout my lifetime, I've faced a lot of assholes, and they were from both camps. The extroverted ones used loud, aggressive methods of intimidation while the introverted ones used insidious passive-aggressive tactics. None was better than the other. So it's really not about where you are on the introversion-extroversion scale is what you end up doing with it and this point seems to completely escape Cain's view. This book was meant to stroke my introverted ego, but it failed miserably. To me, it felt like a big pity party while I was expecting a fairly objective opinion based on scientific findings about introversion and extroversion.  I'm not saying that her criticism of today's western society is invalid. And that she doesn't have a point when she talks about how awful corporations and the educational system are. Or about how they brake spirits and suppress valid ideas just based on the delivery. Loud, arrogant, impulsive, stupid people are usually the ones who end up in charge everywhere nowadays and this is causing so many issue for everyone. But it's not a simple matter of introverts vs. extroverts. The only few sections that were not completely tainted by her personal convictions, did provide some useful information and helped me confirm the knowledge of my own personality. But nothing was revolutionary, I had an intuitive understanding of most of those ideas. Needless to say I was very disappointed by this book. It's of little value from a scientific point of view. For me it was mostly Cain's way of dealing with her own challenges of being an introvert and frankly she comes out as a somewhat bitter, passive-aggressive individual. Otherwise, the narration was quite pleasant and there are quite a few good quotes and ideas, too bad they were tainted with the author's defensive attitude."
117,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14371463-suzanne-arcand,4,"I work in an environment where extroverts have the run of the place. Because I eat at my desk while reading and do not really enjoy small talk and big parties I’m often the odd one out. I’ve been trying to be more sociable and have internalized other people’s opinion that there is something not quite right with being an introverted. Reading this book I felt vindicated and understood. Never again will I blame myself or make excuse for being introverted. In a lot of ways, I’m still old fashioned. I value discipline and moral. So it was with a mix of sadness and pleasure that I read how the extrovert came to dominate the business world and the rise of the “Culture of Personality”. Susan Cain’s book helped me understand why in such a culture, my favorite candidate in the last municipal election didn’t stand a chance. What she writes about Harvard Business School could apply with any business school and explains why acting decisively and rapidly is valued over pondering one’s decision. In Canada pharmaceutical industries are not allowed to advertise so I was shocked and appalled to read that Paxil was promoted as a drug to cure shyness. I was touched to read about the gentleness of Rosa Park and not so surprise to read that creativity is often a lonely endeavor.Curiously I was less enamoring with the second section “Your Biology, Your Self?” I did find the whole discussion about high versus low reactivity interesting and appreciated that the author wrote that “High- and low-reactivity are probably not the only biological routes to introversion and extroversion. However she does put a lot of emphasis on those factors almost to the exclusion of anything else. Of course my impressions are not scientific at all but based on my own, limited experience. I’m definitely am introverted but I don’t see myself as being high-reactive and adverse to novelty and I’m a little embarrassed to admit that I am not highly emphatic (but I’m working on it). But am I? On one hand, I’m certainly not an early adapter. I down have a smart phone yet and still read paper books. On the other hand I am not usually anxious and love travelling. Like the author, I have learnt to stretch myself by talking in public and talking to people in parties and cocktail. I’ve even been told that I’m lucky to be extroverted. I they only knew!The third section thought me that there are places in the word where introversion is valued.All this theory would have been interesting but not as useful without Part four “How to Love, How to Work” which teaches how introvert and extrovert can get along and how to fit in when you’re an introvert. I have learned to leave 15 minutes between meetings to restore myself. I now work from home once a week. I just whish some of my bosses and colleagues would also read this book. "
118,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,4,"I went 3, no 4, no 3, no 4, no 3 on this. And I realised this was an example of one of the traits of introversion, to decide correctly so as not to feel guilt. ""Guilt"" is mentioned 22 times in this book.What sucked me in to trying this book was in the intro: ""Now that you're an adult, you might still feel a pang of guilt when you decline a dinner invitation in favor of a good book.""EXACTLY!!In fact, it doesn't even have to be a GOOD book, just a book! Or a magazine! Anything rather than having to (gasp) socialise. And if one doesn't really drink much alcohol, or ""a glass of extroversion"", than it does become a painfully long ordeal.The first 2/3 was quite interesting. About one-third of the population are introverted, but the extroversion bias of North American society, especially the US, means that introversion becomes regarded as a defect or something to overcome, rather than just a temperament which in many ways is more desirable than its opposite. Society needs both temperaments and the spectrum between them. (But try telling that to the pharmaceutical companies making Paxil and Zoloft etc., who would love to label as all as having 'social anxiety disorder'. They are trying to create disease out of normal human nature. They could make twice as much money if they instead try to create a disease of extroverts and call it something like ""pathologic social exhuberance disorder"". :-) )The last part lost my interest, as it degenerated into a self help type style, thereby somewhat contradicting the first parts of the book. Still, it was an interesting enough book. I never read these kinds of books, so that I managed to finish it says something."
119,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64325592-supreeth,5,"I guess basically every single person can be boiled down as either an introvert or extrovert. And without any sort of survey, you can say at least two-thirds of the Goodreaders/book-people (or whatever -philes) are introverts. I mean who else can be passionate about a bunch of words put together for pages? So this book might've reached a good amount of introverts. But the trouble is, it's supposed to work another way. I wouldn't say this book is a waste of time for introverts, it validates their behavior, maybe makes them quit their search for approval. But in a world dominated by ideal extroverts, it wouldn't make much of a difference. If managers, interviewers, parents etc can't exactly understand the fact that 'Introversion isn't something to be cured', there's no point in self-validation(in the bigger picture). So if introverts come out as narcissists and anti-social(but who exactly defined social?), it's because of the other group. Other than this, Quiet also talks about the cultural differences with respect to personality traits. While introversion is ideal in fareast, it just works the other way in the west. Susan Cain also calls out America as the most extroverted nation. And India, as a country which is highly influenced by the USA follows the same ideal of extroversion. If you've also read this book called, The Culture Map, you can easily make out why Eastern Asians can read between the lines, westerners just can't and South Asians lie somewhere in between."
120,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74034800-lucy-langford,5,"So I probably picked up this book, as most others do, due to identifying as an introvert. This book explores both extroversion and introversion. It uses case studies of both famous and non-famous people, as well as psychological and business studies. The case studies were great as you could identify with others personal experiences. It was also refreshing to read some of the psychological studies as a reminder of what I had learned as an undergraduate psychology student. This is definitely a book I should have read earlier in my life- during college or university. I always felt weird being the one who is described as shy and quiet by teachers and bookish. I don't particularly socialise much and have social anxiety before going to seminars. It made me identify that my experiences are not alone- I'm just an introvert. This book explores introversion through different cultural experiences and shows the power and benefits of an introvert in these circumstances. A much needed brilliant read!"
121,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4964631-maureen,2,"This is one of the most self-congratulatory books I’ve ever read.In theory, this book had a lot to offer, but it didn’t deliver. Rather than create a nuanced web to help express the ways that temperament develops in the human mind and in our cultures, Quiet describes an unreal version of reality where two binary spectrums of humanship exist- the loud, and the shy. The popular and the pariah. Nary is the middle ground discussed, despite the fact that everyone on earth at times has felt both ends of this spectrum.One of the greatest mistakes of this book is that it appropriates bookishness, introspection, and wisdom with introversion. This is problematic- the act of reading or thinking or affinity for knowledge is not exclusive to shy or introverted persons. Nor is the act of laughter or enjoying jokes exclusive to extroversion. Of course, the world would be improved with a greater balance of types- but mistaking habits and preferences for temperament is downright problematic, and more or less, annoying. Based on this book, extroverts are unfeeling, unthinking bumblers that stumble about loudly, eating and drinking themselves to death. But don’t worry, the world needs extroverts, if nothing but to balance out the more valuable, cerebral, noble introverts that have long gone undervalued. Gimme a break.The main issue with this book though, is that temperament is not genuinely explored through the lens of any other variable of the human existence- gender, ethnicity, geographic location, family experiences, race, socio-economic status, so on and forever. Of course, addressing each of these would be exhaustive, but the fact that so little is explored regarding these important factors is an unfortunate oversight that detracts from the overall effectiveness of the arguments in this book."
122,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke,4,"I have long known I am an introvert and thought I understood things pretty well, but Susan Cain's research turned up some fascinating details about this personality trait. I really enjoyed learning these things--from my thin skin (that has toughened over the years) to my ability to function reasonably well on little sleep (thanks to being a new mom). I also enjoyed her ability to delve into extroversion; it is a mistake to talk about one without the other. But the one aspect I missed seeing in this book has to do with parenting. She covered social life, the workplace, partnerships, and parenting introverted children...but her thoughts and information were quite thin on how/what it's like to be a parent who is introverted. I was hoping for more of that...she made suggestions about how to deal with certain things, but as an introvert I found myself wondering how I might actually do those things. Over and over again I get anxious about the future and that anxiety almost always is related to navigating parenthood as an introvert...am I up for dealing with teachers and schools? Other parents? And (good lord) birthday parties?? She had coaching tips for how to help a child cope with parties--but what about the mom? I'm not joking.I told the one known extrovert in my office about this book in an attempt to encourage her to read it. She wondered if there is a book called Loud, because Quiet just is not capturing her imagination. So I would like to ask Susan Cain to write a book about Loud, or better yet, repackage Quiet as Loud....and perhaps exponentially increase her audience and the number of extroverts learning about their introverted family members, colleagues, and friends."
123,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666003-silvana,3,"A very divisive, uneven book, this one is. At first I (an introvert) was happy that I got the confirmation that the world's adherence to extroversion could negatively affect the introverts. And then I was relieved that being an introverts also have its benefits. I became aware that there is a spectrum and not a binary, where I do have some extrovert parts in me. I also learned that introverts can fake their way into a more extroverted behavior even in daily basis, but has to be aware that it has consequences and thus careful 'transaction' needs to be done to balance it out. On the chapter about Asian values, while it focuses more on Asian Americans, I still could relate and reflect.Those are the useful stuff. Then come the rest. I could not care less of the famous people the author use as examples of role models of introverts. I'd like to have more scientific analysis on introversion than the book gives me. Instead it provides very lengthy accounts on marriage lives and child raising practices, which I could not relate and thus feel very bored listening to them. I need more analysis than self-help tips, more 'why' than 'what' and 'how'."

125,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4407044-jim,5,"What would you say to an attorney who loved her work on Wall Street but hated face to face meetings and found her self as the lead attorney on a negotiation team charged with solving a serious problem for a client as she sat across the table from a team of intimidating lawyers from the other side? What would you say to a frustrated and concerned parent who wanted her child to fit in and have friends but who instead preferred to read at home?How about a university student who found the ""discussions"" of their classes disgusting and a waste of time?With the premise in her introduction (that parallels Stephen Covey's similar views in his introduction to his 7 Habits of Highly Effective People) that a shift from a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality has ""unleashed in ordinary people-introverts and extraverts-a nagging sense of personal inferiority that plagues them to this day"" Susan Cain, a self-professed introvert, begins leading us on a journey of visits to quiet people such as university and high school students, parents of ""quiet"" but gifted and articulate children, a well-known mega church (Saddleback Community in Southern California), and through a number of signifcant studies of introversion and extroversion as she seeks to encourage all of us to ""be true to yourself.""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, (to be published in January 2012 by Crown Publishing) is a thoroughly researched book in which Cain argues for a greater understanding and acceptance of those who are often thought shy, bookish, backward, and even anti-social - introverts. Basing her views of introversion on the views and study of Carl Jung, Cain suggests that there is a place, a much needed place at times, for introverts in our society as a companion, and in some cases, a check, against the predominate extroversion of our time.Along the way, Cain, takes us into... the workplace and challenges the current preoccupation with groupthink and argues that working alone is still a viable and necessary activity for both productivity and business success.... the modern American classroom and the need to help both school systems as well as the classroom affirm and encourage the introverted student to thrive as much as the extroverted student... the financial world and how ""introverts and extroverts think (and process dopamine) differently"" as she contrasts the 'Wizard of Omaha"" Warren Buffett who has made money in a tough economy with those whose risk taking caused financial loss for themselves and others as well... parents, and students, who struggle with a 'shy' label that creates both personal and academic problems instead of seeing how the richness of their inner world is an assetIn this midst of this journey she focuses her study on what I have often thought about on this discussion on personality as a whole and this particular aspect of personality.How much of it is nurture and how much of it is nature? Where does free will come into play?Her significant use of studies done on identified introvert and extroverted students using MRI scans is a strength of this book as it reveals that there is a biological and chemical aspect to personality that must be considered. But in doing so she acknowledges that there is a grey area into which we must take account in the dynamic of human personality.In short, Quiet affirms the place and importance of introversion in society and Cain challenges our current extroverted society with bringing the deep and necessary gifts of those who are more introverted into play.(I wish Cain would have taken more time to discuss ambiversion as I believe that I am such a person and that there are others who are equally able to move between introversion and extroversion without difficult. But I also enjoyed her presentation of High and Low Self Monitoring (HSM's and LSM's) discussed in chapter 9, When should you act more extroverted that you really are?)In short, I believe that Quiet is going to be, and must be, a welcome volume to the discussion of personality in the years ahead because of its impact on our personal lives, our education, our workplace, our financial health, and (an area Cain briefly discussed) our faith. I am glad that Cain, whose own story is told in a unique way in the book, has written this book.I believe that this book would be a great book for college classes on personality, for those in ministerial training, as well as for human resource and educator continuing ed and training.On my review scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (great) book I rate Quiet a 5 a great read!"
126,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2799121-gary-anderson,5,"Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking is a powerful and important book.Quiet heightens my awareness of how extroverted students thrive on group work and class discussion while introverts thrive on opportunities for quiet reflection and expression, either on their own or with a very small group of co-thinkers. I know plenty of educators and others who believe that group work and class discussion are more valuable real-world skills than those offered to the world by introverts. That belief is a myth, and Susan Cain proves it in Quiet through study after study explained in clear, engaging language.The fact is that extroverts tend to dominate the spotlight and microphone while shouting the glories of their own attributes while introverts tend to avoid doing that. So the societal message that comes through is the extroverted version of things, and then it becomes a convoluted but self-fulfilling prophecy. The ideas in Quiet also have enormous implications for teacher professional development. In order for introverts to contribute to meaningful collaboration with other teachers, a reflective design is needed. Introverts are likely to contribute more in-depth, nuanced ideas to collaborative efforts, but they need a different model than what we frequently see in PLC-based schools where teachers have no choice regarding with whom they collaborate, what they discuss, or how and when their “learning” is reported. (For teachers and professional development designers, Jane Kise’s Creating a Coaching Culture for Professional Learning Communities (Solution Tree 2010) can be a useful companion to Quiet.)Quiet also delves into implications of introversion and extroversion for the business world, parenting, and relationships.

Yep, that brave woman that refused to give up her seat, the children's book writer and the first lady all share this rather unique characteristic. Or not so unique after all. Susan Cain, the author, points out that one third of the population is introverted. Through research studies, anecdotes and examples Cain walks us through the power of quiet.This is not the typical book I read but, boy, I am glad I did. Ever since I was a kid, it has been difficult for me to interact with people. I was the student that did not speak up in class but not because I had nothing to say. Try as I might, I could not get words out. Its not a good feeling. Most frustrating of all, was that I did not understand why. Now I do, I am an introvert (and shy to boot; not all introverts are shy though). To be fair, this is something I suspected for a while but can now confirm it. First off, it should be made clear that this is not an attack on extroverts. Cain covers a broad range of topics to highlight that introverts, as well, as extroverts can make valuable contributions. Cain explains the differences between temperament and personality. That leaders do not have to be loud to triumph (Mother Teresa and Mahatma Ghandi are among the most recognized examples). Its about finding the most optimal way to communicate. This work spoke for me, to me. Without denying that there is always room for improvement, I no longer feel apologetic for the way I am. Introversion is always going to be part of my life. And know what? I don't mind that one bit. And that same girl that had a hard time speaking up in class is the same one that has no qualms about screaming and jumping up and down when my team scores a goal."

Being an introvert can be very tricky in today's society and I found this book so reassuring!This book is very readable. It's a pretty quick read, moving fast & keeping the readers attention consistently. The variety of situations and topics covered in the book were great. There was a good mix of explanation, tips and examples within the book. I think this would be good for both introverts AND extroverts to read - to help us all understand one another better. I can think of a number of people in my own life that I wish would read this so they can better understand some of the choices that I make instead of treating me as if I'm crazy for those choices.

131,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26041131-julie,5,"Excellent book on the world of introverts and extroverts. It gets into the weeds and plows through stereotypes. Though there are traits that will be recognizable to all, it goes past some standard black and white snapshot to one with more nuanced shades of gray (with layers upon layers of things to consider). For those that like lots of data, this is the book for you. This is a well-researched book that isn't some fluff piece. One thing shared early on in the book gave me pause. Infants that cry more or overact to things are more likely to be introverts. The reason being is that they are more sensitive to new stimuli. This caught my attention as I'm an introvert but I didn't cry when I was born. I was calm, cool, and collected said my mom. This book had many such moments for me as the author gets into different aspects thought of as exclusive to introverts or extroverts and how they aren't so cut-and-dried. Being an introvert doesn't automatically mean you are also bookish and shy anymore than being an extrovert means one can't be either of these things. There are different types of introverts and extroverts - nothing is black and white.The book explores how introverts and extroverts relate to each other (or don't as the case may be) - this part is worth the read alone. It also explores why introverts get passed over for leadership positions in favor of extroverts. And why often it's a mistake, as most financial collapses can bear witness to (fueled by too many extroverts making too many risky decisions). The book explains why someone like introvert Warren Buffett makes a better leader than someone like extrovert Donald Trump (the gist is that the latter gets too much of a buzz from the attention he gets than giving attention to detail). The book brings home that it's all too easy to confuse schmoozing ability with talent. All too often, schmoozing is rewarded over critical thinking. While the book leans more to singing the praises of introverts, it certainly doesn't discount what extroverts have to offer. The book brings home that both doers and thinkers make the world go round. A world with only introverts would be just as much of a disaster as one filled only with extroverts, though the former might be a lot more quiet. The part of the book that discussed brainstorming sessions rang true. I've been part of countless brainstorming sessions and I find validity to the studies shared in the book that show that groupthink can kill creativity and that better ideas initially come from solitary brainstorming. There are several reasons, but suffice it to say that the loudest bird doesn't always get the worm, but they often drown out great ideas with their mediocre bluster. Of course extroverts have stellar ideas, but sometimes their showy banter is given more weight than it deserves.The most revealing part of the book has to do with why so many people are medicated for anxiety these days. It dives into the history of how and why the culture of personality overrode the culture of character. This shift required everyone in America to strive for some extrovert standard that was oppressive and quite frankly made introverts anxious. Cue the Xanax.When people moved out of small towns to the big city, it changed things. In small towns everyone knew most everyone for generations. They knew each other's business and everyone was invested in children becoming adults with character. When moving to the big city, one needed a shortcut to show they were of good character. Personality became that shortcut and pretty soon that shortcut replaced the real thing, character.It's easy to see why anxiety plagues so many in this country as half are likely introverts being asked to devalue their rich inner lives for a more showy extrovert ideal. An introvert having to live as an extrovert to survive would make anyone have to pop a chill pill. It turned half of us into circus performers until the ultimate circus, social media, took the wheel and drove us into a world where the culture of personality reigns supreme. Without personality trumping character, something like Facebook could not even exist (ironically created by an introvert). This book explains someone like our current U.S. president. Someone like him could never have won an election in a time when character mattered most. In the culture of character, the ideal would be serious, disciplined, and honorable. Bragging would be considered bad form. What impression one made in public would never be as important as how one behaved in private. The idea of a personality didn't even exist until the 18th century and the idea of having what one might call a ""good personality"" wasn't a real consideration until the twentieth century. It makes one wonder if America is largely responsible for this cult of personality as it forged its own path and myths. As American's, we are very big on myths of freedom and equality even though we have never had a moment where all have been considered or welcomed as equal by all. This makes me think about the Wild West and its cowboy criminals and later the age of the gangster that led to a major shift in hero worship - when we went from revering someone of character to obsessing over bad boys with personality. This led to being preoccupied with how others perceived us. Cue the Tequila shooters.There was an interesting correlation between the rise of the cult of personality and that of corporations and the self-help mania that focused on outer charm versus virtue. Add to that America's first tycoons and matinee idols and it was a perfect storm that led to the nonsense we have today of self-help gurus gunning to sell us a more dynamic life. The gist being that if you aren't an extrovert, you best fake it until you make it. I think the book leaves one having respect for the other side of the way of being in this world. There are things I'll never get a thrill out of in the same way as some true-blue extroverts but on the flip side, well, there's a flip side.This book has so many interesting things to ponder that I couldn't possibly hit on all of them in this review. What I have shared here is only a taste. I highly recommend reading this book."
132,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-he-him-his,1,"I'm an introvert and I didn't like this book.When I was a child, I was decently popular. I had friends and good ones at that. One friend I've had for about 16 years. Another I've had for 9-10. But, I always drew my strength from being alone. Always. My parents are introverts as well, although they're like me. We can be extrovert and conform to situations as needed, however we largely enjoy being alone in separate parts of the house doing our own things. My mom always enforced alone time when I was a child so she could recuperate. In high school, I was remarkedly quieter. Which was when I heard about this book. If I read this book in high school, I would have loved it. Finally, reasons why I am this way! Finally, a way to show that the extroverts I'm around are insane!Now I'm almost done with college. I'm completely different. Still an introvert, but also high school was very difficult for me. I was a transgender person living in the closet because I didn't want to deal with my peers. Now, I'm out and proud. I pass very well and I'm unafraid of people who may not accept me for who I am. Also in high school, I wasn't as adept at looking at arguments and seeing their flaws.So, if you want a positive review of this book, there are many out there. Almost everyone I'm friends with or follow who have read this book have rated it 4-5 stars.* Read those. This is not a positive review, even if I did like some things about the book.My first issue is that this book is basically a self-congratulation for Susan Cain. It reads as: ""Look at all of this information! See, the extroverts are wrong and we're right!"" It's written by an introvert for introverts. This book is basically a way to show introverts that they have loads of research on their side to make them better and whatever. But, leading into my second issue, Susan Cain denies that there's a bias. She'll list off all of this information and studies and they all imply the same thing. Introverts are better. Introverts are the ones we should look to. Introverts are better adapted in x, y, and z. Then, almost like that racist person most of us know, she throws her hands up and says, ""But I'm not biased!""My third issue is that someone who doesn't understand psychology shouldn't talk about it. Her theory about the rise of extroversion and how it's being promoted in businesses, schools, and other places is something she calls the new groupthink. Cain, that is not groupthink. Groupthink is the idea that people come together in groups and there is a lack of creativity. There is a person who rules the group and there's no way for dissenters to disagree with what's being said. Group polarization definitely plays a part in this, but it's not a new groupthink. Moreover, she starts randomly talking about psychopathy. (Maybe it was a jab at extroverts, but who the hell knows.) I'm in a class about psychopathy and, I hate to break it to you, psychopathy and sociopathy are not interchangable words.**My last complaint sort of ties in with my first, that this book is self-congratulatory. Every hypothetical situation that Cain talks about focuses on females. Because females are also the typical paradigm for introversion. She just focuses on females and their things. Probably because that's what she knows. And it was annoying. Talk about more than just women in your hypothetical stituations. Or, even better, be gender neutral! I know that people think that saying ""they"" is gramatically incorrect, but that's just not true. It's inclusive and honors that there are people out there that don't belong in the male/female binary.Basically, this book was good in some ways but my complaints outweigh them. It was well-written and competent in most places. The history of how our thinking changed from being more introverted to being extrovert is interesting. If she had left it there, I'd have been on board with it more. The only thing I'll take away that's positive is that I would use her chapter on school children and parenting. It was the tamest chapter that didn't show her bias.*There's one exception to this. One.**Sociopathy is more related with negative life events and life experiences. Psychopathy is that plus a genetic aspect. Sociopathy is also more like antisocial personality disorder, which is higher on different traits. If you look at the primary measure for psychopathy, ASPD is higher in the second factor while psychopathy is higher in the first factor. There's a whole lot of differences."
133,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4702450-rachel-the-book-harlot,3,"Say the word introvert and many people envision an antisocial loner hiding from the world. In Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, author Susan Cain dispels the myths and negative connotations associated with the word introvert. As she explains, the “word introvert is not a synonym for hermit or misanthrope. Introverts can be these things, but most are perfectly friendly."" Cain also tackles what it means to be an introvert in an American culture where being an extrovert is the ideal. The book highlights various findings of research and studies. One such finding is that introverts tend to be more sensitive to stimulation than extroverts, which I think leads to the stereotype of being antisocial. It’s not that introverts are particularly antisocial, it’s just that they find an abundance of stimulation draining. Where an extrovert needs to recharge by being social, introverts need time to recharge by spending some time alone. There was also a section offering advice for introverts on how to work in open space, team oriented business environments, which has become incredibly popular within the last twenty years, as well as advise for managers and business owners on how to create an environment that brings out the best of both introverts and extroverts. Cain points to studies that indicate the fallacy of open space environments being conducive to productivity and creativity. They have the opposite effect. Cain also includes a section for teachers and parents on working with introverted children. Despite these interesting tidbits, I found Quiet disappointing. I’m not sure what I was expecting, but I thought it would delve a little deeper. Much of the book felt sort of “surface” and shallow. A large portion felt like filler. The book was organized by topic, but it felt as though she jump around too much, which I think had the effect of making it feel as though she was glossing over things and not delving deeply. I also thought the section related to various Asian countries was overly broad. Instead of differentiating between them, she just lumped everyone under the umbrella of “Asian”. I get that she was trying to compare the Asian experience and culture with the American extrovert culture, but it would have been far more interesting if she had discussed introversion and extroversion from within the various cultures while also comparing their experiences east vs. west. Don’t get me wrong, it was interesting to read how the American culture of extroversion is perceived, but it could have been handled better. So, while Quiet offers interesting insight into the world of the introvert, overall I found it to be disappointing. While I still definitely think it's worth a read, I would recommend borrowing it from a library. Final rating: 3 stars"
134,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3081099-aimee,4,"Susan Cain gives the reader an in-depth look at the differences between people that are introverts and those that are extroverts. She uses stories of real people, psychological studies, and lots of research to show how being an introvert or an extrovert impacts our day to day lives. Susan Cain talks a lot about how our culture is turning more and more extroverted and she gives some helpful advice to introverts on how to survive and thrive in this extroverted culture.I really got a lot of good information from this book. I am an introvert myself and after reading the stories of the many people Susan Cain interviews for this book I feel like I am not so alone in my desire to stay home and read on a weekend night instead of going to a party. What struck me the most while reading this was how much being an introvert of extrovert effects so many aspects of our lives. There are a lot of scientific parts to this book including case studies of experiments done, descriptions on how are brains work, the fight or flight response, etc. These parts some people might find tedious or boring, but I found them very interesting and I learned a lot from them.The most important part of the book for me was the advice Susan Cain gives to introverts and parents of introverted children. She talks about making time every day to be alone to recharge, how to talk to the extroverts in our lives, and things teachers can do to help children who are introverted to have a better learning experience. Having introverted children I wish this book was required reading for all teachers in my school district. Quiet is an excellent book for those interested in psychology or those looking for more information on what it really means to be an introvert."
135,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5196337-emily,4,"I like the idea behind this book, but so far I'm not sure how well the author is succeeding in presenting her point.She makes it clear early on that ""introverted"" and ""shy"" are not the same thing...and then proceeds, at least in the early chapters, to fail to distinguish between the two.Preferring solitude and requiring alone time to recharge-hallmarks of introversion-are normal and healthy. Being pathologically incapable of functioning in a social situation because one is terrified of contact with other human beings-extreme shyness-is not.I am both introverted and shy. I wish I had been encouraged in my youth to be less shy. I missed out on a lot in school because I couldn't bring myself to ask for help when I didn't understand something in class.At least in these early chapters (I'm 17% in to the Kindle version), the author makes clear her disdain for the excessive extroversion preached by the likes of Tony Robbins and the Harvard Business School, but also seems to think that social anxiety disorders don't exist, or wouldn't if we didn't value personality over substance so highly.Finished the book last night. Interesting and gave me things to think about. This is another book I sort of wish I had in print, so I could flip around and look at certain parts again."
136,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,4,"Ironically, it took me a long time to read this book because every time I picked it up and focused on a page some twerp would start babbling inanities about some trifling matter or another, thereby legitimizing the subtitle of the book in question. As for the book itself: well written and utterly engrossing right up to the last chapter or two, in which Ms Cain holds forth generally on the care and handling and education of the introverted child. In spite of the slow finish, the book is definitely worth the time it takes to read it."
137,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37855949-subashini,2,"There were parts that I enjoyed reading in this book. I mean, all the things I’ve struggled with and had to deal with is laid out very clearly here, and it’s validating in that sense. To know that it’s a struggle for so many people. But something about the tone of this book didn’t sit right with me. I think it’s a subject that needs more attention and discussion, but I’m not sure this book is it? On one level, this had to do with my expectations of the book. I expected something a bit more thorough, and maybe a bit more radical in its outlook. For instance, if extraversion/extroversion has become a mode of life, and primarily seen as the only way to survive (i.e. make a living), then what is it about capitalism and modes of work under capitalism that forces people into these extremely rigid forms of permissible behaviour? One would think that would be a question that comes up. I mean, I get it, I can’t expect leftist politics in all my books but it’s just weird that instead of looking at introverts and people who struggle to be well-adjusted in a profit-driven society in terms of what might be systemic structures that contribute to this, it’s essentialised into personality traits or genes or weird evolutionary psychology-type theories.I was expecting a more rigorously researched social history of personality traits. Instead, there’s a bit of waffling and all sorts of theories cherry-picked at random. There is one section that cites the work of a scientist who talks about how certain physical traits embody the behavioural traits of an introvert. So there’s something there about being fair-skinned and blue-eyed and being more thoughtful and introspective or something. The author admits there’s something weird about that without calling this shit out for what it is: racist! Especially since she cites examples from Disney where “rough-featured” and darker-skinned people are portrayed as “brash”. So yes, identifying white Aryan features with thoughtfulness and introspective tendencies is tantamount to saying darker-skinned people without “delicate” facial features are lumbering oafs. You need to call that shit out in your book. Saying, “OK, hmm, that’s interesting but maybe kinda not good” is not being an objective journalist, it’s perpetuating fucked-up thinking that leads to eugenics.Also, there is an entire chapter saying that to be Chinese is to be an introvert. Well, I’m simplifying, but so does the author. And that’s precisely the kind of thing I don’t like in my nonfiction. I could not even believe this chapter passed the editing stage. I mean, what? Also, what about the racism Chinese kids deal with in American society? Does that not factor into their behaviour? How can everything boil down to introversion vs extroversion? There are all these social factors like gender, class, race, caste that are never addressed at all, in any intelligent way, in terms of how it might complicate the introvert vs extrovert schematics. There are parts that I liked and then there are these repetitive, waffly bits just sort of thrown in there to make a book. There are some sections that are illuminating, and would be great for parents and educators. But it’s sandwiched in-between the waffly stuff. And I get the sense that Cain is building a brand off of “quiet”. Like, it’s not about pointing out how people who are introverts and demeaned as shy, etc. might have some fundamental problems with society. That maybe they’re ill-adjusted to a rapacious, capitalist, profit-seeking nightmare society. But this book sort of dials that down and sort of suggests that there are ways to monetise your quietness. Cain dares to cite Rosa Parks. Parks did not try to adjust to white supremacy. She did not retreat into her cubicle to design computers and become a capitalist. She wanted a fundamental shift in how social relations are organised. Parks’ actions were radical. It demanded a change. This book, on the other hand, gently nudges you to adjust to how life is. So that you can get by and make some money and become successful in all the conventional ways. That’s weird, to me. That is far from a quiet revolution. It’s just capitulation, but with “introvert” as a label.On the other hand, a lot of introverts are outsiders, but no doubt a lot of them use various forms of social privilege to behave irresponsibly towards others and leave most of the emotional labour to women or people of colour. I mean, some are full-fledged psychopaths who have no doubt used “introversion” as a shield to become the kind of people who carry guns into a public place to shoot up people because girls don’t want to have sex with them. So there’s that. Just a very weird book. Muddled and strange. Life is a hell of a lot more complicated than a division between people who don’t know how to be alone vs those of us who just want to be left alone to read a book."
138,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4487924-ben,4,"A nagging sensation has pestered me incessantly through recent years. As I have not yet reached 30, I hope this sensation does not signify a mid-life crisis. However, I have recently felt a bit hopeless, that I will never find the American version of success through any profession or medium from which I experience a deep sense of passion or fulfillment.Listen, Ben...you gotta toughen up. The world's mean and doesn't care about you. Sure, your art was cute when you were a kid and I'm glad you had so much fun making books out of paper and tagboard in elementary school - it makes for great family reunion material. But, now, let's make sure we're obsessing over music at a reasonable level. And good Lord you read a lot! I can only imagine these words have reached the ears of many introverts as they come up in the world. To the listener, I have to assume that such words immediately translate into a dichotomous perspective of superiority and inferiority - valuable and wasteful. Of course, the listener instinctively categorizes themselves on one side of the split. Unfortunately, one might feel that their passions will never come to successful fruition in American consumerism because introverted tendencies and aspirations are just so darn undesirable - despite evidence to the contrary! Take music out of the schools! Those introverts need to learn how to make themselves note-worthy despite all the commotion of people competing to generate the next economic bubble! We would let them down if we did otherwise! Then quietly, someone suggests how music increases math and science scores. But the loud guy wins because that makes more sense than reasonable ideas.You want to be an art teacher?!?!? Good luck finding work.So on and so forth. But I'll quiet down now.Cain's book first inspired an emphatic resonance for me when she described the rise of personality over character - the evolution of American values from defining personal quality according to character and ethics to the sometimes shameless promotion of economic success as the determining factor for personal worth. I felt like a man at a rally speech violently shouting my fielty to Cain's message. Of course, all this happened in my head.Yet by deconstructing our current value system, showing how those values have shifted as described above, and exposing illogical idolization of extroversion as the means to American success, the introvert can confidently abandon feelings of low self-efficacy in a world that continually purges them to the outside rims. An introvert may find comfort on such fringes of parties, but I cannot concede that an introvert finds comfort in feeling unwanted, purged, worthless or diagnosable. Cain wields a wide variety of psychological and sociological research to make her point - introverts not only have value, but suffer under unfair stereotypes illogically associated with their preferences. Many of the reasons western culture idolizes extroversion make little sense. And along the path to this cultural sentiment, we've lost a sense of value for things previous generations would have died for: honor, integrity, etc. These qualities have not passed into extinction, but we have redefined their value according to what they can produce. And extroverts portray such characteristics as well! Cain made every attempt to describe the ideal of social and psychological balance between the traits; though I imagine many skeptics chastising her thesis anyway. If one were to read her conclusion first, it may sound as sentimental fluff - but her research! It lends unlikely credence to feelings expressed by many who have already considered the personality imbalance. To those who love quiet nights with a book with classical music blaring (I mean, subtly humming in the background), working in the office alone, who feel ashamed for wanting to avoid the party or ""going out"" in college (seriously...they talked about ""out"" like it was place down the street!), rediscover yourself through this book. Just because the status quo idolizes something, does not mean the disenfranchised should value themselves accordingly. After all, what group dynamic or sickness - racism, gender discrimination, etc - has not endured a similar enlightenment?"
139,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3000932-sara-alaee,4,"I’ve always counted myself an introvert so this book didn’t surprise me on how I could spot an introvert based on some specific traits. I already knew how! (You might know as well, but in case you don’t, you could take Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test or answer the twenty questions provided by the author in this book.) This book has useful and practical advice for those who want to live a better life (Really!) It is an important read for anyone interested in the introvert-extrovert psychology research. Many introverts find it difficult to live in a world dominated by extroverts. The society tends to value the gregarious go-getters, the loud talkers and the forceful presenters. Business environments are dominated by people who themselves are extroverts and have developed highly social skills. Schools and work areas are well suited for people with high interest in socializing, teamwork, constant connection and multitasking. Susan Cain feels this idealization wrong. She proves that introversion is real and indeed a necessary type of personality that should be valued. ""It might be sometimes helpful to pretend to be an extrovert, No big deal!"", she says. But in the long run, staying true to one’s own temperament is the key to finding work or the relationship he/she desires. Here is the summary of Mrs. Cain’s advice in her own words: “The secret to life is to put yourself in the right lighting. For some it’s a Broadway spotlight; for others, a lamplit desk. Use your natural powers—of persistence, concentration, insight, and sensitivity—to do work you love and work that matters. Solve problems, make art, think deeply.Figure out what you are meant to contribute to the world and make sure you contribute it. If this requires public speaking or networking or other activities that make you uncomfortable, do them anyway. But accept that they’re difficult, get the training you need to make them easier, and reward yourself when you’re done.Quit your job as a TV anchor and get a degree in library science. But if TV anchoring is what you love, then create an extroverted persona to get yourself through the day. Here’s a rule of thumb for networking events: one new honest-to-goodness relationship is worth ten fistfuls of business cards. Rush home afterward and kick back on your sofa. Carve out restorative niches.”And her final praise to introverts! :“We know from myths and fairy tales that there are many different kinds of powers in this world. One child is given a light saber, another a wizard’s education. The trick is not to amass all the different kinds of available power, but to use well the kind you’ve been granted. Introverts are offered keys to private gardens full of riches. To possess such a key is to tumble like Alice down her rabbit hole. She didn’t choose to go to Wonderland—but she made of it an adventure that was fresh and fantastic and very much her own.Lewis Carroll was an introvert, too, by the way. Without him, there would be no Alice in Wonderland. And by now, this shouldn’t surprise us.”"

For some it’s a Broadway spotlight; for others, a lamplit desk.""Mine is definitely the latter.I was impressed by all the scientific research and effort Cain had put in assembling and presenting each chapter. Her storytelling, also, is downright exquisite and compelling. I was hooked throughout despite that nagging boredom at times whenever she drifts into too much research data. These envelop each chapter's story in a circuitous fashion that is both enjoyable and persuasive, but can be boring if you're like me, eager to get the gist of it.I feel like I've come out with a decent understanding of extroversion and introversion after finishing this book. Although I admit, my reading would have been better were it not for my occasional dozes on the bus! I definitely need a second reading.Here is the sum of what I've learned, what I can recall at the moment at least and have the energy to put into writing:- Introverts are sensitive to novelty and social stimulation. They need solo time to recharge. They are often quiet and soft-spoken. They favor one-to-one conversations about deeper meaningful topics and feel awkward when it comes to small talk.- Extroverts are sensitive to familiarity and aloneness. They need social stimulation to recharge. They are often loud and have get-up-and-go style. They favor group conversations and are good in small talk.- Introverts need to develop an ""extroverted persona"" in order to cope with social demands. This is why the aforementioned characteristics can be deceptive in categorizing people at times. Introverts also need to establish ""restorative niches,"" solitary timeouts to recover from too much social stimulation.- Being loud and gregarious, speaking with confidence, has zero correlation with the 
soundness
 of 
ideas
. In other words, don't confuse social confidence with wisdom.- In relationships, during arguments, introverts tend to become silent and withdrawn. Their tone becomes cold and detached. Extroverts, however, tend to become talkative and direct. Their tone becomes loud and engaged. In other words, extroverts tend to 
hiss
 and 
bite
, whereas introverts tend to 
recoil
. This is when misunderstanding happens because extroverts tend to see 
hissing
 and 
biting
 as a sign of 
caring
 and 
love
; they see 
recoiling
 and 
silence
 as a sign of 
indifference
. The opposite is true for introverts. They see 
recoiling
 and 
silence
 as a sign of 
caring
.- Solution: introverts need to learn that it's okay to 
hiss
 and become argumentative. Extroverts need to learn that it's okay to 
recoil
 and become silent."

Oops, too late.[/update]I have finally finished this unbearable book of platitudes. ""Figure out what you are meant to contribute to the world and make sure you contribute it,"" she writes. ""Love is essential; gregariousness is optional."" And a good thing, too. ""Spend your free time the way you like, not the way you think you're supposed to."" If lines like this make you, like me, want to vomit, then you may want to reconsider spending your free time finishing this book like you think you're supposed to.This book had little interesting to say about introversion that could not be captured in a 60-second Google search. It seemed to me that the book's primary purpose was, in fact, to flatter introverts -- the book's likely audience -- by telling them that they are not alone and that they, too, could contribute Value to the world. One of the author's favorite gambits, for example, is to reveal that some of history's greatest and most successful personages -- Mahatma Gandhi! Rosa Parks! Warren Buffett! Eleanor Roosevelt! -- were introverts (ZOMG! We introverts are awesome, hooray, lulz!). ""None of this is to denigrate those who forget ahead quickly, or to blindly glorify the reflective and careful,"" the author hastens to explain. Except that it is, wink wink. She spends most of the book telling introverts what we already know about ourselves: that we are the way we are. (See, e.g., anectodal examples of introverts acting introverted, ad nauseum! And it's OKAY! Introversion is perfectly normal, guys! We're just mizunderst00d by those unfeeling, unthinking extroverts.)To be sure, the author offers some potentially useful advice for parents of introverts, and for teachers and managers (Be mindful that there are introverts in the world. Don't just structure the world around extroverts! 'kay, thanks!). But the main thrust of the book is Hooray Introverts!, Introverts Are Cool!, If You're An Introvert and Want to Hear All About How You Are Just As Awesome As Everyone Else Please Buy My Book!Consider this introvert utterly bored."

I thought introversion explains the behavioral term usually about tendency to hide feelings from others or personal preference to build walls around himself. I didn't know that my soft voice, risk-avoidance, reluctance in participating group activities, fear of public speaking, and solitude seeking were also characters of an introvert, instead, I just believed they were the flaws blocking me from being sociable person. In ""Quiet"", Susan Cain not only persuaded introverts to be not worried about their shy, cerebral and quiet qualities, but convinced them to make use of those differences.  Citing many references and researches, she almost made me believe that my introvert nature was inborn quality and cannot be changed with time and experiences. But shyness, quiet manners, fear of socializing can be covered through acting like an extrovert, if necessary. Hiding behind a rhino-skin, an introvert can be pseudo-extrovert. Loved the ideas and messages Susan Cain intended to deliver to her readers; they were powerful, clear, and immensely useful for the introverts who see themselves as freaks or anti-social ones. Also the examples were amazing, including stories of Rosa Parks, Mahatma Gandhi , Eleanor Roosevelt and Stephen Wozniak, all considered as introverts. Planning to read more psychology books."

Quiet is a wonderfully researched look into an introvert’s mind and life in this extroverted society. Cain cited dozens of scientific studies and researched as many people and books in her quest to explain why quiet people are the way that they are, and how they can thrive in today’s loud world.A large section of the book focused on introversion in the work place. I was glad Cain talked at length about open office plans and how studies have proven they're not that effective. The thought of an open office makes me want to cry. I would literally walk out of an interview if it was an open office - after explaining why, of course. The book did a good job of explaining how important it is to use your quiet skills, even while presenting or working in groups. At no point did Cain make this book into one glorifying the introverted person over the extroverted. She repeatedly emphasized the need for all types of people in order to create healthy environments and often compared the two. So often, I see memes or articles on the internet dissing extroverts for being loud and rude and I think that's a problem. I would happily read the extrovert version of this book. I'm giving Quiet four out of five stars. I loved the content and the careful research - that part really could not have been better - but some parts read rather slowly. "
144,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,3,"This book reminded me a lot of Willpower in that it also would have struck me as brilliantly illuminating if I had read it 15 years earlier. As it is, I thought this book about introverts did a good job of expressing things I already understand, such as the idea of understanding your own ""sweet spot"" of mental/social stimulation: ""Imagine how much better you'll be at this sweet-spot game once you're aware of playing it."" And this is a pretty good description of life inside my head: ""Introverts tend to sit around wondering about things, imagining things, recalling events from their past, and making plans for the future."" The closest thing to new information from this book, for me, was the discussion of how introverts can steel themselves to be more extrovert-like in the pursuit of things they care passionately about. That feels right, and I'd never quite thought of it that way.You would probably find this book more worthwhile if the concept of introversion were new to you and/or you recognize yourself in it. In a nutshell, introverts are people who tend to be thoughtful and conscientious, who take time to recover from social situations rather than gaining energy from them, and who are easily overstimulated, in part because they are very observant and notice more details."
145,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is an informative book about the value of being an introvert in a society that pushes people to be extroverted. The author cites research into the strengths and weaknesses of both introverts and extroverts, showing why both are important in business, relationships, and the classroom. She also writes about Eastern cultures that place more value on an introverted lifestyle than we find in Western culture. She encourages introverted individuals that spend their time in extroverted leadership positions to carve out restorative niches (quiet time, research, reading) in their day. Suggestions are included for parents to help their introverted child feel comfortable in the classroom and on playdates. The book was well researched and held my interest."
146,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,5,"A great book to read if you're an introvert as the majority of GoodReads readers probably are. You're not weird because you prefer to be alone with a book or have a small group of friends. You're an introvert who (at least in America) is surrounded by groups of extroverts.Being an introvert has great advantages - it is probably true that most of the great thinkers were introverts - but only if you can relate to extroverts sufficiently that you are not ignored or dismissed by your peers.I wish I had this book when I was growing up. As an introverted executive who spends much of their time with hugely extraverted executives, I have found over time many of the survival techniques given in this book for managing one's energy in an extravert world, but it would have caused much less dissonance along the way if I'd known why I seemed to act and value things so differently from my happy and talkative peers."

This book is full of insightful information about how being introverted can actually be a good thing in a world that generally perceives extroverted personalities as ideal. I especially liked the message that introverts can achieve great things not in spite of being introverted but because they are introverted (for example, introverted leaders are more likely to listen and value the input and ideas of those around them). Also, I had fun spouting off random facts to friends and family about why introverts are cool and explained to my husband that introverts and extroverts perceive different levels of noise as ""just right"" and he should be mindful of that (he's the definition of an extrovert and the bane of my existence because he's so LOUD).I'd highly recommend this book to any introvert or anyone who knows an introvert!"

I must take time to compose myself before committing to a full review, but know that without question it is one of the five most important non-fiction books I have ever read. EVER. I cried through the whole conclusion of the book, because this book was me, I identified with the children, and the adults, and to just know that I'm really not alone, that I really AM this way, is just so amazing. There is nothing wrong with being an introvert. There is nothing wrong with being an extrovert. We can change the way we interact with each other, teach our children, and structure our lives, and we can all strive for a better, healthier goal.P.S. If I could assign mandatory reading to the world at large, this would get assigned."

It's gold. As a hardcore introvert, this book resonated with me on every page and made so much of how I feel and see things and respond to things make so much sense. It was hugely helpful, absolutely brilliant, deeply insightful, fascinating, wise, and just so very good. ""The power of introverts in a world that can't stop talking"" -- YES. Introverts and extroverts alike-- read this and I promise you will understand people and yourself more clearly and it will change your life. Also-- Susan's TED talk is incredible too, if you're more into that sort of thing than you are into reading a whole book. Whatever you do, just soak up her goodness ASAP."

152,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132123-cyndi,3,"There are things about this book I really liked, especially all the tips on raising introverted children. Very good information.  My only problem was that I felt the author was harsh on the extroverts. I know she was trying to let introverts feel more important, but why is it necessary to say extroverts are clumsy, pushy and basically slow-witted? "
153,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5483197-ananthu,5,"“Why shouldn't quiet be strong? And what else can quiet do that we don’t give it credit for?” Before reading this book, I remembered the time I encountered the word ‘introvert’ for the very first time. Shy and quiet, crave solitude, seemingly unsocial  were some of the terms the author used to explain the word, and somewhere inside my mind, I screamed: This is so me! What followed was akin to the boundless joy every bibliophile across the globe must have experienced at least once: the sense of belonging; the assuring knowledge that you’re not alone, that there’s someone somewhere who can relate to what you feel, what you think. And there was something greatly relieving about the fact that to differ in traits with your peers is no big deal; that it’s all completely normal. You’re an introvert. Those people are extroverts. Two different personalities, that’s all.But it was only much later I realized that people mostly considered introversion as some kind of a flaw or disadvantage. Negative connotations are regularly employed whenever the word is uttered, and I've had my fair share of experiences as well. Extremely introverted was how someone dejectedly remarked about a peer who hardly socialized with anyone except a friend or two; anti-social, apathetic, selfish, moody socially awkward, misanthrope are only few of the large chunk of words used to “describe” introverts. We live in a culture that extols the Extrovert Ideal, where gregariousness is considered ideal, and quiet unacceptable. Susan Cain makes a compelling and engaging defense of introversion, and the book is filled with a perfect mix of scientific research and anecdotal evidences. The book did a lot of wonderful things to me. Most importantly, it took me back to all those times I had- consciously and unconsciously - behaved in ways that I couldn't fully comprehend or fathom back then, and answered all my Whys with clear and impeccable evidence; it has added a much needed sense of lucidity and clarity to my life; it gave me great dollops of inspiration (the striking image of the young Steve Wozniak working late into the night in his cubicle is still in front of me), and fanned my growing interest in neuroscience.“We know from myths and fairy tales that there are many different kinds of powers in the world. One child is given a light saber, another wizard's education. The trick is not to amass all the different kinds of available power, but to use well the kind you've been granted. Introverts are offered keys to private gardens full of riches. To possess such a key is to tumble like Alice down her rabbit hole. She didn't choose to go to Wonderland -- but she made of it an adventure that was fresh and fantastic and very much her own.” Quiet: the power of introverts.""In a gentle way, one can shake the world."" (Mahatma Gandhi)"
154,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6560108-nostalgia-reader,4,"PREACH, SISTER.This did not get a full 5 stars, as I would have liked to see more about how mental illness and introversion interact with each other (does one cause the other? how much harder is it for mentally ill introverts to act extroverted?), it really brought things into focus for me. Not only did it help me realize what being ""sensitive"" really meant, but it also solidly explained the cultural transition from neutral introversion to excessive extroversion (aka ""oh, that's why I've turned into a cynical misanthrope!"")I always thought that ""sensitive"" was a term used for people who were startled by anything and cried too easily. However, Cain explains sensitive introverts in terms that I found myself nodding along with--overly-stimulated senses, feeling anxious over small things, avoiding things that will over-stimulate... it all made much more sense, and I immediately started seeing points throughout my life where I showed sensitivity. It's not just feeling emotional, it's feeling connected to something so strongly that you just can't even. Oddly enough, though, I sometimes do seek out over-stimulating pieces of art because I can fall into them for hours at a time, picking them apart.But the best part, the chapter I want to memorize and quote at chipper interviewers and people who think presence and face is the only thing that will get you anywhere, is the first chapter. Cain explains how society used to be (blissfully) introverted, and how it abruptly changed in the 1920s to be extroverted--and has only gotten more extroverted since. The golden age of introversion is called the Culture of Character, when honor, sacrifice, and modesty was key, and how private life was more important than public life. But with the increasingly consumeristic and vain culture of the 20s, people started caring more about how they came across in public, creating the Culture of Personality (*cue the earworm*). It continued to grow until it's reached where it is now, where extroversion and putting your whole life out there is par for the course. People don't exist if they don't do that, and it makes it difficult to get by in the world today (at least in the U.S.). If you are introverted and would rather keep to yourself, society doesn't care--you need to fake extroversion to really get more opportunities.Unfortunately, no tips were really given if you would rather stay true to your introversion and not bow to the oversharing of your life.I had seen this book on feeds for a long time, but had thought ""I know I'm introvert, what more do I need to know?"" SO MUCH MORE apparently. It explained so many awkward points in my life and showed that introversion is totally normal and healthy and just as valid as extroversion--even if our narcissistic society tries to convince us differently."
155,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/392057-jennifer,3,"Every personality type assessment that I have ever taken has placed me smack dab in the middle of the E & I spectrum. I am equal parts Extrovert and Introvert, or as Cain describes it, I am an ambivert. The introvert in me loved this book. It is educational and empowering. Cain details the undervalued strengths of introverts in a society that tends to give preference to individuals who exude extrovert qualities (a theory called the ""Extrovert Ideal""). I found myself identifying with a lot of introvert qualifiers that she described. I think I was hooked within the first couple pages where she said something like ... it's not that introverts don't like going out and socializing, it's just that at some point in the evening there will come a time where they wish they were in their bed with a book. Umm ... yes.Cain not only made many points to identify with, but she also uses this book as a tool to explore biological explanations to being an introvert and studies that have demonstrated the strengths of introverts. The research that she cited was interesting and easy to understand. As compelling as this was to read, I have to say that it's not going to be for everyone. As I said, the introvert side of me loved this book. The extrovert in me - not so much. It's not that Cain discounts the strengths of extroverts. Just the opposite, in fact - she consistently recognizes that our society would fail to function without a balance of the two personalities. What she does is point out that there is a flawed societal desire to have everyone at least act like extroverts, even if they aren't one. In pointing out the pitfalls in that desire, Cain often makes extroverts appear as rash, unintelligent, and unaffected people. I'm sure that is not her intent, because she does so in a way to illustrate where listening to an introvert's voice could have prevented some big failures (aka the Wall Street Crash) and could help a business thrive. However, individuals who don't identify with introvert characteristics might not see this as the learning tool that it could be because she talks plenty about the downfalls of extroverts and it is hard not to get defensive.If you are an introvert, or think you might be, this is a great read. It helps explain and validate the introvert personality on a larger scale and empowers through recognizing the strengths of introverts and how to capitalize on them in a largely extroverted society."
156,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350233-casey,5,"Although the United States is the most extroverted country in the world, one third to one half of people are introverts. Introverts are often quiet people, the ones who would rather stay in on a weekend than go out to a party, the ones that need to recharge with solitude after giving presentations. Introverts are often deep thinkings and intimate friends, although our society (incorrectly) views them as passive and anti-social. In Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking, Susan Cain explains how Western society misunderstands the quiet among us.I do not count myself as one of the quiet ones. Indeed, I'm one of the extroverts, and I'll go so far as to say that no one has ever called me quiet. I know I'm an extrovert, because I look forward to giving presentations (the bigger the audience, the better). I get antsy when I don't have a party to go to on Friday night, and I recharge after a long day of work by socializing. Plus, I'm going to spend a large portion of this review talking about myself. Cain's book makes me realize that I also possess some traits that are more characteristic of introverts. I spend a fair amount of time with my nose buried in a book, and I'm hopelessly bad at multitasking. I'm not a fan of group work (unless I can be completely in control of the group), and I would certainly consider myself an intellectual. As Cain points out, no one is completely an extrovert, nor is anyone completely an introvert. Extroverts, however, flourish in American society, while introverts are often forced to pretend to be extroverts.Particularly interesting is the chapter on raising introverted children. I don't have children, nor do I have plans to gestate a human being anytime soon, so I was surprised at how much I got from this section. After reading it, I realized how difficult school must have been for the shy ones, the ones that ""never spoke up"" in class. It's clear that I got undue praised for being bossy and talkative. Who knows how many kids my teachers ignored while I blabbed on endlessly about who knows what.Throughout the book, Cain argues that introverts should be cultivated, that their unique abilities (such as the deep focus that so often eludes me) should be valued. I agree, and I think she should take her argument one step further: extroverts should try to bring out their introverted sides. Maybe, instead of telling introverts to be louder, we should all try to become more quiet."
157,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27068311-amy,5,"This book answered so many questions for me and has already helped me to become better at setting up my work environment to be more productive and satisfied with decisions I make. In my line of work, being forceful, making quick decisions and aggressive management are things that get you noticed and praised. I have learned to integrate some of these things into my work style, but it makes me feel very fake and unsettled. I don't encounter a lot of other people like me, likely because I don't take the time to socialize beyond the people I need to get work in my area done. This book has given me a lot of valuable tools for planning to further my career and how to work with people who are not like me and do not recognize my strengths or know how to capitalize on them. It also made me feel free to stop doing a lot of things I've contrived in my work personal to ""fit in"" which I have continued even though they have not lead to the desired effect. It helped me sort out that while I do care deeply about not hurting or offending others, I do not care if others ""like"" me or enjoy working with me. It also made sense of why I feel very empathetic when I see others experiencing strong emotions, but rarely feel strong emotions myself. The end of the book gave some very helpful insight into raising children who are introverts and it was very affirming to find that I have already been doing many of the suggestions the author has for helping introverted children become comfortable in school and other social settings while also encouraging them to be who they are. I listened to the audio book version of this publication, the narrator was excellent. Her tone and cadence really lent itself to the material and I'm glad I listened to this book rather than reading it. I highly recommend this book for those who are introverts, live with an introvert, or are raising an introvert. I especially enjoyed learning more about the research on ""free traits"" and how adaptable we can be when we are doing things we believe in. It was just an excellent, well-researched and well-thought-out book."
158,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4929450-amanda,4,"I picked this book up because I am both introvert and shy. I wanted to see what Cain had to say about introverts. I agree with Cain’s assertion that American culture idolizes extroverts, making them the idea to strive for. As a teacher, I find myself carefully waking a tightrope. I can deeply empathize with my introverted students but I am also expected to grade these students based on their participation and how much they speak out in class.I thought Kagan’s data regarding qualities of babies and predicting temperament to be quite interesting. I wasn’t aware of the scientific community moving away from nature versus nurture debate moving into one that values both equally.I agreed with the author’s assertion that an introvert‘s heightened sensitivity may enhance his or her capacity to experience empathy. I also agreed with her statement that Individuals who are threat sensitive tend to be more cautious about losses and punishments. I have known many extroverts that were so interested in chasing the next high that they weren’t even aware of the changing emotions of someone around them.I totally related to the far east’s ideal of putting community needs over those of the individual. I would be interested in learning more about soft power and reading about examples of a circumstance in which someone used a soft power approach in a negotiation.My main critique is that this book supplied an overabundance of statistics and data, in my opinion. I feel like this book could have been condensed and it wouldn’t have seemed like information overkill. I couldn’t quite figure out if Cain is anything besides a writer, such as a psychologist or the like. She collected so much empirical data that I was wondering if this also plays into her job. Overall, this was a good book and I’d highly recommend it for anyone wanting to get to know the introvert in the life better."

It took me quite a while to really grasp that I am an introvert, and more than that, to understand that there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. Once I learned and accepted my personality, I have found so much more peace and balance in my life. This book has further helped me understand the way that I am, and I think it could do remarkable things for extroverts - to help them understand the mind of introverts. All people could benefit from reading this. Introverts, extroverts, teachers, businessman, everybody really... I know I, for one, am tired of people telling me to go out more, be more social, hang out, get used to a lot of stimuli, whatever... And when I try to explain being an introvert, I feel like people who aren't introverts look at it as a disease that needs to be cured. If this personality type was more understood...oh, the possibilities!The 4-star rating comes predominantly from my expectations. I just expected something else. This book is so incredibly well-researched. The time and effort Susan Cain took to create this, brava!

When I saw this book, I couldn’t resist. Call it what you want- morbid curiosity or whatever, but something compelled me to pick this up.Not gonna lie, I low key expected some extrovert bashing. After all, the subtitle is- “The power of introverts in a world that can’t stop talking.”- which seemed almost like a jest at extroverts. I don’t wanna be known as someone who can’t stop talking!!! But when I opened the book I didn’t find any extrovert bashing. I found a well written book that was just trying to speak for the introverted population. Loving yourself for your own personality and not trying to change and be like someone else.

Susan doesn't recommend that all us introverts curl up in a ball in the dark, she encourages us to push our boundaries; all the while questioning where these boundaries are set.This book was affirming and even though I am proud of my personality, it gave me more confidence in who I am and that my behaviours are normal and should not be viewed negatively."

The problem is that so much of this book is a treatise on the power introverts, or it’s a cheerleading book for introverts. I did love how the book described the world through and introvert’s eyes. It was an eye opener. I flipped through a magazine as I was in the middle of this book; every ad, every article was an attack on the senses, a colorful celebration of the extrovert or extroversion. Sexy men in cologne ads stared with open face; people partied on cruise ships; colors burst all over each page. Reality programs celebrate the outgoing, loud, and even obnoxious over the quiet, steady, and thoughtful person. It’s as if the introvert doesn’t have a say, a role model in our culture.I also love how this book outlined the difference in American culture – a culture of extrovert ideal – versus a more Eastern look at personality. Ever wonder why so many times, people from Eastern countries do better at math and science? It’s because their value in introversion respects patience and working alone. (I still think these sections went on longer than they needed to, but that seems to be a flaw with the book.)The other area I found fascinating is the section that discussed the qualities of introversion and extroversion in all of us, how we can pull on these ideas and practice them based on the role we are in at a given moment. Information on high self-monitoring (adjusting to social situations) versus low self-monitoring (not adjusting, staying to task) was fascinating. Cain outlines how introverts become good speakers and negotiators. She also mentions (in brief passing) how more extroverted people can practice more quiet, contemplative skills in listening and doing. And Cain knows that, even when we practice flexibility, we will wear out after a while and go to our area of comfort.I have to admit; I am not as much of an extrovert as people think I am. I fake it. I have found tricks for introducing myself to strangers at parties, but given my druthers, I’d rather stay around the neighborhood with people I know. Even though I sometimes act noisy and energetic, I actually often feel uncomfortable with super-showy, loudness (which is why many characters on reality television make me wince.) I don't like performers whose primary purpose is to pull focus and grandstand. I love performers who interact well. In some social situations, I worry about my graciousness level, because I often am thinking to myself, “I don’t care; I’d rather be at home with my latest book,” when someone is telling me something. I hate, hate, hate watching people get publicly embarrassed. If I am watching a live performance where someone has the chance of being humiliated, I start to stare at the curtain or the floor. On TV programs with this, I’ve often turned off the TV before it gets too bad. On the other hand, I also feel uncomfortable around people who haven’t kicked in their slightest social skill, the basics needed to help others start and keep up conversation.So this book has taught me that I’m more of an ambivert (probably, honestly, leaning toward extroversion). I do have moments of stir-crazy where I just need people. However, there are other moments – moments when I am in the flow and getting things done – when I would rather be left alone to finish a task, write on a play, and problem solve. I sometimes even need time alone just to daydream, vent, nap, and recharge. I like this. I feel for the introvert among us. And if I can be more sensitive and help with the socialization and comfort of them, I feel like I won’t miss out on a wonderful person, just because he or she may be a bit quieter and a bit more deliberate."

Susan Cain tries to help people understand the importance of introverts and why we need a balance between the two personality traits. Susan is an introvert herself and found her job as a lawyer expected an extroverted personality. However embracing her introversion, she was able to prove herself a valuable employer and lawyer; so much so that she went on to become a negotiations consultant.Quiet is a book that seeks out to explain the need for introverts, while also looking at the history between these two personality types. I myself am extremely introverted and my Myers–Briggs Type Indicator is INTJ (this can change over time but I will not go into that at the moment). I found it useful to understand the history in how society deals with introverts; some of which still feels very relevant today. I remember reading sections focusing on the 1950s and 60s, thinking this happened to me and is still happening in today’s society. This leaves me to think that people do not have an understanding on the personalities and how to manage introverts.Susan Cain goes into a lot of detail with suggestions on how to fit into such an extroverted world, from developing a pseudo-extroverted personality to finding a quiet place to work. Obviously it does depend on your different situations but I think there were some interesting ideas to implement. She also goes into the problems with open offices and productivity levels as well as the extroverted nature of church. I was surprised by just how much this book covered.I really enjoyed Quiet and feel like I learnt a lot, however it just makes me want to learn more, especially about the history (it is a vicious cycle). I want to give this book to my parents because I think they might actually benefit in learning about the topic. In fact I want to give this book to everyone, I feel like it is an important topic and we need to know that people are different and need to be treated differently. This is another book to fulfil my passion for learning about psychology and I would happily take some recommendations based on this book.This book originally appeared on my blog; http://www.knowledgelost.org/book-rev..."

In common with many similar books and writers (e.g Malcolm Gladwell), the main points can easily be summarised in a few pages however, in order to create a book, the central ideas have been filled out into c300 pages of science, research, social history, questionnaires, and anecdote, much of which adds little to the central message. I got impatient throughout the many sections which felt like padding and added little to the central thesis.Susan Cain's book contains some important, timely and provocative messages that are worth understanding. That said, it's not necessary to read the book to grasp the key points, which can be understood more quickly by watching this TED talk and/or reading the book's summary on Wikipedia.3/5"
174,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16375752-anusha-narasimhan,4,"After watching Susan Cain’s TED talk, I wanted to read her book immediately. While the TED talk made me feel that she is talking about me and expressing my thoughts, the book induced some valuable self-realization and self-validation.I needed almost a month to complete it and still felt that I should have taken it up slower. I could not read more than a few pages at a time, because I had to constantly pause and reflect on what I read. Holding this book in my hand, I was either nodding my head in agreement or digging up past memories related to whatever I was reading. This is one of my favourite books because it made me accept my traits and encouraged me to face my fears.The book tends to glorify introverts and should be taken with a pinch of salt. I would still recommend it to everyone. Whether you are an introvert or an extrovert, if you ever wanted to understand people who are quiet, introverted or sensitive, this book is for you.Full review in my blog:https://anushanarasimhan.com/2015/10/..."
175,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15978152-aoife-lennon,5,I loved this book. Well researched. It helped me understand more things about myself. I'm an introvert and I'm also highly sensitive. I particularly liked the chapter on quiet children. 
176,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35088694-carly-friedman,5,"This was a terrific review of the research on introversion and extroversion. I especially appreciated the balanced and nuanced discussion of the strengths of both personality types. She has great tips on the best ways to make use of your relative strengths and interact with others. Also, she is convincing in explaining how everyone can learn and benefit from the best of both introversion and extroversion.A more detailed summary of my reaction to most of the chapters:The introduction immediately caught my attention. As cheesy as it was, I enjoyed the opening story of Laura the lawyer. In the first chapter, she did a good job of defining introvert and extrovert, explaining the complexities of these definitions, and differentiating introversion from shyness. I also appreciated the discussion of how economic forces and advertising led to the increasing emphasis on extroversion. In chapter 2, I thought the part about Tony Robbins was funny and interesting. I also like the research on successful business leaders and how they are often not extroverts. The research that suggests that it really depends on a good match between leader and employee personality and behavior makes total sense but was new to me. In both chapters, the ""culture of character"" versus ""culture of personality"" was interestingThe section on workplace structure and productivity was really interesting! The gist is that workplaces are most productive when employees have their own space to retreat to. Cubicles are not evil! It makes total sense to me that the most productive workplaces have a mix of open space for collaboration and smaller, personalized spaces for individual work. Cain did a great job discussing the research on how personally is due to both nature and nurture. One important point is how our personality in childhood guides us to environments that encourage certain behaviors. Reading alone in your room develops different skills than playing in large groups. In this section, the story of the extrovert who has learned from introverts in her life is a good example of the strength of the introvert personality. I wasn’t as interested in the part about public speaking. The information on optimal arousal level made so much sense to me. I have a very low threshold for sensory input. I hate roller coaster, scary movies, even too much noise. My poor family knows that they can’t talk to me for too long before I have to retreat. I was even fascinated by the concept of highly sensitive people. I have always been suspicious of the concept - it seemed too touchy-feely or an excuse for wimpy behavior- but the way she described it makes sense. I was interested to learn that they may be more detail-oriented, feel more guilt, and dislike violence.The sections on cultural differences in introversion and extroversion and how to best deal with personality differences in romantic relationships were also informative and engaging. The final section on raising introverted kids was really helpful. My daughter is 8 years old and I think she is pretty introverted. She is a SUPER friend, highly sensitive and generous, and super fun in small groups. She definitely prefers to have a few close friends. The tips in this chapter will definitely come in handy."
177,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75748905-elizabeth,3,"Like the hundreds of thousands of people who picked this up before me, I am an introvert. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking speaks to those of us who prefer curling up with the good book in bed to the late-night parties, who prefer the one-on-one conversations over the group get-togethers. It's the validation and the relatability we've always wanted, and not surprising, either. And that makes me wonder, how many extroverts were and are motivated to pick this up? I'm curious as to how the content, geared towards introverts, would relate to an extrovert.There's something alluring about figuring out the many-faceted intricacies of personality, and we can derive a sense of comfort or ""a ha! so relatable"" moments when we place ourselves along Myers-Briggs spectrums or Enneagram types. Extroversion-introversion has always been one of the most fascinating, as I've grown up with both extremes for parents. Before I embraced my introversion, I grew up idolizing how well my mom could navigate and chatter her way through any social situation. (I swear, much to my disbelief, every National Book Festival, she'd become best friends with the person standing in front or behind us in line! How?!). That was so far from who I was, and it was so easy to fall deceptively in pursuit for the Extrovert Ideal. So it's a comfort when Susan Cain shows us how classrooms and corporate workplaces are structured heavily towards the group/open settings of extroverts but then highlights a number of introverts who have flourished in their careers and adult lives. Cain expertly wields her previous background as a corporate lawyer and journalistic sense to communicate numerous psychology studies. I found that some sections of the book felt too heavy on the speculation without being backed by a compelling research finding; in many cases, extroverts felt unnecessarily demonized in order to add extra luster to qualities of introverts. This was a solid, quick read, though I wouldn't call it essential reading. Much of what is touted in this book is familiar, especially if anyone has any layman's background on psychology. More than 8 years after this book was published, I think we've made heartening strides in shining light on the ""soft"" power that these quiet and reserved people have in spades, and we can look back to Susan Cain as having had an important role in striking up a public and modern conversation about it. And to everyone thereafter that has spoken up, I say: thanks, fellow introverts! :) I love you guys <3 "
178,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6472547-lady-jane,5,"This is an amazing book for both the soft-spoken introverts who live in a noisy world that won't hear them, as well as for the extroverts who share work or home space with them. This is also a great book for ambiverts, sociologists and behavioral psychologists who may profit from the research findings and speculations revealed in this book.My favorite types of works are not only those to which I can relate, but also those that challenge the tyranny of the majority. Susan Cain does just that by questioning what she calls the ""Extrovert Ideal."" She states that we live in a society that values gregariousness over reflectiveness and verbosity over creative insight. It was refreshing when I came across Susan's blog for the first time and read in the Introvert Manifesto statements such as follows:1. There’s a word for “people who are in their heads too much”: thinkers.9. Everyone shines, given the right lighting. For some, it’s a Broadway spotlight, for others, a lamplit desk.15. Love is essential, gregariousness is optional.In a world in which almost every product, literary or otherwise, is aimed at convincing you to be something you are not, I was instantly mesmerized by the promise of this book to teach introverts to use their natural gifts to the fullest. The author talks about ""soft power,"" which is the type of power that people like Mahatma Ghandi, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Rosa Parks used to achieve their ends. In fact, Cain devotes quite a large portion devoted to the latter two activists. She also mentions how Moses from the Old Testament was actually ""dreadfully timid,"" by today's standards, yet Yahweh chose him to carry on the holy operation of the story. Even though we are referring to fiction, it is wise to remember that the hero of every story ever written is invented to fit the image of the author's ideal. It is interesting to note that in older times in a different culture, quiet leadership was valued over the rambling of the typical American extrovert.It is quite dreadful that we live in a society that requires people to act like overcaffeinated, hyperpseudoconfident chatterboxes in order to be taken seriously. Susan Cain states, ""It's so easy to confuse schmoozing ability with talent. Someone seems like a good presenter, easy to get along with, and those traits are rewarded."" Even one of the entrepreneurs Cain interviewed expressed worry that ""there are people who are put in positions of authority because they're good talkers, not because they have good ideas"" (52). Apparently our culture is still in that sophomoric stage of humanity in which people are easily swayed by appearance. Just as I frequently express in my blogs, we value not the best ideas, but those who have the best sweet-talking and acting skills.""So may the outward shows be least themselvesThe world is still deceived in ornamentIn law, what plea so tainted and corruptBut being seasoned with a gracious voiceObscures the show evil?""Merchant of Venice, 3.2.73-77, William ShakespeareIn the business arena, people tend to act rashly and exude confidence, because showing the slightest doubt in their prospects would lead investors to abstain from investing in their companies. The world truly does not work on substance or merit, but on the appearance of these traits. Quiet challenges these cultural norms by suggesting that the extrovert majority pay more attention to the introverts, who may ""seem stark mute but inwardly do prate"" (Queen Elizabeth, ""On Monsieur's Departure""). It is interesting to observe that in a business world dominated by histrionic and aggressive extroverts who act before they think, so many companies have failed.I love chapter three because it challenges the mainstream and blind reverence for ""teamwork."" Cain observes that we tend to organize our most important institutions in highly detrimental ways: ""It is the story of a contemporary phenomenon that I call the New Groupthink-- a phenomenon that has the potential to stifle productivity at work,"" because the best ideas are diluted with the majority consensus. The author suggests that in the most ideal situations extroverts and introverts would contribute their individual best for common good-- the former in public domains and the latter in the theoretical and aesthetic, which are fields that are repeatedly shown to be the best for introverts. Another aspect that I love about Quiet are the frequent references to literary classics. One can tell Susan Cain is well-versed in the classics, which is not surprising considering her impressive education from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. I love how she characterizes the evolution from ""Culture of Character"" to ""Culture of Personality"" by referring to the timeless works of the respective age: ""While poets of the previous century had wandered lonely as a cloud through the countryside (Wordsworth, in 1802) or repaired in solitude to Walden Pond (Thoreau, in 1845), Eliot's Prufrock mostly worries about being looked at by eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase' and pin you wriggling, to a wall"" (31). These three works are in my list of favorites, and I feel the melancholy of her observation and the resignation to the reality that the majority has created.I also really enjoyed the chapters that delve into the physiological differences between extroverts and introverts (mostly Part Two). I learned some interesting things about how the more reactive one's amygdala, the less likely one is to seek the new situations, risks and meetings on which extroverts thrive. However, high-reactive introverts tend to be ""more likely to develop into artists and writers and scientists and thinkers because their aversion to novelty causes them to spend time inside the familiar-- and intellectually fertile-- environment of their own heads"" (110). Of course, there is also free will and the book does advise that sometimes it is good to pretend to be an extrovert for the sake of achieving one's goals in the world as it is. One can actually pretend to do as the Romans do, but only so much and not without a ""restorative niche"" (214), because introverts are often more prone to burnouts because we are more sensitive to the burdens of duplicity. I cannot possibly reveal more about the book without spoiling it, so please make sure to get your copy! You will not regret it, regardless of your personality type. It is an insightful read filled with relevant research findings, brilliant commentary, and peppered with entertaining side remarks that will make you chuckle while you learn."
179,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68659711-franziska,4,"I really loved this book! I am a person that can proudly say: I am both, introvert and extrovert. Most of my friends would describe me as outgoing and someone who wants to experience as much as possible. Also in normal times I am more on the road to meet friends and experience life. But I am also someone who loves deep talks and thinks before I speak (up). So I was so glad to feel myself perfectly described in several chapters of the book and I also loved learning about different cultures as well. I, as a scientist, love books with scientific references about experimental studies. So this book was the perfect mixture between scientific proof and ""just"" experience the author makes in several meetings. So I can totally recommend it. :) "
180,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15896137-olivia,4,"So many times while reading this- as I imagine countless others too- I just thought, yup, that's me! I literally wrote that several times in the margins XDThoroughly researched (this books boasts 250+ references at the end!!!), this managed to still be engaging because she does a great job of looking at various aspects of introversion and the introversion-extroversion spectrum. And it was approached with such understanding. I especially liked reading about introverts in the workplace. I was really interested to read both the science and experiments/studies, and the theories underlying it all, along with the history of how we got to the current state of interaction today (particularly in the US). Though I should note, since it started out after the introduction with that historical context, it can read kind of dense right at the beginning. But in the end I didn't mind much because, again, it was interesting.Susan Cain has a business/financial background and, thus, many examples (more than I expected) and case studies reflected that. At times I thought there were perhaps too many examples or past researcher's work she was discussing, but I go back and forth because that is also what makes it so thorough. I do think extroverts kind of got the short end of the stick in this sometimes- LOL. It wasn't that she talked negatively about them, and she points out how everyone has their own power in wherever they lie on the spectrum, but I thought some of the descriptions of extroverts had slightly negative connotations.All in all, I would recommend this to anyone wanting (well researched) insight on introverts- which is to say- anyone who knows anyone because you more than likely interact with introverts daily or are one. :)"
181,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422493-patty,5,"I always knew I was an introvert, so no surprise there, but I am not shy, not even a little bit. But I am quiet, in the sense of, if I have nothing to add then I don't talk, why would I when I don't have anything to say, that hasn't already been said, or is already known.This is a very well researched book, and it should be enlightening to both introverts and extroverts, and helpful in the workplace and with family and friends. I could see specific examples that exists in me and my husband, him being the extrovert. This book helps me to understand the extrovert. It also helps me to understand myself better and explains why I do what I do. Therefore this is a great book for people period if they want to understand others.Living in an extroverted world can be exhausting sometimes. Why is everyone always talking, about nothing, it seems sometimes they are yelling, ""look at me,"" and it is very tiring. I have always thought that all this talking is about people needing to be heard, needing their self esteem to be validated by the listener, but now I guess this is just part of being an extrovert. Although not all by any means speak so very much about nothing.This book is broken down into four sections. Part One is ""the extrovert ideal,"" and how much businesses place on one being an extrovert, this explains my inability to find employment. Just kidding. It also speaks about how too much collaboration hampers creativity, because everyone is so busy sharing ideas that no one does much of anything. Part Two is about the biology behind both introverts and extroverts, and nature vs nurture. The author gives great examples about a variety of people in business and how their personalities fit into this world. Part Three is about our different cultures, specifically Asians vs Americans. I think I like Asians, although I have never actually known one. Part Four is the differences of introverts and extroverts and how we can love each other and raise children that are different from ourselves. I think all teachers and parents should at least read part four for invaluable insight. This book could be used to teach teachers how to treat children as individuals rather than extroverts.At the back of the book are notes. I know I will refer back to these notes to read parts of this book again and again.""The secret to life is to put yourself in the right lighting. For some it's a Broadway spotlight; for others, a lamplit desk. Use your natural powers--of persistence, concentration, insight, and sensitivity--to do work you love and work that matters. Solve problems, make art, think deeply."" (pg 264) I love that paragraph, and it speaks to both introverts and extroverts, personally I love the lamplit desk.Someone commented that most of us are not all introvert or all extrovert, but rather a mix of both, yes with some of us more one than the other, but not necessarily the extreme of either, and I must say this is true for me.Quiet, yes I require quiet time, more than most, a time to re-charge myself so I can go back into the world again. I have been trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my life, work wise I mean, and I just can't figure it out. What do I like to do? I like to read, and absorb new information, a new way of thinking, I like learning just about anything, but most of all I like to figure out why people do what they do and why they are like they are, and I think reading helps me to do just that, but now the real question is how to find a profession that allows me to do that. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated."
182,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5601183-kamila-kunda,2,"I had very high expectations beginning to read “Quiet. The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking” by Susan Cain, but ended up being very disappointed. The subtitle alone should ring alarm bells. Cain is a typically US-centric author who sees the whole world from her own perspective and does not seem to acknowledge a multitude of points of view or cultural diversity. Her assumption, which she tries to present as ‘the Truth’ throughout the book, is that the whole world favours extroverts. The whole world except Asia, or rather Chinese-Americans, whom she presents as sole representatives of the entire Asian continent and all Asian cultures. The book is clearly written for Americans and presents plenty of case studies from her own playground, which are not very applicable to other cultures, often focusing on other values. There is not a word about European cultures (even though many times Cain presents The US under the umbrella term ‘the West’, which is very misleading, as European - Western - cultures are very diverse, much more than she is aware of), African or South American ones. Readers get the impression that the whole world functions according to American standards and that is a gross misconception.From an author as highly acclaimed and praised as Cain I would except a much better research and balance of presented cases. Cain devotes ten pages to some workshops for extroverts, one page to a story of an introvert musician, three pages to her observations of a discussion among school students - both extro- and introverts, and many pages to various stories of extroverted and introverted business people, usually from the financial sector. There is little coherence, there is not enough analysis, and way too much focus on the corporate environment. Often I had an impression that I was reading a pseudo-intellectual business self-help book (heightened by cringeworthy chapters’ titles), the genre I never ever lay my hands on. If she uses a case study of a person in the limelight it is always a businessman giving presentations or sales pitches, never an actor, singer or a person working in a non-profit sector. The choice of people whose stories Cain decided to present is very poor and narrow, and the stories themselves sound often very repetitive. What put me off was also a lot of emphasis on success and making money, which, as Cain was trying to show, introverts can achieve too. I consider myself an introvert, who enjoys spending plenty of time on her own, loves talking on profound, complex topics, hates big parties, shallow small talk and people talking loudly, who doesn’t care about fame, wealth and status, who favours harmony over conflict, who is perceptive and inquisitive, serious and quiet rather than jovial and gregarious, who is sensitive and emotional with a tendency to melancholy and nostalgia, who has a big heart and a strong conscience. And who is confident, has rather high self esteem and who doesn’t seek others’ attention or approval to live how she wants. I grew up in an environment which favoured introverts and from a young age I was able to thrive academically and socially as myself. I never thought there must be something wrong with me and I always sought company of people who shared the same values and interests - there were many around me. I read “Quiet”, wanting to learn more about making better use of my introversion, but the narrow scope of Cain’s research and the monotonous style of the book left me uninspired and bored. The topic has so much potential and Cain wasted it completely."
183,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,3," 3 stars - It was good.The Myer Briggs personality test pegs me consistently as an INTJ. As a female INTJ, I am part of the most rare, MB personality type gender grouping, making up less than 1% of the population. I don't say that to proclaim being ""special"", though I do have one super power... I say that to point out that I knew long, long, long ago at a very young age that I was a bit different from the other little boys and girls. While that made high school and its pseudo-forced conformity more interesting, somewhere along my mid-20s I just accepted that I would be happiest much of the time on a different path from most, and that was ok. Life has been better since. Most of this book I found to be slow and dry, even though the subject matter is interesting to me. The problem was that there was very little new or unknown information presented, as I was already aware of most of the points. There is a strong, repeating theme of ""these are the things that make introverts so freaking awesome"" throughout this book, and while there is clear warning of such in the book title, I would think that this book would be a painful read for extroverts. It's even painfully slow at times for introverts (unless you know next to nothing about basic personality groups).In contrast to the rest of the book, her conclusion chapter, while succinct, was beautifully written with excellent life wisdom for introverts in particular, but for everyone in general. While again, I have already figured much of this out (most of it the hard way), it could be life changing advice for those still trying to squeeze themselves into a mold for which they do not fit. I specifically love that she points out that if you don't want to go out to a crowded, smoky place full of drunk people that don't understand, let alone respect personal space on New Year's Eve, then don't. That may seem obvious to most of us, but I didn't have it figured out yet in my early 20's. It would have been a nice thing to know. If you are thinking of bailing on the book, definitely read her conclusion and sweet dedication note regarding her grandfather before putting the book down. In my humble opinion, she saved the best for last.P.s. From 3rd grade on, I have absolutely despised ""group work"", both in school settings, and with career/workplace settings. I hate all versions of this dreaded, mandatory, counter-productive activity. Now I completely understand why. (Why I hate it, that is. I still don't understand the purpose. No one understands the purpose of group work. No one.)P.s.s. My super power is an abnormal, seriously ridiculous, keen sense of smell. And yes, I do know that is incredibly lame. As Susan Cain points out, we don't get to choose which special magic powers we are granted -- we just make the most of them.----------------------------------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Introverts are offered keys to private gardens full of riches. To possess such a key is to tumble like Alice down her rabbit hole. First Sentence: I have been working on this book officially since 2005, and unofficially for my entire adult life."

I enjoy going out and seeing my friends, but I’m often relieved to come home to a quiet house where I can unwind on my own. I love thinking critically, but I’m rarely the first person to leap into the discussion. And in a culture that seems to value extroversion over nearly every other trait, I’ve always been made to feel slightly insecure about these things. Susan Cain’s book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking helped me change my outlook.Quiet presents an idea that Western society so often seems to contradict: that being introverted isn’t a bad thing; our brains just work differently than extroverts’ do. As extroverts have their own strengths, we have our own, and the world needs a balance of both types of people to function well. It needs the people who can go out and charm the pants off of clients, and it also needs people who are thoughtful and perceptive.This book was really enlightening for me. It was so validating! I’ve always thought that my dislike of small talk, need to unwind in solitude, and the intense guilt I feel whenever I do something wrong are unusual and problematic. Quiet, however, taught me that these are simply common traits of introverts and that there’s nothing inherently wrong with these things. Roughly one third to one half of people are introverts! It’s not just me! Plenty of people feel like I do, and that makes me feel so much more comfortable with myself.This book also helped me realize what strengths I have, as an introvert: I think carefully before I speak; the quality of my communication is more important to me than the quantity. I am a creative thinker. (Did you know that most really creative people are introverts? They need quiet and solitude to think without interruption.) I process information deeply and will listen carefully to all points of view. I think before I act, I can stay on task for long periods of time without giving up, and I work accurately. The list goes on!Quiet is really well researched, and Cain includes many interesting studies that illustrate her points. It’s a very readable book, and nearly every page held some fascinating new piece of information that I just wanted to tell everyone — hey, did you know?I highly recommend this book. If you’re an introvert, Quiet will teach you a lot about yourself, and if you’re an extrovert, it will help you relate to your introverted friends, family members, and co-workers — because whether you know it or not, you have some. For employers, Quiet offers strategies for utilizing introverted employees by recognizing their needs and making the most of their strengths. For parents, this book provides advice on raising quiet children in a noisy world.More book reviews at Books Speak Volumes."

For someone who has studied and is well versed in the widely accepted Jung theories of introversion and extroversion, I found the author's take on introverted and extroverted qualities to be incredibly generalized.The author made statement such as ""extroverts, in other words, are characterized by their tendency to seek rewards, from top dog status to sexual highs to cold cash"" and ""this theory of extroversion is still young, and it is not absolute... it suggests that when it comes time to make group decisions, extroverts would do well to listen to introverts, especially when they see problems ahead."" I personally have known impulsive, pleasure-seeking introverts and thoughtful, problem-solving extroverts. These bold and generalized statements do nothing to help people understand each other's preferences or work more effectively together, rather they imply that one type is better than the other and encourage an ""us versus them"" mentality. The author went back and forth between detailed dull scientific concepts, practical situational examples, and then over-generalized statements summarizing the two. The book definitely felt a bit self-serving, as the author makes it clear that she considers herself an introvert who has struggled in an ""extroverted world"". I'm not saying that the author didn't make any good points or that there wasn't any truth to some of the concepts she put forward, but to be honest, the continued bias throughout the book made the author lose some credibility with me. There are so many great books out there about personality and introversion/extroversion that are balanced and put forth tips and suggestions for interacting with people who are different from us, that it's disappointing to see this book getting so much attention.

These people are not the life of the party types or the first ones to speak up in groups of people and prefer in general deep meaningful conversations and quiet time alone. Like myself Introverts have are own personality traits that in this modern world are not as desirable as they once were with gregarious characters being seen as being likely to succeed in life despite no evidence to suggest that the best speakers are the smartest people.Susan Cain who herself a self confessed introvert tries to explain why the world has gone away from admiring softly spoken thinkers in the past and why and how things can be changed to create an even balance between Introverts and Extroverts in our society. Through interviews with psycholgists and other professional in universities and the corporate world she gives us the readers an understanding of introversion and how even some people who may seem a complete extrovert may not be the case and infact have learnt to overcome there fears to be more outgoing. She also mentions a number of famous introverts who although softly spoken changed the world with there conviction including Ghandi, Abraham Lincoln and Dr Seuss.For me this book is a celebration of all things introvert and gives a great insight into the gift that half the people in the world have. The author has has exstensivly researched and at times the chapters can seem abit overwhelming with so much information about various experiments. Despite this the book is deeply intriguing and is a potentially life altering examination of the human psyche and will be a great benifit to introverts and extroverts."
187,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917504-gaijinmama,5,"This book really made me think. Having some definite introverted tendencies myself, it was so nice to hear someone say that those characteristics can actually be a positive thing. I particularly enjoyed the parts about introversion and Asian cultures (I live in Japan), and the suggestions for how a mixed couple,in which one partner is an extrovert and the other is an introvert, can communicate better in spite of different communication styles.I'd say the thing which made the greatest impression on me was the idea that, according to the author's definition and despite the title of this book, introversion isn't just about how much you talk or don't talk. It's more about how you respond to stimulation and where you get your inspiration from. I am a teacher, and I'm already thinking of ways I can use these ideas in class, as I definitely have a number of students who clearly find group work and public speaking stressful. Not that it isn't important to work on overcoming those fears, but different personalities have different learning styles and it's important to acknowledge and nurture those differences. "

I loved how Susan Cain gives the reader an insightful look at the differences between introversion & extroversion. I loved how she used real stories, complemented with lots of scientific researches, showing how different an introvert and extrovert are.I loved this book so much :D I highly recommend it to everyone even though you, yourself isnt an introvert (but your family, close friends, might be one)"
191,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16738961-agirlcandream,4,Fascinating read (listen). I've always known I need to recharge after social gatherings ( when I convince myself to even go to social gatherings). Introverts Unite! Maybe. Easier on line. Maybe not. Think I will just pick up another book. Lol

194,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,4,"I recently watched a TED Talk given by the author on the power of introverts (you can see it here) and it inspired me to read her book. I'd put it on my to-read shelf a few years ago, but I was really intrigued by her talk and wanted to know more. This book takes an honest and open look at the valuable contributions of introverts, who comprise one third to one half of all Americans. It targets schools and other organizations who attempt to force all people into an extrovert mold and shows how this can really be emotionally and psychologically damaging. And it shows how breakthroughs, whether in science, philosophy, art or literature often stem from quiet solitude and study, somehing that is not embraced in society today. We need people who excel in quiet surroundings, who are able to explore the boundaries of creativity and discovery without the noise and distraction of the rest of the world. Just as we need the outgoing personalities and gregarious people who blossom in a crowd. We need the quiet strength of people like Rosa Parks, just as we need the booming oratory and magnetic personality of people like Dr.Martin Luther King Jr..I have always thought of myself as being adventurous, outgoing and extroverted, and most of my younger years epitomized this. More than once, even now, I have been chatised for speaking too much and with too much volume, leading me to declare, ""I live life loudly."" I enjoy being part of a group or team very much, be it in sports, work or even as part of a club.But the older I get, the more I realize just how much I treasure my solitude, too. This book really revealed to me that I have many introverted traits myself. I am very happy to be quiet and by myself, even in the midst of a crowd. And I would so much rather be at home with my family with a good book than at a loud party. I think that part of this stems from my upbringing as an only child. I was alone often in my childhood and I grew to be quite comfortable and contemplative in that solitude. In fact, as I took the quiz on pp. 13-14, I realize that I may be an ambivert, but the majority of my answers lie solidly on the introverted spectrum. I suppose that my outgoing nature derived from wanting to be part of a group, that I already had enough alone time and wanted to have at least a part of my world fit in somewhere. But I think, also, that I just have a need for balance. Perhaps it was a bit of insecurity that drove me to try to fit in, so as I mature and grow more comfortable in my own skin, I feel less of a need to fit in just for the sake of fitting in. Either that, or I'm just becoming a bit of a curmudgeon.But enough about me. The really great thing about this book is that it does make you think, about the world, about yourself, and about what kinds of lessons we are passing down to our children. interesting quotes:""Now that you're an adult, you might still feel a pang of guilt when you decline a dinner invitation in favor of a good book. Or maybe you like to eat alone and could do without the pitying looks from fellow diners. Or you're told that you're 'in your head too much,' a phrase that often deployed against the quiet and cerebral. Of course, there's another word for such people: thinkers."" (p. 7)""Open-plan offices have been found to reduce productivity and impair memory. They're associated with high staff turnover. They make people sick, hostile, unmotivated, and insecure. Open-plan workers are more likely to suffer from high blood pressure and elevated stress levels and to get the flu; they argue more with their colleagues; they worry about coworkers eavesdropping on their phone calls and spying on their computer screens. They have fewer personal and confidential conversations with colleagues. They're often subject to loud and uncontrollable noise, which raises heart rates; realeases cortisol, the body's fight-or-flight 'stress' hormone; and makes people socially distant, quick to anger, aggressive, and slow to help others."" (p. 84) ""We all have old brains, of course. But just as the amygdala of a high-reactive person is more sensitive than average to novelty, so do extroverts seem to be more susceptible than introverts to the reward-seeking cravings of the old brain. In fact, some scientists are starting to explore the idea that reward-sensitivity is not only an interesting feature of extroversion; it is what makes an extovert an extrovert. Extroverts, in other words, are characterized by their tendency to seek rewards, from top dog status to sexual highs to cold cash. They've been found to have greater economic, political, and hedonistic ambitions than introverts; even their sociability is a function of reward-sensitivity, according to this view - extroverts socialize because human connection is inherently gratifying."" (p. 159)""Anyone can be a great negotiator, I told them, and in fact it often pays to be quiet and gracious, to listen more than talk, and to have an instinct for harmony rather than conflict. With this style, you can take aggressive positions without inflaming your counterpart's ego. And by listening, you can learn what's truly motivating the person you're negotiating with and come up with creative solutions that satisfy both parties."" (p. 216)""Having spent so much time navigating my own career transition and counseling others through theirs, I have found that there are three key steps to identifying your own core personal projects.First, think back to what you loved to do when you were a child....Second, pay attention to the work you gravitate to....Finally, pay attention to what you envy."" (p. 218)""Scores of studies have shown that venting doesn't soothe anger; it fuels it.We're best off when we don't allow ourselves to go to our angry place."" (p. 233)""Your child needs to acquire social skills and make friends, not turn into the most gregarious student at school. This doesn't mean that popularity isn't a lot of fun. You'll probably wish it for him, just as you might wish that he have good looks, a quick wit, or athletic talent. But make sure you're not imposing your own longings, and remember that there are many paths to a satisfying life."" (p. 259)""Love is essential; gregariousness is optional. Cherish your nearest and dearest. Work with colleagues you like and respect. Scan new acquantances for those who might fall into the former catergories or whose company you enjoy for its own sake. And don't worry about socializing with everyone else. Relationships make everyone happier, introverts included, but think quality over quantity."" (p. 264)"

This book was soooo interesting and soul finding and gave me insight to people I didn't understand.I can understand myself much better after reading this book. And I can also understand some of the closest people around me much better as well! Susan Cain discusses what it means to be introverted or extroverted and provides examples of people who fit these categories and why and how these people were treated by society and what they did to deal with it. There are so many personality traits out there but one of the most centered and primal ones is introverted vs extroverted, it's an umbrella trait that gives you so many other traits. Susan Cain says that about 1/3 to 2/3 of the population are introverted and I'm now proud to say that I'm an introvert. This book showed me that's OK to be introverted, half of it is genetic and you can't really change it throughout your life so may as well embrace it. I was always told by people to be more social, talk more, participate in class, speak louder, etc etc and I always felt like why??? I'm happy just doing this and being this way. And then they told me come on step outside your comfort zone and I did which got me out of my shell but I still go back to naturally being introverted. I do have some extroverted tendencies so I understand both sides to the coin. Like when I'm with family, close friends and I'm talking about something I care or value about I can seem pretty extroverted lol People always have thought me to be 'shy' which in our society is a negative trait, and I don't think I was shy I was just introverted.Definitely a re-read but here are some notes I took:- They found that hyper sensitive, overly reactive babies become introverted later on, and vice versa for extroverts- Introverts handle the emotional roller coaster that the stock market and any reward based thinking entails. But they can sorta be a buzz kill lol- Asian culture values introverted as a great quality and most are quiet and studious, while Americans have the most extroverts in the world. So when asians immigrate to the US like students for example they have a tough time fitting in and if they don't adapt they have an even tougher time in the job market."
196,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/792145-sue-bridehead-a-pseudonym,4,"At first I really loved this book; in nearly 40 years of living, reading it was the first time I'd received permission from anyone to be quiet in a group setting, to not participate in class if I didn't have something important to say.But the longer I read, the more I started to feel a subtle shift in my reactions. I'd gone from feeling recognized and appreciated to feeling pushed to the side and victimized.Hear me out:I believe there is a very, very thin line between empowerment and victimization. If you take a group of people, define them as unique, and then spend many pages exploring, through case studies and scientific research, how they are different emotionally, why they are different biologically, and why this is OK, the cheerleading can start to feel like overcompensation -- maybe for the author's deep down belief that the people she's championing really *do* need championing, because they aren't normal.Something about that feels dangerous to me. Cain spends a lot of time proving that introverts are all around us and that there are probably evolutionary reasons why we exist. But any time a writer goes out of her way to define a group, label it, and declare it biologically and fundamentally different from the majority culture, I get nervous. It's as if, in some bizarre trick of logic, setting out to prove that introverts are normal actually does the opposite. I mean no disrespect to the author. I am giving this four stars because it's well written and enjoyable and I do think she's doing a lot more good than harm. But as an introvert, the preponderance of scientific data about the brain and genetics started to make me feel like a research specimen, and apparently I'm not cool with that. I'd be curious to know if other introverts felt this way while reading this book. Maybe I'm a stubborn case; I like being appreciated for who I am, but I don't want other people to feel like they need to read a special book to learn how to deal with me. I'm not that fragile or unique.From a writing standpoint, here's what I liked or didn't like.Likes:- When Cain referred to her own experiences and her client consultations- The opening chapter on the evolution of our extrovert culture (great chapter, really fascinating; the first meta analysis I've seen of America's self-help culture)- The implication that we are an anxiety drug-taking nation because this culture is going against our grain (if 1/3 to 1/2 of us are introverts trying to be extroverts, it's no wonder so many of us are taking meds)- The chapter on Asians and Asian Americans because of the outside cultural perspective (though I think it's subject to some overgeneralization, and it might have been nice to hear from a second outside culture)- The bits about teachers learning to teach introverts differently (Oh how I wish this book had existed when I'd been a kid; it would have saved me so many low class participation grades and annoying chidings from well-intentioned teachers who thought my reticence was a sin.)- The case study about the married couple who must learn to compromise (the solution to their problem turned out to be one of the few actionable takeaway items in the book -- how to compromise with an overly sociable spouse)Dislikes:- Much of the science felt like pseudo-science; though having worked on a research-heavy book in a soft science myself, I understand the challenges of finding the right studies.- There were too many studies; after a while, I found myself thinking, ""She just stated a personal opinion. Here comes the research study to support it."" Again, this is not really the author's fault; there are only so many ways to present research and weave it into your narrative. But as a reader and a writer/editor (and an introvert), I have a tendency to pick up on patterns, and when they become very consistent, they start to feel predictable in a way that makes me feel smarter than the text. (I know; so arrogant. Sorry. I am the most exacting reader ever because I read for information and for style and structure.)- The general tone of ""introverts matter too."" While I completely agree that we introverts have something to offer, and that we should be encouraged to work in the way that allows us to make our best contributions to the world, I just feel like hearing that message again and again makes me feel like someone who needs special concessions. Like my temperament is a handicap. Since she'd already proved to the reader that it's our culture that's skewed, and not our introverts, I think I may have been happier with a little more proactive tone. (E.g., ""How introverts can adapt to today's extrovert business climate."") Then again, maybe this book was not written for me. The more I think about it, the more I believe it was written for the culture at large -- so extroverts can understand introverts' strengths and styles.- The ending. Cain had proven at the start of her book that our culture is skewed in one direction. I think it would have been nice to end the book with the optimistic hope that it may, as is the nature of trends, either swing the other way, from extroversion to introversion, or balance out. Something about economics, the future of our country, the changing face of business with telecommuting and the nerd/tech industry, how to deal with other nations, etc. might have added a big picture cultural relevance to the last few pages of the book. After all, she did devote sections to the extrovert role in economic collapse. I feel like that thread got dropped. Rather than it being a standalone chapter, I'd have liked to have see that idea carried all the way through.Overall, I feel this book is 90% pop psychology culture book (like a Malcolm Gladwell book) and 10% self-help. I think that 10% confused me and left me wanting more, because I am an introvert, and concrete advice on how to proactively deal with extroverts is something I would like to see. Ms. Cain -- please write a follow-up and teach us polite ways to excuse ourselves from dinner tables and parties. "

There exist introverted charismatic leaders as well as extroverted ones.Even though schools try to teach us to New Groupthink, somehow collaboration kills creativity, and it might be better to work alone. William Wordsworth described Newton as ""A mind forever / Voyaging through strange seas of Thought alone."" Also, the best violinists tend to spend much more time practising alone than others.PART TWO: YOUR BIOLOGY, YOUR SELF?Infants born with an especially excitable amygdala have more reactions towards unfamiliar object, and are likely to grow up to become introverts. They are ""high-reactive."" For children who are more high-reactive tend to feel a lot more guilty about their transgressions than others.Not only in humans but in animals do these traits exist. Shy ones are more careful about being hunted while bold ones are better at defending territories.PART THREE: DO ALL CULTURES HAVE AN EXTROVERT IDEAL?Asians are more introvert-oriented. Their culture teaches them that being ""humble,"" ""altruistic,"" ""honest,"" and ""hard-working"" is preferred.In an experiment of testing the persistence of children, researchers found that it took Japanese children much more time to give up than American ones.PART FOUR: HOW TO LOVE, HOW TO WORKProfessor Brian Little knew that he needed to recharge after giving speeches. Actually, he needed it so bad that he went and hid in the men's room if he could not find other escape hatches. [Note in 2020: I also do this.]Some findings show that introverts like people they meet in friendly contexts and respond better to robots that speak in a gentle manner; extroverts prefer those they compete with and work harder for robots that used more aggressive language. (hide spoiler)]THOUGHTSWhile reading this book, I took time to reflect on my own characteristics. When I read the parts that introverts need less stimulations than extroverts and tend to require ""taking a break"" after extensive socializing or participating in extrovert-dominating events, I realized that it is how I deal with stress and daily life as well.And that I prefer working alone. Working in a group demands energy for socializing and thus makes the process of it much more tiring than otherwise.On the contrary to being an introvert though, I am not afraid of and may even enjoy giving presentations in front of a big audience as long as I am notified well beforehand. Sometimes, last-minute changes in my schedule just freak me out.Even though the book states that Asian cultures emphasize more on introvert traits than Western cultures, I still think that in families, schools, and the society, people tend to think higher of those who are more extroverted. Also, we were taught not to be shy and should interact with others more often. Even if trying to be gregarious actually makes me feel uncomfortable and stressed out, sometimes I still coerce myself to socialize more.As a study mentioned in the book, a second grader, Isabel, said that ""School is hard because a lot of people are in the room, [...] I like having thoughtful conversations because they make people happy."" I find this very true indeed. When I was in elementary school, I always dread the start of semesters when all the students were rearranged into new classes. I hated to have to try to make new friends and often waited for others to do so.In high school, I finally understood how wonderful having thoughtful conversations can be. Sometimes, I need those deep talks to keep me sane in this overwhelming and over-stimulated world. And having retreats is just as relaxing and mood-lifting.Somehow, I think this book has changed some of my perspectives on life and now I continue to observe everything around and within me, trying to make sense of it all. Or maybe I am not really trying to understand, but rather purely enjoying the process of onlooking."
198,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17711984-sandra,5,"I had always felt embarrassed about my quietness and questioned my need for alone time. I’m the one who speaks rarely in staff meetings, and I’m the one who’d much rather eat lunch in my classroom than in the staff lounge. This book made so much sense to me because I am that introvert who always just seemed different from most other popular/sociable/confident/outgoing people out there. While I felt discomfort from the low-key part of me wanting to hide from excitement, I also knew there were parts of me that I felt good about, though it was hard for me to reconcile the two contradicting aspects. This book addressed all of this and taught me even more. Cain, through extensive research and years of writing, explains the science, social, and practical aspects of introversion, extroversion, and how to navigate our temperaments/personalities with one another. While one of out every two or three people are introverts, this culture is largely made for the success of extroverts. From the Harvard Business School model to corporate offices to even school practices, the Extrovert Ideal seems to be the exemplary performance standard. But Cain carefully details the strengths of introverts who, despite being quieter, reflect more deeply, communicate with more substance, and achieve higher level of thinking than seemingly/wildly successful extroverts. She explains why introverts work more deliberately and with more concentration, listen more than talk, are better writers than talkers, and need solitude to recharge. Cain discusses the biological differences between introverts and extroverts, documents longitudinal behavioral studies by scientists, as well as gives sound advice to help both groups of people. She shows how introverts can stretch to act more extroverted with purpose and practice. Cain even has an entire section on Asians and Asian Americans and how culture significantly affects personality styles, which I could completely relate to. Finally, she helps us guide our young children and students so that we can nurture their introversion to help them feel heard and propel them to succeed. I also very much enjoyed Cain’s TED Talk on this topic. I know she succeeded in her goal of writing this book with me: I now have a “newfound sense of entitlement” to be my introverted self. In fact, now I know that this is the part of me that I have always felt good about, or even proud of. I’ve had my daughter read Quiet Power, Cain’s book for young readers and students, and hopefully my son will read it, too, as we are a family of quiet introverts. Highly recommend this read for both introverts and extroverts alike!"

So we lost our center and have to find it again."" - Anaïs Nin As an introvert, I have been curious about reading this book since 2012. It would have probably have been of better use to me then, time and experience has made the books potency less effective--but let me begin with the good. This book is the perfect laymen's guide to introversion. Anything the average person who may not know anything about psychology can use the book to its fullest extent. I think this use of simplification is good for getting these ideas circulated for a pop-culture crowd, that does not like complexity or ""big-words."" It gives good summaries of things and different research and stories of people making introversion work in an extroverted world. For me though, I have become relatively more versed in psychology and philosophy and the concept of introversion and extroversion. I don't mind more mature and technical explanations and a more in-depth look at these contexts. Unlike some reviewers, I don't think Cain was patronizing her audience, but she came dangerously close in some passages. Speaking of audiences....I am not sure if this was done intentionally or not, but it did become apparent to me that there where a specific demographic in-mind for this book--especially as the book made its way to chapter 8. It came to my attention that the group that she is writing to are (as she labels them) ""European-Americans."" Despite the fact that she opens the book with Rosa Parks, it becomes very clear who she is writing to. I would not have had issue with this if she made this intention clear up-front. I am guessing it was unconscious, but I could still notice the bias. While this is not that big a deal given I read older philosophy and psychology which is very intentional in their ethnic-bias, there was something that I could not ignore.Though the book uses European-Americans (again the author's label, not mine) as the default for introverts, it brings in Asian-Americans (and by extension ""Asians"" by which she means East Asians) early as an alternative introvert culture. At first, it did not sound to uncontroversial in the context of that chapter, but then we go to chapter 8 and I realized a quarter of the way in that she was trying to sell a modified version of the model minority myth. This myth is a form of contemporary-eugenics or scientific-racism, usually deployed to argue against civil rights for African-Americans. Of course, she is not arguing that position, but she is using almost all of the dog-whistle terms, that more sinister types would use to advance their white supremacist thought. Ironically, I could only make it through 3/5 of that chapter before I skipped the rest and moved on to the next chapter.This was an interesting book with some flaws in it, but I was impressed by how she got a lot of basic 101-level information in one book. It served for me mainly as a prelude for Carl Jung's Psychological Types."

I’ve read books that incite laughter and tears and violent rage. But never have I read a book so close, so incredibly intimate to, and validating of, my fundamental being.This book was written for and about me. It was written for and about the 1/3 to 1/2 of our population who identify with the introverted soul. The Quiet, as Susain Cain so wonderfully names it. The quiet, introspective personality that the current world rejects, pathologizes, ridicules. But, as Cain points out, the Extroversion Ideal that we’ve so readily adopted in our society may be less beneficial than we had anticipated. Introverts are the yin to extrovert yang and we must recognize and create space for both to facilitate productivity, happiness, and social harmony. But in such a loud, boistrous extroverted world, what’s a highly sensitive introvert to do? I happen to like Susan Cain’s answer: Find where home is, the sweet spot, and then build on the strengths that seem to be natural pieces of your being. And, while you’re in a validating mood, give others permission to find their own truth, loud or quiet as it may be. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anybody who is interested, but more than anyone else, I would encourage teachers (even college professors!) and parents to read it. Teachers and parents: You shape the world. Seriously. And you have the capacity to create a wonderful existence for all of our magnificent, introverted students and children. You open the doors to self-esteem and confidence that they don’t know exist and show them that being who they are is not only okay, but that who they are is absolutely valuable; that they have incredible things to offer this world.As a highly sensitive, lifelong introvert, I am so grateful for the the people in my life who choose to honor me for who I am, rather than how often I raise my hand in class or the number of road trips I take with random groups of friends. I am so thankful that I have finally found ways (small as they may be) to be myself in a world designed for my opposite. Read this book."

My name is Emily and I'm an introvert.I mentioned this to a friend-of-long-standing the other day (we've known each other for about seven years) and she was shocked - shocked! - that I wasn't an extrovert. ""Really?!? I never would have guessed!""In Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, Susan Cain discusses some of the misconceptions about introversion - for example, that introverts are shy - as well as why some introverts are mistaken for extroverts. For one thing, introverts are the minority. About one-third of people are introverts and it's easy for the majority to simply assume that others are like them. Secondly, our culture favors extroverts. ""Americans are some of the most extroverted people on earth."" Extroversion - being outgoing - is seen as both a personal virtue and as a business advantage, so if you aren't naturally extroverted, developing some extroverted traits is pretty much required for survival. ""Nowadays we tend to think that becoming more extroverted not only makes us more successful, but also makes us better people."" And that's why many of us introverts fake it, at least some of the time.But, Cain points out, this view is counterproductive and prevents introverts' skill sets and gifts, such as sensitivity, keen observation, intense focus and concentration, introspection, and depth of contemplation, from being used to their best advantage. It ""fail[s] to distinguish between good presentation skills and true leadership ability."" It neglects the fact that ""there are many different kinds of power in this world...The trick is not to amass all the different kinds of available power, but to use well the kind you've been granted.""Cain cautions against New Groupthink, brainstorming, and open plan offices, which put introverts at a disadvantage...To read the rest of this review, visit Build Enough Bookshelves."

But this depends – among other things, on the personalities of their employees. One 2011 study showed that in branches of a pizza chain where employees were more passive, extroverted bosses were associated with higher profits. But in branches where employees were more proactive, introverted leaders were more effective. One reason for this is that introverted people are less likely to feel threatened by strong personalities and suggestions. They’re also more likely to listen.""**""Daydreaming in the absence of such distractions activates the brain’s default-mode network. Among other functions, this network helps to consolidate memory and understand others’ emotions. Giving free rein to a wandering mind not only helps with focus in the long term but strengthens your sense of both yourself and others. Paradoxically, therefore, periods of solitude actually help when it comes time to socialise once more. And the occasional absence of focus ultimately helps concentration in the long run."""

She showed how we have so glorified the charismatic, confident extroverted personality, that introverts feel they have to fit this mold. Susan Cain then shares some of the many strengths of introverts in the context of education, parenting, leadership, public speaking, business, relationships and culture. She also shared lots of interesting studies concerning personality theory. I now have a little more of an understanding of why I am so bothered by violence and anger and that it actually has something to do with me not having ""thick skin""! It is interesting that I am wired to have a more sensitive conscience and to not be motivated by money, power and status. There was some things in this book I've not heard anywhere else, its a book I would like to see land in the hands of all my introverted friends and yeah, even extroverts could benefit from reading it, for it could give them a better understanding of us introverts.

204,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4271110-noah,5,"A must-read for everyone: for introverts to gain some surprising insights and for extroverts to understand why quiet doesn't equal bad. One of the surprising things that I learned was extroverts prefer to be yelled at by coaches--it motivates them more. Introverts prefer encouragement. This helped explain a situation where I had quit a sport because I wasn't into being yelled at. I no longer had to feel bad or think the guy was mean; he was just appealing to extroverts.I have met some extroverts who seriously think that being an extrovert is superior to being an introvert. I think it's important for everyone to understand that theses are two equally valid ways of being both with their own strengths and weaknesses. Since introverts receive so many invalidating messages all the time, it's really important to read this book and learn about all of the valuable attributes that being an introvert has. Hopefully ""introvert"" will cease to be a dirty word if we begin to take pride in our introversion. We don't have to apologize or pretend to be an extrovert. We can just be ourselves."

As I read thru I saw so much of myself within its pages I felt like someone had cracked open my head and peeled back all the layers. I also felt a fair amount of anger at moments that society acts as though there is something wrong with introverts being the way they are or expects them to be more like extroverts. The whole chapter on the period where drugs were pushed on introverted people to get them to be more extroverted (and essentially deny their own nature) made my blood boil. I highly recommend this for both introverts and especially for someone for who is an extrovert in a relationship with an introvert.

In some ways, it was validation of stuff introverts already know, which is why I can't give it 5 stars, but it was very interesting. I kind of wish that all bosses ever had to read it, since so much of the way that introverts thrive goes against the brainstorming/open floor plan/meeting-centric business model. Even though I think of myself as an introvert, it did help me realize some things about my (even more introverted) husband, and how we're introverted in different ways. Also, this will sound insane if you haven't read it, but it made me think that we're already seeing some introvert/high-reactive signs in my 10 month old, just based on some of the long-term studies Cain discusses. If that turns out to be true (which, based on her parents seems likely anyway), it gave some good ideas for parenting her in a way that is supportive of her introverty needs."

One of my book club buddies said ""This book seems like Susan Cain's therapy."" I think she hit the nail on the head with that. I found that it was getting a little repetitive but finally coming to the most obvious conclusion that we need extroverts and introverts to make the world complete. I've never really been a fan of psychology/self-help books. That's just not enjoyable reading for me. Nevertheless I did learn lots of things I didn't know and that's something. I'll be avoiding books like this in the future because I don't want to waste my precious reading time. My YBR list is a monster and growing. I want to get down to some productive reading.One suggestion is to read through it as quickly as possible. I feel that it would be difficult to pick it up again with too much of a break.

I'm completely at ease with myself and my lifestyle, though much of society doesn't think I should be.Susan Cain has put the introvert/extrovert issue in perspective, using situations and experiences all of us can relate to.

I think the main reason for that is that it's very America-centric, and while that's understandable, I would have preferred a text that approached introversion/extroversion in a more global sense. I also don't love reading about business people, and there were quite a lot of examples on that. Saying all that though, I feel like this is a good book for helping you come to terms with your introversion (if that is how you identify), and gives good ideas for how to deal with people/situations where the opposite is prevalent."
215,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/758088-eve,5,"I already knew before reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain that I am most definitely an introvert. Consider the damning evidence: I would rather stay home and read than go to a party (unless it's composed of close friends). I often find it painful to make small talk. I enjoy being alone. And although people tell me I have a strong personality, I loathe to be the center of attention, preferring instead to be, yes, the quiet, observant one. Yet despite knowing this about myself, I was astonished by how Quiet illuminated my personality, the personalities of those I knew, and my relationships. Reading Quiet was absolutely revelatory. It explained so much and connected so many dots for me that I couldn't stop talking about it for weeks after I read it. Quiet delves into all aspects of introverts such as the historical, psychological, biological. Cain, for example, pinpoints when our society transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality. The world now celebrates an Extrovert Ideal - paying attention and valuing charisma and a bold personality, men and women of action over the ""quieter"" ones, those who prefer contemplation. She directly connects the 2008 financial collapse to our society's misplaced faith in extroverts - thinking that those who are the loudest and most persuasive should be at the helm of our financial institutions, without proof that they actually knew what they were doing. ""Introversion---along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness--is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology.""Growing up, and even now, I always felt that my introverted tendencies meant that there was something wrong with me. Why didn't the prospect of large, boisterous parties attract me? Why did I like being by myself so much? Why did I hate making small talk when it was so easy for others? My sister always made fun of me for having much fewer friends than she did. It turns out that all these tendencies didn't mean that I was abnormal (phew!). (*I'm abnormal for other reasons not covered by this book.*)Most of the above stems from the fact that I need less stimulation than extroverts, who need the constant energy from socializing and interacting with other people.Furthermore, being shy and/or antisocial is not synonymous with being an introvert. I love getting together with my friends and planning dinners, movies, and activities. But unlike extroverts, I prefer small, intimate groups. My introverted nature likes one-on-one interactions over large parties. I prefer depth rather than breadth. Quiet celebrates the fact that I and other introverts flourish in solitary pursuits - which is a powerful affirmation. Rather than saying we need to be more outgoing or social, in other words, go against our own nature, Quiet says the world benefits from letting introverts be exactly who they are. Albert Einstein, Van Gogh, Gandhi - all introverts. ""Some of our greatest ideas, art, and inventions---from the theory of evolution to Van Gogh's sunflowers to the personal computer--came from quiet and cerebral people who knew how to tune in to their inner worlds and the treasures to be found there."" What's troubling is that the world - from schools to the workplace - are geared towards the Extrovert Ideal. Group work anyone? I hated doing that in school and I hate doing it now. Why? Because inevitably, either I do all the work while the group sits on my labor OR one person, usually the loudest and most persuasive, somehow dictates the direction the entire group will go. Yet my schoolmates and I were routinely forced to work in groups. In the workplace, Groupthink, as Cain puts it, is the trend, where everyone is forced to sit a room together to brainstorm ideas, even though studies show that it is less productive. I could go on and on about all the insights in Quiet, but suffice it to say that this is a powerful, insightful, and thought-provoking must-read not only for introverts, but anyone who is close to an introvert - which is to say, everyone should read it!"
216,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone,5,"In her essay Trash, Art and the Movies, Pauline Kael writes:Because of the photographic nature of the medium and the cheap admission prices, movies took their impetus not from the desiccated imitation European high culture, but from the peep show, the Wild West show, the music hall, the comic strip - from what was coarse and common. The early Chaplin two-reelers still look surprisingly lewd, with bathroom jokes and drunkenness and hatred of work and proprieties. And the Western shoot-'em-ups certainly weren't the schoolteachers' notions of art - which in my school days, ran more to didactic poetry and ""perfectly proportioned"" statues and which over the years have progressed through nice stories to ""good taste"" and ""excellence"" - which may be more poisonous than homilies and dainty figurines because then you had a clearer idea of what you were up against and it was easier to fight. And this, of course, is what we were running away from when we went to the movies. All week we longed for Saturday afternoon and sanctuary - the anonymity and impersonality of sitting in a theatre, just enjoying ourselves, not having to be responsible, not having to be ""good."" Maybe you just want to look at people on the screen and know they're not looking back at you, that they're not going to turn on you and criticize you.Perhaps the single most intense pleasure of moviegoing is this non-aesthetic one of escaping from the responsibilities of having the proper responses required of us in our official (school) culture. And yet this is probably the best and most common basis for developing an aesthetic sense because responsibility to pay attention and to appreciate is anti-art, it makes us too anxious for pleasure, too bored for response. Far from supervision and official culture, in the darkness at the movies where nothing is asked of us and we are left alone, the liberation from duty and constraint allows us to develop our own aesthetic responses.Take those moviegoers, sunk to a seat for an all-too-brief 120 minutes of unrestricted freedom - the freedom to think for themselves, to react for themselves, to judge for themselves, to seed that aesthetic sensibility for themselves - and you have a rough approximation of what is going on with the segment of the population Susan Cain is talking about. Introverts discover, very early on, this pocket of precious ease and abandon; this space where all the rules and expectations vanish; where development, deep and profound internal development, can actually happen. And when given a choice this is the space they choose, the pocket they prefer to inhabit.Life is not particularly kind to the introvert. The ""team"" ethic and the collaborative demands introduced in schools and carried through to the business world often run roughshod over the heightened sensitivities of the quiet ones among us. And how is this reacted to? Well, we ask those quiet ones to suck it up. Suck it up and change. Speak up! Take charge! Stop being such a doormat! Get out there and participate! And the introvert will end up attempting this. For you. Because it's obviously what you need her to do. And because she wants to be respected by you, sad you, who doesn't seem to be capable of respecting her just the way she is.Wait. That's not what's happening! Or is it?Susan Cain has written a wonderful book that addresses these issues in a wonderful way. Well worth the read. In fact, I passed several copies out to friends."
217,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3925186-bill,3,"I learned some things from this book but based on all the hype it received and my preexisting interest in the subject matter, it didn't quite meet my expectations. It was definitely emphasized the pop in pop science.Structurally, the chapters felt like serialized essays and I was never quite able to identify the thread pulling it all along. And that definitely kept me more distant and never really pulled me in. In particular, I was disappointed that at the end she admits she just followed whatever popular definitions of introvert and extrovert matched any particular topic she covered, rather than sticking to consistent meanings. I feel like I've seen this pattern before, where a journalistic writer immerses themselves in a subject and then feels compelled to dictate all of the experiences into a book length treatment, without stopping to throw some out and sculpt the rest in the service of building a more compelling whole. ""If my editors paid me to go to a Tony Robbins seminar, well then I should have a chapter about it."" That one could've been cut, as could the really watered down one about the evangelicals. I found the chapter on Asian immigrants in California to be particularly muddled. Since other parts of the book spent time on the genetic roots of introversion, I expected an explanation on how an entire country and culture could be more introverted than another. I wasn't expecting a deep psychological or sociological analysis, but she could have at least interviewed some folks on the question. To me, the whole section came across as being more about Eurocentric values (and specifically, the disastrous ""You are special"" values that millenials were spoon-fed) rather than really telling us anything new about introversion/extroversion. But, again, after I read the tacked-on disclaimer that ""introvert"" just meant whatever she needed it to mean at the time, perhaps I was expecting too much.A common criticism in other reviews (usually written by extroverts) is that it the book suffers from an anti-extrovert bias. It seemed hard to take those claims seriously when it seems more likely the reader was just used to the whole world singing the praises of their temperament 24/7 and being uncomfortable hearing that it had any weaknesses. If anything, I didn't find the book anti-extrovert so much as excessively pro-introvert, especially since it didn't do a great job disentangling shyness/social anxiety with introversion, and it seems clear that such anxieties are quite harmful.All that being said, it's a quick read on the subject and worth reading. It made me reflect on some of the ways in which I've conformed to extrovert work culture, particularly after working for years at a consulting firm which definitely emphasized the practical necessity of practicing extroverted behavior to succeed. It inspired me to do a better job to make space for all of us to hear and learn from quieter voices.I also very much appreciated Cain's overall goal to challenge the Extrovert Ideal. Trump's rise alone makes some of the material more frightening. It's one thing for extroverted finance Alphas to bring down the economy; it's a step further to annihilate the world with nuclear weapons. Let's hope we all hear more from introverts and less from blowhards."
218,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1353601-brennan,5,"For me, this book was truly amazing. It is the most comprehensive and insight psychologically based book I have read since discovering the Road Less Traveled 20 years ago. Most psychology or self-help books have a few strong chapters, followed by a few mediocre ones, followed by several terrible ones. This book is the exception. I kept waiting for the book to fall short – but it holds strong till the end. Susan Cain has done an amazing job not only helping others to see how introversion/extroversion plays out in the dominant US culture, but she has compiled a wealth of psychological studies that are summarized with stunning clarity and brilliant personal insight. I have taken the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) Test 3 times over the past 25 years. Each time I regrettably scored as an introvert. I was embarrassed by this label as I felt it meant I was destined to be shy, socially awkward, and not outgoing. However, this book has helped me fully embrace and accept my introversion. Her illuminating examples of what it means to be an introvert were incredibly helpful. I love to have fun as much as the next person, but I have purposely only eaten lunch with co-workers a handful of times over the past 19 years because I don't want to be exhausted the rest of the work day. On the weekends, rather than spend time making small talk at parties with people I barely know, I would rather spend time with close friends and family, talking in depth about meaningful topics while building relationships I value. The book also helped clarify for me why I love my work so much as professor, researcher, and therapist. I prefer the inner world of ideas, spending time alone thinking, and sharing the things I value with others through teaching and discussion (see free trait theory in Chapter 9). I also greatly enjoy understanding the inner worlds of others and working together to find ways to decrease emotional suffering and distress. A few of the highlights of this book include her summary of the emerging body of research on 'high reactive' and 'sensitive' temperaments in Chapter 4-5. It is revolutionary. And Chapter 6 which details how the introversion of Eleanor Roosevelt balanced FDR's extroversion is an exceptional piece of research and writing. Both introverts and extroverts will find value in this book. Introverts will likely appreciate how the book gives voice to feelings they have lived with for years but never quite had words to express. Extroverts will find increased understanding and appreciation for the inner world of the introvert - particularly if they have an introverted child, spouse, co-worker, or friend. Although I doubt extroverts will experience the excitement of discovery that introverts will often feel as they read, they will be able to more fully appreciate the differences between themselves and introverts. Cain makes this brilliant point more than once – that in the end, what we all need is balance. Introverts need extroverts, and extroverts need introverts. My hat goes off to Susan Cain. This is a beautifully written and researched book. I give it my highest recommendation. "

I appreciated that there was science, and, like Cain, the thing I found most revelatory was Professor Little's Free Trait Theory: you may sometimes act out of character/against type, and that's okay if it's in the service of something you really, really care about. (Also the corresponding Free Trait Agreement--if you're with someone, you'll give and take--was pretty cool too.)Bonus points for:1) Acknowledging the Universal Hide in the Bathroom Principle. (If you don't know what I'm talking about, that's okay, it takes all kinds!)2) Pointing out that the internet is actually the introvert's dream format. Peace without loneliness! Non-exhausting connections at your fingertips!3) The guy at Claremont McKenna who got up early ""just to savor time alone with a steaming cup of coffee."" Replace tea, and you've got my life now.4) ""the life of the mind""5) ""'The stereotype of the university professor is accurate for so many people on campus. They like to read; for them there's nothing more exciting than ideas. And some of this has to do with how they spent their time when they were growing up. If you spend a lot of time charging around, then you have less time for reading and learning. There's only so much time in your life.'"" That last line is something both sides of the spectrum should be able to say, but you so rarely hear it applied in this context.6) Introvert guilt, which I completely identified with and had always chalked up to Catholic Guilt.7) The brief introduction to situationism.8) ""Finally, pay attention to what you envy. Jealousy is an ugly emotion, but it tells the truth.""9) ""person-environment fit""Points deducted:1) In all that talk of fear of public speaking, not once did anyone mention nervous poo. Forgive me for being frank, but it's a phenomenon my college roommate (who I am sending this book immediately) discussed endlessly. Quelle oversight!No, but really:1 and only) I found the first section on the Extrovert Ideal annoying and stressful. Yes, we all know that's how it is. I don't want to read about the vagaries of open office plans and group work (spawn of the devil, and I knew that as a preschooler) and megachurches where extroversion is mandatory. I want to read about people and what they actually do. In the two months it took me to read that part, I found myself thinking longingly of what I wanted to be reading instead: a book of essays written by introverts about their full, purpose-driven lives. Learning by example, that's me. I want to be shown, not told. Fortunately the book changed tack slightly, but she almost lost me there."

Cain's thesis is that for most of the 20th century, Americans worshiped people who were extroverts and discouraged introverts. We see this in a school system that encourages socialization. In the last 30 years parents have taken this to the extreme with extra-curricular activities almost every day of the week. Outgoing, friendly people are celebrated. The book worm, the loner, is discouraged. My wife of 40 years, on the other hand, is a classic extrovert. She was born talking. She has never met a stranger who she couldn't start a conversation with. We can be sitting in the Drs. office and she will strike up a conversation with someone sitting in the next chair. In the mornings, I prefer silence. Since I don't talk, she turns on the TV so she hears someone talking. She is outgoing and friendly. Everyone falls in love with her. People when they first meet me see me as grumpy and grouchy even though I am not. I am just very quiet. We are opposites that were attracted to each other. What has happened in the last 40 years is that I have taken on some of the behaviors of an extrovert and she has taken on some of the behaviors of an introvert. We have learned to live together.Susan Cain has amassed an enormous amount of research demonstrating that society, business, communities and even marriages need and benefit from having both introverts and extroverts on the team. Steve Wozinak, inventor of the Apple computer, needed a Steve Jobs to market and sell the computer. We are all to varying degrees somewhere on the introvert - extrovert continuum. If you are an introvert or an extrovert or in a relationship with one or the other, then you need to read this book. Business people should read this book to understand their employees, their bosses and their peers. Teachers should read this book to understand the differences in the personalities of the children they teach. Husbands and wives should read this book to understand each other. If there is only one book you are going to read this year, it should be Quiet by Susan Cain. This book could save your marriage, your job, and your life."
221,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1135225-brian,3,"If American culture has a personality preference would it be the outgoing, social extrovert or the reserved and thoughtful introvert? In Susan Cain's new book Quiet: The Power of Introverts In A World That Can't Stop Talking she posits that the former is our template, something she calls the Extrovert Ideal. This ""ideal self is gregarious, alpha, and comfortable in the spotlight"" and though this is an ""enormously appealing personality style ...we've turned it into an oppressive standard.""The most compelling material is front-loaded, especially in discussions like how new the phrase ""having a good personality"" is (20th century), and how advertising for things like soap in the 1920s were pointing toward a more confident outgoing self. Cain visits a Tony Robbins rally/seminar and Harvard Business School seeking to understand the dynamics of extroversion, and visits Rick Warren's Saddleback Church with the author of a book on introversion in the church who has good insights into the quiet, liturgy, and contemplation found in high church tradition and missing in evangelical megachurches. There will be recognition here for most readers drawn to a book like this.The missteps come later on, mostly centered on explaining events/people through the lens of extroversion/introversion and the ""exciting research"" of neuroscience. She frames things like the rejection of Al Gore's climate change advocacy and Moses’ reluctance to serve Yahweh in terms of their introversion and tries to show that evolution has given us a ""new brain"" that replaces the ""old brain"", which sounds suspiciously like our sinful nature to begin with. There are time where inserting categories like temperament can't bear the weight of the application she's using, and between these speculations that are not well grounded and the trips into scientism they grind the book to a halt in places.This is a book that will appeal to readerly types whose very love of books and what they provide predispose them to the arguments contained. There is a bit too much us-versus-them and it is overlong but to have someone write about what so many of us think is thrilling if not completely satisfying in the end."
222,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3680008-michael,4,"I always knew that I was reserved but never considered myself an introvert. I was the one who preferred to go to the movies alone and always hated unexpected surprises from friends. Once I went to the movies alone, it was so peaceful that I felt that I was the only one in the theater. After researching countless of articles, I realized that I was not antisocial. Neither was I shy or rude as some extroverts assume but I was simply a introvert. There are a countless of occasions when I can remember me feeling like I did not belong in a big crowd. All of that mingling meaningless chatter about nothing has put a tremendous toil on me. Usually I will recharge by reading a book or walking alone in the park. Now I have told my close friends of who I am, I now can live my life without feeling socially awkward for not talking.Susan Cain book taught me to appreciate my introversion. The initial pages of this book was mesmerizing, the way she described herself under a different name. I loved how she eloquently described the misconceptions about an introvert and a extrovert. My favorite part was when she detailed why introverts are considered ""bad leaders"" because their unwillingness to speak up. It really highlighted the bias that society has against them. Introverts are in the minority but they are possibly the most trusted and respected individuals. However I am not suggesting that they are smarter than the extroverts but because of them being misunderstood,they are richly valued.Although this book had some great valid points, I can't say that I agree with all of it. For instance, I don't think that an introvert should conform to extroverted traits. Whether that is a on job interview, date or making friends. They should be allowed to live amicably with everyone, whether they have a gregarious personality or a quiet one. Also I thought that this book was heavily researched(not saying it is a bad thing) and it somewhat took away the quality of the book. In other words, I wanted it to be more persuasive than informative.Despite those minor flaws, this is a excellent book for introverts and extroverts. Understanding the difference can possibly change your perspective of them & possibly your life!!!"
223,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610234-caren,5,"If you are an introvert, you've got to read this book. The author admits she has been working on this book since 2005, but has really been thinking about it all her life. If you live in the USA, you live in one of the most extroverted countries in the world, one where your strengths as an introvert are not often valued. From the time you were a child you were probably told to speak up in class, make large groups of friends, and join lots of group activities. As an adult, you may work in large offices with no private space. This book is filled with fascinating research. Ms. Cain traces the time in our history when personality with a capital P came to be the most valued trait, rather than character. Just at the time when people began leaving the farm for industrialized cities, the extrovert ideal began to blossom. Our Western cultural emphasis on rugged individualism contributed to the mix. (Later in the book she notes how Asians, whose cultural ideal is one of humility and harmony with the whole, have trouble navigating the extreme extroversion required in our places of education and business.) Ms. Cain looks at current brain research and speculates on how evolution may have required the two aspects of behavior as balancing strengths for human survival. She gives you ways to manage your life to make sure your requirements as an introvert are met. She looks at introverted children in the home and classroom, and at partnerships in which one member is an extrovert and the other an introvert. She says that from one third to nearly one half of us are introverts, so we are not so rare; many of us have just become very good at masking our true selves to meet the requirements of our society. This is an empowering book for the quiet, reflective, introspective among us. As the author says at the end, ""We know from myths and fairy tales that there are many different kinds of powers in this world.....The trick is not to amass all the different kinds of available power, but to use well the kind you've been granted."" (p.266)"
224,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17245074-naia,1,"From the start I was very frustrated with the ""us"" (introverts) versus ""them"" (extroverts) tone that carries throughout the book. This is a complex characterization; different people fit into different categories based on circumstances and situations. Putting everyone into only two categories oversimplifies human behavior.The author states American society is dominated by extroverts; introverts are either pushed to the sidelines or forced to become extroverts. Yet the only examples she presents to support this statement are Harvard Business School and, to a lesser extent, salesmen. Neither of these examples are even somewhat representative of American society. Most of the author's examples of introverts seemed to argue against an extrovert dominated society.The author only mentions the fields of law and psychology. Why wasn't there more research or discussion about stereotypical introvert fields like engineering, mathematics, or research science? I have a hard time understanding how the author struggled to make a connection between race but didn't dive into the segregation of professional fields in our own culture. The Asian argument was interesting but poorly developed. How do Indian cultures differ? I would have been interested in more development of Asian business culture. Where is the line between cultural differences and personality type differences? (I used to work for an engineering firm in Taiwan; of all the challenges we faced, I never felt is was due to different personality types).Another frustrating theme that carried throughout was one third to one half of society are introverts. Yet, the author narrated as if introverts are a significant minority, a uncommon occurrence. Where are all these extroverts that dominate our culture? I don't know any, maybe I have subconsciously built up a shield and only surround myself with the introvert minority.One star may seem harsh, but this was a very frustrating book for me to get through. "
225,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321314-jeff-scott,5,"The main focus in Susan Cain’s book is on the quiet uncelebrated introvert. We spend so much time enamored of the Tony Robbins of the world, but couldn’t we use a little more time listening to those who don’t often speak-up? We need to set aside time for the thinkers, the dreamers, and those who speak only when it really matters. Allowing introverts their quiet reflective time can bring out the Tsunami of an idea. Author Susan Cain also points out that some of the greatest thinkers were introverts like Einstein, Newton, and even Dr. Suess.One of the great things this book does is to identify why people are introverted and how they can use those inherit traits (calm, resolute, reflective) to be very effective in any work environment, even as CEOs of major corporations. It made me think a great deal about how to work with those who may need more space or may take more time to come to a conclusion. Those who are introverted, as I myself am, need to find a balance of stimulation in their life. It provides excellent advice for those who are introverted, how to create an environment for success, and how to harness their power to bring out the best in them. If you read only one chapter, read chapter nine. It talks about when you should act more extroverteed than you really are, but also to identify when you are acting like a pseudo-extrovert. She even goes further than this analysis and confidence building, but also goes into relationship advice and parenting. This is a whole new category that we need to pay more attention to other than the occasional Myers-Briggs testing. I think the most important point was that whatever your personality you have to find your right stimulation balance and stand firm in that need. It will lead to a happier and better balanced life. "
226,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23038885-jody,4,"As an introvert (like, I suspect, many of us on here!), it was very comforting to read this book. We're often made to feel as if there's something wrong with us, and indeed until introversion became more well-known I felt as if there was something wrong with me.This was on the whole, a warm, reassuring hug in book form. It was slightly drier than I usually prefer my non-fiction, but it was still an excellent read."
227,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23802045-vinit-nayak,3,"This could have definitely been 4 stars if not for 2 reasons:In the first chapter/section of the book Cain comes off praising introverts and putting down extroverts in every way. I understand that she herself is an introvert and there will be that bias, but I was not a fan of her tone. To me it seemed that she was saying introverts were intrinsically better people than extroverts by enumerating all the bad things extroverts do (gambling, failing in stock market, cheating on significant others, etc). Not sure if she was trying to go for a strong hook to catch readers or what the intention was since this isn't the same tone in the rest of the book.The conclusion of this book is also a bit unexpected. Towards the end it seems like it becomes a child development book for new parents. I appreciate the connection Cain makes between what the experiments have taught us in the lab and connecting that to practical uses, but it ended up being unexpectedly focused on children.Aside from those complaints the book was engaging. I was very interested in how she defined the two groups and she gave complete definitions supported with a good amount of data as well as real world examples most people could relate to. The sections on connecting biology to the psychological differences differences between introverts and extroverts was also very fascinating. Most importantly I did enjoy the message of accepting and adapting to people as they are, and being very mindful that people aren't always how they seem on the outside (which isn't necessarily a bad thing either)."
228,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613351-linda-robinson,5,"In the American business world of team building, groupthink, committees, office barns with no privacy; of schools with pods of students trained to adhere to the American business model, there is also the academic research world of scientists who are discovering and affirming that celebrating and promoting ""hail fellow, well met"" Harvard Business School clones exclusively might not be in America's best interests. Consider the American financial world's performance leading up to 2008, when senior management level non-risk averse/reward-seeking/dopamine-addled extroverts almost brought down the entire global economy. Susan Cain has done considerable research for this book, indeed she said she has been working on it nonstop for her entire life, in part because she is an introvert and is passionate about the subject. She also has a consulting practice that helps businesses and people learn how to live with quiet people, temperament differences, and how to raise a confident, successful introverted child. I couldn't put the book down, so I underslept a little. I'm an introvert, and although I can act out as an extrovert, have managed to take the Myers-Briggs often enough to change my I to an E, it's a relief to know that there's not much point. Plus all that exposure and test taking is exhausting. Introverts comprise about 1/3 of humans, introverts are creative, thoughtful. contributing people, and we need to give them a little room. And a door. With a lock. "
229,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine,4,"An enlightening read. Some parts are a bit text book-like with the scientific study results, but the author was adept at weaving between those and the real life personal stories of people interviewed for the book, keeping it interesting. Some of those studies are quite fascinating. Overall much food for thought in these pages. Americans in particular undervalue the introvert. From the time we’re small children it is almost universally accepted as a negative, unpopular trait, despite the fact that most of our cherished inventions and grand ideas come from the minds of these individuals. This book will give anyone a new appreciation for the shy and quiet among us and hopefully be fuel for a change of perspective in corporate settings and classrooms. From the introduction:Without introverts, the world would be devoid of: the theory of gravity, the theory of relativity, W. B. Yates’s ‘The Second Coming’, Chopin’s nocturnes, Proust’s ‘In Search Of Time, Peter Pan, Orwell’s ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four’ and ‘Animal Farm’, The Cat In The Hat, Charlie Brown, Schindler’s List, E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Google, and Harry Potter.

230,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6948943-greta-hambke,3,"This book offers moments of profound reassurance for those of us who call ourselves introverts. I recommend it to anyone who has found themselves cringing in a corner at a busy party, counting down the minutes until a speech or presentation or meeting is over, or opting for the company of a good book over friends. It's also a great read if you are extroverted and simply don't understand why your employee, spouse, or child doesn't want or require the same degree of social participation you do. It explores how Western culture is essentially a culture of extroversion, and the unique challenges and opportunities this presents for the introverts of the world. Cain also makes a case for a greater acceptance and deeper appreciation for people who might have lots to say, but not necessarily out loud, all the time. Shyness is not a disease, and solitude offers great benefits and breeds big thinkers. There is a cultural, psychological, and physiological basis for different personality types - Quiet suggests that the social scales be balanced for a greater understanding of our fellow man."

That would have made my life much easier and days merrier.Being a classic introvert, the book resonated with me. It was like somebody knew exactly what I'm and then telling that back to me. I'm planning to write complete extract of Quiet so that I can read it every now and then. Why I liked Quiet so much is it doesn't force you to become someone else you don't want to. It encourages being yourself because it's perfectly OK to be and that there's nothing wrong with you. When everyone around tries to be cool, Susan Cain prompts to remain warm and be compassionate with oneself. She also tells that there are different strengths being sensitive and cerebral. Instead of trying to be what you are not, play to our own strengths and make best of us. I would urge everyone to read it. One in every three persons is introvert and so it maybe your close one if not you. It enriches us, improves our understanding about the fellow human beings and promots acceptance. Now isn't it a great message?"
232,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"I started Quiet with no small sense of trepidation; At times what passes for Psychology non-fiction in the marketplace can leave one cringing for days, also reference to the controversial Myers-Briggs personality types had me much worried about spurious trends and links between personality and success.That sense, however, left as quickly as it arrived. Cain uses Intro and Extravert as broad terms, focusing more on how responsive people are to their environment (people who are highly responsive tend to be introverted as the world is that much more intense and need plenty of processing time)Cain goes on to explore how extraversion is over-valued in Western culture, how this is different across other cultures and the risks of a world that loves outspoken action rather than sensitivity and nouce.For me this book was a personal revelation, not just about my own psyche, but how the world around works."

I'm reading an advanced reading copy from the publisher and I think, as a confirmed introvert, that I'm really going to like it.I've finished the book and I must say that it gave me some really good insight into our ""extrovert ideal"" culture and the pressures that are brought to bear upon those who don't fit that mold. Especially fascinating is research done on infants that shows introversion/extroversion characteristics at very early ages. This book encourages introverts to accept their temperaments, to appreciate the positive aspects of being ""quiet"", and gently advises us how to feel more comfortable in a world that does not always value introspection. Good advice for parents as well on raising introverted children. "

I learned that you can situationally fake not being an introvert, particularly if you are pursuing something that is meaningful to you. But that faking can come at a cost, and one needs to be mindful of restorative spaces.

It’s called Quiet. And it’s a book about all the amazing people out there, doing amazing work, but who aren’t In-Your-Face people. We forget about these people. We have, as a society, Cain writes, come to believe that everyone who is anyone is an extrovert. Cain speaks up for the quiet people, reminding us of all those who have been and are doing their quiet work, who have and are living their quiet lives, who have and are quietly eating and drinking and shopping and reading books.

We are not anti-social and it's ok to need occasional solitude to recharge. I read this book and felt great but also angry. Our culture is messed up, we are encouraged to speak and not listen, to fake gregariousness and not be genuine, and to utilize group-think (whatever the hell that is) instead of focused concentration.

244,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858127-dree,4,"Well I have to say, as a raving introvert (who has mostly grown out of extreme shyness) - I've never read a book that made me feel quite so good about myself! Over the years I have read quite a few psychology type books, some of which were very good, however, I always came out them feeling like I needed to try to DO something else - to make myself happier, or more productive, or a better parent etc.This book is utterly unique in that instead of focusing on attempting to change or improve oneself, it really is all about working with & appreciating the values you do have. I know a lot of books try to do that - but even that seems forced - like visualisation or self talk. Not that things concepts don't have their place of course - but THIS book just felt more natural to me.I particularly appreciated the passage about Ghandi. It concerns his passivity & dislike of conflict. I can SO relate. I hate conflict. It is out of my comfort zone & I will avoid it wherever possible. I recall many times when as a child (& even several as an adult) that I would be told that I should confront somebody about something, or get annoyed about something - when I just didn't feel like it was enough of an issue to warrant something as uncomfortable as confrontation. In fact sometimes said thing didn't bother me much at all! It comes across as passive I guess, but actually I feel like I'm a very strong person internally. I certainly CAN push back & most definitely will when given the right circumstances.There were so many things in here I could relate to about introversion -and I really learnt some important things about myself! Now I understand why I utterly HATE being interrupted when in the flow of something (like my 3yr old just interrupted me writing this review & I flew off the handle!)Of course this facet of introversion is a real challenge as a parent - when you are constantly being interrupted. But I guess instead of feeling like I'm a horribly impatient person, I can appreciate that quality & try to avoid being in a situation where I'm likely to be. I've always wondered why I feel so harassed by my children when really they just want to talk - it really is a case of managing my own tendencies rather than pretending they don't exist. I feel like I have a better appreciation of my introvert son - & am less likely to hassle him about things he doesn't want to do (and that fact that he absolutely can NOT multitask... god so frustrating)This really is a fascinating book - there is also some exploration of extroverts & I even felt a little more understanding of them. In fact extroverts really ought to read this book - but they never would! :D"

A lot of the information given and repeated didn’t sound very scientific to me.It basically says that its great to be an introvert, societies should treat introverts in a special way, respect their space and give them enough range to be themselves and to bloom, extroverts go to Tony Robbin’s workshops which essentially sounded like a cult more than anything, extroverts are the reason financial markets crash, ALL Harvard Business School graduates are extroverts, and Asians are mainly introverts.

It is beneficial to both introverts, extroverts and any type in between. Introverts (and those who experienced introversion in their life) definitely can relate to it more but, nonetheless, extroverts may find it useful to understand the world of an introvert and, beside the downfalls, what are the ""unpublicized"" upsides of this world."

I’ve always known I was an introvert, but I could never explain why I behaved like an extrovert in front of people. Three words: free trait theory. Also, why I am so upset when I disappoint someone or cause someone frustration. Two words: sensitive introvert. This book is a GAME CHANGER. Hands down the most helpful book I’ve read concerning human behavior. "
251,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,3,"Introversion is fascinating, especially when you think of how many contradictions there are to people who are introverted. For example, I am not afraid to speak in front of groups; I get a little nervous like anyone would, but public speaking is far from my worst nightmare. That said, I absolutely dislike group discussions, group work, and being forced to participate in group settings (think school or committees in the work place). I very much thrive on being given time and space to think through things, to write them down and play around with them in my mind. It's not that I can't think on my feet, but rather, I am a much more productive, happy, and satisfied person if I can have that space. Part of why I had a hard time getting great grades in college was because I never participated in class. It's not that I'm afraid of sounding like an idiot but rather, it kills me to not get the chance to explore ideas on my own with time. I find I get nothing out of simply reacting or speaking with immediacy. But writing an essay? Those were the things I could get positively high off of doing because it was precisely how I learned and processed. It's funny though because throughout your education, you're told you're wrong for being that way. You get this weird sense of loneliness, and you sometimes find yourself frustrated, wondering why you can't perform like everyone else around you. The thing is, though, 1/3 to 1/2 of people experience the same exact thing because they, too, are introverted. Cain has a very Malcolm Gladwell approach to her book, in that it's much more anecdotal than hard (social) science. That made it really readable and understandable. It was fascinating to read about how underappreciated introverts are in a world where extroversion is really rewarded. And it is -- the loudest, the quickest, and the ""biggest"" get the chance to shine while people who are quieter or slower do not. We make fun of artists because they live in their heads and not out in the world (even though they're actually engaging with the world in the exact same way as someone who is out and about -- they just process it differently). What didn't quite work for me in the book was that at times it felt like Cain applauded the introvert at the expense of the extrovert. By that I mean, it sometimes felt like she suggested that extroverts were wrong or were the reason introverts had it tough. While some of her reasoning made sense and was valid, it felt at times a little blame-y to me. It's a bigger issue than the individual; it's cultural and societal. The differences between personality traits and habits was interesting, and I think that maybe that was the most valuable insight to come out of the book. Even though I'm an introvert, my habits may differ greatly from another introvert. For example, in high social situations, I cannot sleep. I find I am much better at decompressing through staying awake, getting quiet and alone time while others sleep. But for other introverts, sleep may be the ideal decompression. Those are habits and not traits. The trait is the need for that need for decompression. Why this element sticks out in the book is that at times, I think Cain confuses the two herself. But more importantly, because I think that the introverts who are reading the book (and just judging by the first page of Goodreads reviews, it's the bulk of readers) will walk away knowing they're not alone and that they can differ substantially from other introverts. And I think it's a crucial read for extroverts who want to better understand people who are so different from them and from one another.I think I have a lot more to say about this book and the implications therein. There may be a longer review to come. Overall, I'm glad I read this and think it offered some good insights, though I wonder if the message is going to reach those who might need to really hear it. If they want to listen, that is. Being a good listener is, of course, a trait of the introvert. "
252,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4015452-sheila,5,"Our manager, who recently came from abroad, gave each of us a bar of chocolate. I found mine on my desk when I arrived, the guilty object claiming its space and my attention before I could summon my power of speech, which has its own schedule. Usually after it has tasted some coffee. My grease of choice in the morning. I put the unexpected treat inside my bag and started up my computer. If I send her an email, it will be unnecessary and too formal. If I send her a message through chat, it will be too familiar. I battled with myself the whole morning until my colleague arrived, saw her chocolate, and shouted THANK YOU! to my boss, who was sitting in her corner glass office on the other side of the room. I felt the heat creeping up my face. Why can't I just say thank you so coolly and think nothing of it after?In Susan Cain's book, I'm a classic introvert. I have preferences on where, when, and whom to interact with, partly due to nature (one of my parents was an introvert) and partly due to my own sense of satisfaction and being.Cain discusses these in detail through biographies and interviews with scientists, psychologists, priests, parents, and a host of individuals who shared their reflections about their challenges with and acceptance of their lives as introverts. The premise here with which Cain based her argument that introverts must develop their quiet power is that the world needs BOTH extroverts and introverts.The reason: they have much to offer each other. And as an introvert, I'm deeply comforted and inspired by this. Who knew that we could change the world in the calmness and comfort that we always seek?Cain cites many examples, one of them the Wall Street Crash, which, through interviews, she attributes to the lack of restraint of extroverted and reward-seeking investors and the lack of participation of the introverts who had predicted it. She also mentions the soft power of the Asian-Americans, whose abilities in science and math are unmatched because of their quiet persistence. The story of Gandhi that Cain included here was by far one of my favorites. That and Harvard Professor Brian Little's Free Trait Theory which he practiced as a pretend extrovert by giving lectures to students and dignitaries half the time, and as a true blue introvert by hiding in the men's room cubicle half the time (or whenever he ran out of excuses to be alone during lunch). There is much to learn in this book, both for extroverts who have relationships with introverts and for introverts who have doubts about their contribution to society in general. The message is that in a world that celebrates the Extrovert Ideal, we introverts are more needed than we think. And Susan Cain helps us by prescribing the ways by which we can be productive, creative, and happy without losing our true quiet selves."
253,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2506118-riham-ibrahim,5,"	Susan Cain doesn't just say that it's ok to be an introvert, but she shows how important it is to embrace our introversion and perceive it as a gift. The book is written with style and you can sense how passionate Cain is about the topic. She highlights that the power of introversion has become overlooked in the age of what she calls the ""extrovert ideal"". The society seems to idolize the outgoing, loud and talkative people, even though they might not always be the ones to have bright ideas. Introversion is a gift that needs to be more appreciated and understood. If you think of the best advice you ever got in your life, chances are it came from an introvert. Introverts excel at critical thinking and noticing things that other people seem to miss. Cain highlights examples of introverts who through their quiet and thoughtful reflections were able to alter the course of history, most notably Gandhi , Newton and Mother Theresa. She also defies the misconception that introverts are not social people. On the contrary, they might be the most gifted speakers and in possession of high social skills. It's just that they need socializing in smaller doses than their extroverted counterparts. They need their time alone to be able to recharge and get back on their feet. The studies Cain used to make her case are compelling and thought provoking. The one I thought was most interesting was the study about solitude and how it affects the performance of college students and athletes. I experienced that myself as I engaged in several phases of solitude and it was the main driver behind my success. In solitude you isolate yourself from the thoughts of others. You get the chance to focus on your own thoughts, emotions, and desires. You grow more aware of who you are and what you want out of life. Solitude also teaches persistence and sharpens the mind. I also admired greatly the part that talks about Highly Sensitive Persons (HSPs) and how most of them are introverts. Cain delves into the studies that dealt with this type of people. Despite their very complex way of thinking they are quiet and not of the talkative type. They hate small talk and are highly empathic.I LOVED the conclusion part. Cain gives the most heartfelt advice for introverts to enjoy their lives. This paragraph is what got to me: “The secret to life is to put yourself in the right lighting. For some, it's a Broadway spotlight; for others, a lamplit desk. Use your natural powers -- of persistence, concentration, and insight -- to do work you love and work that matters. Solve problems. make art, think deeply.” All in all, this book is one of the best books written on introversion. Cain's passion about the topic is evident in every chapter and even in each paragraph. I highly recommend it to everyone, introverts and extroverts alike. It will take you on a journey of self-discovery if you are an introvert, and a journey of understanding the world of the quiet if you are an extrovert. "
254,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65090369-allwynne,3,"As an loud and proud extrovert who's friends with a lot of introverts... and I'm a psych nerd(can't help it, it's the psych major life), I knew I had to pick this book up immediately. I did very much enjoy this book in the information it did bring to my attention, of the realities, struggles and gifts an introvert encounters in their day to day life. The book used a broad range of examples:business,psychology based, biology based, and non professional ones to illustrate its concepts, the author writing a very passionately written informative book. I can appreciate the section at the end about how to help and promote introverted children, that really stuck out to me the most.There was just a few things that kept me from labeling it a four/five star read: it felt a bit repetitive at points, felt a little too self helpy for my taste, and also a little too ""rah rah introverts, here's how you are more equipped for the world,"" and not enough of ""extroverts and introverts work differently, and introversion does have its flaws to be sure."" But despite all that, this book kept me interested from beginning to end, and I would recommend it to any introvert or extrovert who may want to learn more on this particular subject. "
255,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2576733-jeff-yoak,4,"Sometimes it is difficult to remember what my ratings are for. Sometimes how good I think the book is diverges radically from how much I enjoyed reading it.Quiet is such a book. I think it has deep flaws, but it is one of the most thought-provoking books I've read in a long time. The primary theme of the book is that it is ok to be an introvert and that the culture so values extraverted traits that introverts are oppressed. Much like books that aim to say that it is ok to be a woman and accomplish it by villianizing men, Quiet belittles introverts. This is particularly true in the first third to half of the book. If you are an extravert, you are a buffoon who wears lampshades on your head at parties, bullies and does things like run Enron and cause the global housing and economic crisis, all the while aspiring to be Tony Robbins. If, by contract, you're an intravert, you are a quiet, builder / leader like Woz. I was able to overcome the bias to extract value out of the book, but it is a real flaw.A good example of the value I received was shifting my thinking from behaviors to internal reactions to situations. I've cultivated the skill of working rooms at fundraising events with behavior that flows naturally from extraverted personalities. This is because it is an important skill and accomplishes my values. If instead of framing questions like that, you frame questions such as, ""Do you recharge and gain energy by being alone or by socializing?"" you can see illuminating traits emerging. There are values there.The latter part of the book was most valuable to me. She talks about things like problems emerging out of I/E relationships. Some of that read like spooky, watching-over-my-shoulder reports. Also, raising children is a major topic given various traits in kids. The analysis of the rise of problems was good, and the corrective advice was better.I would recommend this book to anyone trying to understand people better. That said, I have some concern that the biases could be harmful to readers, but I'm skeptical about personality psychology in general thinking that they mostly make things up and then draw dubious conclusions on those bases. Overcoming that bias on my part and causing me to think there is something substantial to learn in the area is nothing short of remarkable. I think it is worth that risk and so I rate the book highly and recommend it."
256,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4821718-angela,3," Social media is currently favouring the introvert, the empath, and the highly-sensitive type, so it’s no surprise that bookshelves are becoming populated with literature exploring these trends. ‘Quiet’ is a book about the power of introversion, which challenges the Western expectation of ambition and turns to biological and social studies to provide a hefty backing. Chances are you’ll pick up this book as an introvert looking for self-validation. But what of the reader who identifies as a gregarious extrovert? According to Cain and the multiple studies she cites, an outgoing, chatty extrovert often has less intelligence and originality than those who opt for peace and solitude. Cain asserts that a show pony may get the attention but the nerdy brainiac will ultimately inherit the earth. She makes introversion so appealing that I suspect many readers will come away convinced it defined them to a T, relieved that, finally, someone understands them, whether this is true or not. The audience seems to be the savvy, upper middle class US business person. Many of the discussions focus on the implications of introversion in the workplace and while the book employs examples to back the arguments, I found it too limited in its corporate focus. Cain only seemed to interview wealthy, successful types, defining them by their job roles and career trajectories. This consistent use of famous and successful figures only serves to alienate those sensitive readers who already feel they aren’t up to scratch. I’d personally have liked some gender-based discussion - a large portion of CEO’s and interviewees were male - with more focus on relationship interplay or motherhood to potentially expand the dialogue further. ‘Quiet’ might have lost me quickly and this would have been a shame considering the more personal, human element which evolves in the final third. It was here I identified why I felt so uncomfortable at school and why I had to use excessive force when dragging myself to nightclubs ten years ago. According to Cain, the key is finding your ‘sweet spot’, that precarious balance that meets your need for alone time with your desire to be with others and get the job done. ‘Quiet’ outlines what it means to be born with an introverted temperament. It certainly allowed me to understand myself better but, for those seeking information outside of the work arena, you’d best not rely on this book alone.3/5 Stars."
257,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4592166-joana,5,"First of all, I greatly recommend this book to any type of personality. As Susan Cain explains, the introvert-extrovert axis is one of the few (if not the only) concepts every psychologist uses for personality analysis. And, for the most skeptical of you, it is obvious there is no ""pure"" introvert or ""pure"" extrovert, those cases would probably be pathological.According to my rating, I loved this book. It took a lot of research, more than I expected, but it validates problems I've had to deal with ever since I was born. I am a known introvert, but also more than that... a pseudo-extrovert, which is someone that spends a lot of energy on a daily basis acting like an extrovert. Now someone might think that it is dishonest of me to do such a thing but it is just a tool i've developed to lead the life I've chosen, to do the things I love (that take a lot of human contact) and interact with the people that matter most to me. Being an introvert comes with some guilt, right from when we were children, thanks to the extrovert ideal that reigns a little all over the globe (with the exception of asian and nordic cultures). While reading Cain's book, and learning more about sociology and myself (because I found myself nodding on every single page and saying 'That's precisely what I feel, but I've never thought about it this way!'), that stingy feeling was put off.When I talked about this book with some extrovert friends of mine, they all reacted the same way - 'You're kidding, right? There are far more introverts than extroverts!'. I'm not saying that isn't true... to you. That's your perception of the world, which tends to differ a lot from the one of introverts. Anyway, scientific knowledge cannot be based on such perceptions, it uses statistics and a great battery of previously validated tests, and they account for one third of the population being introverts, in North America and Europe.All in all, the message of this book - that I absolutely agree with- is pretty simple - there shouldn't be such an ideal modelling every activity in our society, since kindergarten lessons to employment interviews. Every type of personality should be cherished and its best traits nourished and explored. Like Carl Jung superbly put it - 'The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances; if there is any reaction, both are transformed.'"
258,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna,3,"Thirty to fifty percent of people around the world are introverts, and I'm one of them. I began this book thinking I'd find some interesting facts about people like me and perhaps even find a definition in there as to what an introvert actually is since the term seems so slippery with a number of seemingly outgoing individuals claiming to be introverted. I found all of this inside this book and more. Because as I continued reading, I found answers to questions I hadn't thought to ask when it came to introverts in a traditional school system, in a team-oriented workplace, and in all sorts of personal relationships, including that of parent and child.But one thing I never expected to gain from this book was a sense of kinship with other introverts, and a bit of comfort in learning why introverts are as they are. I learned the value of introverts in society, and how they need not apologize for possessing attributes certain people might view as weaknesses instead of strengths. And in case you think this book is only for introverts, you'd be wrong. The book is just as valuable for every extrovert who will ever come in contact with an introvert in helping him to understand them.Still, this book could have been even better than it was in several areas. The title is certainly misleading since the author does not explore introverts around the world. She concentrates on America, mostly. There was a small mention that Finland is a nation of introverts. And China and Chinese Americans had some page time. But overall, if the author does mention other countries, she lumps all of the East together versus countries of the West. That was a big disappointment to me and seems, for all the research she did, neglectful. Another problem that I had with the book was that it was very technical and dry, going into physiology of the brain and extended comparative research studies conducted on extroverts and introverts. I would have preferred less generalization and more personal case studies of individuals. There were some, but not nearly enough.But overall, this is a very valuable book for introverts and extroverts alike. It gives the reader much to think about, and to hopefully allow him to see himself or his quiet friend or colleague or family member in a different light and with a sense of appreciation."
259,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy,4,"I wasn't surprised at Cain's generalization that extroverts are the social ideal. People who exhibit the personality traits of extroversion, those who are more gregarious, more active in group dynamics, and more comfortable as the center of events are seen as those most successful at life. The person who practices activity over thought, isn't afraid of taking risks, and displays confidence in the ways they conduct themselves are generally more admired than their introverted counterparts who're often thought to be limited in terms of interaction and therefore less likely to be successful. Quiet people are sometimes thought of as disappointments. Extroversion is the ideal we're expected to achieve.Cain's study refutes the notion that introverts are limited or that the way they conduct themselves in society and business--private, shy, contemplative, even--doesn't have personal value or benefit society. She reminds us that some of history's leading personalities--political, military, and business--have been introverts. How our ideas about extroversion and introversion have led us to behave is that people pretend to be extroverted. It's a big subject. She writes chapters dealing with such topics as handling introverted children, how extrovert-introvert thought processes are different, the influence of temperament, and new business models that emphasize working alone. She writes about how solitude breeds more innovation. She emphasizes the importance of finding the work you love and best fits your personality. She spends considerable space discussing the notion of high emotional sensitivity in people and how it's related to introversion. In the end she stresses that while love is essential, gregariousness isn't.Most people would come, I think, to this book already thinking of themselves as introverted and, the general perception being that certain social skills, even intelligence, are lacking, looking for explanations and ways to deal with it. I know that I was looking for ways of seeing myself. Cain has some answers. I did find myself in her book but also finished it believing introversion is far from undesirable. She makes me proud to be the way I am."
260,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2555509-mike-vasich,2,"I have been an introvert my entire life, and much in this book resonated with me. It was enlightening to discover that I'm not some freak or weirdo (well, maybe a little) because I don't like to go to parties or hang out with huge groups of people, or that I find excessive socializing very tiring. Learning that introverts also have tendencies to fixate on their pet projects (my words, not the author's) was also eye-opening since I of course have that tendency, as well. So why only a two star? (Probably more of a 2.5). I tired of hearing about how wonderfully accomplished the author and her circle were, for one thing. We learn that she went to Harvard, was a very successful Wall Street attorney, is married to an amazingly successful blah blah blah, knows all these amazing people who yada yada yada . . . I'm not opposed to a little self promotion, but much of the book seemed like an exercise in vanity. ""I'm an introvert and I'm so wonderful and successful and you can be, too if you're like me!"" I also didn't like the near-constant praise of everything introvert. Many famous names are dropped and we are told they were introverts (probably true), but the implication seemed to be that introverts are just all so wonderful and amazing, and you might be the next Rosa Parks or Einstein or Eleanor Roosevelt, etc. if you are an introvert. To be fair, the author does note that both extroverts and introverts have strengths and weaknesses, but I felt like she was putting up extroverts as a kind of straw man to herald how wonderful introverts are.The advice section on how to deal with introverts--especially how teachers should deal with introvert students--left me annoyed. A lot of it was pretty common-sensical. ""Allow introverts time to think"", ""Don't embarrass them in class."" But her ideas about what goes on in the classroom made me think she doesn't really know much about how real classrooms and schools work. Anyway, worth a look if you're an introvert, but I'm wondering if there are better books out there about the topic."
261,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4197862-valentina,5,"As an introvert myself, this book drew me in just from the title, and I can truly say this is a fascinating study of what being an introvert means.With a mixture of anecdotes and scientific research, Cain explores how introverts function, what makes us act the way we do, and why in this day and age it is such a difficult thing to be respected as someone who is different. Most of us have faced all of the things she mentions, from teachers who think that there is something wrong with children who prefer to read than play, to the minutia like making small talk that can drain some of us of all energy. She does a fantastic job of explaining why we function in this manner, and she manages to show us that we are not wrong in the way we act; we are just different.The narrative is always interesting, keeping the reader engaged all the way through the book. Although this is a serious research book, it never bores, on the contrary, it is hard to put down. There is a wonderful section on how to take care and nurture an introverted child, which can be a challenge since most of society is geared towards extroverts. Introverts need different things, and modern life refuses to provide those things, with its constant rewards for those who speak the loudest, whether they have the right answer or not. If you are an introvert, or if you know an introvert, this is a great read. I highly, highly recommend it."
262,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,3,"I found the first part of this book fascinating. At least 1/3 of us are introverts. The author, Susan Cain, found that being an introvert is not so bad. Many great people were introverted. Scientists such as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and Isaac Newton were introverts. Even politicians and actors such as Al Gore and Robert Di Nero are introverts. She also found the good qualities that introverts have. Introverts tend to be more creative than extroverts. We are also less likely to be unfaithful. We tend to make better decisions as well.The one thing that was most interesting to me was her description of Harvard Business School. The author states that the good grades went to those who talked the most. It didn’t matter how substantial the information was that was said. As a consequence extroverts did better in the debate formatted classes. I was surprised about all the research that was done (and is currently being done now) in this field. It seems like Ms. Cain covered every study. She also used so many stories of friends and acquaintances that either were introverts or had introverted children that the book started to drag. I thought to myself who should read this book –the introvert or the extrovert. And decided the introverts should read it to validate the fact that they have nothing wrong with them while extroverts should read it to better understand introverts because many extroverts are attracted to introverts.

263,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/640412-katie-wudel,5,"I'm sure, like a lot of folks, that I mostly picked this up because of the provocative title. And I'm so glad I did. It's a well-written, entertaining read and nearly every page contained at least one small nugget of wisdom or new scientific discovery that utterly blew my mind. I can't even begin to list them, but one of my faves: Did you know that it's been PROVEN that in-person group brainstorming sessions do NOT work, over and over again?! People, both extroverts and introverts, come up with many more ideas and solutions when working by themselves, even though, after group brainstorming sessions, they nearly always report that the session was a success. (Group brainstorming sessions are good for social bonding, but not for producing results.) Online collaborative brainstorming DOES work, but think about it: when you're online, even in a chat, you're technically alone with your thoughts. I spend a lot of my working life (and social life, frankly) pretending I'm not introverted, but now I'm learning to embrace my thoughtfulness, my drive to power through a problem, my outward appearance of calm (even when inside, I'm freaking out). There's a lot in this book about office culture that I wish more businesses would take to heart, but for now, I'll focus on the one thing I can control: myself."
264,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,3,"This felt merely like an outlet in which Cain deposited all her research. She switches from story to report, back and forth, and forward and sideways -- so much so that her chapters are sporadic and unrelated to their titles or subtitles. Yes, it contains interesting information, but she could have written a much more entertaining book that was much more organized -- actually organized. It was all a rambling mess of information tentatively related to introverts -- statistics with surmises and questions, without ever coming to a cohesive conclusion.Perhaps it's because I knew most of the information in this book already. With the exception of the occasional recreated vocab word or statistic, all Cain really did was solidify my preexisting knowledge about introverted and extroverted tendencies. It's not a hard subject to pick up on in everyday life.Worth the read, but I'm sure there's shorter books out there that give a better foundation without all the statistics and names. Pity that she went so in-depth with her research, but never phrased it well enough for me to appreciate. Cain is well-spoken, but this dragged on and on without any real goal or point at the end. I was left with no sense of conclusion or satisfaction."

Or at least, that's what popular personality-type quizzes like Myers-Briggs and other people's observation of me have led me to believe.Quiet, is an interesting exploration of the roles that introversion plays out in modern society.There's a lot of interesting observations and discussion about the state of American society which favors 'extroversion' and that 'introversion' has become somewhat of a negative connotation.Susan Cain explores this cultural trend and looks into the neurophysiological differences between the two and how different cultures view both extroversion/introversion.Overall, this is an interesting read - there's a lot to be gained from Susan Cain's gentle approach into the matter. Looking back at this now, it may seem 'obvious' and you may wonder why such a book was written in the first place - it's more of an insight into how disquieting American society has become in general, somehow equating extroversion with success. Other cultures don't place the same premium on extroversion as does America.Definitely one of the few non-fiction books that will absolutely benefit you.3.96 / 5 "
266,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/325787-sarah,4,"4.5 stars. As an introvert myself, this was a big ah-ha book for me. Like, now it makes sense to me why I feel so much more affected by both beauty and violence than others, why I have a horror of being over-scheduled or not having sufficient free time, why I'm tired and really need space and quiet after work even though I have a not-especially-demanding job that I like and find rewarding, why I'm drawn to my extroverted, life-of-the-party husband (even as he wears me out with his constant chatter), why so many of my best girlfriends have been fiery types with big personalities. Like a handful of other nonfiction books (The Omnivore's Dilemma, Animals in Translation, and A Natural History of the Senses come to mind), it's a book that just seems so right and true to me, somehow. It wasn't as consistently fascinating to me as those other titles, some sections were definitely better than others, but if you are an introvert and/or interested in personality and temperament, I would highly recommend it."
267,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/245923-dini,4,"I've seen some comments saying this book is meant to make introverts feel good about themselves. Well, I say introverts deserve to feel good about themselves once in a while, because most of the time we are made to feel that we are somehow lesser than others because we are introverts. From our earliest years we are constantly urged to 'speak up' and 'be active' in social situations. If I could get a coin every time someone said to me ""Why are you so quiet?"" or ""You haven't said anything!"" since I was a little kid, I would be a billionaire by now.I have learned to speak up more and be more active in certain circumstances especially in educational and professional settings, to somewhat fake it in order to get by. But as this book describes, we also need our personal time to recharge and find a balance. And we have our own strengths that should not be underestimated just because we are not loud about it. We can be ourselves and we're just fine the way we are, because without us the world would've been an unbearably loud place."
268,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32271-jeff-raymond,4,"So I guess I'm an introvert?I've had this on my to-read list since the day I heard about it, but only got around to it now. Partially because it's been on perpetual library hold, but more because it's only recently that I realized that I actually appear to hold more introverted traits than the extroverted ones I expected.So reading this book, which is essentially a love letter to introversion, did a lot in terms of kind of confirming a few things about myself that I already kind of knew or believed, and put them in a good context. That was good.The bad is that it might lead me to some confirmation bias issues to work out, but that's on me. That the book felt a little long is one that I can't control, though, and keeps it from being an all-star of a nonfiction book.As it stands, though, a solid read overall and one I'm glad I read and can recommend. Worth the time, intro- or extroverted."
269,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"Given that even in the ungodly extrovert America one third of the population classifies itself as introvert, I couldn’t help but cynically suspect that the title of this book was chosen to convince us introverts to read this book and be convinced of our greatness. That’s not why I picked up this book. I didn’t need any such convincing. “The glory of the disposition that stops to consider stimuli rather than rushing to engage with them is its long association with intellectual and artistic achievements. Neither E=mc2 nor Paradise Lost was dashed off by a party animal.” Maybe extroverts can also accomplish something genuinely novel if they just stop talking a little. This book does a decent job in refuting some of the misconceptions about introversion, e.g., introversion doesn’t mean social anxiety. The reason that I found this book lacking overall is that it’s high on anecdotes and short on substance. "
270,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731872-kathleen,4,"Cain presents a very well-researched discussion about the differences between the introvert and extrovert personality types, and how the Western world has changed from one that used to value introspection and quiet intellect to one of dominance by forceful vivaciousness and outspokenness. Turns out that open office concepts, group projects, and committee meetings are NOT the way to get the best work done. Also, contrary to popular belief, the gregarious and most forceful risk-takers often make terrible leaders and decision makers.If you're an introvert, this book will provide you with many aha! moments. If you love an introvert, expect to gain valuable insights into how they process information, relate to others, and cope with a world whose volume goes to 11.Barnes and Noble is featuring a Drawn to Read review of this title that is worth a look."

A friend gifted it to me and I'm grateful. It definitely shines an important light on our culture and how we now value extroverts over the qualities of introverts. This explains our hang up with Hollywood and sports stars, and the inequity in pay scale. I love the Anais Nin quote in the book. It was written decades ago but applies now:""Our culture made a virtue of living only as extroverts. We discouraged the inner journey, the quest for a center. So we lost our center and have to find it again.""Whether or not you are religious, we have lost something of value in introspection, valuing imagination and creativity, and encouraging our youth to pursue healthy pursuits that feed the better part of the brain. I wish this were required reading for every US citizen."

Her first case study is herself, and she looks at Rosa Parks, Ghandi and others.She also looks at how introverts need to have time and space of their own to be able to function, and how some introverted people manage to carry off a extroverted persona at times to help them fit in. I really enjoyed this book, don't feel quite so alone now!"

281,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"Why do some of us tend toward introversion( purely genetical?...)?- Genetics play a significant role in determining introversion vs. extroversion, for sure. The amygdala of an introvert is different.But there is also a component that comes from environment and life experiences.Why do some culture chase for extroversion?Are shyness and introversion the same thing? ( No please! Shyness is the fear of social disapproval or humiliation, while introversion is a preference for environments that are not overstimulating)Should introverts get a cure for their inherent traits?How does the environment shape introvert's behaviors? What is the evolutionary advantage of introversion? Why does introversion tend towards cynicism? How to manage or work for an introvert as an extroverted person or vice versa?Is there any relation/connection between introversion and emotional intelligence?What is the benefit of sticking to your own enthusiasm for growing?What are the negative effects of skating /jumping from one action/hobbies to another for learning?Is there any relation among persistency, introversion, and depth of understanding?Why do some introverts train themselves to act like extroverts sometimes?Is that always healthy for an introvert to stretch the personality to get out of their inherent temperments? How can we behave like introverts (and no one can tell we're introverts) to understand other introverts, extroverts better?Referring to the “Big Five” personality traits, what Susan Cain states that her use of the word “introvert” includes not only introversion but also “openness to experience,” “conscientiousness” and “neuroticism.” She (sort of) admits that there is no scientific basis for correlating introversion with these other three personality traits, but then she states that there’s a basis in literature for the generalization that introverted people also fall on the “sensitive/nervous” side of neuroticism, not on the “secure/confident side.” Our society often rewards or admires extroverts but there is much to admire from introverts as well.I would like to mention her last quote in this book -""Introverts are offered keys to private gardens full of riches. To possess such a key is to tumble like Alice down her rabbit hole. She didn't choose to go to Wonderland - but she made it an adventure that was fresh and fantastic and very much her own.Lewis Caroll was an introvert too, by the way. Without him, there would be no Alice in Wonderland""Introverts prefer to work independently, and solitude is a catalyst for innovation. Though introversion is a “fixed trait,” but introverts can benefit from “self-monitoring” and putting on an extroverted persona to achieve personal goals that are important. It’s also helpful for introverts for creating “restorative niches,” periods of time when they can be alone and “recharge their batteries” by doing something of interest by themselves.This book takes a step away from current views about introverts and talks about introverts from the point of view of psychology and results of experiments in a persuasive manner. :)"
282,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,4,"When you read Susan Cain's Quiet, you must remind yourself of a few things:• This not introverts versus extroverts; [1]• she is not villainizing extroverts;• she is not out to glorify introverts and introversion; and• if it seems like she is making unsubtle generalizations, it's because she has targeted a lay audience.With this in mind, you are then properly armed to read and digest her otherwise wonderful book. The sub-title is a good place to start:The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop TalkingNot to judge a book by what's on the cover, but we get the gist from that alone. Let's unpack it:What Cain has written is a book about introverts and introversion, [2] the qualities that constitute them, the ways in which they (introverts) are strong and powerful, the places where their tendencies can work against them, and some of the strategies they can use to overcome those tendencies [3]--but also when to stand firm and acknowledge that you (as an introvert) need not bend. And when she makes that borderline inflammatory sleight of hand word with ""in a World That Can't Stop Talking"", what she is really saying is that we have arrived at a place in our culture/society where we now over-value extroversion and extraverted traits: talking and group work, immediate action, open office floor plans... the list goes on. And while she does not quite go so far as to demonize all of these behaviors, she also is sure to point out that we've swung too far in the other direction--we've pathologized introverts and introverted traits. If someone is quiet, we accuse them of being shy and/or anti-social. If someone would prefer to reflect on a problem or situation, we call them slow and indecisive.We have transitioned (Cain writes [4]) from a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality. We judge people by the first impressions they make, not by the last effects they have. We judge ideas by the candy-coating of PowerPoint presentations, and not by the facts and figures. In her words: ""It's an elitism based on something other than merit."" And while this sounds awful, and while it would seem easy to blame that ""Culture of Personality"", [5] Cain seems more interested in examining the whole picture. Who are introverts? What makes them that way? How do they perceive and make sense of the world? How do they react to the world? How do they react to and deal with other people?And as long as she is already asking the questions, she decides to ask all of these same questions about extroverts.The book is full of fascinating research and interesting anecdotes. I won't go into all of it here, but I did want to remark on one particular point--what Cain calls ""the New GroupThink"", and if there is any place where she seems to eviscerate our current social tendency toward extroversion, it's here.Cain's ""New GroupThink"" isn't exactly Orwellian [6] but there is some palpable apprehension on her part--apprehension over the phenomenon's pervasiveness and the threats that this poses to introverts. The New GroupThink is effectively the dominant cultural paradigm in which we believe (mostly falsely) that the work is team work and that the best ideas come out of brainstorming. She talks about how this is reflected in open office floor plans, how people are organized into teams in the workplace, and how students are arranged in ""pods"" in schools. She talks about authors like Gladwell, Bennis, and Shirky as kinds of prophets of this mode of thinking--and she calls them out as being effectively full of shit. [7] Her problem isn't with group work per se--she freely acknowledges that some types of work are (probably) best performed in groups, and that we need to prop each other up with our complementary styles and areas of expertise--but with how our immediate response to most questions and problems seems to be: ""Let's put everyone into a room and brainstorm a solution!"" Cain's opposition here boils down to two key points: (1) that such situations effectively shut down and tune out introverts [8], and (2) that the research suggests that ""brainstorming"" actually produces bad results. To the first point, the obvious problem is that group situations over-stimulate introverts, who would prefer time to think and who in many cases would prefer to write out their ideas rather than try to talk them through. To the second point, group dynamics can actually change your perceptions and alter your opinions; while discussing governments, corporate management, and academic institutions, she offers up this chilling quote:But when the group is literally capable of changing our perceptions, and when to stand alone is to activate primitive, powerful, and unconscious feelings of rejection, then the health of these institutions seems far more vulnerable than we think.Indeed.As an introvert, I found this book in many ways validating. I saw a lot of myself (and a lot of my loved ones, on both sides of the spectrum) in this book. I walked away from it thinking: She's right. I do my best work when I can wall off a few hours of isolation. I need the time away to recharge and to organize my thoughts. Why should I change to fit the loud mouths? And I don't believe that to be naïve; I do not think it is unreasonable. And I expect to change by not changing.---[1] As Cain indicates in her text: after much deliberation, she went with the popularly recognized ""extrovert"", as opposed to ""extravert"" which is preferred in the technical literature. Thus do I go with that term here.[2] I say ""introverts and introversion"" because, as she points out by quoting Carl Jung (the originator of the terms): ""...there is no such thing as a pure extrovert or a pure introvert. Such a man would be in the lunatic asylum."" Meaning that when we say ""introvert"", what we are really saying is ""someone with predominantly introverted preferences and tendencies"". It's a constellation of behaviors.[3] Though I'll caution you that this is not a self-help book. And in fact, she points out that many (most? all?) self-help books tend to slant toward extroversion: toward teaching you to be boisterous and more out-going etc. (i.e., to be a loud, pushy, and obnoxious jerk).[4] And suggests that this transition is ""for worse"".[5] And (truth be told) in some places she basically does.[6] Though it may as well be?[7] Of course, she also presents Jason Fried as a counter-point to those guys, but the man who has called meetings toxic can himself be a bit poisonous, if you ask me.[8] Who (needless to say?) would rather ""brainstorm"" the ideas on their own first before discussing them with anyone.---See also:• Here's Susan Cain's TED Talk."
283,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42763210-kishan-mittal,4,"The book delivered what it promised - it made me change the way I see myself . Lately I had come to believe that I am an introvert. I find it hard to initiate random conversations with people I don't know well, I prefer casual small get togethers than the often planned weekend parties where I can't recognise half of the faces, and not to mention that it takes a huge huge amount of mental effort for me to sustain conversations where I don't have anything tangible to say or good to contribute. I have often blamed myself for not living up to the 'social standards' and for being such a reticent guy. 'Quiet' tackles exactly these situations and many others. It argues why introverts / extroverts behave the way they are , the difference in their physiologies , why is it wrong to build our society based on the norms of only one kind and why above all, introversion is not something that needs to be cured and moulded into the extrovert ideal but rather needs to be acknowledged in its own regard . I hope that I am able to retain what i have read in this book for the rest of my life, and that I am able to come out of dilemmas that I face every now and then for keeping quiet. Ending the review with the following lines from the book, which represent one such dilemma -""In the Culture of Character, the ideal self was serious, disciplined, and honorable. What counted was not so much the impression one made in public as how one behaved in private.""""At the onset of the Culture of Personality, we were urged to develop an extroverted personality for frankly selfish reasons—as a way of outshining the crowd in a newly anonymous and competitive society""""All of which raises the question, how did we go from Character to Personality without realizing that we had sacrificed something meaningful along the way?"""
284,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20156212-jason-harris,1,"I'm not sure how it's possible to fail at writing this book, but Cain has done it. Spectacularly.First, her attempt at ""sciencing"" is so very, very no. As a researcher, I'm speechless at how consistently and how badly she manages to misunderstand and misuse the science she cites. And the science is what she fills much of the book with. My worst nightmare is an airheaded journalist trying to write a story on research findings. This is that. Only worse.Second, there are two unforgivable structural sins. First, she leaves her feeble attempt at a working definition of introversion in a note at the end of the book. You literally read the whole book on introversion trying to work out how she defines introversion. Only to find she tried to do so. And filed it away where you wouldn't find it until after reading the book. Second, her citations/footnotes are numerous, but not indicated in the text. At all. Again, you could read the whole book not knowing there was a single citation only to get to the end and find 45 pages of notes arranged by page number.Third, it's just a terribly thought out book by someone who doesn't know the first thing about the psychology they are attempting to discuss. It is populist. It is intellectually insulting. It is very short on helpful insights. It is poorly structured and badly written. It is of quite loose coherence.Sadly, I don't know another book that says what this book was trying to say, so this book might be the best way to explore the crucial topic addressed here. But you'd have to take the whole thing as having the scientific credibility of New Idea or Woman's Day. Profoundly disappointing read."

286,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2304944-catzkc,4,"A bit dry, but lots of good bits. Just took a while to get thru - taking it a little bit at a time. Would have been really helpful if I had this 25 years ago! Had to learn some of these things the hard way over the years. For example, from grade school thru high school I would often be accused of being stuck-up. Totally confounded me - I wasn't popular, my parents didn't have a lot of money to spend on trendy, fashionable clothes, I didn't have a car or whatever item/gadget was ""the thing to have"" at the time. If it wasn't being accused of being stuck-up, I be accused of not liking or hating someone, while maybe I hardly was even aware that person existed, not to mention knowing them well enough to have established an opinion one way or the other about them. That continued even later on after college when I started working. Finally I realized that my being so quiet (and VERY much an introvert - like ALL the way over on the scale) many people are intimidated by that. And since they can't read my mind, and I'm not running on at the mouth giving away what's running thru my mind, they will project their thoughts onto me. If they are insecure, those thoughts they project will not be positive in attitude - instead they will assume I am thinking the worst about them. A worthwhile read, if a little tedious at times. But I think I'll probably go back to it now and again to re-read parts of it, and refresh parts that I highlighted. This book would probably be most interesting to introverts, extroverts who live or work closely with introverts, or someone who has a particular interest in behavioral psychology. "

Modifiers ascribed to extroversion in this book consistently are negative, while modifiers applied to introverts are, if not always positive, at least used to put the best construction on a situation.Overall, I found the book helpful, though it is difficult to trust the research values behind anyone who publishes statements such as this: ""Even the Western God is assertive, vocal, and dominant; his son Jesus is kind and tender, but also a charismatic, crowd-pleasing man of influence.""The work cited as historical proof of this assertion? Not any primary source, but...wait for it...Lloyd Webber's JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR."

It seems my initial instinct of ""do not read, you already know tons about introversion from the internetz"" was mostly true. I did not, however, hate it and I did find some value in it such as the importance of looking at if there are spots for me to hide away and reflect at work. My current work is not open concept exactly, but it sort of is and everything is overcrowded and I just hate it. I think the chapters about introverted children are also especially helpful for parents or teachers who just don't know or understand how to respect who their children are."
289,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14767901-martha-love,4,"""Quiet"" is definitely a book that anyone could benefit from reading and I especially recommend it to all parents and teachers for its excellent discussions about the learning style of an introvert. It is an excellent exploration of the introvert-extrovert personality functions and encourages people to appreciate both ways of functioning. Susan Cain excels in exploring how introverts have influenced the world, and in particularly the internet and the upstart of the computer age. My feeling is that the positive understanding of the introvert described in this book would please Carl Jung, who as Susan Cain points out to have coined both the word 'introvert' and its original meaning with the person primarily receiving energy from within the world of one's ideas, imagination and feelings rather than from the outer world of people and things as do extroverts. And Jung never intended for the word introvert to be synonymous with the word “shy” as it has been twisted to mean nor that introverts are necessarily ineffective people or less appealing than extroverts. In fact, Jung was an introvert himself, as was both Myers and Briggs (that I know from personal communication in the 70s with Isabel Myers herself), who were instrumental in introducing us to these concepts of the functions of our personality with the MBTI. So the question is, how did the meaning of introvert"" get so twisted and distorted as to mean something less valued than being an extrovert? Susan Cain addresses this question with an explanation of the business personal models and the extrovert ideals that began to storm into the picture in the 20s with Dale Carnegie and others who were pedaling a shift from honoring morality toward self-presentation and personality. I think it would give her discussion a deeper understanding if she also looked at the huge influence that John Watson and his behavioristic views had in the 20’s and 30’s on the advertising world, as well as on business and personnel assessment and development. After being forced to leave the academic world due to a sexual scandal, Watson entered Madison Avenue in the 20s and began showing the advertising world how to apply behavioristic methods to boost sales by the manipulation of the public ideals. His influence of applied psychology in the field of personnel assessment and management was responsible for the idea that “failing businessmen” (remember we are also talking about the gender prejudice of the 20s and 30s) were advised to learn to “talk about more than just their business but also other subjects, like golf and fishing in order to be ‘all you can be’”. Watson strongly advised that we reinvent ourselves to be more of the successful ideal, and yes that meant being outgoing and talkatively social. In many ways, I have felt that the distortion of Jung’s original brilliant Depth Psychological meaning of the word “introvert” was a result of the conflict between Watson’s behaviorist applied psychology and more humanistic schools of psychology. And the struggle between and among these vastly different schools of psychological thought still prevails, less we would have little need for this wonderful book by Susan Cain explaining what being an introvert is really suppose to mean.As a graduate student in the 60s in school psychology and psychometry, I was disgusted with the personality inventories commonly used and that I had to study and endure taking and giving as a part of my studies. On the left side of the test results and assessment profile sheets of these inventories were personality characteristics that were considered undesirable and emotionally unhealthy; and on the right side were the healthy and desirable personality traits (reflecting the DSM-3). You may have already guessed it that “introvert” was on the left. This interpretation of typology served to throw me toward looking for an alternative inventory that reflected a way of viewing people that included all ways of functioning as valuable. This was not because I was an introvert, as I have always scored very extrovert, but because this arrangement of introvert and extrovert as one being good and one being bad was plain unbelievable to me, since I had also had the opportunity to read some of Jung’s works and knew this was not how Jung viewed introvert and extrovert. Fortunately, after beginning a teaching career in Gainesville, Florida where the MBTI was being studied extensively, I met and had the grand experience of personally knowing Isabel Briggs Myers, and consequently embraced the MBTI as a personality inventory. Anyone who enjoys “Quiet”, would also enjoy reading Isabel Briggs Myers’ book “Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Type”, which was published in 1980 upon her death, and is written also in a very easy to read style exploring type in positive ways.Martha Char Loveauthor of What's Behind Your Belly Button?

290,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13430088-vipassana,4,"Quiet was great at helping think about the kind of work that I want to do. There's a certain amount of self-negation that I have taught myself after moving to this country. Not that India was any more or less friendly to the introverted kind, just that I felt comfortable in my own skin and less of an outsider. Except, that self-negation is not really taught but rather a reaction to how I know people perceive my personality, and I feel much better equipped to think about how I interact with different kinds of people. Susan Cain's cheering of the introverted personality was comforting to read. She throws study after study aiming to alter the way introversion is perceived as anxious, terrified and misanthropic. I've read all about the introvert processing more external stimuli and being highly reactive to the environment, however it was good to remind myself about that again. I'd recommend this for introverts who need a little reaffirming of their selves., this book is categorized as self-help after all. Unfortunately, I still see a world where the extroverted ideal is considered better than anything so the best my fellow introverts can do is find ways to cope. For that, this book is great."
291,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,5,"It is funny how someone speaking softly but with conviction can change a conversation. Susan Cain has done just that with her bestselling Quiet. The book is about the unique gift, the ""quiet power"", introverts bring to the world, particularly American culture, which places a premium on extroverted behavior--group work, public charisma, being the life of the party. And this is important as she argues because one-third to one-half of all people are introverts. Cain is not arguing that we suddenly coddle introverts or that being extroverted is bad. Rather, she paints a compelling picture of what happens when introverts and extroverts can appreciate each other's temperament and gifts. Her examples of this include Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr and Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. She introduces the book with a compelling narrative of her work with a young Wall Street lawyer and the negotiation she faced in terror that turned out with her being offered a job by opposing counsel. During the negotiation ""Laura"" turned to her ""quiet power"" and through persistent questions and proposal carried the day against her extroverted, brazen opposite. ""Laura"", it turns out is our author.The first part of the book focuses on the American extrovert ideal. Cain traces the history of this ideal and what she calls ""the new Groupthink"" and its manifestations in education, business, and even the church (she visits Saddleback Church at one point observing that it was ""all communication"" with no chance for reflection).In the second part of the book, she turns to the research on temperament and argues that introverts are actually different in their sensitivity to stimuli, in how their brains process dopamine, and more. This is the most technical part of the book but Cain livens this up through first person interviews and illustrative stories including that of Franklin and Eleanor, and the contrast between the ""Masters of the Universe"" on Wall Street and Warren Buffett. At the same time, she avoids a ""biology is destiny"" argument. Introverts can push the boundaries of their temperament in things like public speaking when it is for causes and purposes they care for deeply.Part three is the shortest section, just one chapter, in which she proposes that all cultures do not share our extrovert ideals. Working in a university context with many Asian-Americans, I found this of interest because she suggests that the Asian ideal is different and that all the group discussions in our classrooms and the extroverted character of much of campus life poses real strains for many Asian-Americans. Part of the strain is the pull to deny one's own cultural heritage and temperament, thinking the American is ""better"".Part four focuses on how introverts may constructively engage an extrovert world--when to act more extroverted than you are, how to talk to the opposite type and how to raise children who are introverted. Most enlightening to me was the idea of not ""throwing them in the deep"" when they fear something, but gradually and safely introducing them to new things. I've know introverts who received the former treatment in childhood who still carry painful memories of these experiences.Perhaps it is part of her lawyerly training, but Cain writes with clarity, building a compelling argument in a quiet voice, with nothing extra. What I most appreciate, in contrast to some I've read on this topic, is that Cain does not come off ""whiny"" or with an entitlement mentality. She makes her case for cherishing the gift introverts bring to the world without downplaying the gifts of others. Her plea is one that plays not on guilt manipulation but the recognition of a tremendous opportunity to recognize what introverts add to our families, our organizations, and our world."
292,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172557-kirstine,4,"“Introversion—along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness—is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology. Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man’s world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are.”The first thing I want to say about this book is that I want to give it to everyone. I want to bulk buy it and just hand it to everyone I know and people I meet on the street. I also understand that this is not because the book itself is perfect, but because it covers a subject that is incredibly dear to me and that not enough people know about. I wish I’d known about introversion and extroversion when I was growing up, I wish my parents, my teachers, my friends, had known. I wish this because, despite growing up with a decent amount of self-love, a lot of the guilt I felt for not socializing more, for not liking parties, for not having a shitton of friends, is something I can still clearly recall. I wish I’d known I was perfectly normal. There are things about this book I dislike; how it focuses too much on introversion vs. extroversion in the world of big businesses (we’re introduced to Wall Street lawyers, salesmen, etc.) and is extremely USA-centered. A broader range of examples, from people and situations from different social-classes (not just the top and a few in the middle) would have been nice, as well as perhaps a European perspective. However, they are small complaints. All in all I found this to be an excellent look at introversion. Susan Cain treats her subject-matter very seriously, probably due to the fact that she is herself an introvert and feels, the way I do, that the world ought to know being an introvert is perfectly fine – that in some ways, we have strengths that extroverts don’t (and vice versa). The crime being that one is accepted as the norm, while the other is considered a flaw, thus lowering (to an extreme degree) the chance of those introvert-strengths ever being put to good use. If you want a very deep look into what makes a person introverted/extroverted, then this is not that book. It’s a mix of science, psychology, real-life examples/experiences and advice. It touches on plenty of subjects, but Cain doesn’t linger too long. She explains (putting the science and her own examples to excellent use) and we understand, making it a simple, enlightening and validating read. Enlightening to both introverts and extroverts a like, and validating for all of us who’ve gone through life feeling wrong and guilty for being who we are. It’s short, but it’s sharp and on point, with all the information boiled down into the essentials. There are plenty of sources if you want to dig further into the various studies, but it’s plainly written for the common reader. Anyone who might have need of this book will be capable of understanding it, and that is so hugely important. I’m grateful for this book and to Susan Cain for putting so much effort, work and love into it. The world is indeed built, it seems, to serve extroverts (if you wonder why; she explains that too), but that can change, as soon as introverts stop feeling they have to make excuses for themselves. As soon as quiet is accepted on equal footing its louder counterparts. “None of this is to denigrate those who forge ahead quickly, or to blindly glorify the reflective and careful. The point is that we tend to overvalue buzz and discount the risks of reward-sensitivity: we need to find a balance between action and reflection.”"

294,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5541253-amgad-muhammad,4,"I'm a big disbeliever in personality types. I think they limit our abilities rather than reveal them and most of the time we end up judging and labeling each other by that narrow perspective we built upon those categories. (We cut pieces out of you so we can box you in a category that's easier to judge)..So if I am to review the book from that standpoint ;it is a disaster. It builds walls between the camp of doers and the camp of thinkers, it fuels prejudice, and it disconnects us from being a beautiful spectrum of integrated uniqueness to individualistic unconnected dots. But that's not the case. Susan here is not really on a mission to gather Introverts on a plan of revenge as I thought she was. But she's here to tell us that if you would rather read a book under the blanket than joining the party next door, or if you'd rather study alone than in a group, or if you like to watch a movie in total silence and take long walks alone, then it's Ok... Actually it's more than Ok, it's awesome! On a small scale, this book is a guide for Introverts to get to know themselves (and feel less guilty and more compassionate about it). And a guide for extroverts to know why their friends keep their cellphones closed on weekends. On a large scale, this is a book for the world to stop the freaking extrovert culture madness! JUST STOP IT! When Introverts are left unrecognised we all suffer. When we don't give Introverts the chance to succeed the way they are, quietly and softly, we risk destroying the next E=mc2 or the next harry potter series or the next peace activist who will bring independence to his poor and scattered home land. My only complain here is the use of what seemed unpublished research work or weak social experiments. Some of the cited social work is not mature enough to establish facts or support theories. Also some of the experiments conducted in the book looked naive to me and unconvincing. Since the topic here is a cultural and social aspect of human identity I'd expected more qualitative data than quantitative data. And the qualitative data to be of more value. The stories in the book are great but they are not enough, that made me feel that Susan might have been trying to push the limits to prove something that was not really scientifically proven. However, my view changed when she started reality-talking Introverts. She encouraged Introverts to do extroverted stuff if it's essential to our goals and that sometimes we will have to put down our quietness and yell and shout and scream. So I think I'm comfortable with the facts she tried to pursue. ""We know from myths and fairy tales that there are many different kinds of powers in this world. One child is given a light saber, another a wizard’s education. The trick is not to amass all the different kinds of available power, but to use well the kind you’ve been granted. Introverts are offered keys to private gardens full of riches. To possess such a key is to tumble like Alice down her rabbit hole. She didn’t choose to go to Wonderland—but she made of it an adventure that was fresh and fantastic and very much her own.Lewis Carroll was an introvert, too, by the way. Without him, there would be no Alice in Wonderland. And by now, this shouldn’t surprise """

That's the one where he's stranded on a deserted island and tries mightily to get off of it for seven years. When I saw that, my first question was, ""Why are you trying to leave?"" I mean, come on, peace and quiet at last!I'm an introvert. Other introverts think I'm too introverted. Back in the 1980s I had knee surgery and didn't leave the house for three weeks when my college roommates went home. We didn't have cable TV or personal computers, nevermind the internet. I was happily alone. My girlfriend at the time said she could envision me living alone on an island. Little did she know what that dude on Bosom Buddies had in store for me!So yeah, I liked this book. Shocking.As I was reading along, I would occasionally post excerpts on Facebook and ask people their thoughts or if they saw these same tendencies in their kids when Cain talks about how they followed babies into adulthood to see how they'd turn out on the extrovert-introvert scale. Stuff like that. I got some interesting answers from parents and teachers and psychologists, and it sparked some wide-ranging discussions.But the extroverts? Man, they had FITS. I hadn't noticed, but apparently a lot of them are feeling rather put-upon by all these introverts coming out of the closet and organizing into online groups. I kind of surprised myself by feeling no pity.My school was dominated by extroverts and their rules. So yeah, a lot of this book rang true. Hell, even my math class had a portion of the grade set aside for ""class participation."" It wasn't enough to know the damn equations, you had to participate. And even when you tried, if you didn't do it right according to the outgoing teacher, you got a poor grade. So why should I even bother? I'm incredibly uncomfortable already and you're still not going to give me a grade as good as the doofus sitting in the next desk because he always raises his hand and puts wrong equations on the board? Screw that.Hm... I may have some repressed stuff here that I didn't know was lurking under the surface.And that's because we live in an extroverted world run by extroverts. Which is pretty much Cain's central thesis, which is so true it hurts. Yet I've had a number of extroverts protest this. It's exactly like White Privilege: if you don't see the problem, you ARE the problem.""Why don't you try to understand extroverts?"" one of my theatre friends proclaimed.Um, because I don't have to. You guys broadcast everything all the time. You're always thinking out loud and organizing things and woo-hooing all over the place that it's impossible to escape you. the reason we introverts enjoy the internet so much is because we can indulge at our convenience and take it at our speed. It's asynchronous and we can wade in when we've recharged out batteries.Quiet has a lot of science and study to back up what we already know is true, which is good. Cain also challenges us -- introverts and extroverts alike -- to consider the world from the other perspective, because we truly do have strengths and weaknesses that make us better as a whole.It's just that introverts are better. But you knew that."
296,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410049-mark-stevens,0,"If you have found this review and if you are contemplating the investment of reading time, don’t hesitate any longer.“Quiet” is thought-provoking and rich. I hope it promotes a shift back from our current culture of personality to a culture of character. I know it’s doubtful, but one can hope. “Quiet” encourages us, from schools to the workplace to our everyday interactions, to reconsider our thinking about introverts. It’s an argument that the world would be a better place if we celebrated all aspects of humanity and understood that we need all types of brainpower and all types of character traits in order to move ahead. “Quiet” is one of those non-fiction reads that provides a new prism in which to view the world and I highly recommend it.This review is being posted to suggest another audience for “Quiet:” fiction writers.If you read “Quiet” and if you write fiction, you might never think about any characters you develop without thinking about where and how they fall within the world of introverts, extroverts and ambiverts (individuals who don’t lean one way or the other).From Susan Cain’s “Note on the Words Introvert and Extrovert” from the end of “Quiet.”The book “focuses on the person who recognizes him- or herself somewhere in the following constellation of attributes: reflective, cerebral, bookish, unassuming, sensitive, thoughtful, serious, contemplative, subtle, introspective, inner-directed, gentle, calm, modest, solitude-seeking, shy, risk-averse, thin-skinned. Quiet is also about this person’s opposite number: the ‘man of action’ who is ebullient, expansive, sociable, gregarious, excitable, dominant, assertive, active, risk-taking, thick-skinned, outer-directed, lighthearted, bold, and comfortable in the spotlight.”Cain uses “introvert” and “extrovert” in broad terms but I’m recommending this book to any writer who is trying to think through a character under development—where does your antagonist or protagonist or other minor character fall within the options available? “Quiet” is a handbook, based on science and lots of research, about personality types and how they function.And, as with a lot of great fictional characters, it comes down to the inner life versus the outer life. A solid contrast between the two always makes for a juicy character. “Whoever you are,” Cain writes, “bear in mind that appearance is not reality. Some people act like extroverts, but the efforts costs them in energy, authenticity, and even physical health. Others seem aloof or self-contained, but their inner landscapes are rich and full of drama. So the next time you see a person with a composed face and a soft voice, remember that inside her mind she mind be solving an equation, composing a sonnet, designing a hat. She might, that is, be deploying the powers of quiet.”It’s a fascinating read—and an excellent breakdown of how to think about characters and you might cast them in your story.  "
297,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,2,"I was once an introvert. ""Reserved"" was the term my mother used, reflecting her New England background. She was armed with many reasons about how she was unable to change from that temperament herself. By contrast, my father was quite gregarious. When I was a teenager, I was in awe of his ability to talk with strangers. Happily, as I got out in the world, I became more like my father. It has been a good thing indeed. But I still treasure my time to be alone, to read and think. I guess I'm an ambivert.As for my mother's excuses, and others I see proffered by some other introverts, I have always liked this scene from Pride & Prejudice in which Elizabeth Bennet is playing the pianoforte under the critical eye and ear of Lady Catherine de Bourgh at her Rosings estate. And commands the intense gaze of Darcy.ELIZABETH: First time I ever saw Mr Darcy was at a ball, where he danced only four dances... [Colonel Fitzwilliam laughs.] ELIZABETH: ...though gentlemen were scarce, and more than one lady was in want of a partner. [Darcy fiddles with his signet ring, pondering her statement.] ELIZABETH: I am sorry to pain you, but so it was.COL. FITZWILLIAM: I can well believe it.MR DARCY: I fear I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers.ELIZABETH: Shall we ask him why? [Elizabeth plays a few more chords.] ELIZABETH: Why a man of sense and education, who has lived in the world, should be ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers? [Elizabeth finishes the chords.]MR DARCY: I'm…I have not that talent, which some possess, of conversing easily with strangers. ELIZABETH: Well, I do not play this instrument so well as I should wish to, but I have always supposed that to be my own fault, because I would not take the trouble of practising.-----------Looking back, I think I was a lot like Darcy, even though bored by high school, I was the class clown and enjoyed telling humorous stories to a couple of friends during lunch break. When I was in college I met a new student who was bold enough to confront me about my reserve. ""Its a form of egotism,"" he told me. I was not offended, only surprised by his insight. Darcy, indeed. It would take many years and life experiences to come fully out of my reserve and be at ease with people, including those I just met and strangers in public settings. I know others will differ, but I've had a much happier life as a result of this change. As Elizabeth says, it was a matter of the willingness to practice."

I suppose I was somewhat right on both counts. Both books contained roughly the same biological description of introversion - greater sensitivity to stimuli and a more pronounced fear center - and both had the self-help sections you'd expect: work, relationships, and parenting. The main difference was that this book gave more of a cultural analysis, showing how both classrooms and the business market favor extroverts. In other words, it's not necessarily the person with the best ideas who succeeds but the person who presents them best. Often that's bad news not just for the overlooked introvert but for everybody who didn't take the time to listen to what might have been a better idea. The author, who was an attorney on Wall Street, blames the financial crisis on precisely that dynamic. To some, this may sound like an oversimplification, but as someone who's been pretty much ignored most of my life, I think it's quite likely to be true.Introverts reading this book might not discover anything new about themselves. The biggest insight I got was about extroversion, i.e. that whereas our fear centers are more active, their reward centers are more active. One psychologist even theorizes that reward-seeking is the definition of extroversion. I'm married to an extrovert, and like the Wall Street insight, it may seem like an oversimplification, but I think it's probably true.Even though I didn't find this book to be such a life-changer, I really do admire the author, and not just because she's the granddaughter of a famous rabbi. She's an introvert who's stretching herself beyond her comfort zone to help all other introverts do the same and to help the world to listen to us more closely. I've got to love a mission like that. May Hashem help us all to succeed."
