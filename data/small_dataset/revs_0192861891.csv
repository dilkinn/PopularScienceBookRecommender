0,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368200-nathan,5,"Michio Kaku apparently spent his childhood building super-colliders in his parents' garage. It paid off. He's clearly brilliant, and best of all, he's not lost his imagination. One sad fact of modern physicists is that precious few of them have any imagination, and are incapable of thought experiments and relative flights of fantasy. As Kaku has pointed out, fantasy fueled more great discoveries in science than pure science ever did on its own. In this book he uses what we know about quantum physics to explore possibilities formerly relegated exclusively to science fiction. In doing so, he should be admired. He is merely asking us to consider what some great minds in both literature and physics have imagined, and in doing so, manages to make what we do know seem almost simple by showing us how much we truly don't know. He's amazingly talented, imaginative, and best of all, he knows his math. He also knows how to use that math to dream of what's possible. An absolutely fun book to read.NC"

It is a really good crash course on just what the hell Quantum, String, Unified Field Theory ad Superstring actually are. Lays down the history and concepts in a way that makes sense and makes you get it.Particularly savvy readers will start making the other logical leaps. If we are thinking energy vibrating along a 10-dimensional string, what does that say about the frequency of sentience in the universe? Since energy can't go anywhere and sentience is a factor of energy, what the hell really does happen to us when we die?Enjoy your trip down the rabbit hole."
2,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45364364-kelvin,1,"DNF at chapter 10. It was a bit too dry and technical for me. While the chapter names were intriguing and there were interesting anecdotes in each chapter, it was still slightly too boring, even with the pictures, for me to read into and understand the developments of modern physics. There wasn't much holding it together, i.e. the book only follows the overthrow of each theory as its organizing structure. It also seemed to ramble on with analogies that weren't that great to follow, eg the wood vs marble and flatland comparisons. Though I'm sure that Michio Kaku is quite knowledgable about the theories mentioned in the book (as evidenced by his other books) I expected this book to be more in story form like Flatterland and thus easier to read. Overall, this book was just disappointing for me. I expected it to be a fun and informative telling of the evolution of dimensional theories but ended up getting a book that was difficult to read and closer to a paper than novel."

4,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1846986-kesseljunkie,2,"It was OK just because the science fiction at the end was a lot of fun.Dr. Kaku alternates through two styles -- talking to the reader like they're completely stupid and then talking to them like they've taken a college physics class. I'm neither, I understood what he was writing, and was just insulted. The cornerstone of Hyperspace theory is that there were 10 dimensions for a fraction of a fraction of time in the first fraction of time of existence for this universe, but 6 of them probably don't exist since. Um, so there aren't 10 dimensions -- there might have been. And then the whole premise is that I should accept the premises in the book even though he acknowledges there may never be proof? And the difference between this and religion is....oh, I see, there is none. Fifth dimensional beings could exist, but not God? Interesting assertion. So long as we're just accepting things on faith, let me toss this one out there: God is a 5th dimensional being.But of course, it's sexy to act like you're smart -- and when someone like Dr. Kaku publishes a sexy bit of science fiction and calls it researched science, everyone's afraid to look like they don't ""get it."" It's like living in a Rand novel. It's OK to call bullsh*t on someone in the sciences, people. And in this instance, I do."
5,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/227682-steve,5,"If you've thought science is dull or perhaps too far beyond you, then please meet Michio Kaku. He writes about theoretical physics in a way that will fill you with wonder and possibility. He takes what would otherwise be very complex concepts and conveys them using metaphors that every average joe can understand. The number of a-ha moments I had reading this book were too many to count. What a terrific read."
6,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1287856-david,3,"Started strong. An introduction to non-Euclidian geometry, string theory, and related concepts. Made me fantasize about learning the math. Got more and more speculative toward the end, and not so interestingly so. Like many books, this one would have been improved by a ruthless editor. Still, worth a read if the topic interests you. "
7,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/477898-shawna,4,"This is one of the popular science books that got me so interested in doing physics in the first place. Accessible to me before I even took a physics class, it should be accessible to most anyone with interest. Very interesting questions raised about space and time/parallel universes/etc. New ideas (as of date published: 1994) are discussed in a non-technical way. Also, very well written and easy to read (with humor and everything!)."
8,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7289539-rich-paz,5,I am now officially a Michio Kaku fan. This book explains physics as it should be taught in school. His simplistic approach begs the reader for more information. I also love physics now because I understand it a lot more thanks to Mr. Kaku's books. The school systems should think about this book as part of their cirriculum to teach the importance of understanding physics. Highly recommended.
9,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,4,"Michio Kaku makes some amazingly complex and mind-bending concepts accessible to the lay reader (i.e., me, and maybe you, too, if you're also not a physicist). He sprinkles the book with entertaining and informative anecdotes and his passion for the topic is infectious. Still, I shudder to think that no author ever addresses Schr√∂dinger's ailurophobia. Here's hoping the 6-dimensional universe opens up just as this one closes!"

It's a bit dated, as it was written in the 1990s, but I wanted to start with some of Kaku's earliest works to get a solid foundation of the concepts in here, before moving to his more recent books.Hyperspace has left my mind buzzing with possibilities, with the wonder of the universe, as it took me through concepts like quantum physics, string theory, and higher dimensions.This has been rewarding as a theoretical physics fan, and inspiring as a science fiction writer.I'm excited to read Kaku's next book. It's already sitting on my shelf! üòåThis was my first hardcore science book, but it definitely won't be the last. :)))"

In fact, according to this theory, matter is nothing but the harmonies created by this vibrating string. Since there are an infinite number of harmonies that can be composed for the violin, there are an infinite number of forms of matter that can be constructed out of vibrating strings. This explains the richness of the particles in nature. Likewise, the laws of physics can be compared to the laws of harmony allowed on the string. The universe itself, composed of countless vibrating strings, would then be comparable to a symphony.‚Äù"
13,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1335294-ricardo,3,"It's up there, though not as accessible, as Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Universe in a Nutshell"". Dr. Kaku does spend a considerable time walking the reader through how the theories of space-time and hyperspace arose and some of the historical and more mathematical stuff can be a little dense. However, the book opens really nicely with very vivid and amazing explanations of just how freaky hyperspace can be as well as the implications for the world of physics. The book also ends really well with how hyperspace can tell us something about how the universe will end as well as how it may help us, if we're still around, at that time as well as how to build a time machine and the potential evolution of an intelligent species into one capable of manipulating time and space.I imagine his other book ""Physics of The Impossible"" which focuses more on trying to explain with physics for well-known sci-fi concepts would be as good as the beginning and end of this book. However, if you find that kind of topic, theoretical physics, black holes, time travel, 10 dimensional space, then I would recommend this book. "
14,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63821926-logan-scoles,3,"Intriguing topics and Dr. Kaku is one of the few people who writes for the science enthusiast. Lot of information here. However, it was not conveyed in terms understandable for the general reader. Multitude of topics discussed without ever being broken down as to why I should care or what that means in terms I can relate to. Good book for someone well versed in mathematics or physics. I enjoy the topics discussed, but they need to be broken down in a way in which anyone could understand and relate to."
15,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67164439-aenea-jones,5,"I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone interested in Quantum Physics.Kaku covers both the basics (Schroedinger's Cat, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, double-slit experiment, etc) and the newest insights into the String Theory. One reason why his books are so popular is because he manages to explain difficult and logic-defying processes in an understandable way."

If you're looking forward to seeing another triangle drawn on a saddle or reading another synopsis of that Heinlein story about the girl who became her own parents, Kaku's your guy. (For a while he had me wondering if I'd already read this one and just forgot to review it, but no.)The physics stuff is mostly‚Å∞ covered in the exact same (shallow) way almost everyone else has covered it,¬π but he doesn't stick to that, because other writers don't. His inevitable discussion of things like the anthropic principle and the cosmological argument (you know: those things that were in all pop-sci from, say, the '80s all through The God Delusion, after which they mysteriously became less fashionable) seem calculated to miss the point in a way that's meant to annoy literally anyone with any opinion at all, but they're not even the most embarrassing sections of the book‚Äîthat would be the ``futurology''¬≤ that takes up most of the last quarter of it (I hope you like reading about the Kardashev scale again!).In fairness I should also point out that this book was published in 1994, so it does predate a few hundred (but by no means all) of the books that made popular physics such a tired and derivative cottage industry; I don't think that excuses this one.Writers who have written this exact book in a more competent way include Brian Greene, Brian Cox, and Michio Kaku.--------‚Å∞ His discussion of Schr√∂dinger's cat is notably worse.¬π Kaku did manage to do something Lee Smolin and Peter Woit never could: make me doubt that string theory is actually a meaningful thing and not just a mathematical artefact; a lot of the big insights in his own actual work that he brings up do seem to come down to realising something he came up with was just a way of rephrasing older laws.¬≤ A ``futurologist'', of course, being a sci-fi nerd with delusions of grandeur."

The most egregious spoiler is when he recounts Asimov's The Last Question. Do yourself a favor, before you read this, go read that one first at the very least. Other than the story spoilers this is a great and accessible synthesis of twentieth century physics."
22,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2925334-anusha-sridharan,5,The most intriguing book I have read in recent times.

A good portion of the book discusses the history and progression of humanity's conceptions of higher dimensions, and how those ideas affected art, religion, and other aspects of society (and how, in turn, the science was affected by the results of that cross-pollination). While the science has surely matured since this was written, it's a thought-provoking read about the nature of our universe, and our quest to understand it."
25,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55798799-veronika,4,"Good book. Toward the end I felt like I am reading sci-fi instead of science, which is great. Where would all the science be, without a good dose of imagination. "

27,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44370756-benjamin-park,4,Hyperspace makes the obtuse and opaque concepts of theoretical physics accessible to anyone with an interest in science. I was delighted to learn about the world of physics that lies beyond the three dimensions that we perceive. I did find parts of the book to be too dense or technical so I just skipped over those sections.
28,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6770267-chris,3,"Whew!! The evolution of theoretical physics up to 1994. Was waiting for a more current book, but started this in the interim. Part I, the first four chapters and Parts III & IV, which covered 6 chapters were pretty easy to read for this non-physics person and quite interesting especially those things involving cosmology. Part II, had my brain often saying Whaaaat???! More technical definitely. So why would a non-physics person, much less theoretical physics want to read this book? Well the novel Dark Matter to be precise. It piqued my interest in the titled Dark Matter-what is it? Parallel worlds, wormholes and the like. "
29,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24160488-jim-nielsen,4,"I found this to be an enjoyable, relatively accessible look at some of the most advanced theories of physics (and mathematics) in modern science. Granted, I didn't understand everything in this book, The overview on the brilliant theories of specific and general relativity and their consequences I found fascinating and understandable. Once you start getting into quantum theory and its mathematics things get a little strange and complicated. But why shouldn't they? Quantum mechanics, as the author explains, is a convoluted, ugly theory that is only still around because of its abilities to quite precisely predict experimental data. After an overview in these theories you begin to see the dichotomy between the two and how string theory represents a possibly elegant solution to unify all the laws of physics under a single theory. As the author states many times in the book, you begin to see how the laws of physics can be much more elegantly and beautifully expressed when brought into higher dimensions, an intriguing and fascinating concept. I couldn't put this book down!"

Although some of the book was way over my head, I read the rest with great interest and learned a busload of new things about Quantum Theory. I enjoyed the read though it took me a long time to get through the book. I did have to skip some of the more technical stuff, but every once in a while a light would go on and I would be elated.I can't comment on the book professionally of course, but if you are interested in Quantum Theory, Dr. Kaku's writing style is extremely easy to read, entertaining in some spots and thoroughly engaging."
32,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2833296-bob,4," Good general history of 20th century physics. I enjoyed the layout of the book -- first half of the book is the history of hyperspace, second half is what can come out of the theory. Loved this part. Wormholes, time travel, black holes and the death of the universe. The author does a good job bringing in sci-fi stories to explain or illustrate the various theories. Some times he would go off on a tangent and try to bring the point back in a rough way."

He also explained a few concepts, which I had come across before but not fully understood, and made it clear. This book as the tagline explains takes the reader through the tenth dimension. His flow is consistent and he achieves this by reducing his data into four parts. I: Entering the fifth dimension where he takes the reader on a journey from special relativity to general relativity; II: Unification in ten dimensions where he takes the reader on a journey from general relativity to string theory; III: Wormholes where he deals with black holes and time machines and how time travel is not merely possible but probable and it's different types; IV: Masters of Hyperspace where he deals with the question of our future civilization and how the fate of the universe would be inescapable for even them unless the density of the universe was more than 10 raised to -29 gram per cubic centimeter then perhaps our species may have a chance to use the six dimensions towards the end to escape.He discusses the Kardashev scale (to categorise civilizations) and the difficulties our species may have to face reaching Type-I considering that we have discovered the power of element 92 (U), with the help of Einstein's famous e=mc2 equation, without having reached the social development to ensure that we don't unleash it on ourselves (aka self destruct). I actually enjoyed reading this book despite the fact that it was written ages ago even before Edward Witten proclaimed that the string theory was actually M-theory. This was one of my first books by Michio Kaku and I thoroughly enjoyed it except for when he pontificated (throughout) at how this theory found in the 20th century was made for the 21st, considering how we still are not better off.All in all its a popular science read, simple for a lay reader who is interested in understanding a few bits of the only compatible theory of everything. A good readüëç"
52,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4547369-p-dreadful,5,"An Odyssey, indeed. And an entertaining one at that. The book is divided into four parts. The first part discusses the need for a fourth spatial dimension. The second and the third deal with ten-dimensional universes and wormholes (and wormholes within black holes), while the last part is about the death of our universe. The underlying theme of the book is that all the laws of physics can co-exist only in a higher dimension. I had come across terms such as transversible black holes, Casimir effect, quarks, leptons, false vacuum, etc. but I had no idea how they all fitted together. This book explains that and more. The author, one of the founders of the superstring theory, does a brilliant job in explaining complex concepts in a simple, easily digestible format. He explains why there was a need for a higher dimension and goes on to discuss the greatest scientific achievements since Newton that led to the development of a unified field theory. I found the diagrams particularly helpful, especially the ones depicting Flatlanders (living in two-dimensional worlds). Some of the amazing things I learnt from this book are given below: 1. The number of dimensions can only be ten or twenty-six, but it's probably ten(?). Why ten?Because of the factor (N-10) that appears in some equations. 2. Our original ten-dimensional universe was unstable hence it broke up into two four-dimensional (ours) and six-dimensional universes. The latter is tiny (Planck's scale) and folded up. It might be in the shape of a six-dimensional torus (or a doughnut). Have fun trying to visualise that. But this sister universe is not entirely useless. When our universe starts to undergo the Big Crunch (that is, contract at an alarming rate), we can escape into this six-dimensional universe which will expand. 3. Nature prefers symmetry.4. Black holes may be gateways to alternate, mirror universes.5. The concept of world lines. 6. Our sun may have a sister called Nemesis. We may be a part of a binary star system.Absolutely unputdownable.

53,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5065158-denise,5,"This was an interesting and challenging read for me. I do not have a background in physics or mathematics, but Kaku made String Theory accessible to folks like us. The broader picture and the impact the notion of Hyperspace has on our perceived world is effectively conveyed in his pleasant writing style. I have to admit that the chapters on the specifics of the different theories were the challenging part for me. The math went completely over my head. Luckily understanding grad school level equations was not necessary. I found the need to consult secondary sources to better understand the specific theories, some of which may or may not have been written for grade school students. This is no reflection on Kaku's abilities. Given that he admits that some physicists don't completely understand Quantum and String Theory, this is obviously difficult material to explain to laypersons. As a non-scientist, I mostly enjoyed the philosophical and theological discussions of how the String Theory and Hyperspace change and affect our perception of the universe and our place in it. I especially enjoyed the account of how the various theories and discoveries have influenced the arts, particularly literature. Thanks to this book, I now have a long list of science fiction books and short stories to hunt down.The final section includes a detailed prediction of how civilization will advance, both technologically and scientifically as well as socially, and the various obstacles humanity must overcome in order to master Hyperspace in the distant future. Kaku also discusses the possibility of humanity's ultimate fate. This is not so much the predictions of a fortune teller, but rather educated speculation based on current knowledge. He could be wrong, but he doesn't think so. I found this fascinating, and tried to Imagine what it would be like to be a part of a Type III civilization.Lastly, Kaku mentions Star Trek quite often throughout the text, which alone makes this book really cool. All in all, it's an engaging read, and I feel a tiny bit smarter now."
54,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29920947-andrew,2,"Rife with overly simplistic analogies which serve to muddy rather than illuminate the underlying physical and mathematical principles, this feels like a book written for people that the author believes not only aren‚Äôt educated about said principles (or about the mathematics necessary to truly represent them) but who are also incapable of ever truly understanding them. The former should obviously be held to be true, but the latter makes this book often read like it was written for fools.Kaku also makes many leaps to suppose causation that are laden with fallacy. Every third page seems to present a ‚Äútherefore‚Äù clause that either doesn‚Äôt hold up to simple formal logical scrutiny or which is missing the key causal link that would clarify for the reader. He uses the word multiplet without providing a definition but then dedicates multiple pages of visual diagrams to simply show us matrices of expanding dimensionality, saying ‚Äúthe forces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle‚Äù which belies the basic relation between matrices and dimensions/transformation - something which Kaku never assumes we know nor simply clarifies at any particular point.This felt like reading a bad freshman year Physics For Poets lecture that never ends. It‚Äôs overly dumbed-down science and as a result, unintentionally I‚Äôm sure, much of it constructs a false picture for the reader in the desperate hope of constructing the simplest picture possible."

The author makes complex principles and challenges in physics accessible to the lay reader and argues forcefully that the hyperspace-superstring-10 dimension theory simplifies and synthesizes all known physical observations and the requirements of the conflicting quantum principles of the micro world and the time-space principles of the macro world. Unfortunately, Kaku points out that the energy levels that would be required to provide demonstrable evidence that this theoretical framework are unlikely to be available to humankind in the current millenium, and the limitations of mathematics in its present form doesn't allow a pure math-based ""proof"" of the theory. I found the final chapters outlining the obstacles to continued growth and progression of a late stage 0 civilization like ours and the philosophical and religious implications of the hyperspace theory to be the most intriguing parts of the book. The book is worth a read if you are curious about where the astounding progress in physics might be leading. You will understand much more about the core challenges facing physicists and mathmeticians today and what might lie ahead. "

As a literature, it's ok to read but even as a pop science writer, I found him dabble in areas that aren't his expertise.As a writer, he may be great (Though I read only a few books of him ), but I don't appreciate his method of popularizing science; as it may implant a very wrong perspective in the minds of the viewers.Maybe, guys like Dr. Kaku, Bill Nye, Tyson are the bridges between academic and the public.Because the fact is general public don't read the technical literature usually. Besides, popularization is more about stretching imagination and explaining why science did in expensive labs is relevant than about training anyone to do physics. In that light, I think Dr. Kaku was working. But, the effectiveness of his approach to popularizing science could be debated and I prefer Lawrence Krauss more for the same approach."

Unfortunately Kaku's no Feinmann, and the narrative jumps from place to place sometimes taking the reader for a conjectural fool, something the previous generation of popularizer physicists wouldn't do, as to present science-fiction for science.I never finished this one, and I'd really love someone not ""famous"" (i.e. not like Kaku or Neil DeGrasse Tyson) to write a full multitome update of the Feinmann's physics, something that Hawking never did, considering his state it was no surprise, but especially now it is too late; because it has been almost 60 years since Feinmann, physics has expanded and instead of a general, even if ever so huge collection of understandable physics, what we have now is self-promoting science celebrities each working in their own corner, and each having a very cursory understanding of others' work.Skip this book."

I would read a chapter, then spend several days researching the topics presented. I LOVE working through a book like this. Kaku makes you think critically, but it's not so aloof as to be inaccessible.I had this on the self for a few years before finally cracking it open. It's not for the faint of heart. You may run into something you don't like or can't make sense of. You have to be in the right head space, willing to challenge your opinions and explore theoretical (and seemingly whimsical) statements without a clear destination in mind. You may feel existential dread or overwhelming hope; sometimes both at the same time.One of the greatest tragedies and advantages of the human condition is to conceptualize futures that you'll never be a part of. Kaku's a great lecturer and author. Highly recommend reading this and others by him. (Also, read Our Mathematical Universe, Max Tegmark and The Elegant Universe, Brian Greene)"
60,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55651694-mars-smith,4,"This book, as the name might imply, discusses different dimensions such as the 10th and the 26th dimension. Michio Kaku refers to another book called ""Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions"" in order to coherently explain why higher dimensions can simplify the laws of physics rather than complicating them. Pro: This book is great for people who want to learn more about higher dimensions and how it might affect future civilizations as we go from what we currently are a Type 0 civilization to what we potentially could be which would be a Type III civilization.Con: Unfortunately, a lot of what he talks about cannot be proven in the lab. We simply do not have the technology or know how to show experimental evidence for higher dimensions. The author knows this but is still rather fascinated by the idea that there might be."
61,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22068229-ben,3,"I have many of Kaku's books, but this was the first I've actually read so far. I've been a fan of his for many years and had ""hyper"" expectations for it. Overall, Hyperspace was worth reading. The first and last 100 pages were excellent, but the middle 100 were overwhelmingly dense theoretical physics, and pretty repetitive. Having taken college physics, theoretical math/computer, and many other science classes at his own alma mater of UC Berkeley, it was still a bit hard at times to grasp. But for what Kaku does, explaining the most extreme theories known to man, he does it in an entertaining and humble manner. I loved how he emphasized the roles of philosophy and religion, and even drew upon biology to ground theoretical physics in a meaningful way for all of humanity. I'm looking forward to reading Parallel Worlds next, and his Physics of the... books. "
62,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47627566-niel,4,"Appearing in another dimension, Michio Kaku explains and enlightens on the quest for unification of the various forces of nature. He reveals from the eyes of Huxley that the universe is ""not only queerer than we suppose but queerer than we can suppose."" He lets the matter he talks about bring about wonder in itself with little or no occupation on the overwhelming grandiosity of what he refers (which I believe would have been reconciled in more stronger hands) Following from this, he enlightens those who can accompany him on the journey to the understanding of the universe, and where we might reappear if our technology increases exponentially and our political disputes are conquered by the need for self preservation on a cosmic timeline, while showing confidence that hyperspace is where we might come to this experience."

The author has discussed the various aspects of the ""Tenth Dimension"" in a very simple fashion and has chronologically outlined its development through the decades. He has again analysed the vast sea of knowledge that might become accessible to us once we rise beyond our conventional three-dimensional world (and time). At the same time, he hasn't shied away from the mere technological disability of the present century to experimentally verify the theoretical implications of the String theory. The best part is, however, the Conclusion where he succinctly describes the relation of this outlandish scientific theory on philosophy and religion. I particularly enjoyed his view of God as the God of order and God of Miracle. It was fun reading this book, Dr. Kaku!"
64,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19033159-nisha-sadasivan,5,"Absolutely loved the book. Kaku is by far the best astrophysics writer I have encountered thus far. The book takes the reader on a ride through the history of dimensions in Mathematics and Physics, the various theories that were postulated, the ones that succeeded, the ones that failed to see the light of the day, and some that were even resurrected - often interspersed with many an interesting sci-fi story. The author's depiction of Thorne's calculation for Time Travel is sheer brilliance.Did you know that you can travel back in time, if you could only learn to travel faster than light? But, the problem is, once you enter the Einstein-Rosen bridge popularly known as a wormhole, you're doomed, because the entrance will then close up.Well then, hope to meet you in the 10th dimension, a few millennia from today. Bye for now :) "
65,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19100966-micah-mccoin,4,"This book is designed as a ground-up layperson's guide to the scientific journey to a unified theory of all natural forces. The solution: ten-dimensional hyperspace. The writing is crisp and full of visualizations to help the reader get a grasp on the concepts. In many places, the concepts progress from zero to 100 quickly, and I found myself totally following the narrative one moment and then falling off a cliff of incomprehension the next moment. I think the author, who is himself a physicist involved in the academic discourse around the hyperspace theory, needed a co-writer to further ground the more abstract concepts.A fascinating read. My main gripe is that the end of the book sort of circles the airport and continues to introduce new concepts and conversations instead of closing strong with a recap and resolution of the hyperspace theory itself."
66,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41024537-daksh-jindal,3,This book captures one of the most important scientific debates of the human life. The question that every human asks themselves about their origins. The author takes you on an amazing journey starting from early mathematics by Riemman to modern theory of physics by Stephen Hawkings.The analogies int he book are brilliant and makes you really think outside the box on how the universe we live in could so multi dimensional due to the simple laws of physics. It‚Äôs fascinating to see how our minds without even leaving our planet has come up with all the realistic testable theories about unifying the 4 major forces of nature.The book does a little complicated and repetitive in the middle which breaks the flow but the end wraps up the book nicely.It is a good read for someone looking to get a glimpse into the past and the future of physics and humanity as a whole.
67,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59451697-jerry,4,"Author Michio Kaku once stated, ‚ÄúSome people seek meaning in life through personal gain, through personal relationship, or through personal experiences. However, it seems to me that being blessed with the intellect to divine the ultimate secrets of nature gives meaning enough to life.‚Äù In other words, physicists study physics because it gives their lives a purpose. By understanding the secrets of nature in Michio Kaku's book, people can gain meaning in life. The book Hyperspace by Michio Kaku records and explains all the latest developments of theoretical physics. The book contains many interesting ideas, such as higher dimensions, dark energy, and the quest for a grand unified theory of the universe. Hyperspace is organized like a story, with each section highlighting an advancement in physics and detailing an explanation. Each part connects to the previous and the following section in some way. Every part is understandable because Michio Kaku explains the advanced concepts he introduces in simple terms that everybody can understand. Discovering more about the intricacies of quantum physics was fascinating, specifically the focus on black holes and time travel.	I would rate this book four stars because I enjoyed the ideas presented but not the fine print. Being a fan of science, I liked learning about black holes. Kaku describes black holes and parallel universes, stating, ‚ÄúIf a space probe were shot into the top or bottom [of a spinning black hole]...the gravitational force would not be infinite,‚Äù meaning that the black hole would allow access to other universes. This understanding of black holes means that entering a black hole and avoiding being crushed is possible. I had always assumed that if one was to enter a black hole, one would become quantum soup. I was excited to realize that traveling to another dimension was possible. Michio Kaku also discusses how to build a time machine, explaining that it is possible although scientists dismiss it: ‚ÄúProponents of time travel point out that Einstein‚Äôs equations for general relativity do allow some forms of time travel. They acknowledge, however, that the energies necessary to twist time into a circle are so great that Einstein‚Äôs equations break down.‚Äù I loved learning that time travel was not just science fiction but possible. Usually people think of Einstein as the greatest physicist but even his equations stop working eventually. This fact taught me that science is evolving beyond Einstein and into new territories. While I enjoyed discovering more about physics, the print was so small that sometimes I lost my spot. If the print were larger, I would enjoy the book more. 	Ultimately, people who enjoy physics will enjoy this book. Although the material might seem advanced, Kaku explains everything in terms that any reader would understand. He reveals that the ideas in science fiction books might become a reality someday."
68,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25582110-kate-savage,3,"Yeah pop physics books! This was one of the first books written on superstring theory for a lay audience. Though it was written in the 90s, if you add one more dimension to make it eleven, the fundamentals still hold (as far as I can tell, but my brain's only three dimensions after all).Two quibbles:1) The author could have cut out some sections, which seemed redundant and served more to increase book length than to explain.2) Physicists, who are careful to allow incredible complexity and nuance in the physical world, write about the human social world like it's obvious, simple, and heading toward some clear goal. When Kaku writes about our likely future, I find his ideas both naive and unimaginative."

Kaku has a very engaging style of writing wherein he gives the readers a good view into the history / background of each of these top physicists and mathematicians, who ended up shaping higher dimensional math and physics. I particularly like the parallels that he draws between the life and times of great minds like Riemann and Ramanujan. I guess the language of math and physics is universal!

The author ranges widely through the various disciplines, developments, theories, crackpot notions, and wild guesses that have brought scientific thinking to its present, ever-roiing state, and even dares to suggest how the insights of philosophy and religion contribute to thinking about the connectedness of everything and dealing with paradox.I approached this book cautiously, expecting at any moment to be plunged into pages of incomprehensible string theory and arcane mathematical jargon, but it never happened, and I was actually reluctant to come to the end."
71,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53294527-roberto-paredes,4,"The word ""Hyperspace"" had a totally different meaning (or lack of thereof) to me before reading this book.I didn't know exactly what to expect, as I just knew this was a very popular (popular) science book and I liked physics. Michio Kaku does a great job explaining in layman terms what are Hyperspace and String Theory, along with some related physical topics and their historic context; and why is it currently the most popular candidate for a theory of everything.Curious fact: one year after this edition was published, Ed Witten proposed M-Theory, which I believe is the most recent and advanced version of a superstring theory to date; and it has 11 dimensions, instead of the 10-dimensional theories discussed in the book."
72,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224710-j-e,4,"At times fascinating, at others overly technical name soup. I love Michio Kaku's light-hearted style on his radio show and documentaries so I was expecting the same here, but it got pretty heavy at times. I suppose that kinda comes with the territory when you're discussing... you know, the ultimate theory of everything that exists. (Especially when that theory is one that can't be seen, tested, or really even explained using ordinary language.) That being said, at times I think this was trying to be too many things to too many audiences. Is it pop science? Is it intellectual history? Is it a textbook? Maybe all of the above."
73,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28103847-dan-walters,3,"+ Good structure. Subsections are relatively small giving you time to process thoughts before delving further.+ Time taken to clearly explain experimental concepts that have lead to the proposal of Hyperspace theory.- Kaku uses a very anecdotal and story-like style to explain physical concepts; often with multiple scenarios for the same concept - feels overdone.- Quite early on you get the sense that no firm conclusion can yet be made - and that humanity is unlikely to posses the energy levels to test the theoretical idea of hyperspace for many years to come. Discussion is interesting, but far too excessive.  "
74,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19124904-charles-sheard,2,"Ultimately, I feel that Kaku tries to explain and support his untestable, unlikely theories with analogies and explanations that are themselves unrealistic. I also feel that he fudges things too often, or accepts things on faith, simply because they would (if accurate) make his theories more solid. Finally, I found far too much of the book to be quotes from others, or retellings of SciFi literature or television ideas, whose purpose never went beyond ""gee, isn't that a neat idea"", without ever being incorporated into his arguments. Hopefully his later books improved, but I don't know if I'll bother giving them a try."

Another 6 dimensional universe went somewhere, but it is/was so small we can't measure it. Read the book for full details! I didn't expect to enjoy this so much, but the author made the concepts easy to understand. Also, I didn't realise that physicists are okay with the concept of extraterrestrial beings. Unfortunately it's highly unlikely however, that humans and E.Ts would exist in the same time period. They could have been, or they will be, perhaps long after our extinction."

93,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198798-linda,5,"Super interesting book that I almost understood! Only the math gets in the way, although Michio Kaku has a great way of explaining complicated ideas so that even a non-scientific person can catch a glimpse of the universe!"
94,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66751237-armand,4,"Entirely dedicated to one of my favourite topics, but not always an enjoyable read. It seemed to me that Kaku repeated or restated some facts ad nauseam, but barely explained others. It was almost as though there was no clear audience in mind, with regards to physics literacy. "
95,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3442177-amanda,3,"Very interesting, but extremely long-winded at times. The author easily gives three to four examples of everything he discusses, even at places where one, two or even none would be enough. Nevertheless, if you aren't too bothered by that, this is a very fun read."
96,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13294490-arvind-jeena,5,"Reading this book felt like an sci-fi adventure, only this one is real. The science in the book, though a bit complicated for average person, is highly facinating. Lot of things to learn and to wonder about. A must read."
97,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093437-joseph-siry,4,"Impressively clear and thorough description of the dimensions of the universe as revealed in astrophysical theory, experimental evidence, and carful observations of the subatomic and post-relativity world."

So, try it out if you are a true fan of physics, mathematics, and science in general."
99,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85657914-eric-nguyen,5,"I'm more of a biology person, but this still fascinates me to this day.

""A koi fish swimming in a shallow pond has no idea how big reality maybe until he is briefly picked up out of the pond"". Are we in the same state as a koi fish? Book gets tougher to follow as it progresses. "

103,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105140962-john-rojewski,4,Not his first book! Kaku has a deep background in physics and an inspirational way of visualizing those things which are often difficult to explain.

139,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5905953-mike-smith,3,"If this were the mid-1990s, I'd give this book four or maybe five stars. But it's 2020, and this 1994 book on certain aspects of string theory are now dated (so far as I can tell).In 1915, Albert Einstein theorized that gravity is not a ""force"" pulling objects together across interstellar distances, but a bending of the fabric of space through a fourth dimension. The standard analogy, which author Kaku uses as well, is to imagine an infinite two-dimensional sheet in space, with large balls representing planets or stars placed on it. These masses would sink into the sheet somewhat, bending the surface of the fabric around them through the third dimension. A small object rolling over the sheet would move in a straight line until it passes near one of these depressions. Then, its path would have to curve to follow the distortion in the sheet's surface. So, Einstein said, that's why objects follow curved paths around massive planets and stars: they have no choice but to follow the curve of space, which is warped by the large masses.As Kaku explains, Einstein's theory replaced the need for a mysterious gravitational ""force"" with a simple geometric explanation for gravity. Likewise, string theory, a branch of physics first developed in the 1960s and which gained prominence in the 1980s, can unify the four fundamental ""forces"" of nature (gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the strong and weak nuclear forces), if we assume that space contains 10 dimensions. Then it's just geometry, not magical ""action-at-a-distance"", that makes matter and energy behave the way they do. Kaku was one of the physicists who helped develop the ten-dimensional version of string theory (there are many versions of string theory).Kaku begins by going through the history of physics and its attempts to explain how matter and energy behave. This takes us up to Einstein and general relativity. The second section of the book deals with the rise of quantum theory, which is an entirely different way of thinking about physics, but which was found to be incompatible with general relativity. Until, that is, theorists, including Kaku, proposed a multi-dimensional way to unify these theories, much the way Einstein proposed additional dimensions to explain gravity. He makes the interesting observation that the concepts behind string theory were discovered almost accidentally, and that we don't (or didn't in 1994) have the mathematical techniques to properly compute and solve string theory equations. Kaku also points out that we could not, in 1994, conduct experiments to prove or disprove string theory because the amount of energy needed to conduct those experiments was centuries beyond our current technology.In the third section of the book, Kaku explores potential applications of string theory if it can be proved to be true, such as travelling great distances through space (and maybe between universes) in very short times, using ""hyperspace"" (as in Star Wars or Star Trek) and maybe even travelling in time. In his final section, Kaku speculates on what the distant future of mankind and the universe itself might be if we can avoid destroying ourselves and can use wisely the enormous energies unleashed by string theory.As a history of physics and string theory up until 1994, this is an excellent book. It is similar to Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time (1988) in that regard, and also brought to my mind Carl Sagan's Cosmos (1980). Kaku references both of these works. Today, in 2020, however, it main value is historical. There have been significant developments in physics since then, including the discovery of dark energy in 1998 and the discovery of the Higgs particle in 2012. I am certainly no expert (I studied undergraduate physics in the mid-1980s). I gather that progress in string theory has been challenging, for a variety of reasons. See, for example, Lee Smolin's 2006 book The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next, which comments on both the mathematical complexity, bordering on futility, of string theory, and the way scientific research is funded and approved.Kaku is good at explaining these very difficult topics, although I find his style is a bit drier than Hawking's or Sagan's. You would probably need to have some familiarity with relativity, quantum theory, and cosmology to get much from this book. You should also always keep in mind that the science has moved on since this was written."
140,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77387048-rudro,5,"I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I've always had a thing for non fictions and having recently read 'selfish gene' (which is not at all related to physics. I know) I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect and it was one hell of a ride. Michio Kaku has a very easy to read way of explaining the complicated things with interesting examples. I've always had trouble grasping the idea of curved space. After finishing this book, not only do I have a better understanding of that, I'll go as far as to say that I have a much better understanding of the other dimensions as well. Highly recommended for anyone who is remotely interested in science."
141,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2123305-jacinta,3,"Pretty tough reading! I'm not sure I absorbed too much of it, but I enjoyed it while reading it and could probably get an extra sentence into a dinner table physics conversation before I was lost. "
142,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1741591-m,5,"This book does a good job of explaining the search to unify the the laws of our universe, and how superstring theory suggests that there exist ten dimensions. Because it covers more history than math, I found the concepts digestible."
143,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12134322-ric,5,"Most the time, I think about which purpose should I give my life so that I can give the biggest and the best impact that I can provide to all of humanity, not just for today but up to the future when I am gone.Thus, it was not far-fetched that while reading the book, I was having the urge to pick up my old college book of physics and study it again. There was this little arrogant me inside my head claiming that maybe, if I start again now, I can still contribute to the development of physics and maybe I am actually the one they are waiting for to solve this great mystery. Of course, the pragmatic me caught up and was able to conclude that this is just a fleeting urge and that I am not really that enthusiastic about math.Then, I came upon this section which indirectly showed me what my purpose in life can be: Part IV (Masters of Hyperspace), Chapter 13 (Beyond The Future).This chapter gave us an introduction the Kardashev scale which is a method of measuring a civilization's technological advancement based on the amount of energy that that civilization can harness and utilize. Below is a quick summary:

   Type 1 - All possible energy sources from its home planet. 
   Type 2 - Can directly mine its parent start. 
   Type 3 - Can directly the nearby stars within its galaxy.
Our current civilization is still very much dependent on fossil fuels and we cannot even efficiently convert the powers of the sun, wind, etc. We are still classified as Type 0 and we would need to overcome barriers or challenges before we can achieve being Type 1.One of the main themes of these developmental barriers is our social maturity, or the lack thereof. Prior to World War II, the social maturity of our civilization is almost always at par with our technological advancement in terms of energy we can control. However, with the discovery of atomic energy, we were able to harness energy that is much more advance than our social maturity. If our social maturity will not be able to catch up with our technology, we might annihilate ourselves before we can even come close to being Type 1.But why then should we aspire to becoming Type 2 and then Type 3 civilizations? On the scale of hundred thousands to millions of years, it is already sure that Earth will be struck by at least one destructive cosmological force that can cause massive extinction, if not planetary destruction, i.e. asteroid impacts, gamma rays that can wipe out our protective atmosphere, the ballooning of our sun into a red giant, etc. The only way we can survive this is to achieve interstellar travel and colonize planets outside our solar system. Type 2 and Type 3 civilizations will have that capability.This is where people like will come in. As mentioned above, our social maturity is lagging behind our technological advancements. We can help to exponentially raise the speed of our scientific and technological development and remove the risk of self-annihilation by helping our society reach the level of maturity that is at par with our current scientific and technological capability.***************************************************************(Reviewer's note: The text below is supposed to be the introductory part of this review. However, I felt the need to give importance to the part of the review written above so I decided to start with that instead.)In this book, Michio Kaku tried his best to present to us, non-physicists, the concepts of hyperspace and its possible impact to mankind. These included an overview of the hyperspace theory, its significance, history, possible implications, possible uses, and the future of humanity when or if we will become masters of hyperspace.As one reviewer already pointed out, there is a large part of the book that discussed concepts containing mathematics and theoretical physics. which are quite difficult to understand no matter how Kaku tried to simplify it. Fortunately, this part is sandwiched between relatively easy-to-understand chapters."
144,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163911-ian-welke,4,"This is a strange review for me, but I‚Äôm on unfamiliar ground as this book is one of the first I‚Äôm reading in a concerted effort to read more non fiction. After doing a search for best books about astronomy, this was one of the few I hadn‚Äôt already read that seemed to be on most lists. My reaction to this book is mixed, but I‚Äôm rounding up because the things I liked about it, I really liked, and while there are things I disliked about the book, it‚Äôs more important to me to get more recommendations with the aspects that I like about it, than it is to avoid the things I didn‚Äôt like about it. And I liked a lot about this book. First off, I‚Äôm very much not a scientist. I‚Äôm a writer with a History degree, who would like to learn more about science, particularly astronomy and physics, but I wouldn‚Äôt claim to have much aptitude or background in either. I think that Kaku does an excellent job in explaining his concepts for the layman. I‚Äôm in no position to measure the merit of those concepts, but he did make me think (always a plus), and his ability to use allegory to make theory more approachable is effective. I learned a lot from this book. Maybe not as much in his concepts, but when he described much of the history of this line of research, he discussed a lot of the people involved, and with a few quick Google searches‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more on Kaluza Klein for example. As a gateway for more reading, this book succeeds. I also like the speculation at the end of the book on man‚Äôs potential. My reasoning for reading more about science started because I would like to write more positive science fiction, and I think I lack the science to arrive at positive solutions. I‚Äôve written two published books. One is dystopian scifi, the other is apocalyptic weird fiction. I‚Äôd like to write something more positive. Not just something that warns the reader, but something that inspires the reader to go out and be the scientist or engineer heroine in the story. So I was really happy with Kaku‚Äôs speculation at the end of the book about various potentials for humanity: mastering the solar system, harvesting stars, mastering the energy of entire galaxies. I can‚Äôt measure the likelihood of this ever coming to be, but I like to think it could. What bothered me about the book was some of the philosophy. He dwelled on the concept of god. God seems like a fairly loaded concept especially for a book that is on the ‚Äúbest books about astronomy‚Äù list. I get that part of this is because when going into the lives and research of so many scientists through history he is interested in their speculation about the nature of the universe which included speculation about god, but it struck me as inconsistent with the rest of the text. I could go on, which is sort of the problem, such a loaded concept is hard to discuss in a paragraph or even in side tangents in a book. Overall I‚Äôm happy that I read it. I may read more by him, although I‚Äôm really interested in finding more concrete and less theoretical books next. "
145,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,4,"An Introduction to HyperspaceThis is an odyssey into the history of development of the concept of hyperspace that includes fourth and higher spatial dimensions to account for the riddles and unsolved problems of unified field theory. Since the postulation of special theory of relativity, Einstein and subsequent physicists until now have struggled to explain the four natural forces; the electromagnetic force (explained by Maxwell's field equations for electricity & magnetism); the strong and weak nuclear forces (explained by Yang - Mills field equations for subatomic forces); and the gravitational force (explained by Einstein's field equations of gravitation and relativity) by one unified field theory (theory of everything: String Theory). In other words, unifying the forces of the big, the cosmos, and the laws of the small, the microcosm (subatomic forces) by one single theory. The first part of the book describes how laws of nature become so simple to understand if higher dimensions are invoked; the author gives us a good historical background to build his case for hyperspace concept. The second part of the book describes the evolution of quantum mechanics and String theory. An introduction to wormholes, black holes and the use of these cosmic bodies for interstellar travel is given in the third part. The fourth part rambles through the future of the universe with irrelevant and some times out of focus narrative. The book is entirely free of physics and mathematics; from the point of understanding the basic concepts this approach is welcome. This book also gives an insight into the poignant story of Riemann (p.42) and Ramanujan (p.174) who sustained enormous personal and family hardships to contribute significantly in the field of mathematics. We also get a glimpse of academic rat race that involves professional rivalry, name & work recognition, and personal ego that is prevalent in academics. This is illustrated when Einstein delays Kaluza's paper for publication for 2 years (p.102). Bohr calling Pauli's lecture crazy (p.137); Sheldon Glashow ridiculing t'Hooft's work (p.121); a superior discouraging Mahahiko Suzuki's publication about Euler's Beta function (p.161); and Pauli being furious about Eisenberg's claim, Einstein - Bohr argument, and Schrodinger frustrated with Bohr's interpretation (p.261). The author rambles about symmetry in arts; what is that got to do with hyperspace? The reader can find this discussion in any art book. Time travel has been described in layman's language in many books in depth; this discussion is unnecessary for this book. Throughout the book, the author refers to standard model and the equations of quantum mechanics as ugly; Equations are not ugly, they are complex or non-symmetrical. The author could have devoted one chapter to describing the field equations in layman's terms; it would have helped a more enthusiastic reader to build a bridge to physics and tensor calculus. The reader should not be discouraged about mathematics in understanding relativity; many physicists themselves are heading to the library to learn about mathematics in String theory (Part 2). More appropriate title of the book could be hyperspace - a historical development of String theory. Despite the minor concerns, this book has strong points as observed above. I encourage the reader to buy this book; if you are not happy with this book, it is less than two-lunch money (page numbers from 1994 edition). "
146,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15651131-last-ranger,5,"Down the Rabbit Hole:Like all branches of science, theoretical physics is in a constant state of flux. New observations lead to new avenues of research and that, in turn, can lead to new theories and radicle new ways of looking at the universe around us. In 1994 Michio Kaku published ""Hyperspace"" as a way of taking the interested layman on a journey to the edge of the known universe; from Flatland to the 10th dimension and beyond. Like most books of this nature ""Hyperspace"" is part cutting edge science and part science-history giving the reader an in-depth picture of the people and theories that make this branch of physics endlessly interesting. Ideas like Quantum Mechanics, String Theory and the Multiverse are born from the realm of advanced mathematics, but you don't have to be a math wiz to get something out of this book. Although Kaku doesn't bog the reader down with a lot of heavy-math he does provide a few equations in the end of book ""Notes"" for those who are so inclined. Some of the best science books are those written by actual working scientists, those who realize the importance of communicating their findings to the general public. People like Carl Sagan, Brian Greene and, of course, Michio Kaku are quite adapt at explaining these, often, complex ideas to the layman reader. That's not to say this is an easy read, far from it, but anyone who got through their High School Science Courses, or is an experienced Science Reader, should be able to handle the bazaar, far reaching concepts that Kaku discuses in his book. Ideas like multiple universes and alternate dimensions did not just spring out of nowhere though. In one form or another they've been around for a very long time and, since the beginning, they were always controversial. Starting out with our quest for the 5th Dimension, Kaku gives you an overview of how we moved beyond the standard 4D and toward the hypothetical 10th Dimension. Along the way he introduces us to people like George Bernhard Riemann, Euclid and the famous mathematician Lewis Carroll, among others. The disagreement between Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein over Quantum Theory shows that great minds don't always think alike. In 1884 Edwin Abbot wrote his famous novel ""Flatland"" as a Romance of Many Dimensions that explored a 2D world that clashes with a 3D world. Our Religious beliefs are also touched on with human views on God and the Creation and how some see Science as just another form of Religion. The book ends with a section of Kaku's extreme speculation on where science is going and when we might expect to get there. This book is an excellent introduction the realm of speculative science and extreme theories. Michio Kaku's ""Hyperspace"" was written over a decade ago but, to this very day, modern science journals continue to publish articles on this subject.* Theoretical Physics has come a long way since 1994, new research and observations have led to new conclusions and changing viewpoints. Current theories on hyperspace, multi dimension and alternate universes show that creative, speculative, thinking is still alive and well in the 21st Century. *See: Scientific American, March 2016 for ""The Puzzle of Dark Energy"" by Adam G.

Published in 1994 with a plethora of other volumes from a rather august company of physicists such as Kip Thorne and Murray Gell-Mann on the burgeoning science of Heterotic String Theory, Dr. Kaku‚Äôs book adds an interesting twist by exploring the multidimensionality of the new thinking. Its material is now a bit dated in its approach to the pursuit of the Grand Unified Theory, but still valid as it proves itself a wonderful primer for the layman wishing to become better acquainted with where the brief but famous notation E=mc2 (unity of matter and energy)and Einstein's theory has taken us and where we may go after Einstein as we move towards quantum theory and finally unifying gravity with the other forces.At the time this book was published funding for the Superconducting Super Collider, a massive particle accelerator to be built in Waxahachie Texas, had been killed by Congress and there was not a flicker of hope for particle physicists with respect to an experimental platform upon which to test their theories. Ah well, Waxahachie‚Äôs loss is Geneva‚Äôs gain. Since that time The Large Hadron Collider has been built at CERN and hope is again rekindled that the standard model will be proven out and progress can be made towards establishing a Unified Theory. The steps toward unification is like a great puzzle for which physicists still don‚Äôt have all the pieces. This can be confusing to the scientist let alone the layman. The author demonstrates that a world of three dimensions is simply not big enough to accommodate the ideas currently being investigated. Dr. Kaku deftly takes the reader by the hand and leads them confidently into not just one dimension, but two or three, perhaps as many as ten demonstrating how, as we reach into higher dimensions, we can more easily fit the pieces of the puzzle together. With his clear style and descriptive prose he lifts the reader up to a precipice above the confusion where we can see all the known components clearly and observe the panoply of interaction between forces and particles and the parts each play in the deepest secrets of creation.Hyperspace was an excellent read and well worth the time invested to gain a better understanding of the forces that shaped us all. We find that the universe is far more elegant than we imagined and far simpler than we dreamed. We find we are fashioned from the dust of stars. We learn that all the atoms of our universe, our little planet, and all that‚Äôs on it were forged in the heart of a nuclear furnace of a star and that we shall not, in the words of the Bard, ‚Äúlike some insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a rack behind.‚Äù Apparently we are indeed such stuff as dreams are made on and though our little life may be rounded with a sleep, our atoms will go on and on for billions of years until somewhere in the distant future the last star winks out and it all goes dark and cold and what started with a bang ,our universe, quietly ends."
148,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104907096-another-roboto,1,One of the first books i have read. The subject matter was over my head and i wanted to feel like a smarty-pants. 
149,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,2,"A popular account of higher dimensions (more than three spatial dimensions) in relation to modern physics. Frankly, this is one of the worst popular science books I've read recently. The book is divided into three parts; the first part gives a historical background to the mathematical and physical theories of higher dimensions, the second part is an overview of string theory, and the third part is about wormholes, time travel, parallel universes, and various far future disasters and how super advanced civilizations will deal with them through mastery of hyperspace.The first and third parts are mostly what I call ""gosh-wow"", exaggerated and inaccurate or at least unqualified statements meant to create an impression. There were many references and analogies to non-scientific areas of culture, which is not necessarily a bad thing except that much of what the author says is just wrong. For example, he says correctly that H.G. Wells was a Fabian socialist, but in the next sentence he calls The Time Machine a ""Marxian analysis"". Fabianism and Marxism are two very different theories, and The Time Machine is a good example of the difference. He also begins telling a story and then leaves out the details that would make sense of it. Almost all his quotations from historical figures in the first section are also quoted in Martin Gardner's The Ambidextrous Universe, which makes me wonder if he has researched these people himself or just lifted the quotes from Gardner's book (which is not included in his bibliography.) There is a lot of half-baked discussion about God which will not satisfy either believers or nonbelievers, who know anything about the actual questions.The second part, on string theory, has less of the ""gosh-wow"" and is the principal reason I read the book; I could have forgiven the other parts if this had been a good introduction. However, his alternation between very simplistic popularization and unexplained higher mathematics (which seems intended simply to impress, since anyone who understands his equations without explanations would not be reading this kind of popular book to begin with) and his switching between incompatible metaphors makes it quite difficult to get any idea of what string theory actually is about -- he spends more time telling us how wonderful it is than what it is.The third section was so speculative that it seemed more like a primer for how to write science fiction than a serious discussion -- unlike, for example, Kip Thorne's Black Holes and Time Warps, which I just finished. (In fact, his sensationalist interpretation of Thorne is just the misunderstanding that Thorne complains about on the part of ""journalists with no understanding of science"".)His other books may be better, but I am not going to waste my time finding out; I've taken them off my TBR list."
150,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46484714-jj,4,"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension by Michio Kaku is a really good introduction to Quantum, String, Superstring, and Unified Field theory, which takes it readers on an incredible journey from the Big Bang to the very end of time. Kaku writes about theoretical physics in a manner that just fills you with awe and wonder, and makes you think about things that you would never ordinarily think about, such as the vastness and complexity of the universe of which we are but an infinitesimally small and, very probably, insignificant part. Kaku has the ability to explain some very complex mathematical concepts in a way that even the average Joe can easily understand, or at the very least makes you feel that you have understood just enough to be able to continue reading without feeling totally lost. Although, having said that, there are still a few places where Kaku does get overly technical, and others where he will discuss things without fully explaining them, perhaps assuming that everyone already knows such things, which, unless they are an actual rocket-scientist, they most probably don't. Nevertheless, Kaku has an imaginative and highly entertaining writing style, which I really enjoyed and appreciated, as many science-oriented books can often be so very dry and academic. Kaku obviously has a very good sense of humor, bringing a wry smile to my face on a number of occasions. The book is divided into four main parts; Part 1: Entering the Fifth Dimension, Part 2: Unification in Ten Dimensions, Part 3: Wormholes: Gateways to Another Universe, and Part 4: Masters of Hyperspace. Part 1 contains the following chapters: 1. Worlds Beyond Space and Time, 2. Mathematicians and Mystics, 3. The Man Who ""Saw"" the Fourth Dimension, and 4. The Secret of Light: Vibrations in the Fifth Dimension. Part 2 contains the following chapters: 5. Quantum Heresy, 6. Einstein's Revenge, 7. Superstrings, 8. Signals from the Tenth Dimension, and 9. Before Creation. Part 3 contains the following chapters: 10. Black Holes and Parallel Universes, 11. To Build a Time Machine, and 12. Colliding Universes. Part 4 contains the following chapters: 13. Beyond the Future, 14. The Fate of the Universe, and 15. Conclusion. Overall, this a fun and highly thought-provoking book. I enjoyed it immensely, even if I didn't fully understand all of it. I think that one of the ideas that I most liked is the way that the laws of nature become much easier to explain/understand when they are described in terms of multiple dimensions. I personally think that at its most fundamental level the universe is most probably based on generally simple constructs and rules rather than excessively complex ones, so perhaps our universe really is based, as Kaku asserts, on ten dimensions after all, especially if that allows it to be described in far simpler, more elegant, terms compared to a universe with only four. Perhaps. Highly recommended."
151,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2381167-michelle,4,"Michio Kaku's purpose in writing Hyperspace is to educate its readers about the origin of the 4th dimension and to explore the possibilities of higher dimensions. Kaku provides exceptional support and explains it phenomenally. To help his readers understand what a higher dimensional being would be like, he depicts it as an omnipotent god who can remove things from the 3rd dimension and move things around in ways impossible in three dimensions, like a three dimensional being can remove a two dimensional being from its land and change it in ways that would be impossible in two dimensions. Kaku's theme is similar to his purpose. He wants to help his audience understand the 4th dimension and accept the possibility of higher dimensions that have yet to be discovered and understood by humans. He gives many helpful examples and metaphors to help the reader understand the 4th dimension such as the one mentioned in the previous paragraph and also the explanation that ""Picasso's paintings show multiple perspectives, as though they were painted by someone from the 4th dimension, able to see all perspectives simultaneously""(Kaku 65). He supports the possibility of higher dimensions by alluding Robert Heinlein's book about a four-dimensional house. He summarizes that an architect builds a house in the shape of a tesseract (an unfolded four-dimensional cube) and it is folded into the 4th dimension during an earthquake and when the characters entered it, they could only escape by jumping out a window that takes them to a random place (because there are wormholes in the 4th dimension).As previously stated proof shows, Hyperspace was written as an exposition. Basically the entire book was the explanation of the 4th and higher dimensions and support of them. All of the aforementioned examples from the book support that statement because they prove that Kaku had made points about human's theories of what the 4th dimension would be like.I was extremely surprised at and impressed with how well Kaku was able to express and explain his points. He used easy-to-relate-to examples of what he wanted to prove, which made it easy for me to understand what he wanted to say. I found the book really interesting at most times and it was quite informative. I can honestly say it is the best written non-fiction book I have read and I would recommend Hyperspace to anyone who believes they will be able to grasp the concepts addressed."
152,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98493-laurel,4,"I finished a book! It is this one.At first I was not really a fan of this book, but it got better and better the whole way through, and was pretty much awesome by the end. At the beginning, I found the pop culture references to be excessive, and wanted it to get on down to the business of explaining the physics of ten-dimensional space. Then, it inserted a math picture accompanied by words that did not adequately explain the math picture to me. Stepping outside my own physics-educated perspective, I know there's nothing like math combined with inadequate words explanation to make a non-scientist reader who's been through the experiment in degradation which is mathematics education in the public school system assume they are not bright enough to understand what's being talked about and give up on reading the book, when in fact it's the explanation that's not bright enough.So I resigned myself to reading a history of scientific discovery book without learning any new science, but this turned out not to be the case. The were a number of analogies that seemed a little weird or forced to me, but if you went with them, they were functional nonetheless, and I came out of this reading experience with a better overall concept of higher dimensional space, string theory, particle physics, unification of forces, and all that stuff. I think it was done in a way that a popular reader can understand and appreciate too. Trying to visualize higher dimensions, even though you cannot do so, is always fun, and throughout I found this read was great food for thought. I don't really read and think about what I've read in a linear sense, so much as osmose a concept and then go off thinking thoughts about it, and then read some more, and I really enjoyed all the thoughts from this book.Pretty much every page, when we were winding down at the end with all this stuff of scientific perspectives, and possible futures and future technology, was a joy to read. I was skeptical and disagreeing about some of it, but it was still great food for thought. Apparently he just put out another book on possible technologies, called Physics of the Impossible, which sounds fascinating. I enjoy his can-do attitude towards these things."
153,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5603786-derek-chesnut,4,"Michio Kaku takes the reader on a crash course through the universe and beyond. What! Beyond! What could possibly be beyond our own known universe? Well ignorant coy fish/human beyond our universe lies infinite other universes with infinite different dimensions in each universe. And beyond universes? Hyperspace. an immeasurable realm that does not contain the feeble constraints of time and space found in our universe. How does one get to hyperspace? Worm holes of course, which hypothetically can also be used to pass through time, or create a passage connecting alternate universes. Whats this dimension jargon you speak of? Well we live in the fourth dimension (contrary to popular belief that we only exist in three) our dimensions are classified as breath, width, length, and time. Yet a dimension higher than ours cannot be visualized by humans! Just like if there were two dimensional people living on your table, our world would seem like a place of circles increasing and decreasing in size, a fourth dimensional being (we live in four dimensions, but a fourth spatial dimension is not something we can comprehend) would appear as a strange array of growing and shrinking spheres to us humans. the only way to accurately describe the fourth dimension to third dimensional beings is an infinite number of spherical planes,just like you would describe the third dimension to a two dimensional being as an infinite number of horizontal planes. But they wouldn't be capable to of visualizing it, just like we cannot visualize the fourth dimension. This theory of multiple dimensions beyond our perceived ones has sparked talks about the after-life. That possibly heaven exists on a different spatial dimension, or that ghosts are the result of hyper dimensional beings visiting our third dimension. these studies have branched off into all areas of science because physics is the basis of all sciences, and rise the most questions of our existence. We may never understand what creates the universes, but we can continue pondering what makes it tick and discover new and exiting ways to think about it."
154,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1035683-rachel,4,"Ahem.If this is what physicists work on all day, I got ripped off in high school.Okay, so half of this book is dedicated to ""things we might be able to do in a million years IF we don't blow ourselves up before then and IF our math is correct"" (that million, by the way? not an exaggeration). But before this book I didn't understand how a theory can become a theory just ""because the math works."" Frankly, I still don't--entirely--but my understanding is closer. I would have liked to see a few of the equations that go into string theory, in an appendix perhaps or just scattered through the text. (I say this, but this is coming from a woman who found ""Six Easy Pieces"" too daunting. Maybe I should be careful what I wish for.) What I'm saying, I guess, is that Michio Kaku does a wonderful job explaining the theoretical components of the, er, theory, but when he gets to the point of explaining why the math works out or, his favorite device, showing how string theory encompasses relativity and the Standard Model like a jigsaw puzzle, he lost me. I can't figure out how mathematical equations become spatially linked (read the book, look at the diagrams, and you'll see what I mean).It helps if you've read Flatland before this, and if you have a basic idea of physics--though Kaku does patiently explain the Big Bang, etc, for those who need a refresher.All in all, a fascinating look at one possible way our universe is constructed. Now, my personal opinion--and I'm no mathematician, but I hope I'm getting this right--is that Kaku is right: Nature likes simplicity. And any theory that has as many kinds of subatomic particles as string theory (which encompasses the Standard Model, which predicts the existence of many strangely-named bits of matter) is still lacking something, so perhaps the theory still needs refining.Get rid of the squarks and winos and we'll talk.(P.S. I read a passage from here to Chris and he just looked at me, horrified. ""I would NOT read that for fun."" So sue me, it's definitely not the most fun book. you've been warned.)"
155,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46760707-chance-cardona,4,"Michio Kaku‚Äôs Hyperspace is a brilliant recollection of modern physics seen through the lense of higher dimensions as the key to solving today‚Äôs problems. Hyperspace is told in an easy to read and understand way, even without very much physics knowledge. The book starts with Michio demonstrating higher dimensions easily unifying and simplifying the mathematics of physics, then progresses into the history of modern physics starting from Reimann in the 1800‚Äôs, and finishing in today‚Äôs world with string theory being the leading (and only) candidate. The book concludes with some more profound subjects such as time travel, faster than light travel, and even moral implications and the duties of society. The primary theme of this book is that higher dimensions are the key for simplifying and unifying the multitude of forces in physics, which was Einstein‚Äôs ultimate goal. If you love physics, the history behind it, you‚Äôre a nerd, or you just want to get a basic understanding of modern physics, then this book is a must read. If you lack curiosity or have a very basic level of patience, then avoid this. Michio‚Äôs writing style is clear and to the point with plentiful analogies to help understanding, although he does tend to repeat himself multiple times and the book could be a bit more concise. The best thing about this book, in my opinion, is how Michio doesn‚Äôt just give the facts, but also takes it a step further and talks about the theoretical devices and moral duties that these scientific advancements would bring with it. The weakest part of the book is that Kaku tends to repeat himself and the book could probably use some fat trimming in my opinion. If you‚Äôre debating reading this book for a modern physics class, then by all means do so, as this is a great introduction to the various theories and foundations of modern physics and gives you a basic yet thorough understanding of it all. Overall this book is one of the best modern physics books I have yet to read and I would recommend this to anyone with even a slight interest in physics or even sci fi technology."
156,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1698579-debbie,4,"This is a book about physics. And not simple physics, but really-hard-to-get-your-head-around physics. Mind blowing concepts like parallel universes, other dimensions, rips in the space-time fabric. And although I love science, I have never been any good at physics.But Michio Kaku is a wonderful writer and manages to explain most of these brain-frying concepts in such a way that not only did I understand what he was talking about, but I was thoroughly engaged in the telling.This book was published in 1994, so just over 20 years have passed since it was written and physics has moved on, most noticeably with the experiments carried out using the Large Hadron Collider which have confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson. Now that I've read this book I actually understand what a Higgs boson is, and why its discovery is so important. And the next round of experiments with the Large Hadron Collider may uncover evidence for the existence of extra dimensions. Thanks to Michio Kaku's book I will understand not only the immense significance of such a find, but will also understand what extra dimensions are.This book also opened my eyes to things I've never understood about physics before - such as the fact that physics is concerned with beauty and symmetry, and that a lot of physicists believe in the existence of God because physics suggests there must be a creator of some sort. Learning about the concepts in this book made me consider a lot of philosophical questions, and on a number of occasions Kaku's explanations also brought to mind quotes from Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, especially this one - ‚ÄúSpace is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.‚Äù "

Hypercube. Simple) that we can not really imagine, (the same way Mr.Square could not imagine the third dimension in the book ‚ÄúFlatland‚Äù).	Most people would think ‚Äújust another science textbook disguised as a small book.‚Äù However, this book gives all of the information that could be provided by a book its size, but the reading experience is not as boring as if you were reading the lesson for your homework. Professor Kaku‚Äôs analogies and stories add an interesting (unless the topic is already interesting element that you would most likely not find in a regular textbook (even though there are not many textbooks that talk about how the ten dimensions shrunk down to three dimensions of space and one of time, making total of four dimensions.)	Also woven into this book are some related subjects such as string theory, supergravity, hyperspace (as can be seen by looking at the title off of the title) non-Euclidian Geometry, and Kaluza-Klein theory, all of them not really something that someone would find in a regular class in regular school at this point. Not only are these topic addressed and thoroughly explained, but there are also many connections being made amongst these topics and a few others.	From the Big Bang to the end of time as we know it (and, as some believe, the beginning of time for some other life form whose composition would be considered completely absurd to us), this book will leave almost no questions hanging (that is, at the appropriate level).	Michio Kaku really knows this topic very well, and for that, he gets a book with a five-star rating."
158,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46881676-corbyn,4,"The novel that I am reviewing is called Hyperspace. Hyperspace is a book among books. Meaning that it is a group of paper, written on, and put together for people's enjoyment. This book is about the beauty of physics and how many people have changed it over the years. Hyperspace has a really thin, if at all, plot line. In Hyperspace, the author,writes about how things would be different if we were on a different plane of existence. Such as if the world were a 2d world. Everything would appear as flat around us. If the world were a 1d plane then everything would be straight ahead of us or straight behind us with no height or width. A 2d plane, is many 1d planes stacked on top of each other to give width. A 3d plane is multiple 2d planes stacked on top of each other. Then, it gets more complicated. Instead of just stacking 3d worlds on top of each other, the fourth dimension is time. Now, in the book, it talks about ten dimensions, but here i‚Äôll only go to five so if you have any interest then you can read the book to find out. The fifth dimension is just a patchwork to connect the dimensions together. And the main plot, if you can even call it that, is the idea of Einstein's ideal world of marble. The world of physics, for a long time kept replacing ‚Äúmarble‚Äù with ‚Äúwood‚Äù and Einstein didn‚Äôt like that. He wanted to have his ideal world realized before he passed, but every physical discovery made was turning the world to wood. You‚Äôll have to read it for yourself to see what happens with this later on.I recommend this book to anyone who likes the laws of the world and is interested in how the world works, and why it works the way it does. It is a very interesting read and will inform you on many theories and laws that you most likely haven‚Äôt heard of. "
159,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24013546-jacob-b,4,"Hyperspace by Michio Kaku,a non - fiction that takes on the bold, controversial world of theoretical physics, in which the astounding physicist Kaku, discusses the key moments of physics in the twentieth century (Einstein's theory of relativity and Quantum Theory) and then makes the bold statement (the overall reason for the book) that we live in a world of ten and twenty six dimensions (the complications as to why will go well past the character limit of goodreads) instead of the regular three we all know and visually see.This book was advised to me by a friend, in which he described it as a book for deep thinkers, which indeed it is, but such a book brought me into a depth of thinking and mind boggling questions that my brain hurt. The book was lovely do not get me wrong, the way in which Kaku wrote it, for the simple minded per say was genius, but it was still quite confusing and left me pondering for days. The controversy behind this books ""multiple-dimension"" theory is that of the usual Science issues, it's take on religion (usually negative) brings about a lot of rejects, and this being a sensitive topic as it is, while I read the book I attempted to limit myself to trying to understand the science and concepts rather than my personal views on the matter. To conclude, Hyperspace is truly a book I would recommend to anyone, but at the reader's own risk of confusion, eye strain, and headaches (sounds like reading the side effects to a prescription drug). Jokes aside, the writer's credibility, cunning wits, talent at writing, and ability to simplify the topic really got me hooked on a book I would never thought to be interested in, and for that I thank you, Kaku."
160,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949571-thomas-paul,4,"This book was written nearly twenty years ago but it still holds up well. Michio Kaku examines the theories of multi-dimensional space in an entertaining and educational book. His explanations are so clear that 10-dimensional space actually made sense. The book is somewhat a rambling adventure. Kaku takes us on a tour, introducing us to an interesting cast of characters including the sad story of Georg Bernhard Riemann who developed key equations for analyzing multi-dimensional space in the 1800's. The tour differs from a typical physics book in that instead of giving us the basic lecture of the advance of physics, Kaku approaches everything from a slightly different angle. In trying to help us understand multi-dimensional space, he looks not just at science but in art and literature. To emphasize a point he might explain it using something from his own career or from a science fiction story. The main problem with the book is that the author does tend to get off topic and ramble at certain points in the book. Stories about what an intelligent culture might do as the Universe ends doesn't really fit into the flow of the book and since we really have no idea how the Universe will end, it all seemed a bit pointless. I started to get the idea that Kaku had a number of pages in mind and was trying to fill the book with a lot of different ideas he has had floating around to reach that number. But don't let me scare you away. At least two-thirds of this book is brilliant writing that will make you think, help you understand modern theories of physics, and entertain you. I can forgive the author's ramblings when he provides that much in a few hundred pages."
161,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64836288-matthew,5,"One of my favourite books on theoretical physics, and the one that got me into them in the first place. I'm only around halfway through but I love it regardless. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in science whether it be physics, or chemistry, or anything in between, simply because its an interesting book I think anyone could enjoy"
162,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/665259-anthony,4,"Wow! I guess it's taken me about 7 months to finish this book. It would have taken less time to take a course in Theoretical Physics.Still, this was bathroom reading, so it was always going to be slow going (ha!).Potty humor aside, I love Michio Kaku. This book is part biography, part history of physics, and part analysis and applications of quantum physics.The book is divided into three parts: history of 10th dimensional physics (from foundations to present day), a strong description of the theory itself, followed by a ""what's this mean for me?"" conclusion.I buzzed through the history section (I love history) and I found a number of neat nuggets of information that I stored away for later (especially a bunch of interesting facts about the 19th century and the theories of 4th dimension). The 2nd part slowed me down a lot. I can only absorb so much physics every day. Honestly, the 1st and 3rd part took me about 2 weeks to read, each. The rest of it is Kaku's discussions the science behind 10th-dimensional physics, which took months to dig through.I'd say skip this part, but you can't. Kaku attacks the premise like a scientist and slowly give you the tools/background to understand the next part. But the ending is worth it. Kaku digs deep into the effects of these theories on society and the fate of our species. Very deep discussions await the stalwart reader.I enjoyed it, even though it was nowhere near my typical breakneck consumption style for books. If you're a scientist, or a sci-fi fan, this book will certainly be a treat."
163,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11712114-daniel,4,"This is the book to have at your side when reading hard science fiction or when your friends simply start trying to say that all the things invented by science fiction authors are impossible and non scientific. The author goes from special relativity, quantum theory and string theory and then expands the discussion to hyperspace definitions, time travels, discussion of viability of interstellar travel, multiverses, super colliders, wormholes and black roles and ends up discussing the genesis of the universe and its inevitable collapse after billions of years and the concepts of the evolution of technology against social evolution and the final transition to the complete domain of time and space.Sometimes the qualitative explanations of complex equations are difficult to grasp ( especially to engineers like me who had to learn a lot of math but definitely not enough for string theory or relativity ), but the concepts stick to your mind.Ok sometimes the authors strict adherence to explain a universe without a religious deity might sound a bit annoying to believers or to those who want to believe but one needs to remember that the purpose of physics is to explain the universe and its laws not prove or disprove God. So religious people can read this without any problems.The string theory which is the greatest theme behind the book is presented as a holy grail for physics. After reading this book readers will understand why many of the greatest minds of today are inspired to research in the area that the author names ""the physics of the 21th century"""
164,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,2,"Eh. I bought this book about 5 years ago and I had been excited to read it ever since. Well, finally getting around to it, I was pretty disappointed.It's a good attempt at addressing this interesting subject of higher dimensional physics but the execution leaves something to be desired.My biggest gripe was the fact that Kaku attempted to distill centuries of physical concepts into a few cutesy analogies but they end up unclear at best and patronizing at worst. Having a decent understanding of these concepts, I think his assessments of certain hypothetical situations stretch certain physical principles and completely neglect others in favor of a more dramatic rendering of potential futures. I don't think it's dishonest or even lazy - it just seems to underestimate the reader's comprehension.The redundancy in this book annoyed me a little as well. I understand that he wants to make sure the reader understands the basic principles before extrapolating, but I assure you that anyone interested in reading this book can grasp a ""Flatland"" analogy by the third or fourth example. I can sympathize due to the difficulty of the task though. Paraphrasing hundreds of years of civilization's collected knowledge is a dizzying concept and I respect Kaku's attempt. I just think he should have spent a little more time developing his examples and he should have had more faith in ""lay people"" to digest these concepts."

The topic of hyperspace and physics is extremely interesting to me and I thought that Kaku did a pretty good job of explaining it in the first part of the book. However as the book went on, he introduced a bunch of different theoretical concepts that are difficult to understand if you don‚Äôt really know anything about physics, and I had trouble seeing how they were connected to the idea of hyperspace. This book is well written, and you can tell that Kaku knows what he is talking about, but I found after awhile that reading this started to feel a bit tedious because the explanations were very science heavy and I didn‚Äôt really know what was going on (although this may be my own problem as I have never done well in math or physics classes - I knew going into the book that I would likely not grasp everything but thought I‚Äôd try it anyway because I was interested). Even though I kind of had to power through to finish this book, I would not describe it as boring because some of the anecdotes (especially at the end about wormholes and space travel) are interesting. Overall, this book may be more suited for people who have a better understanding of physics to begin with, but it definitely made me want to learn more about current developments in science and made me think about the universe which is always a good thing."
166,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7108363-ren,5,"I've always been fascinated of myth origins, even the science of it. How people go about solving it or narrating its fiction is wonderful.I came upon Michio Kaku's book at the recommendation of a friend. He had lent to me the book because I had expressed interest in the subject of physics - how it defines the world, the Cosmos, the Universe. What led to me to finish the book (because I had always doubt in my mind that science was indeed a great thing, something marvelous to learn, yet quite too much to take in) was how Kaku narrated the different theories and histories of hyperspace, the development of physics and its laws, and mathematics.The ease and simplicity of the narrative ran parallel to how nature and its laws can be explained - through the basic use of semantics. It is apparent in the Conclusion of the book.I have none more to say about the book, besides it inspiring me to consume more of the same nature of it. It has inspired me to learn more, and better, about physics. It shattered my notions that reading about science would be such a pain. Michio Kaku brings the Cosmos and the star systems down to the level of man, the minds of the great physicists not too far gone for the understanding of the common lay person."
167,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20986031-jason-meinig,4,"A thoroughly frustrating read, on multiple levels. On the intellectual level , I was frustrated I didn't know enough mathematics to keep up with the historical developments in physics that Michio Kaku exhaustively details, but also frustrated how, once again, a brilliant scientist writes about how we have all but found out how everything in our universe works. This kind of lack of humility annoys me - after reading the revolutions in thought and scientific paradigms outlined, you think a brilliant mind like Kaku's would be a little more cautious about claiming what we KNOW to be true, especially when we exist on top of an underlying quantum physics with inherent uncertainty. You can really sense his reductionist bias, even when towards the end of the book he offers up weak apologies to the holistic approach. I also love how scientists have labelled us a Type I civilization (as compared to Type II & III civilizations) - who exactly are they comparing us to? Civilizations in science fiction stories? This is pure speculation that somehow sounds like Science. I wish more hard nose, brilliant scientists could actually be a little more humble and open-minded. Oh well, still enjoyed the book."

It‚Äôs been sitting on my bookshelf for far too long (I bought it around 2000), but I‚Äôve finally gotten round to reading it! My impression of it is a bit mixed. Firstly, I found it very entertaining and I enjoyed reading it. However, I have a scientific background and I am convinced some parts of the book would be challenging to people with a different background to mine. I would be very interested to hear what other people thought about this. Secondly, regarding the topic. The book is, of course, a sales pitch for string theory as the ultimate theory of nature. Whether this is true or not (still) remains to be seen. As the author states, the mathematics needed to tease out any information from the theory is well beyond our current capabilities. In recent years there has been growing disconsent in the physics community about whether all our efforts should be focussed on such an intractable theory, however elegant it may be. (See for example the book Not Even Wrong by Peter Woit.) It may still turn out that string theory is correct, but it is not a given, and I feel the author doesn‚Äôt emphasise this enough. Overall though, an entertaining read."

I found it and read it and enjoyed it.The author gets a ""A"" for ambition, as the book is about the fundamental physics of superstring theories which naturally reside only in 10 or 26 dimensional spacetime, while we appear to be stuck in a 4 dimensional spacetime. As one of the early practitioners in the superstring extravaganza, the author is well qualified to write the book. And the guy is also a writer and educator, so his heart is in the right place for this project. The topic was speculative and ""useless"" at the time the book was written, and it remains so today, 20 years later; it may be a topic worthy of study for hundreds of years before anything useful comes of it. But the theories are apparently beautiful and tantalizingly close to being a ""theory of everything"" which would encompass the Standard Model of particle physics as well as a quantum theory of gravity. The author has nothing to be ashamed of -- 20 years after the book was written, we can see that he was enthusiastic yet cautious. There are no embarrassing predictions. The book moves along pretty nicely by covering historical, social and philosophical aspects of high dimensional theories."

For example, try reading the entry on the Speed of Light: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of...). Instead of a windy, overblown, jargon-y explanation, Kaku will often turn to analogies so that they're much easier to process. Instead of just telling us the math behind going at the speed of light, he described what it'd look and feel like if a subway car ran at the speed of light. This makes it vastly easier to understand the concepts he's describing, particularly if you don't have any sort of scientific or mathematical background at all.Weakness: That said, sometimes he does have to get rather technical with the physics behind those theories. And at other points, he'll talk about scientific concepts without really defining the terms he's using, which can make it hard to follow along sometimes.Overall, it's a very accessible book, but not exactly beach reading. It'll really blow your mind many times over, and make you realize there's so much more to our universe than you realized."

However, unless you have a decent background in theoretical physics (that is, unless you already understand it), you probably won't really grasp the first couple hundred pages. Awash in Yang-Mills field and Reimann metric tensors, the finer point of the physics and mathematics (and Kaku admits much of the math is beyond him) are lost on me. If you want relativity and quantum theory for the lay audience, I think Hawking's  A Brief History of Time is a better bet. But please, read on...Throughout, Kaku's point becomes clear - the laws of the Universe seem to simplify when expressed in higher dimensions. And where this lands for me is in yet another bit of compelling evidence for the importance exploding the dualism that pervades every aspect of our existence. Lately I see the same things - patterns and syncronicities - in nearly everything I see, read, hear, and feel, and this book is yet another piece of that puzzle. I even found, to my great delight, a physicist's argument for globalization buried deep in these pages.All I'm saying is that it's all the same thing. I can feel it in my GUT.

He starts by explaining different theories there are in the world and what we know and don't know. What we can be sure of and what we can‚Äôt be sure of, in this he explains very thoroughly about each theory.The book covers lots of points in it, how ever the particular points it covered was about parallel worlds, which it explained about, it talked about taking two points of the universe and taking the two pinpoints together it creates a wormhole. Theories like these that we wont be able to test out but is an idea, he explains clearly to his audience.I thought this book was extremely interesting but the only problem is that the book is a science book which can bore someone to death. Its interesting and unless you're interested about the topic it can easily lose your interest. I do know more information and theories that i knew about but didn't quite understand.

The history of this is absolutely informative, and the journey throughout the book is wonderful. There never is a ""boring"" part to this book. It takes you through understanding of 2 dimensions, 3 dimensions, the 4th dimension of space and time, while postulizing theories. I particularly like how he refers to other scientists thoughts, sci-fi writers, books written of fiction incorporating hyperspace with extra-dimensions, and so on. I also enjoyed how he pleads to both sides of arguments, showing how they cannot reach progressive ground merely at their spectrum, mentioning how people often are not understanding the meanings of one another. The book addresses well how the Universe may have begun, as well as it's ending, but gives us the hope that even with a Universe doomed to deep-freeze or die in a hot crunch, we can unify these theories over the coming progression of human evolution and progress to an advanced Type."

This is to be expected, though. You just can't make multi-dimensional imagery and vibrating strings very exciting to the lay person. It looses something without the excitement of its underlying mathematical foundation.Dr. Kaku tries his hand at a bit of futurist prognostication, too... very LONG, LONG term future, I mean. The discussion of Type I, II, and III societies and their respective technical and scientific prowess was quite interesting. Sadly, though, the discussion about the impending death of our universe was a bit depressing. Good thing it's a very, very long way off.All in all, this 1994 book was chocked full of interesting scientific history and understanding of the amazing things around us. We've only just begun. Just a few thousand years ago, we could barely manage to keep ourselves warm and fed. Today we're sending probes to other planets, asteroids, the sun, etc. Imagine what we'll be doing in 5000 more years. I can't wait to see. ;)Read it. Science is fun."

It starts off well giving us good insights into how to visualize higher dimensions and why it is needed to ""simplify""/unify all laws of Physics. While the first 2 parts are quite interesting from a layman perspective, the chapters that deal with the actual string theory does not have any mathematics in it. It just touches upon a little bit and never really explains the actual math. I think this is strictly for a layman like A Brief History Of Time but in that case, the author should not have put so many mathematical terms in those chapters. He uses lot of terms and theories but never explains what they mean. I felt cheated in those places. Also, before and after reading the book I still do not know anything about string theory except that the Maths came first in case of string theory and they are looking for Theory now. I would recommend this only if you are interested in physics/quantum theory and wanted some introduction to the world of multi-dimensions but do not expect to learn anything about the string theory."

I loved how it didn't devalue scifi writing in the world of science, and how it talked about science in popular culture, and ALSO, my favorite thing, was the language it used to talk about these things.In that, the author spoke in easy to understand terms and phrases while still staying true to the heart of science. They told stories to make it easier to understand, and the things they are talking about aren't just math and science combinations, they are entirely theoretical in a way that can't even be conceived by humans, and still I feel like I understand the parts they talk about. The second best thing about this book is how much it makes me want to read MORE about this subject, how it builds up this question in my mind and makes it interesting. I have several science books i have put down because the author seemed bored by their own material and I couldn't possibly become interested.This author clearly and enthusiastically loves the subject and that makes me love the subject, and I know this will help in my future writing endeavors.

The book isn't really for a general reader and requires some smattering of physics, but it is hardly the fault of the writer. The subject demands that knowledge, although Kaku tries hard to explain it through simplified pictures and anecdotes from sci-fi works. Coming to that, the extracts from great sci-fi novels, though giving a good opportunity to recall your reads or have a glimpse into their storyline, at places take away from the coherence and flow of the book. There are places where the narrative seems disjointed. Although it coalesces in the end, one feels that editing and flow would have been better.But Michio Kaku is a scientist not a novelist, hence no blame to him. A recommended read if you are interested in the happenings in the field of theoretical physics but can't be bothered or are unsuited for the obscure journals. "

There is no way I could have wrapped my mind around half of the stuff that is discussed. As an avid sci-fi reader I thought it would dumb down the theoretical physics and mathematics enough to make it easy enough for the average lay person, but alas, you still have to have a certain level of knowledge to even get the concepts of multi-dimensional space, let alone understand the theories. It's a great history lesson of scientists and mathematicians that in and of itself is worth the read, but if you're looking for an easy read, this is not it. It does make it easier for the slightly-educated to grasp the concepts discussed with diagrams and such and Kaku is a decent teacher. He conglomerates a lot of ideas into a single book and even though it's at least 20 years old, it still gives a modern perspective on current theoretical physics, quantum theory and math."

I have a better understanding of Einstein's theory of reletivity, as well as what would constitute an equation to be ""beautiful"".This book is a bit dated however.

This happens to me sometimes when I read books about physics: either they seem so dumbed-down that the are leaving out the important bits, and I can't buy into what they are explaining; or they are not dumbed-down enough and I can't quite grasp the concepts. Of course, the perfect book walks that fine line. This was not that perfect book and I feel like it fell into the over-simplified category.

So, if there's some sort of complicated idea behind quantum mechanics you want to understand better, well, there's a Star Trek Next Generation plot device for that! A great & educational read, one that will add to your sense of wonder as well."

There are only two differences: There are more theoretical physics in this book, and it talks a lot more about wormholes and parallel universes, which are my favorite topics. Also, the author clearly has a sense of humor. An example is: ""At this point, the subatomic particles would have been stripped of all their components, which would tear the fabric of space-time. That would lead to a small wormhole opening up in the microwave. At this point, it would be a good idea to exit the kitchen."" In my opinion, humorous sentences almost always make a book better."

Professor Michio Kaku takes us through the search for this equation in the book Hyperspace. He takes those silly questions that children ask about the world and uses simple analogies in order to explain the most complex of concepts. He also tries to grasp the interest of a broad audience by showing how theories in physics developed throughout history and how they have affected famous authors of literary books. This book is a great read for anyone with the vaguest interest in physics.
201,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369506-terry,3,"It was good, but confusing, and it had enough detours that it made me lose confidence in the point. It's generally about how many questions of physics are answered by unifying forces in more than three dimensions (specifically ten). I usually insist on understanding a passage before moving on, but I had to give up pretty often here.Also, reading science books that are a decade or two old (I believe this is from 1996) always makes me wonder what innovations have arisen since, and there's no good way to find out. (I had a similar issue with the much more charming A Short History of Nearly Everything.)"

Its filled with awesome diagrams that seal the mind's ability to comprehend and store the information in this book... they are practical, and easy to follow, and if you needed a quick study on the basic elements of sci-fi, this book is a treasure. It was published years ago and by now there are probably several advancements and developments that are not up to date but a lovely read for the most part about the origin and future of theorizing (and discovering) other dimensions.

Kaku uses amusing and illustrative analogies to explain all of the challenges of trying to unify the physics of the very large and small while teaching the reader about the history and evolution of String Theory. Although the book is very readable, it contains an enormous amount of information for non-science types.

It got me thinking about interesting mathematical concepts before I learned them, formally, in classes.That said, I think popular science writing is particularly bad. In that it misconstrues its subjects as to be almost entirely incorrect... May not be the case here, but I can't tell because I don't know physics that well.I'm somewhat surprised that I left this off my goodreads list until now...

I personally found this book to be very boring. I had read his first book and found it to be very interesting and thought provoking. This one, however, proved to be quite dull and uninteresting. He seemed to just be rambling on and on. I never really was able to find a unifying theme behind the entire thing. I would reccomend this anyone who is a die-hard of Kaku, but not many people other than this would find this book very interesting."

Issues addressed? Hyperspace, parallel universes, the tenth dimension. . . . This ended up not being for me. For others, though, it represents a pretty accessible work on the subject and may prove more satisfying."

Whether you are a hardened theoretical physicist looking to have an idle read, or a new-to-the-field novice looking for a strong foundation, ""Hyperspace"" is the definitive work of superstring theory. Susskind and Hawking are powerhouses to be sure, but Kaku has a way of forcing concepts and pictures into your psyche, even if the raw mathematical concepts are beyond understanding. Brilliant, elegant, and rarely long winded, ""Hyperspace"" might change your life like it did mine.Note: Though the book is, now, a tad dated, this is an absolute must have/read/archive."

I would read this book before any of his other works.Any problems? Because the book is from 1994, the latest progress in physics is missing such as the results from the Large Hadron Collider which began construction in 1998. It is also missing thoughts on M-Theory (1995) which grew out of String Theory. Nevertheless the book provides a good baseline of information. I'll definitely read it again."

It took me forever to finish but I'm glad I did. My main issue with this book was how it tended to jump from subject to subject and lose the reader, i.e. me. However, it was very well written in an accessible but intelligent manner that someone who has no experience with physics, again i.e. me, could comprehend.

And.. Michio Kaku is the top man of hyperspace. It gave me a clearer understanding of life and death somehow, and I learned so much about a person I have admired for so long. Easy reading in a highly complex subject matter. There is something here for anyone who has ever pondered the big questions of life, plus many great anecdotal stories about Michio and other top scientists from the world of mathematics and physics.

But the thorough explanations and many visual representations made learning about the Hyperspace Theory bearable. This book was written by one of the most genius physicists in the world, Michio Kaku, about the theory of hyperspace, black holes, and the fabric of reality. I did skip through some of the more boring chapters, but I really liked this book in the end. Trying to wrap your mind around things like time travel is fun."

I have read other works by the author, and enjoyed his insights into the future of mankind.

The book is beautifully written with good examples. You might need some basics and interest in cosmology and physics to understand it perfectly. Overall the book is great and must read if you are interested to learn about creation of Universe. 
220,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47312505-patrick,4,"As a popularizer of complex physics, Kaku explains principles such as multi-dimensional space by exploring what objects that inhabit it might look like. While Stephen Hawking's Brief History of Time introduces the lay man to the fascinating physics of time, Kaku's Hyperspace does the same with the mysteries of higher-dimensional space.A must-read for anyone interested in cosmological discoveries, also because you can safely skip the mathematics which tend to require some college-level knowledge to fully understand. Something for everyone, no doubt."

I couldn't quite agree with Kaku's overly optimistic view of our civilization and culture though.

I just find fault in that logic."

253,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10057243-john,0,"A very good read that did a wonderful job of explaining some of the simpler concepts, but could easily lose the reader when dealing with some of the quantum physics formulas that are mentioned but not really explained. Granted, explaining these would have probably been another 2 or 3 books in itself, but more real world examples or analogies would have been welcome."
254,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2738955-sultry,5,"Another great non-fiction from the newest master of Physics Michio Kaku. Wonderful views to stretch your imagination. Michio, as always, keeps his reader's attention as he guides them through this dimension and into the next --- how many?A great read if you like non-fiction and physics, easy to understand.Thank you Mr. KakuSultry"
255,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7478472-olivia,4,"I liked the various theories surrounding different dimensions and the newer dimension of time and space. Wormholes and blackholes were very interesting to read about. The ending was a bit tragic for me, however the details and figures in the book were very helpful. Definitely recommend this book for anyone who's curious about space but doesn't want to be bombarded with huge technical terms."
256,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15896876-caco-porto,5,"For everyone that is looking for open the mind in order to increase its imagination, I can assure that this book is the right path for.Using simple words and simple examples 100% understandable for the non scientist people, Michio Kaku explain how our Universe is much more than the 3 dimensions that we are use to live. "
257,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9724730-shereena,4,"I learned a LOT from this book. I am interested in astronomy so this was a great Christmas gift from my sister. I was a little annoyed at the end, mostly because as brilliant as Michio is at explaining the most complex concepts to the average person, he has a tendency to elaborate more than I felt was necessary."
258,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19421049-gustavo-hoffmann,5,"Great book. Very simple, yet somewhat complete on a complex subject. Very easy introduction to superstring theory. The explanations are simple and the textbook itself seems like it's a dialogue where Michio Kaku is telling a story. A must if you want to understand advanced physics without complex math (I don't remember if it has any math at all), or even complex math without complex math."
259,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6885267-mike-dodson,3,"Well, this was supposed to be a book on hyperspace theory that the average man could read and I guess it was. The good thing about it is that it really does excite the imagination into what's out there in the universe. The only problem with the book was that Dr. Kaku spent too much time on history. All in all a good book. It will make your head hurt if you read more than 50 pages at a time."
260,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14424440-amy,5,"Fascinating, informative, and mind-blowing. I highly recommend it, particularly for those like myself who can't quite wrap their minds around the mathematical equations and scientific jargon of the physics community, but still enjoy learning about what we do--and more importantly do not--know about the universe."
261,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21395047-a-cheung,5,"A exciting, optimistic account on what the ""world"" actually is and what could come in the future, in a as scientific as possible way. Professor Kaku's writing style is captivating, bridging between colloquial and academic writings. I would recommend this book to more open-minded readers with some understanding of basic science."
262,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22066278-maria,5,"My curiosity on the topics of time warps, dimensions, ect. started when I was very young. I wasn't sure I was going to be able to read this book and was surprised at how wonderfully enjoyable it is. Full of wonderful information that gets you excited about all of the various possibilities. Thank you Mr. Kaku "
263,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3459607-josh-fish,5,"A great distillation of the past present and future of theoretical physics, even if it was still over my head in a few of it's mathematically intense moments. I should have read this book twenty years ago when it was published. It's funny as Kaku talks about how cool it would be if the Higgs-Bosom was discovered. He must feel pretty cool about now. "

265,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26977482-chris-kalbach,3,"The book started off really good and intriguing. However, soon after the midway point the book became a poor exercise in Fiction writing. The book exhibited nearly every logical fallacy. Overall, the math behind hyperspace was cool; but he can keep the useless conjecture that comes along with it. His theory is fundamentally philosophically flawed and as he, himself said, you need philosophy."
266,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7768448-ana,4,"This book was one of the first and most powerful mind-blowing experiences in my life. I found it in high school and thought it was pretty. Boy, was I in for a ride!4 out of 5 stars only because my high school me couldn't understand some of the chapters; but sure enough, I'm gonna read it again, and soon. "
267,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219008-zombaby-cera,4,"Michio Kaku, the man who is always interviewed for documentaries - even those not dealing with theoretical physics. This is because he has a brilliant way of explaining things to the lay-person, without dumbing it down too much and robbing it of its beauty. He does no less in this book! A truly interesting read!"
268,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30240392-amanda-lynn,5,"Though repetitive at times, this is easily one of the most stimulating and mind blowing books I have read. It was a challenging read for me, but I learned a lot and had several heart sinking, mind = blown, moments. Kaku has such a great way of using the right metaphors and scenarios that really helped me understand some of the most mind blowing concepts in this book."
269,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30232795-nour,5,"Michio Kaku tries to explain higher dimensions, first analyzing the history of higher dimensions of space and the struggle to unite quantum mechanics and general relativity in one theory. He then goes on to detail theories concerning the 2-D world, named ""Flatland"". The end of the book discusses such topics as wormholes, parallel universes and the fate of the universe."
270,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/797141-annie-primera,5,"Kako's book manages to be exciting and absorbing. In spite of the ridiculously complicated themes and ideas he works with, his clear and relatable explanations are so good that a layman like me can understand a good part of what he's saying. This book is incredibly thought-provoking and can be equal parts awe-sriking and terrifying. Definitely a must-read."
271,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9328639-jin-jie,4,"""[...] perhaps one of the deepest experiences a scientist can have, almost approaching a religious awakening, is to realise that we are children of the stars, and that our minds are capable of understanding the universal laws that they obey."" think I would have enjoyed this even more had I not dropped Physics in Sec 2."
272,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12768655-vikram-prasad,3,Good concise coverage of history and development of multi-dimensional theories. Covers all popularly known concepts/theories. Simple language without going too deep into science jargons or technicals. Good to get an overview of these theories but for in depth understanding would suggest reading other books focusing on same topic.
273,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41352-james-millen,3,"This is NOT an easy popular science book. Mainly known for its super-cutting edge (read: speculative) Physics at the end. Matt Bellamy from Muse loves it. It borders on ridiculous, but smart ridiculous!James"
274,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145251-george,3,"Great book, really well written. Kaku is one of the rare geniuses that actually knows how to write simply. Kind of a brainfuck because you are trying to visualize higher dimensions but are psychologically incapable of it, though it's wonderful to try."
275,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576391-mary,4,"I love how Michio Kaku explains complicated quantum theories in terms that laymen can understand. It was difficult in a few spots, but I never found it dry. I looked at my world differently for a month after I read it. I already loved physics, but this just added to that fascination."
276,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/916251-kim,5,This is a well-written mix of context and really good explanations -- often from several different angles. Kaku ties physics to history and everyday life in a way that gives you a sense of how interesting and mind-blowing the world is. 
277,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/999826-earlwalkinkle,5,"If you've ever wondered what it's like to understand what a theoretical physicist does, to get into the minds of some of the greatest thinkers of our time, read this book! The one and only popular book ever written for the lay person about Hyper Space. "

I tend to dip in and out rather than read from cover to cover (maybe that is my downfall!)."""
279,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1135684-mab,5,This book was written for the average person not a scientist. It was a good conversation about what modern science is discussing and it's fascinating. I love the idea of the Super String theory. . . . not sure what that is then read this book! 
280,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1169086-gabrielle,3,I won't say I remembr this book with complete clarity but I do remember being impressed that Kaku could make some mind-boggling scientific theories basically clear to me- a dyed-in-the-wool science knownothing.
281,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526488-dwayne,5,"Wow. I read this in prison, and got plenty of dirty looks from the Neanderthals in the cages next to mine. But it was extraordinary. Mr. Kaku is an excellent storyteller, even if his chosen stories are factual in nature."
282,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1496604-chap,5,"Loved this book. I'm a science nerd, and this book was a great way to introduce me to upper-level physics. There is minimal math (if any at all). I read it in high school, and I am sure that I would pick up on more if I read it again. Very in depth. I couldn't put it down."
283,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1749589-aleda,5,"This book is really fun to read! Even though it looks like string theory is probably not going to turn out to be the grand unification theory, it still invokes incredible mind wanderings. And you'll learn a lot of other stuff, too."
284,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3603156-ashley,5,"Absolutely entrancing. Kaku explains his subjects in an easy, exciting manner that grabbed me from page one. One of the best books on theoretical physics and general physics available for the non-specialist."
285,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2692799-ben-jenkins,5,"I really enjoyed this book. It's about space in higher dimensions and how the laws of nature simplify. I recommend this book to someone who likes science. But for those of you who don't, this book is good at explaining things to people who aren't sciencey."
286,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4665860-ethan-bagley,3,"A little more ""out there"" as far as physical theory (at the time) would allow. Very good read for stimulating the mind and imagining what is really *possible*, though probably most likely in far-flung futures and on nano-second scales in laboratories."
287,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5146488-john,5,This book is a well crafted layman's book with one sentence or two that blew my mind. It helped me solve one of the greatest mysteries I ever encountered in my life and in the lives of my grandparents.
288,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4018608-thadd,4,"The section about alien civilizations, advanced societies that use stars and other devices rather than oil for power, is interesting. Other sections, ones dealing with parallel universes, time warps, and the tenth dimension, are fascinating. Read this book, a thought provoking title, many times."
289,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858716-adam,4,"This is the first Michio Kaku book I've read and I really enjoyed it. It makes all aspects of quantum physics easy to understand, and uses some good metaphors to explain some of the more complex parts. "
290,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6007648-jo-o-lamas,5,"Kaku is just brilliant. It's amazing how he is able to explain such complex subjects in a simple way that everyone can understant. Not only one of the greatest scientists of our time, but a brilliant communicator as well."
291,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301867-ryan,4,"This book is really a history of all things extra-dimensional. While a large part focuses on the progression of theories in physics, the book rounds off with discussion from all approaches including philosophy, religion, higher maths, etc."
292,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9050963-indigo-plume,5,"I loved this book because it encourages one to think beyond the realm of our three dimensional human existence. It was an easy enjoyable read, even for someone who may not have taken an advanced physics class."
293,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12626434-blake-griffith,5,"I read this in 7th grade and cannot think of a book that has had a greater impact on my life. I have given countless speeches on this subject, and Kaku sparked my now insatiable appetite for science. "
294,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6258574-amit-srivastava,4,"This book introduced me to Michio Kaku. He is a good writer indeed. However, of late, he has been writing too many books. So I find a lot of stuff being repeated. Hyperspace is good book indeed. In fact it attempts to open up the mind to more than three dimensions in a very practical way. "
295,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6693574-narendra,5,"Awesome book as expected. This book gives an amazing tour to the most challenging concepts of physics like a parallel universe, hyperspace, string theory, field theory and many more. The bottom line is that this book is awesome."
296,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13319217-dan-trivates,5,"More like SIX stars! I had to buy this book twice because some NERD stole it on me! It was worth buying twice, I'm serious. I have nothing but respect for a guy who built his own particle accelerator in his parents' garage when he was a teenager!"
297,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17528182-ash-srinivas,5,"It's been a long time since I read it, and I'm no physicist, but I really recall that I loved it! A truly behind the scenes look at the world of mathematical physicists that doesn't bewilder folks who are neither professional mathematicians nor professional physicists."
298,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8622392-laurent-videau,4,"As Michio says somewhere in his book, ""The focus of this book is not the nature of subatomic particles, but the higher-dimensional world in which they probably live.""Together with ""The Hidden Reality"" from Brian Greene, this book is a good introduction to string theory and multi universe."
299,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21114678-pat-lee,5,Definitely suggest this book to individuals who seek a glimpse of the future and who seek to understand and enjoy various physical concepts that are being delivered from the realm of science fiction to our present day reality.
