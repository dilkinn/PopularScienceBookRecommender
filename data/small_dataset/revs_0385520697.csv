To gild the skills of a highly regarded and successful scientist by cultivating such an accessible and entertaining writing culture that is second to none in the current non-fiction field is at least as much a part of Kaku as the co-founding of string theory. If not a bit more, because the awakening of enthusiasm of others for the miracles around us is considered to be almost even higher than the important, but for most inaccessible basic research. Three categories make up the well-conceived basic structure of the work, starting with the ""impossibilities of the first degree,"" which includes expected inventions in the foreseeable future such as invisibility, force fields, artificial intelligence, robots, teleportation, psychokinesis, telepathy, nanotechnology, and antimatter. Those foundations and functionality are already explored, but not yet implemented. The second round is formed by the ""impossibilities of the same, second degree,"" which fall within the theoretically possible, but with a substantially longer announced development time. Whereby it could take millennia or millions of years to the completion. Representatives of these species include parallel universes and communication with the same, over-light speed, contact with aliens and time travel. The distinction between the third and last supreme discipline of the book forms the harmony with the physical laws of nature and the associated realizability.The ""impossibilities of the third degree"" have entirely alienated themselves from the standard order of things and are therefore in an area of seeming an impossibility. Examples of these, a little pitiable, since damned to be never discovered, species of inventions include the Perpetuum mobile or precognition.Even if some readers are instinctively tempted to roll their eyes in case of some of these categories, one should consider the point of view of a few hundred or even just a few decades of years ago. Moreover, the accompanying worldview, or the same supporting hypotheses for the probabilities of various theories.Then legions of former impossibilities will be found, which have since become antiquated and forgotten. Thus, to regard it as exceedingly arrogant to attest immutable and everlasting veracity to our momentary tiny fragments of parts of the whole thing. On the contrary, the author's ease of acknowledging that in many ways we have not even plunged into the deeper surf zone of the Cosmic Ocean would undoubtedly be useful for some of the established luminaries of the science community. As a motivation to open their intuition.Kaku is also to be credited additionally, that he closes all dogmatics and instead has an open and critical approach to the matter. So that without reducing the entertainment value by drifting into too theoretical explanations, to instead bring in bright and varied images, to make the world of his beloved physics understandable to the layman.Also, this love for his profession thankfully sparks from each new paragraph when turning the pages. This is how science didactics has to work.GERMANGrandios gewandt, verständlich und neutral spannt sich der Bogen von möglich bis allzu fantastisch.Die Kompetenzen eines noch dazu so angesehenen und erfolgreichen Wissenschaftlers zu vergolden, indem man eine so zugängliche und unterhaltsame Schreibkultur pflegt, die im momentanen Sachbuchbereich ihresgleichen sucht, gereicht Kaku mindestens ebenso zu Ehren wie die Mitbegründung der Stringtheorie. Wenn nicht gar einen Deut mehr, da die Begeisterung anderer für die Wunder um uns als fast noch höher zu erachten ist, als die wichtige, aber für die meisten doch unzugängliche Grundlagenforschung.Drei Kategorien bilden das gut durchdachte Grundgerüst des Werks, den Anfang machen die „Unmöglichkeiten ersten Grades“, womit in absehbarer Zukunft zu erwartende Erfindungen wie Unsichtbarkeit, Kraftfelder, künstliche Intelligenz, Roboter, Teleportation, Psychokinese, Telepathie, Nanotechnik und Antimaterie fallen, deren Grundlagen und Funktionsweise bereits erforscht, allerdings noch nicht umsetzbar sind.Den zweiten Reigen bilden die „Unmöglichkeiten eben selben, zweiten Grades“, unter die theoretisch ebenfalls mögliche, aber mit einer wesentlichen längeren Entwicklungszeit avisierte Entwicklungen fallen. Wobei es durchaus in die Jahrtausende oder Jahrmillionen bis zur endgültigen Fertigstellung gehen könnte. Vertreter dieser Spezies sind unter anderem Paralelluniversen und die Kommunikation mit selbigen, Überlichtgeschwindigkeit, Kontaktaufnahme mit Außerirdischen und Zeitreisen. Die Abgrenzung zur dritten und letzten Königsdisziplin des Buches bildet der Einklang mit den physikalischen Naturgesetzen und damit einhergehende Realisierbarkeit.Die „Unmöglichkeiten dritten Grades“ haben sich von der normalen Ordnung der Dinge komplett entfremdet und gastieren daher in einem Bereich der vermutlichen Unmöglichkeit. Beispiele für diese, dadurch ein klein wenig bemitleidenswerte, da zum niemals entdeckt werden verdammte, Spezies an Erfindungen sind unter anderem das Perpetuum mobile oder Präkognition.Auch wenn manch Leser instinktiv versucht ist, bei manchen der genannten Kategorien die Augen rollend laut auszuatmen, sollte man sich den Gesichtspunkt von vor ein paar Hundert oder auch nur paar Dutzend Jahren betrachten. Und das damit einhergehende Weltbild, beziehungsweise selbiges untermauernde Thesen für die Wahrscheinlichkeiten verschiedenster Theorien. Dann werden sich Legionen von einstigen Unmöglichkeiten finden lassen, die mittlerweile selbst antiquiert und vergessen worden sind. Somit es als überaus hochmütig anzusehen, unseren momentanen Fragmenten von Teilen des Ganzen unverrückbare und ewig währende Richtigkeit zu attestieren. Im Gegenteil täte die Leichtigkeit des Autors, einzugestehen dass wir in vielerlei Hinsicht noch nicht einmal in die tiefere Brandungszone des kosmischen Ozeans eingetaucht sind, einigen etablierten Koryphäen des Wissenschaftsbetriebs als Motivation zur Öffnung der eigenen Anschauung gewiss gut.Kaku ist noch zusätzlich anzurechnen, dass er sich sämtlicher Dogmatik verschließt und stattdessen offen und kritisch an die Materie herangeht. Und das ohne den Unterhaltungswert durch Abdriften in allzu theoretische Erklärungen zu mindern, um stattdessen in anschaulichen und abwechslungsreichen Bildern die Welt seiner geliebten Physik auch dem Laien verständlich näher zu bringen. Und diese Liebe zu seinem Steckenpferd schießt einem dankenswerterweise beim Umblättern aus jedem neuen Absatz funkensprühend entgegen. So muss Wissenschaftsdidaktik funktionieren."
1,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/603766-servius-heiner,4,"This book is standard Michio Kaku. He starts off discussing the three classes of impossibilities. (Understand that much of what you would think of as impossible is not really impossible. In order to be proven impossible it must break a law of physics, there is not much that does.)“Class 1 Impossibilities: These are technologies that are impossible today but that do not violate the known laws of physics. So they might be possible in this century, or perhaps the next, in modified form. They include teleportation, anti-matter engines, certain forms of telepathy, psycho kinesis, and invisibility.”“Class 2 Impossibilities: These are technologies that sit at the very edge of our understanding of the physical world. If they are possible at all, they might be realized on a scale of millennia to millions of years. They include time machines, the possibility of hyperspace travel, and travel through wormholes.”“Class 3 impossibilities: These are technologies that violate the known laws of physics. Surprisingly, there are vary few such technologies. If they do turn out to be possible they would represent a fundamental shift in our understanding of physics.”He also goes into detailing the classes of civilizations, which is important because there are just something you can’t do until you have the power to do them. We are a class “0” civilization.Type 1 civilization: Those that harvest planetary power, utilizing all the sunlight that strikes their planet. They can, perhaps, harness the power of volcanoes, manipulate the weather, control earthquakes, and build cities on the oceans. All planetary power is with in their control.Type 2 civilization: Those that can utilize the total power of their sun, making them 10 billion times more powerful then a type 1 civilization. The Federation in Star Trek is a type 2 civilization. A type 2 civilization in a sense, is immortal; nothing known to science, such as ice ages, meteor impacts, or even supernovae, can destroy it. (In the event their mother star is about to explode they can just move to another system, perhaps even move their planet.)Type 3 civilization: Those that can utilize the power of an entire galaxy. They are 10 billion times more powerful then a type 2 civilization. The Borg in Star Trek, the Empire in Star Wars, and the galactic civilization in Asimov’s Foundation series correspond to a type 3 civilization. They have colonized entire star systems and can exploit the black hole at the center of their galaxy. They freely roam the galaxy.Over all I was fascinated by this book, Michio has a way of explaining heavy physics without losing a reader without a doctorate. There are some things I wish he would have went into in greater detail, but I guess there are always more books. I am growing tiered of this universe I think I will go check out the one next door."

Here he dissects all the Sci-Fi tropes and explains how each of them is impossible, or what the hell it would take to make it a reality. I learned quite a lot and it was not too jumbled for a non-scientist like me to read. "
3,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112699911-orhan-pelinkovic,4,"While reading this book, I was thinking to myself, this book can easily be converted into a script for a television show. It's written in a form as if it was prepared in advance for a narrator to recite it on a stage set. Sure enough, a TV series was produced based on the Physics of the Impossible a year after the book's release.Michio Kaku, who governs so well with all the complexities of modern physics, very briefly, but effectively, introduces the development of several branches of physics, staring from Newtonian mechanics of the 17th century up to relativity and quantum mechanics of the 20th century. However, if you're looking for a more elaborate exposition of the theories and laws of physics, I would suggest Brian Greene's The Fabric of the Cosmos.You should definitely consider reading this book if you're a fan of Star Wars and Star Trek and curious no know how probable and feasible is it to achieve, in the future, the hypothetical technologies illustrated in these blockbusters.Kaku, a well known science popularizer, does a superb job explaining how Sci-Fi technologies and ideas depicted in these movies could function and what is restricting us from achieving them today? How realistic is it to expect for humans to overcome these engineering challenges? In order to do so, do we need a new branch of physics or mathematics? Will a robot ever achieve or surpass the capabilities of the human brain? Kaku maintains an optimistic tone throughout the book while his overall assessment is cautiously optimistic concerning accomplishing these technologies.The book even suggests different methods and ways to make flights into orbit more cost-effective, but does not propose reusable rockets, that have substantially decreased the cost of launching payloads into orbit since SpaceX's successful launch in 2015. The book was written in 2008.The authors writing style is clear, smooth, and easy to understand. I read most of the book while watering my garden (a grove of fruit trees) and getting a couple of scratches from the tree branches, which made all this talk about the possibility of achieving human teleportation and interstellar travel seem light-years away. But I have to remind myself of the main lesson of the book: to stay open to far-fetched ideas and not reject them before considering every aspect, even though they sound impossible."
4,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,4,"When I was a schoolkid I studied physics in part because - like many physics students - I wanted to know how to build the cool stuff in science fiction. The death star. Lightsabers. Warp drive. This is the stuff of Kaku's riotous introduction to modern physics and if I'd read it when I was in school it would have blown my goddamn mind.I went into this book anticipating that I wouldn't learn all of that much - after all I have a masters degree in physics and read widely before studying at university - and that all the stories Kaku covered would be all too familiar to me already. For the first half of the book this was true, and his explanations of the science part of science fiction was either familiar to me or stuff I had worked out for myself. The second half of the book, where he took trips into the real bleeding edge of modern physics and invoked predictions of string theory, cosmology, and the standard model included fascinating nuggets of information that were totally novel to me.So if you are a sci fi nerd and are interested in physics (that Venn diagram being all but a circle) then regardless of whether you are a high school student or a university student, I highly recommend this book. It certainly left me wanting to learn more, and further my reading - which after being jaded by four years of hardcore physics is saying something!"
5,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"There is no denying that this is an interesting book and one that presented many of the problems of physics in a way that is comprehensive, comprehensible and engaging. I think other people (people with a greater interest in science fiction, particularly) will find this book even more interesting than I did and more accessible than your standard pop science book on physics. I hadn’t realised I knew quite so little about science fiction – I hadn’t ever really thought about the fact that I hadn’t seen any of the Superman films or any of the Star Trek films or any of the Star Wars films after the first couple. If you’d asked me I would have said that my disillusionment with film had only really started a couple of years ago, but clearly it goes back much further than I realised.I think it would have helped to have known more about popular culture and thereby to have gotten some of the references here – but really, I could make do without this knowledge. So, if you don’t know which end it is best to hold your light sabre or (and even though he doesn’t actually quote Dr Who) how to reverse the polarity of the neutron flow (sorry, that one always amuses me) you will still be able to follow what is going on.This book looks at what it says it will look at – impossible stuff. It then tries to work out just how impossible this impossible stuff is. The answer generally being, not terribly. Basically, he identifies three levels of impossibility. Stuff that is impossible now, but might not be for all that long. Stuff that is impossible now and might remain so for the next couple of thousand years. And finally, stuff that is pretty damn well close to being totally impossible and is likely to stay that way unless there is a fairly impressive overturning of some of the fundamental laws of physics. (And do you know what, if I was killed by a bullet aimed under Newtons Laws and these ended up being proven to be wrong, well, I'd be asking for my money back) What he doesn’t like to do is say stuff is completely impossible and will always remain impossible (even when discussing faster than light travel, for example, or perpetual motion machines – although he does point out that there are one or two fairly serious problems that need to be addressed if these are ever likely to work).I really do understand that people don’t like it when other people (you know, like me) start talking about things being impossible. I know that they point back to past predictions of the impossible and smirk and tut or whatever they think is the best way to express their disgust. And look, all that is fine – but just because you’ve seen something rather cool happen on your favourite science TV show doesn’t mean that the world has to be made to conform to your desires. For example, it is pointed out in this book that to open a wormhole that might allow us to travel backwards in time might require all of the energy contained in a body the size of Jupiter. The wormhole still might not work, of course – it still might collapse as soon as we enter it – or it might not even open at all in the first place. Is there really ever going to be a time when we are likely to convert all of the matter in Jupiter into energy just so as to try out a wormhole that may or may not work? Look, I could be completely wrong (I have been known to be in the past) but I’d have thought we might have other uses for that amount of energy, even in some strange, undefined future. Margaret Wertheim’s criticism in Pythagoras' Trousers God, Physics, and the Gender Wars of the high priests of physics (ever noticed how often these boys talk about the mind of God?) and their preference for BIG science in a world were the majority of our species are barely scratching out an existence is apt and worth keeping in mind while reading this book, I think.I know, I know, ‘where’s your sense of adventure and your desire to dream the dream, McCandless?’ But I want more than ‘there might not be anything in the laws of physics as we know them to stop us from …’ as a reason to believe my grandkids will be living on Mars. And he does a very good job in presenting the ‘problems’ here, even if he ends up being a bit more optimistic than I would be. Given I’ve rather strong doubts we will see out another century without destroying ourselves with nuclear weapons (a threat we seem to have ignored rather bizarrely as the threat increased following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the relative safety of the Cold War) many of these questions are likely to remain academic.There is talk of interstellar flights (and this from a creature whose furthest adventures to date have been to the moon and who nearly kills astronauts (cosmonauts) whenever we leave them on space stations for any length of time). Still, we are talking millions of years into the future – so why not? Well, economics is probably one reason. If travelling away from Earth at near light speeds is necessary for those traveling to the stars it is hard to see why any future society would bother. The stars are an awfully long way away and by the time the people on the rocket would reach these far away places billions of years will have elapsed here on Earth. Why would the people on the Earth (the people paying the bills, after all) bother sending other people so far away only for us to never hear from them again? (Well, unless they are telephone hygienists, of course) I just can’t see how we would ever think that this would be the way to go. I’m not saying we never will go off to the stars, but if we do it will not be with the same sense of exploration that Columbus was sent off with. We will be sending off these ships with the certain knowledge that we will never hear from them again.Despite Kaku being very interested in string theory, he does present it here as having many failings and also presents some interesting questions about the possibility of us ever developing a theory of everything, either made of strings or not. He discusses this concern on the basis of Gödel's incompleteness theorem in mathematics – and given physics is the most mathematical of the sciences this ought to provide some pause for thought. Gödel's theorem says that there will always be things in mathematics that we know must be true, but can never prove to be true within mathematics itself. The goal of mathematics throughout the ages (since the Greeks, in fact) has been to create a system of proven axioms that build upon each other to create the whole structure of mathematics as a logically complete whole – Gödel proved this dream could never be realised. The fear now is that this may also be true in Physics.Kaku does not think that very much is impossible (given enough time, enough knowledge, enough energy). He also handles some of the philosophical issues in some of the impossibilities mentioned (teleportation is an interesting case – are you the same person on the other side of the teleportation device as you were on the side you entered or should Scotty be charged with your murder?) The stuff on lasers – and why light sabres might not be the weapon of choice for quite some time (a bit of a problem with the necessary power source) was very interesting.There is a question I’ve always wondered about which is mentioned here, but not explained. We now have images of single atoms. In fact, I’ve seen pictures of atoms spelling IBM. All well and good (although I am rather surprised it didn’t spell Coke). But I’ve always wondered how this is possible given the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that we can’t know both the position and velocity of a particle with absolute certainty, I’d have thought a photo of an atom would violate that.All the same, this book presents lots of material on many fascinating topics in a way that is very accessible (no maths required). My favourite was a discussion on how to point a star that is collapsing to form a black hole so that it becomes a kind of huge gamma ray weapon. I mean, you’d really have to hate the people you were aiming it at. I would say that to go to all that trouble you would really have to hate them rather a lot. Presumably they would need to be responsible for Vogon poetry or something equally atrocious. "
6,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354369-john-stevens,5,"Dr. Michio Kaku is perhaps the or one of the most brilliant minds in theoretical physics living today. I've seen him present several concepts and theories on the Discovery Channel. I am a man who truly appreciates the marvel of theoretical physics. The stuff of Albert Einstein. Although I have some education along these lines and have watched and read quite a lot, I still find it very difficult to follow.In this book/audio book, Dr. Kaku takes us on a journey into all of those ""sci-fi sciences"" we've witnessed on Star Trek and the like. He helps the lay person to understand what is or is not ""potentially"" possible in accordance with the laws and theories of physics that are most accepted today.It is a real pleasure to take this journey if you are, in the least, a sci-fi reader or a geek who gets excited by science. That's me!If you're going to attempt reading in this direction I highly recommend this as a good starting place.John"
7,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4,"Description: A fascinating exploration of the science of the impossible—from death rays and force fields to invisibility cloaks—revealing to what extent such technologies might be achievable decades or millennia into the future.One hundred years ago, scientists would have said that lasers, televisions, and the atomic bomb were beyond the realm of physical possibility. In Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent the technologies and devices of science fiction that are deemed equally impossible today might well become commonplace in the future.From teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals—and the limits—of the laws of physics as we know them today. He ranks the impossible technologies by categories—Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never. In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains:· How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day enable us to bend light around an object, like a stream flowing around a boulder, making the object invisible to observers “downstream”· How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars· How telepathy and psychokinesis, once considered pseudoscience, may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology· Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build oneKaku uses his discussion of each technology as a jumping-off point to explain the science behind it. An extraordinary scientific adventure, Physics of the Impossible takes readers on an unforgettable, mesmerizing journey into the world of science that both enlightens and entertains.

9,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,3,"I was never promised a flying car.What I mean to say is that my generation was never the generation of flying cars. We grew up knowing better. It’s been seventy years since we started breaking open atomic nuclei to harness their incredible capacity for destruction and creation, and we are still sucking fossilized plants from the bowels of the Earth and lighting it on fire as fuel. My parents grew up watching men go to the moon. I grew up watching NASA’s budget bleeding out on the table, their shuttle fleet slowly becoming more obsolete and decrepit until it was only a matter of time that Challenger repeated itself. The euphoric spirit of technological progress that had so long balanced its darker fear of nuclear apocalypse waned, its promises seemingly hollow.Of course, that’s not to say that my generation hasn’t been promised things, or that we haven’t been promised good things. Global warming and economic recession aside, we’re being told that computers are going to continue to shrink and become more mobile. Wearable computing is just around the corner (hello, Google Glass). My car might not fly, but it will probably drive itself. And, if Kurzweill and his buddies are right (they probably aren’t), we will either be immortal or computer uploads by the middle of the century, so hey, how bad can it get?I say this all just to underscore the constant tension between what we have now and what we might have, what we envision as our future for science and technology. This is an entire academic field, one that is as important as it is dangerous in the sense that nothing it says can really be trusted, but we ignore what it says at our own peril. Futurists are increasingly valuable, because it seems like Gibson is right about the future already being here, just not evenly distributed—but they are human, like the rest of us, and fallible, prone to overexcitement and unable, sometimes, to step back from something in which they’ve invested so much time and energy.I wouldn’t necessarily call Michio Kaku a futurist, but sometimes he plays one in books. Physics of the Impossible is his stab at categorizing certain things that are impossible now but might not remain that way forever. For example, the type of teleportation you see on Star Trek won’t be putting airlines out of business any time soon—but does teleportation really go ""against"" the laws of physics, or is our technology and understanding of physics just not there yet? In this way, Kaku distinguishes between things that we might be able to do in the next century or so, things we might be able to do in the next few millennia when we grow up, and things that we won’t ever be able to do unless our understanding of physics drastically alters. These Class I, II, and III impossibilities form the backbone for the structure of a book that is a mixture of physics lecture, geeky enthusiasm for cutting-edge tech, and optimism for the boundless ingenuity of the human species.Kaku’s classification approach is a very useful one. We bandy about the word “impossible” quite often. The lay public, the scientifically-literate public, and the scientist public all seem to have different ideas about what it might mean, much like the confusion over the “theory” of evolution or “law” of gravity. Is anything really impossible? (The answer is yes, things that are logically impossible, but that is a much smaller domain than what we generally refer to when listing impossibilities.) Kaku has taken the time to give “impossible” a more well-formed definition that we can actual use. In this way, even if one’s understanding of physics is quite limited, one gets a better sense of the relative difficulty of creating or harnessing some of these phenomena.The book contains ten Class I impossibilities, three Class II, and two Class III. The first category includes such things as teleportation, telepathy, and psychokinesis. From this, it’s clear that Kaku is either using a very loose definition of “within a century” or is incredibly optimistic about our how much progress we’ll make in the next century. Think “best case scenario”. In some cases, such as with telepathy and psychokinesis, Kaku doesn’t so much explain possible physics approaches as point to existing technology (brain-computer interfaces) and upcoming research (brain-mapping projects) and enthuse about how much we’ll probably learn in the next few decades. Hmm. In other cases, such as with force fields and invisibility, he seems to present the challenges of replicating what we see in Star Trek and other science fiction much more realistically. While this might not be as reassuring, I definitely find it more interesting.I learned lots of interesting tidbits about physics from this book. I love reading books about physics, although lately the more I read, the less I feel I understand. Quantum physics is just so weird—and yes, I know that if this is the way the universe actually works, then technically that makes quantum physics the ultimate standard of normality. However, it’s still weird, OK? And the more you learn, the weirder it gets, until you’re so far down the rabbithole it doesn’t matter how many blue pills you take; you’re not going home, Alice.Physics of the Impossible is a little more “pop sci” than many of the other physics books I’ve been reading lately, such as 
The Universe Within
. There is only one equation in this book, and it’s one you’ve all seen: E = mc². Kaku doesn’t go into too many concepts in depth—he tosses out certain facts that I was able to accept, because I’ve been exposed to these ideas in other books, but they might cause another person to doubletake. I think it’s asking a little much to expect him to give in-depth treatises on all the concepts he touches upon, though. There’s just so many. It’s one of those situations where, if something intrigues you or confuses you, you should seek out a book specifically about that subject. Since this book is lighter on a lot of the explanation, I suspect that many more people will find it accessible.My favourite fact is one I have not, as far as I remember, seen mentioned before: antimatter is actually just ordinary matter travelling back in time. How cool is that? And as a corollary, it’s possible that our entire universe is just a single electron travelling back and forth through time infinitely many times.And you know what, I get so frustrated with technology sometimes. Some days I feel like I’m living in the future. Other days I wonder why everyone else seems so happy with their mobile devices while mine chug along at a sluggish pace. But maybe it doesn’t matter if I never get a flying car, or self-driving car for that matter. Sometimes, it’s reward enough just to learn the true depths of the weird and wondrous place that is our universe. Kaku definitely captures that here, and he does it in a way that is both edifying and gratifying.

10,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7733394-muhammad,4,"How often do you wonder about The Future? Can you conceive of the technologies people are going to use in the next millennium? Or is it at all conceivable? Is the ever growing ‘Technology Monster’ finally going to define or explain ‘every’ phenomenon around us some time in the far future? What about super intelligent extraterrestrials? Do they really exist? Are they going to invade us like the Hollywood ones? Can humans use psychokinesis in their regular lives as Jean Grey does in the X-Men comic books? Is a speed faster than light ever be attainable? Can we travel through time and alter the course of history? Is it at all possible to unveil what’s going on in the other universes (considering the idea they really do exist)? Are robots going to be so intelligent that someday ‘Terminator’ becomes a reality? Are these all going to happen or they are just fancy theories written on paper only, practically being impossible? If possible, then how long we have to wait? Few centuries? Millennium? Or may be Millions of years? Well, the answers my friend, are NOT blowing in the wind! Trillions, may be quadrillions, may be even larger number of phenomena are still left to be explained. With each discovery, more questions are popping up. We’re completely in the darkness about the technology of nature and the night is yet too young! The use of science since the last couple of centuries has taken us to a somewhat considerable point. But how many miles must we walk to meet these (at least some of these) ‘impossibilities’, is a matter of great debate. You have to know precisely where our science course is set to and where we are standing now for making such ‘predictions’. Michio Kaku, the Henry Semat Professor of Theoretical Physics at the City College of New York, tries to answer these questions from a physicist’s point of view and draws a possible outline when should these impossibilities turn into ‘almost’ everyday regularities. Being a human, if the rapid progression of science makes you wonder about what are the technologies individuals of your species are going to enjoy in the far, far future, this book is for you! The organization of the book is excellent. Kaku divides the book into three parts according to the classes of the impossibilities (Class I, Class II and Class III). These impossibilities are, of course, impossible with respect to our current time frame. The Class I impossibilities (invisibility, teleportation, telepathy, psychokinesis, robots etc.) are the technologies that are not feasible today but they obey the laws of physics. They might be possible in this century, or perhaps the next. Class II impossibilities (faster than light, time travel and parallel universes) are the ones that “sit at the very edge of our understanding of the physical world.” They may be understood on a scale of millennia to millions of years. The final category is the Class III impossibilities (perpetual motion machines and precognition) which violate the laws of physics. “If they turn out to be possible, they would represent a fundamental shift in our understanding of physics”-Kaku’s remark on the Class III ones. Starting from 1960’s Star Trek to modern days’ Eternal Sunshine on The Spotless Mind, the book refers to various TV serials, movies and sci-fi/ fantasy books. Apparently, the movie directors and the storywriters from the old days were far more’ visionary’ than scientists for they pictured the impossible happenings decades earlier while scientists have started taking these into account only in the recent days (human brain’s Imaginative part prevails maybe?!) From pop culture items to pure scientific field, the book declares quite a large realm of itself and these references made the read a very enjoying one. Kaku’s explanations raised some ‘philosophical’ thoughts in my mind as well. For thousands of years people have been dreaming of teleportation, psychokinesis, precognition, telepathy or extraterrestrials. These have been the cores of the fairy tales. If these impossibilities are made possible someday, will it draw a conclusion to the fairy tales? In these days you certainly won’t like to hear a fairy tale about a prince who uses an hp laptop with internet connection, as they are too trivial today! There’s absolutely no fun hearing this story. In the far future, when precognition is achieved, would children want to read the stories about precognition? Who knows? On a different note, I think this book could be a great influence for aspiring sci-fi writers. A writer with enough imagination can take lots of information and ideas from this book. Keeping all the nice words aside, let’s point out that the book has some lacking as well! A popular science book without a single diagram is something I find ‘odd’. Any scientific paper, book, dissertation or thesis needs lots and lots of diagrams for making the ideas clear which this book didn’t address. When Kaku talked about quantum mechanics or matter-antimatter annihilation, the lack of figures really made me stumble on the letters. For making the book a little vague for me sometimes, I am ‘penalizing’ Kaku 1 star, and this is the explanation of a 4 star out of 5. ‘Prediction’ is always a tricky business and often improvident too! One prediction goes wrong and people will start hurling stones. Running the risk of ‘being proven wrong’, Michio Kaku did a splendid job. Things that he understands easily being a physicist are not very digestible for regular people and Kaku's attempt to make it digestible is appreciable. Surely Kaku deserves an applaud. P.S: Before starting each chapter, Kaku mentions one or two quotations by famous people from different walks of life. I couldn’t resist the temptation to pick some of them and re-mention them here in this review! (The last two ones are mentioned as a mean of sarcasm!) “If at first an idea does not sound absurd, then there is no hope for it”-Albert Einstein .“If you haven’t found something strange during the day, it hasn’t been much of a day.”- John Wheeler “Either we are alone in the universe, or we are not. Either thought is frightening” –Arthur C. Clarke“Radio has no future. Heavier-than- air flying machines are impossible. X-ray will prove to be a hoax”-Physicist Lord Kelvin, 1890“The (atomic) bomb will never go off. I speak as an expert in explosives”- Admiral William Leahy "

The title fairly screams at us. And I was joking.This is truly an amazing book. I have been one of the hardened admirers of Kaku ever since reading his absolutely awesome book 'Hyperspace'. This book only enhanced his reputation, as far as I'm concerned.In the inimitable 'Preface' Kaku segregates the 'futuristic' physics into three different classes of impossibilities.Class I impossibilities include several things that have been popularised through books and films. They include Force Fields (Star Trek), Phasers and Death Stars (Star Trek), Robots, UFO-s, Antimatter etc. Kaku describes the physical concepts behind these impossibilities, mercifully avoiding the mathematics involved. He states that these are definitely possible according to the laws of physics known to us, and might be achieved in this or the next century.Class II impossibilities include Time Machine, Hyperspatial travel etc. These, according to the author, may become possible several millennia in the future.Class III impossibilities include technologies that violate the laws of Physics, like Perpetual Motion Machine or Precognition— which may never be possible.After reading this book I'm fairly convinced that Kaku is THE author to read before we either procrastinate or get euphoric whenever something new gets splashed across the screen. We may not understand a single thing about String Theory as the Theory of Everything, but he actually knows his stuff.Highly recommended."

Sure, it's not a text book, but I would have liked to have seen equations or at least references to something that could explain the math. Also, while there is a TARDIS on the cover, there is no TARDIS, and no mention of Doctor Who at all in the book. I felt slightly cheated, but not enough to not give it a five star rating.

I was impressed enough with his talk to order a couple of his books, this one among them.He divides phenomena into 3 levels of the impossible. Class I impossibilities are those that are ""impossible today but that do not violate the known laws of physics."" Examples would include teleportation, antimatter engines and ""certain forms of telepathy, psychokinesis and invisibility.""Class II phenomena include those that ""sit at the very edge of our understanding of the physical world"" and include time machines, travel through wormholes and hyperspace travel. The final category, III, includes ""technologies that violate the known laws of physics"" and include precognition and perpetual motion machines.I thoroughly enjoyed the references to Star Wars movies, Star Trek episodes and various pieces of well known science fiction literature.If you are the type who enjoys mind benders like ""... the true secret of anti-matter: it's just ordinary matter going backward in time"" and who can get excited about the LISA program scheduled for next year which ""consists of 3 satellites circling the sun, arranged in a triangle, each connected by laser beams 3 million miles long ...orbiting the sun about 30 million miles from earth ... able to detect vibrations to within one part in a billion trillion, about 1/100th the size of an atom"" in search of gravity waves, then this is probably a book you will enjoy.

I liked it very much, but I didn't feel that interested in all those ray guns, death stars and light sabres. The second and the third part of the book were more like ""Parallel Worlds"", exploring the very edge of theoretical physics and its impact on our understanding of the reality - and these parts I liked much better. I can't say I've understood everything, but even the phantom of the picture is bewildering."
16,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9514172-huda,5,"i love love love this book.There, I had to say that first before I get anything else out. Searching for the right person to talk to me about science has proven difficult, and I probably didn't even know it was difficult to connect to an author on this subject before I got to know Michio Kaku. In Physics of the Impossible, readers will explore possibilities of sci-fi features in real-time. So they would be questions like: how close are we to building a force field? Is invisibility actually possible? And can we successfully embark on an interstellar voyage? What he does is categorise these 'impossibilities', from inventions that would take decades to build, to leaps of science that would take centuries to fulfil. What makes it so special to me is the very approach used. Michio Kaku is an optimistic child where sci-fi is concerned -- something I think takes a real purist to be able to defend against time. I get the idea that most scientists, the deeper they get in calculations and theories, become more prone to dismiss ideas as impossible, because so much is riding on a conjecture alone. Humiliation among peers, the domino-effect of one theory proven wrong, positions, etc., all these factors can weigh down considerably on a scientist's pure ambition to discover scientific truth. That's why I think the optimism I see in Physics of the Impossible is a treasure -- it's an ambition unsullied. Also, I read a book on Quantum Physics before I got to this, and although I'm pretty sure the book was simplified enough, I vowed to get something more 'elementary' in order to understand the subject. Michio Kaku had a wonderful gage on how to convey ideas to the masses, neither pandering nor caught up on his own interest. He wants you to know there are exciting things happening in the field, that there are players with interesting lives outside their contributions and what great things he thinks we can look forward to in the future. One vivid moment I had while reading was when the ending of Men in Black was mentioned. It was a scene I remember well, because at the time I liked the idea so much, but I didn't know what to do with it. So carrying the memory of that scene until today, I end up in a giddy mess when it was pointed out in the book. Here's the clip: Men in Black EndingI must be entirely biased, but everything about this book is interesting. From its characterisation of other scientists, timeline of discoveries or even all the movie spoilers it provides, Michio Kaku is my favourite professor now."

He is the co-founder of string field theory (a branch of string theory), and continues Einstein’s search to unite the four fundamental forces of nature into one unified theory.Imagine that!This book of his starts by outlining three classes of impossibilities:Class 1 - impossible today but that don't violate the known laws of physics (teleportation, anti-matter engines, telepathy, psychokinesis, & invisibility)Class 2 - stuff that's at the frontiers of our understanding of the physical world (time machines, hyperspace travel, wormhole travel)Class 3 - technologies that violate the known laws of physics or would represent a fundamental shift in our understanding of physics (perpetual motion machines & precognition). It was a bit of bummer when he told me that on an inter-galactic, multi-dimensional and trans-chronological scale, the human race has only reached the point of being a class zero civilisation where class one civilisations can control and harvest the entire power of their planet, class two the power of their sun and class three the power of their whole galaxy!Class Zero! That sounds like Coke Zero, only without cool metal container that you can cut the top off and use as a tiny plant-pot.I love reading about all this sciency/geeky stuff and this book is clever and it ties in Science Fiction movies, so what's not to like; but here's a better idea for a book - 'Things That Were Impossible When The Human Race Was Still Competing With Sabre-Tooth Tigers For Food But Are Now For Sale In Your Local Shopping Centre'.My head got swooped upon by a helicopter-buzzy-thingy (no, that's not the official name if you want to buy one) in Designer Outlet in York at the weekend and just for a moment I pictured myself roaring like a T-Rex, snatching it out of the sky with my feeble forepaws and then crushing it with my gigantic, razor-sharp dinosaur jaws!!Thankfully, I just managed to restrain myself.But just think - all of this helicopter-buzzy-thingy stuff would have been impossible not long back.Look how far we've come!(ok - yeah, I'm being ironic again)"

I follow his website from time to time to see what different discoveries he makes every day. Physics Of The Impossible is a novel that requires some background knowledge and understanding of physics to truly get what he is saying. This book had example after example after example of all of the different things they said we would NEVER be able to do as a human race and just a decade or so later we are doing far more than what scientists said was impossible. Basically it applies the same way today on the different things we may consider as impossible, you never really know if something is impossible or not because over time things could change. Kaku does a great job illustrating that point while still keeping a level head. The coolest part about this book in my opinion is the concept of time travel. Time travel sounds so ridiculous and out of the question at this day and age but there are many notable scientists that agree with Kaku when he says it's not a probability; it's more of a ""when?"". That thought puts chills down my spine. Definitely recommend. "

I say this because there have been plenty of times that stuff believed to be true were disproved years down the line, e.g. the Sun rotating around the Earth versus the reverse. I'm glad to see that I understand most of these things, so I didn't go through school for nothing. The author speculates that the future can hold many wonderful things that will, like all the breakthroughs so far, change our lives completely. He does this by basing everything on known fact, but also assuming that future discoveries will open up new avenues of research and development. He is optimistic about the future, so he is clearly a supporter of science and believes that the future can make our lives better."

There is no scientific value to this book. It is a fanciful weave of outright scientific untruth, confusing metaphors, and semantic diarrhea. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!"
23,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence,3,"Michio Kaku is nothing if not optimistic. Is there anything currently in the realm of SF that we cannot do (in some fashion), eventually? Apparently not. Even perpetual motion and precognition may be possible with a better understanding of our universe (or multiverse). In Physics of the Impossible, Kaku, theoretical physicist and one of the developers of string theory, looks at some of the common technologies found in SF and discusses – in a very general and user-friendly way – whether or not they are possible and when they might be achieved.He divides these technologies into three categories. Class I impossibilities are advances that our current physical model can accommodate but not our current technology; however, they will be available within the next century or so. An example of this is the force field (chapter 1). The force fields of “Star Trek” or the Culture are unlikely but scientists have been experimenting with things that could produce similar results. Kaku focuses on two. The plasma window, invented by Ady Herschovitch in 1995, and magnetic levitation, which we already have in a limited way. The window is a plane of plasma shaped by electromagnetic fields. Theoretically, an envelope could be created that separates atmosphere from vacuum, useful in airlocks and certain manufacturing processes like electron beam welding. And it is possible to envision supercharged plasma windows, part of a layered defense system, vaporizing incoming objects (the other two layers would be a laser curtain and a carbon nanotube screen). We already use magnetic levitation (maglev) to move trains at high speeds. If we can develop high-temperature superconductors, we would have the capability to cheaply create powerful magnetic fields that would open the door to true flying vehicles (or even flying belts) or the floating cities of Niven’s Ringworld (though their ultimate fate might give us pause in that particular application).Class II impossibilities are also advances conceivable within our current understanding of physics but require technologies far beyond what we’re capable of and probably impossible for civilizations of less-than-interstellar scope (see NOTE below). An example of a Class II impossibility is faster-than-light (FTL) travel. In the chapter “Faster Than Light,” Kaku discusses physicists’ attempts to get around Einstein’s light-speed barrier. For example, in 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed a “warp drive” (see the Wiki entry) capable of producing an effect that stretched space behind a theoretical starship and contracted it before the vessel. Unfortunately, it depends upon utilizing negative matter (whose existence has yet to be proven) or negative energy (whose existence was detected as early as 1948 but which exists in such small known quantities and exerts such little force as to be useless). Worm holes offer another avenue to FTL travel but they too depend upon manipulating enormous quantities of negative matter or negative energy (Kaku points out that we would need a particle accelerator 10-light-years long to achieve the minimum energies necessary to create a usable worm hole). And even if humanity becomes capable of using such exotic material or generating such enormous energies, it’s unclear that stable worm holes could be created or that the radiation produced wouldn’t destroy anything trying to enter them.Class III impossibilities are technologies that can’t exist with our current understanding of physics and may well be truly impossible. But – and it’s a big but (sorry) – if/when we develop a better theory, even the impossible may become reality. In this category Kaku places the perpetual-motion machine, which has been pursued by charlatans as well as serious scientists for centuries (our author traces the first recorded PMM to eighth century AD Bavaria). Dark energy, though, holds out the possibility – if physicists can unravel the mystery of how much is there and where does it come from – of a technology that uses this zero-point energy to develop machines with essentially unlimited power (e.g., Iain Bank’s Culture novels).Overall, Physics of the Impossible is OK. I round up to three stars because I’m a science geek and I want to believe we are headed for the bright future Kaku imagines. I do have problems with the book. The first is purely one of content. Kaku covers a lot of ground in only a little more than 300 pages and gives short shrift to many of his topics. I found this particularly galling in the chapter on time travel (“only” a Class II impossibility according to him), where he throws out the idea that anti-matter is matter traveling backwards in time without much in the way of context. Admittedly, many of these concepts are difficult to conceptualize and notoriously difficult to analogize but I think Kaku often rushes through his explanations and falls short in making them understandable to the reader.The second problem I have with the book is a philosophical one. Somewhere in Physics of the Impossible Kaku writes of the highly advanced civilization of the future as one that has transcended fundamentalism, tribalism, racism and all the other plagues that are ravaging our world but it is unclear how this will be achieved or even why it would be achieved simply through technical advance. Nevertheless, Kaku believes that continued progress in technology and knowledge will miraculously bring this about but is unclear on the details. Considering humanity’s record so far, it’s not at all certain that it’s possible. Why should it follow that a highly advanced civilization is a highly enlightened one? Why should we be hopeful that technology will create a Utopia rather than a police state? Why should we be hopeful that a civilization that can handle 10 billion billion times more energy than ours won’t use it malevolently (at least from our point of view – I refer you to Clarke’s Childhood’s End)?Or why should we assume that technical advances will come in these particular areas? It may be that overpopulation, resource depletion and climate change will focus humans on an entirely different range of technologies, delaying further physical and cosmological exploration. And possibly precluding it since a post-industrial, post-capitalist, post-fossil fuel world may have entirely different priorities.In the end I have no real answer to my quandary. It’s terrifying to see how we treat each other and what we’re (potentially) capable of doing to ourselves and this planet with the limited technology we have. Yet…outside of resorting to the Battlestar Galactica solution (watch the series finale), it’s by mastering the technology we have and developing further innovations that we have any hope of saving ourselves and preserving an advanced society. And even then, it’ll be a crap shoot if we don’t have some concomitant advances in the areas of social and economic organization (subjects about which I have opinions as well but which fall outside of the scope of this review and of this book).I’ve only touched on a single example from each of the book’s three sections. Kaku also explores the possibility of invisibility, death rays, teleportation, robots and starships, and parallel universes, among others in an engaging and contagiously optimistic (at least while you’re reading it) manner, and I would recommend it to the science geek or anyone who hopes one day that there really will be a Captain Kirk (or – probably better – a Captain Picard) “going boldly where no one has gone before.”______________________________NOTE: Kaku assumes the reader is familiar with a number of concepts. One of which is Kardashev’s Scale, which – broadly speaking – measures the technological level of a civilization based on its energy use (see the Wiki entry). Briefly, it goes like this:Type 0: Civilizations use less than the total energy output of a planet (us, barely).Type I: Civilizations use the energy output of a planet (according to Kaku, us in another century or two).Type II: Civilizations use the energy output of a sun.Type III: Civilizations use the energy output of a galaxy.Elaborations on the theory have carried the original classifications further – Type IVs are intergalactic in nature and Type V civilizations merrily jump from universe to universe."

I always said so. —J. B. S. HALDANE, 1963This is book basically deals with the concept of ""Impossibility"", and arrive at the conclusion that impossibility is a relative concept. Throughout history, notable scientists labeled things impossible, only to be realized in a relatively short time. For example :one of the most prominent scientist of the 19th century, declared that "" heavier than air"" devices, such as airplanes were impossible. Others claimed that atomic bombs and black holes were laughable stretches of the imagination that might fit into sci-fi novels but surely have no place in the real world. So when we label something impossible today, we have to be very careful.In this book, the author divided the things that are impossible into three categories:1. Class I impossibility :They are technologies that are impossible to achieve with today's standards, however they do not violate the laws of physics, and should be achievable in the next century or so in one form or the other, they include: teleportation, antimatter engines and telepathy to list a few.2. Class II impossibility: these are technologies that do not violate the laws of physics, however our understanding of them is not complete. If they are possible at all, we will need millions of years to achieve them. Time machines and wormholes fall into this category.3. Class III impossibility : these ideas violate the known laws of physics, they very few ( surprisingly) and can only be achieved if our fundamental understanding of physics is changed,so possible ( it had happened before) but highly unlikely.To get a clearer view of what that means, he also classified the type of civilizations needed to achieve certain technologies so we have:Type I civilizations: these civilizations can harness all the energy on their planet, be it sunlight, wind, volcanoes or earthquakes.Type II civilizations: to get there, we need to be able to harness all of the sun's energy. A type 2 civilization is 10 billion times more powerful than a type 1 civilization.and finally a Type III civilization: these guys can utilize the energy on an entire galaxy, and they are 10 billion times more powerful than a type 2 civilization.Just to put that in perspective: we are a type 0 civilization.The book itself deals with these three types of technologies, it is a very interesting , but be warned, there is a ton of science involved in the explanation, I had to read a few paragraph a couple of times to fully understand. So if you are not really that much into science, specifically physics, then I wouldn't recommend it. On the other hand if you are a nerd like me, I'm sure you will enjoy it."

I was thus pleasantly surprised that his personality is not prominently on display in his writing. In Physics of the Impossible Kaku examines the plausibility of futuristic technology that we’re familiar with through science fiction books and films. He categorizes them into three types of impossibilities:Class I impossibilities – Technologies that are impossible today, but that do not violate the known laws of physics. Class II impossibilities – Technologies at the very edge of our understanding of the physical world, possibly taking thousands or millions of years to become available.Class III impossibilities – Technologies that violate the known laws of physics.Topics examined include such things as: force fields, invisibility, phasers and other beam weapons, teleportation, telepathy, telekinesis, interstellar space travel, artificial general intelligence, time travel, space elevators, and others. The format of the book is to take an impossible technology, then examine the current science with respect to that technology and possible ways in which it might be developed in the future to produce the thing in question. The nice thing about this approach is that Kaku spends much of the book reviewing the science and state of the art technologies that pertain the various subjects discussed. It should be noted that the ‘state of the art’ in question was that available more than a decade ago (2007) when the book was written. Although the science has progressed since that time, have no fear, the book is still relevant given that the impossible technologies are still impossible today. On the downside … all of the cool stuff he discusses is still impossible today. I’ll take minor exception with one point. In the epilogue Kaku states that, while these things are currently impossible, physicists are making new discoveries all the time thus IMPLYING that there may be a mysterious force waiting to be discovered out there that will give us say … force fields (note: to be fair, he doesn’t explicitly state this, so I may be reading into it somewhat). However, as physicist Sean Carrol has written “the laws underlying the physics of everyday life are completely understood”, meaning - we know about all the forces that act on a macro scale. We can therefore conclude that such a discovery is unlikely to happen since, if any such a force existed, it would already have made itself known to us. I'm therefore not going to hold my breath on this one."

I'll read more of his books for sure."
31,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936988-jake-buchanan,5," When you think of a high school science fair, I'm sure memories of Baking Soda volcanoes and potato light bulbs come racing to mind. Kaku had a different plan; he built an Atom smasher (also called a particle accelerator) in his basement. This led him on the fast track to a successful life as a theoretical physicist, popularizing science for much of the public eye. Kaku has done this by appearing on many television shows, hosting talk radio shows, and even writing books. In Michio Kaku's 2008 book ""Physics of the Impossible"", Kaku theorizes ways for the most popular ideas of science fiction into their most realistic concepts. Physics of the Impossible is laid out in a way that makes it easy for just about anyone to pick up and start reading. It is split into 3 sections, Class I Impossibilities, are ""technologies that are impossible today, but that do not violate the known laws of physics."" These could take a few hundred years to develop, but are foreseeable in the future. Class II Impossibilities are “technologies that sit at the very edge of our understanding of the physical world,"" and therefore are only realistic thousands to millions of years from now. Lastly, Class III Impossibilities are “technologies that violate the known laws of physics."" and would require all that we know about the laws of physics to go through immense change. In each of these sections are the subsections of the book, where the specific topic at hand is discussed. These topics consist of robots, time travel, force fields, going faster than light, parallel universes, perpetual motion, and much more.  In ""Physics of the Impossible"", Kaku lays out not only the most talked about things in science fiction, but he explains about how they would realistically work. He realizes that, for example, force fields come in varying states and theories. He then makes his own theory, and explains how it would be most probably made and used effectively. And that's what he does for the next 300 pages. Kaku does a great job on explaining the theories, where they came from, and how they would work realistically. The entire time you read the book you feel that Kaku is knowledgeable, that he know's exactly what he is talking about. This book is not specifically written for physics majors, nor is it dumbed down to the point where you feel as if you knew all the material prior to reading. Anyone with a thirst for knowledge or enjoys science fiction would love this book and I highly recommend it."

Dr. Kaku is one of the most prolific physicists on the modern age. In ""Physics of the Impossible"" he explores the realistic possibilities of the science fiction of today becoming the science fact in the not too distant future.In fact, for the most part, the stuff of sci-fi novels will not only become the fodder for tomarrow's non-fiction novels but the fiction may be near childs play as to what the future holds in store for us. Your mind will explode as the possibilites of space and time travel become real in ways you may not realize. More often then not Dr. Kaku reveals we are closer then the general public may even realize.Even when the truely impossible is presented, Dr. Kaku reveals the pathways we must travel (over hundred and thousands of years) in order to get there. For expample, time travel is disucssed as a very real possibility. We know how to do it we lack the ENERGY needed to do it. Wild!For the most part, Micio Kaku is masterful at putting very very detailed physical science into laymans terms that the average joe can understand. However, there are times where I just couldn't wrap my mind around the concepts being destribed. It did not turn me off, I was able to barely grasp the concepts and read through it in a haze. Those moments were few and far between and should be expected when discussing deep physical concepts.This book was the catalyst for the television series Sci-Fi Science. If you enjoy that show or mythbusters or any similar types of programs this book is for you. Of course if your a future science buff this is also essential reading."
33,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/699202-tom,3,"They speak only the truth when the haters call string theorist Michio Kaku desperately nutty but none who believes this would then impute him for writing a bad book. And good news for the equation-phobes as Dr. Kaku stays well clear of his pet subject in Physics of the Impossible, excepting a flip riposte to the current backlash against string theory in the final chapter (but if you're interested in the world of vibrating strings after all, I would recommend skipping The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene and picking up Kaku's Hyperspace instead). The last section of the book, ""Class III Impossibilities"", was the big galling letdown because, in these bubblegum science books, there really always is one. You would see how predictable this is by scanning your surroundings and noting the miserable non-occurrence of lightsabers, babel fish and flying skateboards but, paradoxically, this third class of impossibility (violations of the known laws of physics) covers a mere two ideas. Isn't that nice? Well, we can easily blame ourselves for not having, even, the things that are possible to have. Or did you think a species which still believes in the Trinity deserves a flying car that can collapse into a briefcase? Just shrug and say we wouldn't know what to do with one of those."
34,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60270-khalid,4,"This book is one of the best books in science. The approach the author follows is really interesting. He would take things that are available in science fiction, and discuss how they can be possible in real life, using real physics. He starts with attainable things, until he gets to the really impossible things.This book gives you a very interesting perspective on physics, and is definitely worth reading for any science fiction enthusiast. Part of what I read from it is that science fiction writers are often visionary scientists. They build the imagination, that sometimes drives real scientists to find real discoveries.It is really great also if you plan to write a science fiction novel one day, it gives you the scientific background necessary. I would have to say, however, that the book started getting out of hand for me when it started discussing the more impossible stuff and how to attain them, and it started taking more stretches before actually getting to the point. If the author had taken more time in these parts and explained them more thoroughly, it'd have been more entertaining and beneficial."
35,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31094906-caleb,4,"Given that I'm relatively new to the scientific world, I found all of this book to be entirely fascinating. It introduced me to the world of technology that may indeed be possible some day like time travel machines, force fields, psychokinesis. The list goes on. Most of it was presented so that a fairly intelligent reader can understand, but there were, however, some parts that could use a little clarification for those who aren't as scientifically educated. Kaku never goes too in depth on any one subject either and leaves out the confusing (and perhaps boring) mathematics that often follows physics. All in all, I recommend this book for anyone looking for a book that aptly sums up the problems facing modern scientists."
36,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1678839-cindy,4,"I scanned some pages because it was just beyond my understanding - but I really don't mind that. I still got the basics of what Kaku was sharing, which is the status of the Star Wars/Star Trek gizmos, gadgets, weapons, and transportation possibilities. If you'd like to know how close we are to ""warp speed"", time travel, light sabers, etc. - I'd recommend this book. And really, it was very few pages that I had to skim. Kaku makes most of this very accessible - even to a science baby like me.My friends Tom, Diana, and Jerry and I went to hear Kaku speak in Hobbs, NM a few weeks ago. He's great in person too."

I absolutely love sci-fi whther its books, television shows or movies, so for me this book was like a smorgasbord of food for the brain!It used real science to discuss how typical things found in science fiction could or could not be possible. So if you've ever wondered if Stargates are real or if we may someday be able to fire those photon torpedoes, I suggest you get a copy of this book and sit down for a nice fulfilling read! I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
38,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12709965-tyler,4,This book caught my attention. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about physics and the future of new discoveries. It is a good tool to use for learning history on science. It would also help anyone who wants to know about new technology. This book would be for young adults and older. It is a hard book to understand. Background in physics helps you to understand what is happening.

I felt like a kid all over again, when I found out why some of the most awesome things in science fiction can/cannot be possible. Some of the ideas were things I'd known from my high school physics, but a lot of the content was genuinely interesting."
42,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8612497-hannes-vermeulen,5,"To categorize inventions and discoveries in a scale of possibility offers a real genuine viewing point that feels so reminisced to the star-trek enterprise series that coloured my childhood philosophical and physical thought and fantasy.Funny thing is that most topics of this book I already explored in my many ponderings and daydreams, but I was really impressed by the connections made by Michio in this book.But I feel something missing; I cannot point my finger on it; but while listening to the audio version I could stop but pondering that the necessary evolution in physics needed while have need of revolutions in other sciences first.Not in the least there will have to come some breakthroughs in mathematics and logics; upto the scale of a paradigm switch non the less; but more importantly, to even grasp the knowledge and consequently add and process it, we will need a new form of handling this knowledge.Something we must not loose out of sight is the fact the in the near future Moore's law will hit a brick wall or nano wall more exactly. While theories about quantum computing and such are already in their childhood, there will come a time when we cannot depend on doubling processing power every 18 months; hence we will not be able to use it at decadently as we do today.Which is a good thing, because this will spur thought and effort in actually writing better code and think about the logic that lays at the base of this. And compared to the advances we have made in physics, the progress of logics, semantics and syntaxes; or to call it in a whole our basic thought process, has gone at a much slower pass than the understanding of the world around us. And the culmination of physics and computer power have created a gap in the last couple of decades.to clarify the above paragraph a bit; we are still stuck in a Cartesian/Newtonian view on reality for the most part; while we desperately need to shift to a more dynamic way of system thinking.What with our today logic seems logical and an extrapolation of what we know; like multiverse, 10 or 11 dimensions; time travel, (pre) big bang time; the metaphors we use for particles, gravity and energies... will not suffice to get the deeper knowledge to reach beyond a type I civilisation.Our worldview (or universe view) now will bring us only so far; like the preNewtonian worldview only brought us so far back then.One of the more troubling realisations is that our thinking has not evolved much on answering the questions that the Ancient Greek philosophers asked over 2 millennia ago; without creating any as many new riddles or insights to be answered.It is like (here comes the point); we are close to answering most of the questions the pack of neurons, better known as our brain, can answer. Which brings me upto another realisation. In the book there is stated a believe held by many that a solution must be so easy that it can be visualized. Which from the biological point of view is funny; because great part of our brain centres around vision and understanding/patterning visual stimuli.Now, the sickly joke in this is; that deep inside we all are empirical deep at heart. This has the consequence that we have a hard grasping concepts that we cannot visualize in one sort of the other. Which would ultimately make us literally as meta-litteraly blind to anything we can not visualise in concept or metaphor.Now keep this in mind; and evaluate a statement written down millennia ago that states that the truth cannot be envisioned (seen) but only ""behold"" (behold without connotation to senses, a word the English language does not really have).It would be as the truth, the answer is intuitive and almost instinctive in nature so to speak, but cannot be converted to something visible of imaginative when dreaming with your eyes.--if you don't understand this, I might fail to communicate this properly, since most natural languages are build on vision/senses, and as such are not suitable to translate image-less thoughts--In the same way, mathematical and semantic paradoxes constructed by self reflection are actually fallacies created as a by-product of the immatureness of our natural and synthetic (read math, logic) languages.And when I stated in the second paragraph that we need a new way to handle this knowledge, we might need to construct a new kind of language altogether.Let us do a little thought experiment and imagine a stone which has all knowledge etched on it. Though the stone fits in your hand and only has a single symbol on it. Now that symbol in that theoretical language explains everything there is to know. But to understand that symbol, you must understand the language behind it. If you comprehend the language you know everything.Now imagine modern English as a language spoken by Neanderthals compared to that language. Now, tell me how will you explain the knowledge we have today to those Neanderthals in their language? In short you won't. Just like if you would read texts for an advanced civilisation you will not be able to decode them; since no stone of Rosetta could breach the gap in knowledge.that is what I feel is intuitively wrong with this book. It tells ideas and visions accepted and held as truth in some cases while their is no reason to do so.For example, time travel is based on the idea that time is a dimension or at least a dimensional arrow. But what if time is a kind of energy? If time is not just a constant and a derivative of calculations to understand something without being a ""physical thing"" or a ""reality thing"" more accurately.I won't explain a whole alternative theory of reality here; mostly for practical reasons but some things deserve some though; which are listed below.1.dimensional spaces can only exist in odd numbers and it is entirely likely that dimensions can only exist in a prime numbered group (3,5,7,11,13,..); any even number of dimension would stabilize and sort of cancel each-other out; while it is probable that any odd but not prime numbered group of dimensions would fall apart in dimensional groups of it prime factors.2.only three things exist; a 3 dimensional field of nothingness, time and a force. But these entities cannot be separated; it must be seen as space moving through itself in time to create all what is.Now in this paradigm time itself is more energy than time; it is actually both energy and time. It is actually two separate things but we have still failed to imagine the two concepts that make up time in relation to space.3.the concept of self awareness cannot be understand in today's languages and math because we'll end up with a self referencing paradox after deduction.Evenso the paradox between determinism and free will only exist in our current day logic.Once we find the logic that absolves both of the paradoxes, the answer to theory of everything will seem like a childs puzzle falling in place."
43,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9024615-tammam-aloudat,5,"I enjoyed this book immensely... it did answer many questions I had for a long time being an avid reader of science fiction and did so in a way that I could understand with my modest knowledge of physics, relativity, and quantum mechanics. Kaku divides impossibilities into three levels, the fist is practically a matter of time and the third requires changing the very laws of physics to achieve and then tells us how impossibilities can someday be achieved. I was delighted to know that many things from teleportation to star ships are theoretically possible and how science might come to achieve them. The sad part is none of us living today is likely going to live long enough to see any of those things in reality... What is funny is that the real level three impossiblities are perpetual motion machines and precognition. The first wont happen if the laws of thermodynamics hold and the second can somehow somewhat be perceived if physics change fundamentally. I am a little sad that precognition cannot exist, especially with how convincing Philip K. Dick makes it sound.The one downside to this is that I am not sure how much would be lost on someone who didn’t read anything before on relativity and quantum mechanics. I have very margianl understanding of the two despite having read multiple volumes on them and I missed some of what Kaku described despite him writing this for the lay person.The final thought, this was published before the large hadron collider (LHC) was operational in Geneva where I live. I would have loved to read Kaku’s thoughts on the fact that Higgs Boson was actually found now and how that affects, if at all, the possibility of a theory of everything."
44,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4543657-minh,4,"An absolutely fascinating book from Kaku, and one of my first dive into non-fiction that I totally glad I undertook. -  The way Kaku introduced each topic was absolutely accessible : we go from the very most basic physics topic to extremely advanced (first with the theory of light, electromagnetism... to the general theory of relativity and quantum physics).-  The book also successfully incorporate theories  and explain how they could be use to prove or disprove the potential for technologies we saw in science fiction films exist (teleportation, psychokinesis, black holes and time travelling). -  References : Kaku also made wonderful notes from other science fiction novels to use as definition concerning each topic, with references from H.G. Wells, Asimov, The Terminator, Lord of The Rings ...etc. and other countless amazing work of fictions. I fan-girl so hard when I saw a few works I've read are mentioned here - I did skip a few chapters that were not of interest to me, but the one that I was interest in never disappointed. My most recommended chapters are the Class II impossibilities, where Kaku attempted to explain Einstein's theory of space-time and how that affect time traveling and multiverses, but other chapters are just as equally good. -  Conclusion : As a non-physics major who dreaded math, this book is highly accessible, intriguing, and enlightening. I attempted to capture a skimmed version  here  (work in progress) as a TLDR for a few chapters in the book."

The others - not so much.I really enjoyed the parts about invisibility, time travel, telekinesis and faster than light travel.The ‘spaceship-UFO’ parts really bored me. I dunno, maybe because I am not a sci-fi fan.The main downside if this particular book is that it’s been released back in 2008, and a lot of the information there is old.

The reason for this is probably due to references to things that were in progress, or was going to happen in the near future, has now already happened. e.g. The Large Hadron Collider and other satellites / space telescopes.2. There is a large overload of scientific information/theory, delivered in a pretty boring way. The most exciting parts was when sci-fi books/movies were referenced. Having read other books like A Short History of Nearly Everything, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions. You have some overlap in content/concepts/theories that are delivered in a bit more fun/digestible way that this book.Not sure if this is due to listening to the audio book and the narration being a bit monotonous.Otherwise it is fun to hear that most of the sci-fi concepts currently known to us, whether through movies or books, might eventually become a reality.You are exposed to current limitations preventing some of the technologies, as well as advances that is needed to make them reality.Sometimes it goes on a bit of a tangent, and only when the conclusion is made at the end of a chapter that X is possible in X years, do you remember what they were trying to prove / disprove in the first place.Probably not everyone's cup of tea.

60,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/796216-tim,3,"This read was an experiment - not normally my type of reading for pleasure, rather truly meant as a read for growth and expansion. After all, who is against trying to expand the sphere of the subjects they read, and as a bonus, perhaps they'll learn something of value - science wise. Thus, Physics of the Impossible, written by a nice looking guy (back cover), Michio Kaku, who is the Henry Semat Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. As the introduction states, ""He is the cofounder of string theory ... has written several books including Parallel Worlds; Beyond Einstein; and Hyperspace - one of the best science books of the year as determined by the NY Times and the Washington Post.... Really, his resume is amazing - host of numerous documentaries on National Geographic and Discovery channels, a frequent guest on national TV and the BBC, and apparently has his own syndicated radio program.With an inviting style of writing, Kaku states the purpose of the book to bring the reader into a study of the impossible. As a child, he asked himself ""One day would it be possible to walk through walls? To build starships that can travel faster than the speed of light? To read other people's minds? ..."" similarly with robots, invisibility,time travel,etc. Kaku tantalizes the reader into the expectation that he or she will get a glimpse of whether laser guns could be real as on Star Trek (along with ""beam me up Scotty"" teleporters, and force fields) or Star Wars (death stars), by some simple grasping of the basic laws of physics and the not so basic theories today stemming from quantum mechanics (also known as quantum physics or quantum theory).Providing further structure to the book, Kaku's approach is to write about each subject then give it a Class 1, 2 or 3 impossibility rating. Class 1 = within a few decades or so, this could happen. Nothing in physics is holding us back; Class 2 = not sure, the subject is at the edge of our technological understanding. In other words, we aren't totally sure we understand the issue, therefore we'll need a few thousand years progress before we can decide whether its a Class 1 or a Class 3 Impossibility; Class 3 = those ideas or technologies that violate our known laws of physics. (There aren't that many of these to date, Kaku assures us, and who knows maybe our laws are wrong or inadequate.)I should have known better. The chapters start out easily enough, as long as one doesn't try too hard to judge whether one has comprehended a great deal covering such interesting concepts as force fields, lasers, and invisibility. However 2/3rds of the way in (and I am learning some things about light protons, waves of possibilities in quantum theory), I become more and more struck by the number of words I am familiar with, even as my comprehension of what I read drops alarmingly. At this point, I see that I know 90% of the words, but am comprehending only, say, 30%. This comprehension falls steadily as Kaku warms up to his own fascination with parallel universes, time travel, wormholes (star trek again), until at some point, I realize I'm just skimming (which I doggedly did through the last two chapters so I officially give myself a ""finish"").My breaking point? Page 246 of 283 pages - not counting an epilogue. The test is this - if you can read the following paragraph and find it delightful and meaningful (or can form any kind of opinion), this is a book for you. For me, it was a red flag, though an instructive one in that I found myself experiencing what it is to read smoothly, yet comprehend little.On page 246, in discussing parallel universes, Kaku writes of an approach where ""... the universe simply exists in many parallel states, all defined by a master wave function, called the ""wave function of the universe."" In quantum cosmology, the universe started out as a quantum fluctuation of the vacuum, that is, as a tiny bubble in the space-time foam. Most baby universes in the space-time foam have a big bang and then immediately have a Big Crunch afterward. That is why we never see them, because they are extremely small and short-lived, dancing in and out of the vacuum. This means that even ""nothing"" is boiling with baby universes popping in and out of existence, but on a scale that is too small to detect with our instruments. But for some reason, one of the bubbles in the space-time foam did not recollapse into a Big Crunch, but kept on expanding. This is our universe. According to Alan Guth, this means that the entire universe is a free lunch."" End quote. "
61,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105224098-firangiz,4,"Physics of the ImpossibleThere’s real science behind the ideas of force fields and invisibility cloaks. FORCE FIELDS: Many objects can exert an influence over other objects in their vicinity without direct contact with them. A magnet attracts/repels things lying within a certain field around it. Michael Faraday came up with the concept of force fields: invisible areas/lines of force that envelop a magnet. When gas is exposed to extreme heat, it becomes plasma, an electrically charged mass (neither solid/gas/liquid). Plasma can then be molded by magnetic and electrical fields to form an invisible sheet/plasma window. This force field can then be reinforced with a lattice of carbon nanotubes: nanoscopic cylinders made of thin, rolled-up sheets of carbon. Carbon nanotubes are stronger than steel and can deflect rockets. INVISIBILITY CLOAK: Our ability to see depends on light. The more light that passes through a material rather than being reflected by it (with gas/liquid), the less visible the material is. In 2006, Duke University’s scientists developed composite materials known as meta materials that contain small particles which deflect as opposed to reflect light waves. Any objects enveloped in such material are virtually invisible. Phasers and Death Stars might come to exist outside the world of Star Wars.Nanotech can help to develop handheld laser guns and military already uses lasers in missile defense systems.To produce compact laser gun with ability to fire multiple ties, we need a portable power source for the lasers (we’re not there yet) Although nanotech may one day enable us to create miniature batteries that can store enough energy for a functioning laser gun, we need to find a stable material that could withstand that much energy. The gamma ray bursters are enormous extragalactic blasts of radiation thought to have emerged during the creation of black hole. Theoretically, we could predict a gamma ray blaster and manipulate it to aim in certain direction, but it would be millions of years in the future. In theory, teleportation is real possibility but it’ll take ages before we can teleport humans. According to quantum theory, teleportation occurs spontaneously all the time. Electrons constantly take ‘quantum jumps’ so they can suddenly vanish and reappear elsewhere. Quantum entanglement is when you separate two electrons that vibrate synchronously. Even when they’re literally miles away from each other, whatever you do to one electron changes the state of the other. So, the information of one is transmitted to the other. Actually, by harnessing quantum entanglement, physicists have actually teleported trillions of atoms entangled with a beam of light over long distances. When we teleport an atom, what is really teleported is the info about tis state (spin) Atom itself is not physically transmitted. At extremely low temperatures, most atoms become entangled so scientists are experimenting with Bose-Einstein condensate (colder material) to teleport increasingly large objects. Mind-reading and moving objects with your mind might become possible. Electrical signals emitted from the brain are weak, so they are not readable and even with an attached antenna, we have no way to unscramble the signals. MRI tech is helping scientists identify human brain patterns. So far, they’re already compiling a ‘dictionary of thought’ that can translate these patterns into human emotions. Biofeedback is communicating directly to a computer through the electronic transmission of brain waves, which is the closest we have come to psychokinesis. Implanted chips can be used to read brain waves and translate them into commands. This has allowed paralyzed people to control devices and perform complex tasks. Science is still struggling to develop truly smart robots or computers. Machines cannot speak language mindfully, forming grammatically correct sentences, comprehending meaning. Common sense and pattern recognition remains poor in computers.  MIT professor Rodney Brooks developed bug-like robots that learned to walk based on experience. This can improve robot common sense: trial and error. We haven’t found extraterrestrial life yet, but scientists are looking.Telescopes are getting better, so much that new extrasolar planet is discovered twice a month. Scientists at Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project ares till trying. CIA Documented sightings of UFOs oner Iran in 1976 have yet to be explained. Space tech is advancing, but there are still huge challenges aheadTo successfully transport humans to outer space, we need to find the right fuel source. 2 possibilities: ion and plasma engines. Plasma engines heat hydrogen to million degrees (Celsius) at which it becomes plasma, and then emit the plasma in a powerful jet. Ion engines eject ion bees to propel the space ship. NASA already used an ion engine to fuel Deep Space 1 in 1998. Solar sails: using low and steady pressure of sunlight. For starship to be big enough, sails would have to span hundreds of miles. This, is not possible with current tech. Ramjet fusion rockets: triggering thermonuclear reaction in hydrogen gas would yield enormous amount of energy. This could enable startship to travel 77% of speed of light, so it would take 23 years to reach Andromeda galaxy. One problem would be that the space needed to store the fuel would necessitate a ship so vast it would need to be built in space. Another challenge: making space travel less dangerous. Protection from radiation, since we are wide open to deadly levels without magnetic field of Earth. Weightlessness: muscle atrophy and deterioration of our bones. Einstein said speed of light is the limit of human travel-but he may be wrong. Loopholes: 1. Warping space: if we imagine space as a paper, and we want to get from one end to the other, then warping space is like folding the paper so two ends meet. Einstein’s equations say that warping can be calculated, given a certain masa and energy. But if we start with negative mass/energy, we can come up with speed faster than light. Miguel Alcubierre proposed a drive that works like this: first, you need enough negative energy to create bubble in space time to envelop a spaceship. Then, whenever that bubble moved from A to B, it would compress the space ahead of it and expand the space behind. If highest velocity for passing non-compressed route was speed of light, you could reach B faster than light if route is compressed. 2. Wormholes in space: Einstein's theory allows shortcuts known as wormholes btw 2 points. If utilized, we may cross immense distances as we pass freely back and forth. But we need huge amount of negative energy (size of Jupiter) which would only be enough to open 1 meter wormhole plus huge amounts of radiation Time travel may be challenge and it leads to paradoxes, but it doesn't violate laws of physics. Einstein's theory of relativity says faster a rocket moves, the slower the time that will pass for passengers. If you move through space quickly enough, you can travel into future relative. Russian astronaut Sergei Avdeyev orbited Earth for 748 days and traveled 0.02 sec into the future. Going back in time is more challenging but still possible. IF wormhole connects 2 points I space, it can connect 2 places in time. Time travel comes with paradoxes. IF you traveled into your past and killed your parents before your birth, you wouldn't exist. But?? This can be solved if we assume parallel universe emerges whenever you go back in time. The past you came from would be different past from the one you travel to, although it would appear identical. For centuries, the perpetual motion machine has been the stuff of dreams for inventors. The perpetual motion machine is a device that can produce more energy than it consumes. AS population expands, satisfying our energy needs is crucial subject. Laws of thermodynamics state that it's impossible for anything to produce more energy than it consumes. But there are loopholes in the law and scientists are continuing to delve into possibility of extracting energy from nothing or vacuum.73% of our universe is made up of dark energy. Harnessing this energy is different matter. Only tine amount have been found on Earth, yet, if it could be used to power perpetual motion machine, it would shift the world. Physics might be close to finding groundbreaking answers: Radiation detectors are making progress toward tracking neutrino radiation (elusive elements) Tracking this can tae us within the seconds of Big Bang and lead to theory of everything. In string theory, particles can be modeled as 'strings' that vibrate and interact with each other. One particular state of vibration corresponds to quantum mechanical particle called graviton. String theory can tie laws of gravity with quantum theory. *Read with Blinkist"
62,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072527-nicholas,4,"I like Michio Kaku. It's amazing that someone as intelligent and lost in the world of physics and mathematics to co-create something as complicated as string field theory can write lay science books that are interesting, relevant and funny. In this book, Kaku uses science fiction to explore the realms of physics and as a jumping-off point for the discussion of theoretical physics. A sucker for science fiction myself, I found Kaku's discussions enlightening and heartening. Kaku is an optimist with a firm belief in human progress and has a way of reaching to the kid in all of us by showing how marvels such as teleportation, interstellar travel and time travel are perfectly acceptable in the realm of modern physics. He is also very careful to caution us by giving realistic timetables for humanity's ability to harness and create such fabulous inventions.Kaku divides all of his discussions on the ""impossible"" into three categories:Class I impossibilities: Things that do not violate the known laws of physics, but require a technological leap in our capacity to manipulate energy. These impossibilities have a strong chance of becoming reality by at the latest, the end of the century.Class II impossibilities: Things that do not violate the known laws of physics but are impossible for our level of civilization (his categorization of types of civilizations classified by their use of energy is interesting in its own right). These things may become possible if we make the leap from a type 0 civilization to a type 1 civilization (more on this below).Class III impossibilities: Things that violate known laws of physics, but that may be possible if we expand our knowledge and find ways to create conditions or environments that violate these laws and create new ones (sounds crazy, but Kaku insists this would be possible for a type 3 civilization).Before I forget, Kaku explains (based on the work of noted physicist Freeman Dyson) we are a type 0 civilization because we use dead plant and animal matter as our chief source of energy, which is extremely limited and inefficient. A type 1 civilization has mastered terrestrial energy - they can manipulate the weather, mine the oceans and tap energy at the core of their planet. A type 2 civilization has mastered stellar energy - their energy consumption is so vast they need to extract it from a star. A type 3 civilization are galactic, they consume and can manipulate the energy of multiple stars in multiple solar systems. We are on the verge of breaking through to a type 1 civilization. Depressing right? The leap between levels of civilizations, however, is predicted to occur at faster and faster rates, much like computer speeds doubling and doubling where growth becomes exponential. The hardest part is starting out. ;)Anyway, the most interesting thing is that most of the bizarre and seemingly magical technology discussed in Physics of the Impossible Kaku classifies as Class 1 impossibilities. As crazy as it may sound, teleportation, cloaking devices, robots and the harnessing of anti-matter are all possible by the end of the century. This is more than wishful thinking. Kaku presents sound science to back up his claims, which is enormously exciting and makes me anxious for the future.Sadly, things like faster-than-light interstellar travel and time travel are class 2 impossibilities that we will never see in our lifetimes.A great book for the kid in all of us, and a sound introduction to the world of theoretical physics for all people.

64,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11188049-jordan,4,"Find this review at Forever Lost in Literature!.Have you ever been watching or reading a science fiction movie or book and wondered if that crazy gadget or idea could actually happen? Do you want an invisibility like Harry Potter? Do you want to fly into the future with Marty McFly? Michio Kaku will discuss whether or not this is a real possibility in the future.The purpose of this book is basically to go over the biggest ideas of science fiction, such as invisibility, force fields, starships, fourth dimensions, etc., and discuss the plausibility of each one in real, scientific terms. I definitely think you might be surprised at some of the results.Kaku lays out the book in extremely simple terms. There are three main sections of the book: Class I impossibilities, which are impossibilities today, but do not violate any laws of physics and could eventually become possible; Class II Impossibilities, which are still slightly within our realm of understanding, but would not come into existence for millions of years; lastly, there are Class III impossibilities, which violate known laws of physics - if they ever become possible, things in our world are even less than what we think. Within each category, Kaku touches upon a plethora of ideas created from the works and worlds of science fiction.As far as readability goes, this book is wonderful at explaining things in terms that scientists and non-scientists alike can udnerstand. I'm definitely not scientifically inclined (though not for lack of trying...), but I was able to understand just about everything. (Science fascinates me, but I'm just not very good at understanding and processing science - though I really wish I could.)What I really loved about this book was Kaku's writing itself. He writes about things that would normally probably bore me to tears, but because of his personality and incredibly smooth writing technique I was able to fully understand and enjoy all parts of this book. Kaku also retains a good sense of objectivity; he incorporates his own personality and style, but does this in a manner so that he doesn't interject his own opinions on the plausibility or rationality of any specific idea. He keeps his mind wide open to any and all possibilities.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys science fiction, science in general, technology and advanced technology, or even if you're just curious about whether or not you could have a cloak like Harry Potter! Physics of the Impossible has received four stars from me because it was immensely fascinating and enjoyable, but not quite up to five stars."
65,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4906294-ruediger-landmann,2,"In Physics of the Impossible, physicist Michio Kaku picks out some common science-fiction tropes, grades them into three categories of impossibility, and then discusses current work in theoretical physics that touches on the fictional technology in some way.I like Kaku’s taxonomy. He distinguishes between technology that violates no known physical laws but hasn’t actually been built yet (“Class I impossibilities”), technology that is based on the fringes of theoretical physics and whose possibility depends on certain theoretical models turning out to be true (“Class II impossibilities”), and technology that violates the known laws of the universe in such a way that if such things turn out to be possible, our understanding of the universe is wrong (“Class III impossibilities”). This book is very clearly written, and exactly hits that sweet spot for science writing where an interested layperson is neither patronised nor baffled. However, for all that, I was never actually engaged by this book: I found Kaku’s style to be dull and dry, which is quite remarkable given the exciting and fascinating subject matter! I’m sure most people can recall high-school teachers or university lecturers who could take the most interesting subject matter in the world and reduce it to something positively mind-numbing. For me, Kaku (in this book) is that teacher. However, I fully acknowledge that this might be a very personal reaction; other people might find the delivery here scintillating. So, what did I take away? I certainly found my knowledge of some of the physics either refreshed or further deepened, so it was certainly educational. I was also interested to learn of some upcoming research projects of which I was not previously aware; in particular, the two forthcoming sets of gravity-wave detector satellites. So, while not a pleasure to read, I certainly found the investment of time worthwhile.One final (big) production gripe: when I reached the end of the Kindle edition of this book, I was very surprised to find that it is extensively endnoted. Why was I suprised by this? Because the endnotes are not linked or referenced anywhere in the body text! Instead, each endnote starts with a phrase or sentence from the body text to which it refers, so I guess, if you were sufficiently motivated you could reach the endnotes and then do reverse lookups to find the passages to which they refer. This has to be the dumbest book design decision I’ve ever seen. Great work, Doubleday."

67,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301333-jennifer-kim,5," I love this book because it helps me believe in one of my biggest passions – space travel. After I had taken a class in Astronomy in junior high school, I wanted to be an astronaut. Alas, it wasn’t meant to be because I suffer from motion sickness.In the previous book review (On the Wings of Eagles), I’ve mentioned that Michio Kaku is one of those people I want to meet and talk to, just for a while, because I find them fascinating. Well, the reason I want to meet him is because he has the uncanny ability to transform incredibly esoteric and hard to understand information to something quite accessible and easy to digest. Such is the case with this book.I am curious by nature. I want to know about everything, albeit salt or germs or black holes or dark matter. And this book answers my questions in spades. Whether it’s about force fields or invisibility or perpetual-motion machine or precognition, this book answers all. The best thing about it is that the answers are anchored in science, and he gives his best guess time frame for them to become a reality.As for accessibility and easy to digest part, my ten-year-old son, who is an advanced, precocious reader, and has been very interested in science, read this book. Yes. He did have trouble understanding parts of it, and I tried to explain things to him more in detail (most of it, failed). the important point is that he did finish the book, and said he thought it was interesting. This is a feat for any writer, let alone a science book writer.This book helps me believe the possibility in things that are deemed impossible. He does frame some of them in very, very long time (might as well be impossible), but he gives us a realistic time frame. That’s the point I appreciate.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a long list of topics that seem to skirt the science fiction side of science (phasers and death stars, teleportation, telepathy, psychokinesis, robots, ETs and UFOs, starships, anti-matter and anti-universe, faster than light, time travel, and parallel universe, etc.). I’m not sure I’d recommend it to another ten-year-old, but you’d know if that child is ready for this or not, so I’ll leave that to you.Enjoy and may the force be with you!"

But the one-word question you must be asking yourself then about things like time travel, teleportation, and deadly laser cannons is when? Thankfully the great scientist and bestselling author, Michio Kaku, has lots of answers for you.In Physics of the Impossible, Kaku breaks down what the future holds for humanity with its great inventions by what he calls Class Impossibilities, divided into Class I for possible inventions within one or more centuries, Class II to cover the next millennia, and finally Class III which ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions of years. The likes of force fields, telepathy and starships are covered under Class I, faster than light travel and parallel universes in Class II, and perpetual motion machines (which never run out of power and can continue indefinitely) under Class III. The brilliance with Kaku is that while he is discussing all these interesting subjects, he is also going into depth about physics and mathematics, covering the history of the development of certain subjects, and subliminally educating readers in complex physics. Kaku even provides a clear definition with plenty of similes for relativity, thermodynamics, and quantum theory.Physics of the Impossible is the perfect book for any type of nerd, as well as any person who wants some answers to why we don’t have flying cars and transporters yet. No science background is required, as Kaku breaks everything down to its simplest form. The result is a fascinating book that gives one hope for future inventions, possibly even within our lifetimes.For more reviews, check out the BookBanter site."
69,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2763719-john,3,"This is a good book for understanding where we are in terms of making some of science fiction's wildest technological advances into reality. It's a difficult read, but easy to get into because Kaku is obviously a science fiction buff who is very passionate and knowledgeable about his topic. I'm only giving it three stars, though, partly because so much of it is wildly speculative and therefore not very practical, and partly because Kaku, like so many other scientists along with him, sometimes pushes his own scientific ideas rather than being impartial and just relating the facts. Guessing about the future is ok, because he freely admits that he is just guessing, but at other times his biases are a lot more subtle. Take for example this passage:""Although monopoles have never been conclusively seen experimentally, physicists widely believe that the universe once had an abundance of monopoles at the instant of the big bang...In fact, the lack of monopoles today was the key observation that led physicists to propose the inflationary universe idea. So the concept of relic monopoles is well established in physics.""Wow. That's just brilliant, Kaku. We can't show that monopoles actually exist, but we need them in order to construct the wildly unproven theory of inflation, which in turn is necessary to prop up holes in the (also unproven but ""too big to fail"") evolutionary argument. Is that really all it takes for something to be ""well-established"" in physics these days? Kaku also fails to mention in this book that he is co-founder of string theory, which he humbly claims to possibly be the crowning achievement of physics and consequently spends an inordinate amount of time writing about, considering no strong evidence for string theory has ever been found. No bias there at all, right? A few gripes aside, though, this is one well-written, informative, and interesting book. "

In Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent the technologies and devices of science fiction that are deemed equally impossible today might well become commonplace in the future. From teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals—and the limits—of the laws of physics as we know them today. He ranks the impossible technologies by categories—Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never. In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains:· How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day enable us to bend light around an object, like a stream flowing around a boulder, making the object invisible to observers “downstream”· How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars· How telepathy and psychokinesis, once considered pseudoscience, may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology· Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build oneKaku uses his discussion of each technology as a jumping-off point to explain the science behind it. An extraordinary scientific adventure, Physics of the Impossible takes readers on an unforgettable, mesmerizing journey into the world of science that both enlightens and entertains."

My favorite future tech:Nanoships + Smart Dust (for space exploration)ForcefieldsPlasma WindowsEnergy from much more productive sourcesSpace ElevatorsReally liked how Kaku broke down ""impossibility"" into 3 classes:Class 1: Impossible with current technology, but don't violate the laws of physics. Probably a century or two away (think stealth/invisibility modes).Class 2: The fringe of our understanding of physics. Technically possible based on the math, but way far out (think time travel). Probably in the thousands or millions of years time-frame.Class 3: Technologies that violate the known laws of physics (think precognition or perpetual motion machines). For these to become possible we'll have to find really radical solutions or find that some of our existing understanding of the physical world was wrong.I realized that, whether due to my Christian upbringing or a bias against the longevity of civilizations, I haven't really ever thought about the human race going on for another million years. It was really cool to think about how far we may be able to go in the course of the next hundred thousand years, but just the fact that we really are at the early phases of our technological advancement was mind stretching by itself.

He explores the technology of force fields, invisibility, phasers, light speed, multiple/parallel dimensions, etc., all through the eyes of a physicist, and then, using the logic and tools of a physicist (while keeping in mind the layman audience) classifies each of these ""impossibilties"" into one of three categories:Class 1--something that may be possible within a hundred years.Class 2--something that may be possible within a thousand or a million years.And Class 3--a technology or phenomenon that is not possible within the known laws of physics.This is an intriguing approach to what can be a difficult subject. The writing is very readable and conversational and makes a pretty good introduction to physics (might be a great gift for a student?). That said, a lot of this still sailed over my head. Perhaps I do not possess the abstract thinking necessary to understand things like moving electrons through time and space, or what exactly a particle accelerator does--but in taking a rational, scientific approach to some of the technologies featured in some of my favorite movies and TV shows, he does make me appreciate science for what it is: our best tool for understanding the world in which we live."

His system of organizing ""impossibilities"" into three classes (possible in the next century, possible for an extremely advanced civilization, and requiring a rewriting of the laws of physics as currently understood) is an engaging gimmick. Much of the fun in this book is just seeing how Kaku classified each of the proposed technologies. Interestingly, out of all of the speculative future-tech that he examined, only two concepts are placed in that last category. Everything else (and this includes time travel, faster-than-light, teleportation, parallel universes, telepathy, and plenty more) is allowed (though in some cases limited or highly unlikely) by our current laws of physics.The book provides a very nice physics refresher course, told with a conversational ease and using very accessible language and concepts. In addition, Kaku's knowledge of SF literature and media, while not as deep as I personally would have liked, did delve well beyond the obvious Star Trek and Star Wars material.I did find that the book could be rambly in places, straying afield of some of the chapter topics, although the digressions were usually interesting.Overall, this was a fun ride, not extremely deep, but cleverly thought out and presented in an engaging and understandable style."

I especially appreciated the section on starships, in which he evaluates and compares various methods of space propulsion which I have often read about, as well as assess how far each concept is from practical use.

Kaku divides the 'impossible' things into three different categories: Class I things are most likely possible within the next hundred years or so provided we develop the right kind of technology, Class II don't violate the laws of physics and so are technically not impossible, but might require hundreds or thousands of years to develop, while Class III impossibilities are those that violate the laws of physics as we know them. Not that that means that we'll actually be seeing time travel or be able to move faster than the speed of light, as 'impossible' here literally means 'violates the laws of physics' and there's not really a lot that does. But Kaku also goes into great detail about how they don't violate the laws of physics and what exactly we'd need to do make any of this a reality. He has a way of writing that draws you in to the subject and gives you all the information you need while not requiring that you have a PhD in physics in order to understand. And who knows? Maybe we'll be seeing force fields and phasers in the next hundred years or so. "

Though Mr. Kaku is probably right in most of what he says, I am saddened to hear that he leaves little room for the discovery of additional laws of physics that will blow his timeline away. I suppose that it is only to be expected when you speak to a scientist that only what is scientifically known now is appropriate for consideration. Still, he could have been a bit more flexible in how he worded some of his more absolute statements. Right now, he is the 21st equivalent of 19th century scientists who were quite certain that all that was knowable in physics was known, and only degree or precision was to be improved upon. I was also surprised to hear that he didn't mention the dark, secret side of string theory except quickly in passing, that is, there's absolutely no proof for it; right now, its just a bunch of elegant equations that fit what we already know. There are some prominent physicists who are beginning to get disillusioned about the whole idea of string theory, Lee Smolin being one of them.Still, it was fun reading, and I recommend it if you can handle its level of science."

If you are sci fan, than this is must read book. You will for sure find at least some topic that you have been always wondered about. As he noted himself, Einstein liked to visualise everything, so that may be one general thing missing in book, pictures and graphics. Some topics deserve even more attention (but maybe than book would have 1y distance of speed of light height of pages :)), for example life outside of Earth is mostly pointed to probability, considering many factors, that life similar to our exists, but there is possibility, that at this moment cant be measured, of other kind of life that we can't imagine (we can even imagine silicon based, but who knows what else is/can be there).I really can't tell which one of topics was more interesting.

The author, Michio Kaku, for example analyzes the television show Star Trek’s extraordinary use of teleportation through a scientific physics spectrum. He breaks down not yet realized and even fantasized possible breakthroughs in technology into three possibilities. Class I possibilities, he believes, could be realized in this or the next century. He includes, understandably, the ability to use Robots in this category. He also includes, somewhat not understandably, “Invisibility” in this category. Quantum physics is thoroughly explored and the book tends to venture into higher level physics explanations. He uses mathematical equations to say that certain impossibilities are possible, such as a ladder which extends from the earth to the moon.

He has clearly read a lot of Sci-Fi novels, as all of the ""impossible"" things he discusses are taken from things like Star Wars or Star Trek, which makes it even more interesting to read (at least for a lover of Sci-Fi like myself).In the last section of the book, when he starts to discuss things that are ""actually"" impossible (as opposed to the Lightsabers, Death Stars, and Teleportation devices of the earlier sections), it gets a bit confusing (for those of us who aren't physics majors), but otherwise he is extremely lucid and uses a lot of great examples to help people like me understand what the hell he's talking about.Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in Physics, who loves Science Fiction, or just wants a good book to expand their knowledge of the universe.

However the definition of three classes of impossibilities leaves me somehow doubtful.His analysis is based on science, both present and future, made by men. But progress is going to accelerate soon beyond human limits. Before the end of this century it is likely that advanced science is performed infinitely more efficiently by super intelligent machines. Besides Sir Arthur Charles Clarke states in his third law that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”. This make presume that our civilization or even a “posthuman” civilization, is entering the realm of magic before the end of this century. "

It's accessible without being dumbed down, which is a rarity for the pop science genre, and it's really, really interesting.The book is basically a discussion of all the fun things you see in sci-fi that you wish existed but don't: time travel, faster than light speed, teleportation, invisibility, precognition, etc. Michio Kaku splits these ideas into three ""classes"" of impossibility. Class I impossibilities are things that are impossible with current technology but could exist within the next hundred years or so. Class II impossibilities are well beyond any technology we have or could hope to have, but may be feasible at some imprecise time in the future (hundreds of thousands of years from now assuming we don't all kill each other before then). Class III impossibilities are the things that really are impossible - against the laws of physics. There are fewer of these than you might think!"
83,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30232795-nour,5,"Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration Into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel is a book by theoretical physicist Michio Kaku. Kaku uses discussion of speculative technologies to introduce topics of fundamental physics to the reader. The topic of invisibility becomes a discussion on why the speed of light is slower in water than in vacuum, that electromagnetism is similar to ripples in a pond, and Kaku discusses newly developed composite materials. The topic of Star Trek ""phasers"" becomes a lesson on how lasers work and how laser-based research is conducted. The cover of his book depicts a TARDIS, a device used in the British science fiction television show Doctor Who to travel in space and time, in its disguise as a police box, continuously passing through a time loop. With each discussion of science fiction technology topics he also ""explains the hurdles to realizing these science fiction concepts as reality"
84,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/531931-pete,3,"Pre-reading: I've watched Michio Kaku on the science channel. He clearly communicates his excitement about science. This looks like it could be a fun book.Post-reading: It was a fun book to read. Physics today is difficult to understand, and writing about it for a non-technical audience must present extradordinary challenges. Simply put, there is no intuitive physical explanation for quantum physical phenomena. Kaku does a nice job, but I think the book could have benefited from better editing by someone with a foot in both camps (physicists and non-physicists). There were a lot of things which I just couldn't reconcile, even with extra effort. He goes into some fairly simple concepts in depth, and he he glosses over more difficult concepts. Nontheless, it is a good way for those interested in physics to keep abreast of current events."
85,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3192075-david,3,"I found this book fascinating and very interesting at times. It takes a mostly-understandable-to-laymen look at whether or not technologies, ideas, and concepts that were/are thought to be impossible—invisibility, time travel, perpetual motion machines—are in fact possible. It also looks at how feasible each might be, what work is being done to work toward it, and when such impossibilities might become cross over into the realm of the possible.Due to the way it's organized, separating the different concepts into digestible chunks, I found myself putting it down for longer than I would most books. Kaku's explanations are, for the most part, very understandable, although there were times when I thought he was belaboring certain points while at others I felt lost in a short explanation that would have benefited from some more depth."
86,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"Totally geeked out with this very readable science book. Michio Kaku addresses some of the usual tropes of science fiction and then explains what it would take to actually make them a reality. They are divided into three classes of impossibility. Class I items could happen under the known laws of physics and given another century or more technological progress. Class II items such as faster-than-light travel may happen far in the future. And Class III items (perpetual motion machines and precognition) just ain't gonna happen without a rewrite of known laws of physics. His explanations do not require a Ph.D to understand. Pretty cool and often weird stuff. I particularly liked the weirdness that is quantum physics, an area of science that noted physicist Richard Feynman once said that no one really understands."
87,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146153-halik,2,"Cant say i was really impressed with this one. Kaku talks about technology depicted in science fiction and attempts to find out how impossible they are. In fact he divides them into three classes of impossibilities. The most impossible, that is the ones that are probably never going to happen, are pretty few. But the rest of Kaku's expositions are less than convincing. We are expected to believe that things like reading mind, telekinesis etc are made possible by the extrapolation of simple MRI technologies. That Death Stars can be constructed by Einstein's E=Mc. All this may be theoretically possible true, but one gets the feeling that Kaku tries to merely look at current research that somewhat dimly corresponds to futuristic technology and then start drawing lines and connections, a method that struck me as more speculative than scientific."

We are introduced to the physics of force fields, telepathy, teleportation, invisibility etc which are categorized as Class I and may be realized within a century. Then there are techs like FTL which will require significant advances and cost effectiveness and might take a million years. Then there are Class III impossibilities like Perpetual Motion Machines which will need a complete shake-up of our current understanding of the universe. The book teaches you to keep an open mind about seemingly impossible things as there were many ideas over the years that became possible with advances in science and tech."

There were plenty of parts where I was just amazed at the theories. What was most interesring to me though came from the chapter on parallel universes...From page 240-241:""Apparently our universe lives in a goldilocks zone of many parameters, all of which are fine tuned to allow for life. So either we are left with the conclusion that there is a God of some sort who has chosen our universe to be just right to allow for life, or there are billions of parallel universes, many of them dead.""These comments really jumped out at me.

Kaku touches on many predictions of what could be possible in the future of technology and physics, which are not possible today. He first opens with the subject on a few examples of science fiction tales then moves on to how they became scientific fact and where the extent of the technology can possibly be taken. from forcefields to time travel and multiverses Michio Kaku explains and breaks down how these different inventions and theories could be possible decades or centuries later for civilization. A must read for anyone who appreciates science and technology even lovers of science fiction."

The first book I read from him was 'Hyperspace' and became immediately his fan. 'Physics of the Impossible' is another exceptional work. Like Brian Greene's 'Fabric Of The Cosmos', the book is full of great examples, details that are easily visualized and exciting historical facts that make the scientific terminology digestible. Mr. Kaku helps the readers by smartly classifying the 'impossibilities' (such as time travel and teleportation) and gives estimates as to when these may become 'possible'. The book is very engaging and I highly recommend it."

I really liked Kaku’s categorization of the types of advanced societies (modern Earthlings are a sorry Type 0, still dependent on fossil fuels), but that’s one of the few pieces of information I really took with me. Kaku is much more engaging in person. And as usual, science fiction is much more thrilling to me than science reality."

119,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7350207-orbson-rice,4,"Physics of the ImpossibleAt some point in a 5th grade classroom in Royal Oak, Michigan, Science and I broke up. That’s not to say we were ever really together, but I never looked upon it with fear and loathing until Mrs. Green’s class. Now I could blame her, though I don’t really know if it was her teaching or my laziness that ended the relationship. I was a reader, a writer, a dreamer and Science needed more from our relationship. It required steady effort and logic. Just like my relationship with brussel sprouts we quickly drifted apart. Well, okay we flung apart forcefully when I threw my Science book out of my open bedroom window one warm fall evening. How much energy was exerted? Well it was a fairly heavy book and I threw it as hard as I could, so I would say a fair amount. The sense of freedom was wonderful… until my report card showed up. Over the years, Science and I have been in touch. The occasional required class here and there or news article that caught my attention, but whenever we were together I found myself just going through the motions and was never truly invested in the relationship. As I have aged, my mass has increased, my acceleration has bottomed out and thus my energy wasn’t enough to power a light bulb. However, I began to look upon science with new eyes. While I knew we weren’t right for each other, I began to respect it more. Soon we were friends. No, not good friend, more like passing acquaintances on Facebook. Science would post something interesting and I, in my infinite wisdom would give it a thumb’s up. Way to go Science! That friendship offered me new insights into my world and a great respect for those courageous individuals who not only didn’t throw their Science book out the window, but embraced it with everything they had. Which, finally brings me to Michio Kaku’s Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel. This book was recommended by a friend of mine who knew of and embraced my geekdom. He said, “There’s a great book about the physics related to cool stuff like force fields and time travel. It’s written by an actual physicist but it is really accessible.” I have had the book on my bookshelf for over a year, occasionally staring at it and wondering whether this would be the day that I would finally put aside my fifth grade fears and follow Kaku down the rabbit hole. Finally, two week ago I did.All book reviews are subjective but none more so than this one. I have two college level degrees and I can guarantee you, there are probably 12-year-olds with better scientific knowledge. So when I tell you that there were passages of this book that made my eyes glaze over and my 5th grade self cry out in terror, know that it was probably my fault. Overall I found Kaku to be extremely accessible. He took complex topics and nerdy fantasies and somehow managed to combine them into an interesting read. I cannot say I walked away really understanding the science, it was more like I was introduced to broad concepts which were fascinating. Like others here, I found myself accidentally skimming some of the denser material. Occasionally I would reread that section but more often than not I would just keep going. I think that’s okay, because in the end while I only feel a bit smarter, my appreciation of physics grew exponentially. I have been a firm believer in funding Science for my entire life. After reading this book as well as watching the anti-Science mentality that is plaguing this country, I feel more than ever the desire to ensure that the studies continue. We have accomplished so much in so little time. Could you imagine if instead of focusing on war and greed we focused on science and innovation? Imagine what we could accomplish. Physics of the Impossible is inspirational, it is fascinating and even 9-years after its publication it’s still relevant. I cannot give it 5 stars because of the glazed eyes and frequency in which I asked, “Okay, which topic was this about again?” He would occasionally go off on tangents which I am certain was integral and necessary but made my little brain hurt. Still, overall I will recommend it if for nothing else, than to brag “Oh, yeah, I read books on physics all the time!” Finally, the book did leave me with one non-physics question, what the hell kind of person sticks a cat in a box with a radioactive atom? Just saying, someone may want to call PETA."

One of the reasons is that his popular science bestsellers are often balancing on a string between science and science fiction. They are futuristic and make you think of the great potential a civilization like ours could achieve unless we screw up badly and if what he describes is even physically possible.In his 2008 book, Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel, Kaku claims that the ""impossible"" is often a relative term. He divides the things that are ""impossible"" into three categories.The first is what Kaku calls Class I impossibilities. These are technologies that are impossible today but that do not violate the known laws of physics. So they might be possible in this century, or perhaps the next, in modified form. They include teleportation, antimatter engines, certain forms of telepathy, psychokinesis, and invisibility.The second category is what he terms Class II impossibilities. These are technologies that sit at the very edge of our understanding of the physical world. If they are possible at all, they might be realized on a scale of millennia to millions of years in the future. They include time machines, the possibility of hyperspace travel, and travel through wormholes.The final category is what Kaku calls Class III impossibilities. These are technologies that violate the known laws of physics. Surprisingly, there are very few such impossible technologies. If they do turn out to be possible, they would represent a fundamental shift in our understanding of physics.Indeed, many technologies in science fiction are dismissed by scientists as being totally impossible, when what they actually mean is that they are impossible for a primitive civilization like ours. Alien visitations, for example, are usually considered impossible because the distances between the stars are so vast. While interstellar travel for our civilization is clearly impossible, it may be possible for a civilization centuries to thousands or millions of years ahead of ours.Technologies that are impossible for our current civilization are not necessarily impossible for other types of civilizations. Statements about what is possible and impossible have to take into account technologies that are millennia to millions of years ahead of ours. Carl Sagan once wrote, ""What does it mean for a civilization to be a million years old? We have had radio telescopes and spaceships for a few decades; our technical civilization is a few hundred years old… An advanced civilization millions of years old is as much beyond us as we are beyond a bush baby or a macaque.""So it is important to rank such ""impossibilities,"" claims Kaku. And that’s what he tries to do in this book. The book was written back in 2008. Absolute majority of Kaku’s predictions still remain in the realm of the impossible. However, some progress has been made. For instance, gravitational waves he excitingly writes about at the end of the book have already been detected. This creates a huge potential to reveal intimate details of the Big Bang singularity, possibly even verify some version of string theory, which Kaku believes to be the prime contender for the much-sought-after theory of everything. However, it is still far away from becoming one. Kaku, as many other string theorists, hoped that the experiments run at the Large Hadron Collider would reveal superparticles, predicted by the string theory. Alas, however hard physicists tried, superparticles didn’t show up.In any case, this easy-to-read 329-page volume will make you wonder about the future of humanity and intelligent life in general."

122,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,4,"Wherein ""impossible"" sometimes only means ""quite difficult""!What do Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, Lawrence Krauss, Clifford Pickover, Brian Greene, Douglas Hofstadter and Michio Kaku have in common? Aside from being respected physicists, scientists, mathematicians and theoreticians, they also have the uncanny ability to write at a level that we mere mortals can understand. Happily this allows our workaday world of common non-scientists to participate in at least a rudimentary understanding of the esoteric mysteries of the universe that are fascinating in the extreme and so bizarre as to outstrip the most obtuse imaginings of fiction writers.Michio Kaku takes us on a grand tour of the modern world of physics by grouping topics that either were or are still considered impossible into three large classes - first, those items that don't appear to violate the currently known laws of science and having been considered as impossibilities in times past are either now realities or are verging on reality as technology and experimentation makes progress with such blinding speed; second, items that also don't appear to break the rules as we know them but await the development of technology that is likely centuries or millennia beyond whatever skills we might even envisage at this point in history; and, finally, those things that our current knowledge of scientific law would suggest are genuinely impossible.Kaku treats the eager science loving reader with a generous and formidable list of topics - force fields, telekinesis and ESP, faster-than-light travel, time travel, parallel universes, perpetual motion, telepathy, phaser weaponry, precognition, antimatter, negative matter, hyperspace travel, extraterrestrials and much more. His writing style is at once down to earth, scientifically correct without being either esoteric or condescending, and even witty and humorous as he regales us with amusing tales of the correspondence between science and the astonishingly prescient writers of the science fiction genre. As you might well imagine, the brilliant writers and creators of the Star Trek series come up in Kaku's discussion on more than one occasion.Brilliant, informative and entertaining! Highly recommended. But Class III impossibilities being forever impossible? If I learned anything from this book, I don't think I'll ever say ""never"" again. Who knows? Stay tuned!Paul Weiss"
123,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91577998-jannik-faierson,4,"Physics of the Impossible was a book, I first encountered on a Youtube video about the best popular science books. I decided to give it a try and I don't regret it. I loved how this book connects amazing concepts from science fiction and transfers it to current scientific developments in physics. E.g. does it use the idea of precognition in one of the last chapters to present scientific theories, such as String Theory. But what I liked most was the inspiring and optimistic character that this book offered. Kaku is playing with the expression 'impossible' and takes it as a challenge to look far ahead and surprises the reader what kind of undreaming stuff can become real in the future. He does that by separating his chosen SciFi concepts into three categories which he declares to be 'Impossibilities' of Class 1 to 3. The most concepts, such as Force Fields, Teleportation and Starships, are labeled as Class 1 that suggest a possible invention within the next hundreds of years. Each chapter is highly exciting because Kaku starts with an exposition of how we know this concept from Science Fiction. Then he states reasons why all of this seems to be insane (just another fancy word for impossible). But then he presents current developments in science which are closely linked to the topic and comes to a conclusion that makes one enthusiastic about the future. While the first half is quite technological driven, the author digs more into the world of theoretical physics later on. He mentions some concepts, e.g. of Time Travel, which are to him either Class 2 (still takes an awful lot of time, if even possible) or Class 3 (against today's laws of physics). There he takes the modern views of physics into account (e.g. relativity and quantum mechanics) and presents it to the reader understandably and closely linked to the topic. Thus these theories become really interesting and it left me dreaming about the future what might all be possible. I know that this isn't the perfect book to learn about physics and its theories. But in my opinion, there are already a lot of books that do. 'Physics of the Impossible' does something different but also essential. It is as well an introduction into the worlds of physics for people interested and amazed by SciFi but also a book that inspires you to take a look into the possible future. It does that so brilliantly and enthusiastically that you can only feel the same. It takes you from your everyday life beyond your wildest imaginations to a place that seems impossible but could be a reality some day. Or to quote the final paragraph of the book 'We are not at the end, but at the beginning of a new physics. But whatever we find, there will always be new horizons continually awaiting us.'I am thankful to have encountered this book and recommend it to everybody who is either directly interested in SciFi or finds ideas, such as time travel or precognition, appealing and worth of discovering it more in detail."

He creates three ""classes"" of impossibilities: Class I impossibilities are possible within a century or so; Class II impossibilities do not violate the known laws of physics but would not be possible for several centuries or millennia; and Class III impossibilities are those that are either truly impossible or else something would have to radically shift in current understanding of physics and its laws.Kaku is an engaging writer and he does a pretty good job of attempting to simplify complex topics for a general reader (although I still didn't understand everything discussed). He also peppers his discussion in each chapter with references in fiction and screen to the phenomenon he is examining--side note: it's interesting how many scientists became invested in their field due to a childhood love of sci-fi books, movies, and/or TV shows--and includes quotations throughout from experts in physics and astronomy, astronauts, academics, and Nobel laureates.Most of the concepts he classifies as ""Class I impossibilities"" actually turn out to be already possible or in progress on a microscopic scale, but to a general reader who hears ""teleportation"" and thinks of transporter beams in Star Trek, you will perhaps be disappointed to learn that most Class I impossibilities become Class II impossibilities when applied at the macroscopic level. For that reason, I don't feel like the book quite delivers on its premise since most of the Class I phenomena turn out to be Class II phenomena in disguise. (Also, real talk, this book makes me think that theoretical physics is mostly an expensive waste of time. Based on what Kaku describes, it seems to be a lot of building atom smashers that cost BILLIONS of dollars to prove the existence of sub-atomic particles. Or wasting government-funded research to the tune of millions of dollars to pursue research on mind-reading that SPOILER ALERT didn't go anywhere because no one can read minds. Why? We've discovered quarks, leptons, and bosons, what am I supposed to do with this knowledge? Suggestions welcome.)"

Star Trek came next with space travel faster than light and racial equality not only among humans but alien life forms as well. Science was sexy and it was going to benefit each and every human being.So, what happened to these promises? Reality got in the way. Human beliefs and behaviors hold back change and progress and the laws of physics are not always things we can utilize to our advantage or as easily as we might hope.Michio Kaku's book takes a new look at extraordinary scientific advancements for which we have been hoping. Some of the topics he addresses are: teleportation, robots, starships, time travel, and parallel universes. Kaku takes these and other topics and organizes them into three classes of ""impossibilities"": things that are impossible today but do not violate known laws of physics, things that might be possible millions of years in the future, and things that violate currently known laws of physics.What makes this book so outstanding is that, in addition to the topics addressed, Kaku makes science approachable to even the non-scientist. He uses great quotes, humor, history, popular TV shows and movies, and more to provide insight into what we know, what we don't know, and how we might move forward and know more. While this book doesn't include diagrams on how to build a transporter like on Star Trek, it does outline some ways humans can solve many scientific questions that are currently beyond our reach. Clever and clear writing makes this an enjoyable and educational read."
126,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5144353-phil-giunta,5,"Co-founder of String Field Theory, Doctor Michio Kaku discusses the scientific plausibility of a wide range of popular science fiction devices, abilities, and technologies in his book, Physics of the Impossible.The topics covered in this engaging analysis include force fields, invisibility cloaks, phasers, laser beams, lightsabers, teleportation, telepathy, time travel, robots, psychokinesis, UFOs, alien races, faster than light travel, and more. Doctor Kaku references many popular SF TV shows and films including Star Trek, Star Wars, Flash Gordon, Back to the Future, Doctor Who, The Fly, Independence Day, E.T., and others.I was delighted to note that Doctor Kaku also draws from a rich array of SF novels and short stories such as The Man Without a Body by Edward Page Mitchell, The Disintegration Machine by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Slan by A.E. van Vogt, Larry Niven's Ringworld series, Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the works of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, and Robert Heinlein.Backed by practical and theoretical physics, chemistry, biology, and a rich history of scientific discoveries, Doctor Kaku offers detailed explanations as to which fictional technologies and abilities might be possible in the future and which are simply impractical—at least based on our current understanding of science.Physics of the Impossible is by far one of the most enthralling and illuminating scientific discourses I've read to date. I equate Doctor Kaku with Doctors Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson for his considerable talents as a science communicator."

This was no exception. A high 4.5 from me!It was eminently readable without being condescending to it's readers. It doesn't muddy the waters with weird allegories - the language is clear and concise, explaining hard topics in terms that anyone with a middle school education in science can understand. (Also, it steers away from my pet peeve - using words like ""a billion trillion million billion"". 1 followed by 36 zeros has to be easier to parse even if you flunked middle school maths)The book covers an eclectic variety of topics, some of them beyond the author's area of expertise. Yet every chapter comes through as equally well researched, written by someone very knowledgeable in the field, and equally interesting. The author also discusses alternative approaches to resolving each impossibility - that's a discussion I really enjoyed. If you have even a passing interest in good sci-fi, you'll love this book.PS - I especially loved how he starts with saying nothing is really impossible - all science ever claims is something is incompatible with our present understanding of the universe. Way too many popular science books go ""this is how the universe works"". I wish more would acknowledge the uncertainty that is at the heart of science, the constant endeavor to overthrow current beliefs and prove reality is way stranger than fiction. Without that, where is the fun in science!?Read for the challenge prompts - Around the Year in 52 Books - A book with a weird or intriguing title"
128,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77744562-brian-bakker,5,"What's your definition of impossible?I really liked this book. Not only does Kaku challenge you to think about a range of possible ideas and techniques, but more importantly, he challenges your perspective on what impossible really means. Kaku recalls several historic statements or generally accepted views on things that, at that time, seemed to be impossible, but are nowadays common or even household realities. Whereas a lot of 'less complex' books on physics that I read focus on making the science more palpable and easier to place in the context of the reader's life, Physics Of The Impossible dares the reader to do the opposite. Don't think of scientific breakthroughs as things that matter right now, for your own life, but look further ahead, decades, centuries or even millennia and you'll notice there's very little that's actually impossible. Kaku uses ideas from older science-fiction books or movies and, contrary to what one might believe, gives pretty solid arguments for why almost all of those ideas are (often in a slightly altered way) plausible for the next generations of humans.If I had to critique this work, I could only say, I would've preferred that the chapters on brain-related topics as telepathy and psychokinesis were in a different book. It's also pretty interesting to see how certain things have already changed drastically in the 10-years since this book was written, mainly Kaku's description of the state of AI in 2008 made me realize how far we've come since."

Class I impossibilities:All our known sci-fi tech such as laser swords (Power Rangers, StarWars), invisible cloaks (Harrypotter), robots with emotions (ExMachina, Robo in India), Teleportation, telepathy, psychokinesis, intergalactic search, UFOs, Antimatter, Starships etc; falls under this genre. Basically nothing prevents for creation of these tech and is expected to come within 200 years2. Class 2 impossibilities:Travelling faster than light, parallel universes, time travel etc; comes under this genre. Our present laws defy a bit but there are promising research going in this to make it possible within the next 1000 years3. Class 3 impossibilities: Perceptual Motion Machines (Machines which take nothing but give energy), Precognition (looking into future) are something that no current laws in physics can explain and infact defy the possibilities. So, to discover something in this genre, our current understanding of physics needs to be enhanced, modified and maybe new laws to be discovered/invented (who knows !!!)"
130,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23708347-jason,4,"This book covers a lot of interesting topics and brings of lot of interesting scientific information to bear examining standard scifi topics like laser weapons, force fields, and warp speed. Any fan of science fiction will almost certainly find some interesting ideas in the book. The book is written as a fairly casual examination of scientific topics, so people with deeper scientific knowledge will likely find it a bit shallow.There's two complaints that I would have about the book: the first is that it started to feel a bit rushed towards the end. The earlier chapters in the book (with each chapter covering a single topic) are generally pretty hefty and examine the issue pretty well, but the last few felt somewhat incomplete. The second issue is one that's an inevitable problem with any books about these sort of scientific issues, which is time. The book was written in 2008, and I read it in 2017, and there were a number of things that were already out of date. For example, the search for the Higgs bosom is mentioned a few times - it was discovered in 2012. The chapter on Robots/AI in particular felt dated to me because there have been some rather major advanced made in the past several years. I can't help but to wonder how many other theories covered in the book are outdated/wrong. Basically, this book would benefit greatly from a expanded second edition."
131,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5530529-steven,5,"It's easy for scientists to criticize the devices they see and read about in science fiction. ""That light saber violates physics...space ships don't make zooming noises, etc..."" Dr. Michio Kaku takes the opposite tack. He likes science fiction and challenges his own field by asking, ""Why can't we have have light sabers?"" and ""Why can't we have faster-than-light spaceships?"" He's well aware that history is full of scientists pronouncing this or that is impossible, only to be proven wrong later. This book takes a more humble approach. He tries to find loopholes in our current understanding of the laws of physics that would allow certain science fiction technologies. Even the most impossible ones, the Class 3 Impossibilities (perpetual motion machines and prognostication) he considers seriously, and says might become possible with new understandings of physics. My only quibble is a minor one. He seems to associate Universal Translators with mind-reading. I don't. Online text translators don't need to read minds to work; why would a universal translator need to?Overall, this is an outstanding book. Since it was written in 2008, I hope Dr. Kaku updates it; the existing edition discusses several physics and astronomy experiments that were upcoming at the time, but may have happened since."
132,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6546332-ms-wendy-b,5,"If I’d had physics presented in Kaku’s style in high school, I may well have pursued this subject at university. A fascinating take on a subject that I did not expect to find interesting. I originally purchased the book for my son, and borrowed it for a point of discussion, thinking that I might skim a couple of chapters. However, I was hooked early on to read the entire book.Kaku, a respected physicist, discusses phenomena presented in science fiction in context of the known and unknown laws of physics. If you’ve wondered if travel, annihilation by a Death Star, teleportation, and things you’ve seen on Star Trek are at all possible, this book clearly explains the extent of improbability in relation to Newtonian mechanics, quantum theory, Maxwell’s equation, relativity, and current debates about String Theory. Despite my generally poor prior knowledge of physics, I found the explanations to be clear and engaging — neither too technical nor dumbed down. The general overview of theories were revisited/summarized throughout the book,helpful in that I didn’t have to skim back for information.The best part for me: the premise that most phenomena are actually “physics of the possible.” "
133,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111048119-eric-holyhead,4,"A really amazing book that ignited a passion in me for physics. I was already taking the subject at my college, but after reading the first few chapters and being blown away by the content of this book, and the physics behind it, I knew the subject was for me. The Class 1 and 2 impossiblities are written excellently, a lot of imagery is used in conjunction with physics in order to help the reader understand the magnitude and theory behind what's being stated. There's things in the book that sound like the distant future, but the eloquent explanation of the Physics, and the real life prototypes in development, really engages and at times, even stuns the reader. The only reason I cannot give this book 5 stars is due to the questions I was left with during some of the Class 2, and most of Class 3 impossibilities. There were a few notable times where a lot of the physics and understanding I had enjoyed earlier were left behind, and it became more like science fiction that we were just told to believe.Overall I did have a great time reading this book, and it has encouraged me to find out as well as read more about Physics. An enjoyable read for those who are interested in science fiction or Physics."
134,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5949552-andrew-ives,4,"Each chapter of Physics of the Impossible starts with a particular concept from a science-fiction film or story, such as teleportation, then goes on to explain how impossible it may be and elaborate on how we might go about making it reality through known science. The subjects covered such as light sabres, invisibility, starships, time travel etc are all very interesting and amusing to read about, especially for the first 100+ pages, but as Kaku is a scientist who knows his onions in just about every field, this book is more serious than light-hearted, leaning about 30:70 towards the serious science. (Apart from the mention of a kiwi which Kaku says is an Australian bird! Err...) Even though he writes perfectly nicely and we don't see any equations or too many superscript numbers, this can grow a little tiresome after a while, especially the epilogue which goes over much of the same ground without any noticeable reference to anything from science-fiction. I enjoyed it, but it won't be everyone's cup of tea unless they have a reasonable grounding in science. 4.25/5"
135,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571135-anna,3," Interesting, but the earlier parts were, as I mentioned whilst reading those parts, maybe a bit dated by now. A lot can happen in 9 years, apparently. But the further along the book gets, the more theoretical and hard-to-grasp the ideas get, and the more unlikely it seems that we'd even properly start getting there during my lifetime, at least. Unless something really sudden and surprising happens, you never know.I like it how Kaku manages to make really difficult subjects and theories a bit more easy to understand, but at the same time I get quite annoyed by all the Star Trek and other pop culture references. Which is funny, since I love them everywhere else, except apparently in my ""proper popularized science"" books, as the Finnish scientist Esko Valtaoja managed to annoy me with the exact same thing when I read his books like 15 years ago.Interesting, but not sure if it is worth it any more. Should have read this when I bought it, not years and years later."

This book was definitely an enjoyable nonfiction read, and Kaku did a good job of explaining things for a general reader — though some of his explanations were hard to follow at times, given that the concepts he is trying to explain are extremely complicated and advanced (if time travel was easy, we'd already be doing it). This book is 10 years old at this point, and I'd be interested in seeing an updated version at some point that takes into account more recent discoveries in physics and scientific/technological breakthroughs. But given how far in the future these ""impossible"" phenomenon are (not to mention the new wave of popular interest in science fiction happening now), this book still felt relevant."

A book like this, however, dispels some of that mysticism surrounding pretty much any technology you can think of. Teleportation? Possible, and happening today (at least on a small scale!). Force fields? Invisibility? Time travel? All these are talked about and the path toward feasibility described. Given how many of these technologies are not just possible, but probable to come into being within the life spans of people alive today, the future is looking bright!This book is not for sci-fi fans or the science-inclined only. The writing is fully accessible and will be of interest to, well, anyone who thinks it sounds interesting! The possibilities for the future really come to life, and I often found myself excitedly gabbing about these technologies to anyone around. I'd recommend this book to anyone."
138,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/797141-annie-primera,4,"Amazing book that talks about what sci-fi gadgets are possible with our current understanding of physics. Kaku divides these technologies into three: Class I, which are impossible due to our current level of technology but will become possible in the (not too distant) future; Class II, which may technically be possible but may only be realized (if that) millions of years into the future; and Class III, which are impossible as far as we know, but might become possible if our understanding of physics changes.The book was published ten years ago, so it's a bit outdated and some of the more impressive scientific projects that were being planned back then have since been cancelled or postponed, but it's hard not to get excited about what the future will bring us when reading how light sabers, teleportation and time travel might actually be possible. As usual, Michio Kaku explains some of the most mind-bending concepts in theoretical physics simply and engagingly."

Michio Kaku is good at explaining concepts that could be hard to grasp in simple terms but for me, everything was pretty familiar probably because I've read quite a lot of books like this one. Although it was a nice move to describe such non-trivial things as string theory, time-traveling, Standard Model and so on by referring to the popular science fiction books and shows.What I found the most interesting in the book was the idea that dark matter is actually a matter from a parallel universe that coexists with our universe in hyperspace and sometimes passes by in the fourth dimension influencing our universe processes through gravity, also loved the description of tachyons and contemplations around the unified theory. It's probably a good way of explaining theories by mentioning the scientists who worked on them and some small facts from their biographies but it was a bit annoying to me again just because I've read a lot of books like that.

Although this book assumes some theoretical background in cosmology and quantum physics, the author does well to avoid too much technical details to keep novice physics enthusiasts engaged throughout the book. This book is a test of your imagination as well. It might seem that the book is too brief in some areas but repetitive in certain others. Summing up, it is a fantastic read targeting a specific set of audience. He gets you engrossed in the fantasies of universe and makes you question some of the fundamental truths upon which our understanding is built on.Although intuitive understanding in Quantum Theory and Cosmology is not mandatory, it is recommended.Strictly for Physics and Sci-Fi lovers."

Overall, though, it was wonderfully fun. Kaku divides the ""impossibilities"" into three categories, ranging from technologies we're just on the cusp of developing ranging up to the third category with things like precognition, which violate the known laws of physics. You get a primer on basic physics, quantum theory and string theory along the way. Kaku doesn't *just* know his physics, he knows his classic and modern sci-fi really well, and gives lots of fun examples of how ideas that were once considered science fiction inspired real scientific developments. I loved this and plan to seek out some of Kaku's more recent books."
143,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/967121-ben,4,This was a great book. The author does a great job of explaining what needs to happen in order for technology to get to the specific subject and also gives a very generalized timeline of when that might happen. The author also gives you the history of the subject and then puts that into practical application. In example of this if when he is explaining force fields and how we could do that today but these are the barriers that are limiting us and how they would only work against this type of a magnetic weapon. He then explains that it may be a hybrid force field for multiple types of weapons and then gives detail as far as how that could come into everyday use.Overall this is a great read if you are into physics and also a good read if you are interested in technology and how that could be placed into practical everyday use.

This book carefully deals with physics without intimidating the reader with complex stuff.It has been almost a decade since its release in 2008, it is surprising to see that some of the things discussed in thing book like the invisible cloak has been actually designed.

And I've read about all this stuff much more convincingly before.Anyway, the twist is that Kaku is hypothesising about what might be possible in the future, and that's quite interesting if ultimately meaningless.This book though is by now hopelessly out of date. The Large Hadron Collider hadn't been opened yet and superstring theory was still credible when this was published, so you have to be aware of the implications of that while reading.

He blends a good grip on physics with a flair for popular science to create a work that will keep you focused, even when you find the science hard to imagine. For example: I still find the concepts of matter and antimatter hard to grasp, though I've read about it for several years. Yet, in reading the sections on this topic in this book, I felt like I had a better grasp than before, and even though it was still only the top surface 20% perhaps, I was still deeply fascinated. I found most of the other topics much easier to understand at probably 80%. And, the topic of Psychokinesis much more familiar, because I had already done quite a bit of reading on the topic of the research into developing power chairs that the handicapped can operate with brainwave technology. Kaku's book opened up some of the science behind that which I didn't know, tying it in with much more depth. Overall, he starts with what he calls ""Class 1 Impossibilities,"" those things that may be possible one day, like force fields, invisibility, phasers, death stars, teleportation, telepathy, psychokinesis, robots, et's and ufo's, starships, and antimatter and anti- universe research. He shows how, though those things have seemed far-fetched, they could be developed, and are currently possible to some extent in unexpected ways, such as levitating frogs. He also provides the guidelines and laws that new inventions would have to work within to become possible. Then he progresses through the more complicated in Class 2 and Class 3,like Faster than light, time travel, parallel universes, and among those that would require a total change in our understanding of science to ever become possible, he listed the perpetual motion machine and precognition. He did all this with interspersed history details about famous scientists, and captivating glimpses into their professional and personal lives; as well as relating the facts to popular Sci-fi books and movies of the past. All in all, it is a deeply engrossing book that the average adult would be able to pick up and take away a good grasp of the possibilities for future technologies and science. (I was fascinated with the idea of maglev trains, for example, and ended up launching off into all the videos and websites online about them.)I would have given the book 5 stars, except for the fact that I felt there was a slight tendancy to adhere to a fanatical point of view for his ideas, even when other Scientists disagree with him. This was not problematic, because he was open about it, and you could see the opposing points of view because of his fastidiousness for detail. This is a good thing of course, like reading a political book, and knowing up front that it was written by someone in the party across the isle. Though I may not have agreed with all of his conjectures, I was able to gain further information and explanations for my own conjectures.Below, I will list a few interesting quotes: ""Entire cities could sprout instantly in the desert, with skyscrapers made entirely of force fields.""""In 1984 the world’s first commercial automated maglev system began operation in the United Kingdom,""""superconductors are so remarkable that they appear in numerous science fiction novels (such as the Ringworld series written by Larry Niven in 1970).""""Next, Maxwell asked himself the fateful question: if magnetic fields can turn into electric fields and vice versa, what happens if they are constantly turning into each other in a never-ending pattern? Maxwell found that these electric-magnetic fields would create a wave, much like an ocean wave.""""the entire electromagnetic spectrum— from radar to TV, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, microwaves, and gamma rays— is nothing but Maxwell waves, which in turn are vibrating Faraday force fields.""""Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek’s creator, introduced teleportation into the series because the Paramount Studio budget did not allow for the costly special effects needed to simulate rocket ships taking off and landing on distant planets. It was cheaper simply to beam the crew of the Enterprise to their destination."" ""But over the years it has become clear that lie detectors can be fooled by sociopaths who show no remorse for their actions. The most famous case was that of the CIA double agent Aldrich Ames, who pocketed huge sums of money from the former Soviet Union by sending scores of U.S. agents to their death and divulging secrets of the U.S. nuclear navy."" ""MRI scans show that thinking is actually like a Ping-Pong game, with different parts of the brain lighting up sequentially, with electrical activity bouncing around the brain."" ""mathematicians have tried to mount a crash program that could amass all the laws of common sense once and for all. The most ambitious attempt is CYC (short for encyclopedia), the brainchild of Douglas Lenat, the head of Cycorp. Like the Manhattan Project, the $ 2 billion crash program that built the atomic bomb, CYC was to be the “Manhattan Project” of artificial intelligence, the final push that would achieve true artificial intelligence."" ""The Pentagon has been looking into the possibility of developing “smart dust,” dust-sized particles that have tiny sensors inside that can be sprayed over a battlefield to give commanders real-time information. In the future it is conceivable that “smart dust” might be sent to the nearby stars."""

It was extremely engaging and the little stories and examples given from Sci-Fi books and series were entertaining (though they did contain some spoilers)One issue I had with this book is that in so many places it felt lacking in information. He'd jump to conclusions without giving the explanation for them. It's probably because he's was trying to keep it simple and easy to understand for people without a background in university-level physics. However, I always felt like I wanted more.Nevertheless, it was a very good book, and I would recommend it for fans of Sci-Fi who are interested to the Physics and the science-y wience-y stuff behind it."

The epilogue includes interesting discussions and speculations about how gravitational waves can be used as a means to probe the big bang, inflation, and the origins of the universe, much more plausible now given the actual detection of gravitational waves 1+ years ago. (Note that the book was published about a a decade before the first LIGO detection of gravitational waves)."

But the glue to any good book is always it's 'riting not it's 'rithmetic; and this is very mediocre when it comes to that principle.  2.5 stars out of 5Enjoyable in some areas mediocre in the rest.

Even when:- I don't like physics that much- I'm not a fan of Star War and science fiction so some reference does not really vibrate with meThis book was published nearly ten years by the time I read, and certainly, a lot of progress has been made (like, SpaceX). But I felt that the author's classification of Class I, II and III impossibilities stills hold true, and his explanation is easy enough for the general public with many analogies. It is not enough to help you through a standard physic course in high school (the calculations would be dreadful), but Kaku makes physics so much more exciting. "

The book is neatly structured. Kaku dissects the feasibility several tropes that are omnipresent throughout the genre of science fiction. At the end of the day, he concludes that the majority of them are possible given additional scientific breakthroughs. This is an optimistic, exciting peek into the future of our universe (and beyond), commandeered by a talented author."

At 10 years old, it's quite out of date in some aspects (Kaku was still anticipating the completion of the Large Hadron Collider and the potential discovery of the Higgs boson particle); nevertheless, it's a fascinating read. I listened to the audio version while biking to and from work, and I had to stop the book a few times to ponder more deeply the implications of things like baby universes and what-not. Enjoyable and informative."
154,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8247361-john,2,"I didn’t see a lot of value in the time spent reading this book. Is anything discussed possible? Maybe. Would any of it ever become both possible and practical? I’d scientifically say there’s a 99.9999999999999999% chance the answer is no. Let me summarize: the full list of items discussed all have some basis in the laws of physics (or at least the ones thru page 236, which is where I stopped), but there won’t ever realistically be both the knowledge and - most importantly - the required resources to make them available.

Makes it much more readable for those who do Arts, not Sciences.The arguments it poses, or rather the exposition it provides, to how the impossible is actually possible, can be both interesting and scary at the same time.I highly recommend reading it and promise you it’s not about physics per se, so you won’t get lost whether or not you’re into science (I’m not)"

It is interesting to read a real analysis of things like time travel or parallel universes from Kaku, who is a renowned physicist and theorist, not a science-fiction writer. I found some of his analogies too simple and some concepts too complicated for me to fully grasp or follow, but this book is generally a great resource for science-fiction writers or enthusiasts who want a science-based consideration of these concepts. "
157,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,3,"I liked this book, but a lot of the material is a redo of Parallel Worlds. He goes through the history of certain technologies just as he did in Parallel Worlds. The history hasn't changed so I didn't expect anything different. Since I already knew most of this material, and it was mostly covered in the previous book (about 5 years ago) I probably won't read this book again.The value of reading a book like this is that the science has been changing rapidly. It is good to get an update, but the update comes with a lot of previous material for the benefit of the new reader. Can't be helped."

In general, the book was easy to understand specially the first half of the book. I could not fully understand the part of the time machine and the implications of the quantum mechanics and the general relativity theories when it is related to the universe and it evolution. The book gave a really good overview on different branches of physics and its future whether possible or impossible. "

Developing an understanding of the quantum physics, and the macro-physics is pretty damn cool. In this book, every once in a while, there's a bit too much physics for someone who doesn't understand physics. (I have to say, I get a lot of physics, but once in a while, in this book, Kaku's physics are a bit hard to understand.)Either way, I love the way the book forces you to think beyond your local perception. Local being - what you see and think you understand."

My problem was that most of the second half was about space and quantum physics. I had a really hard time following most of it. So much of the physics was way over my head. But I what I enjoyed, I enjoyed enough that I want to try another of his books to see if it’s more on my level. I do feel like I understand some physics principles better though. And, seriously, what I understood was positively intriguing and fascinating "

I found myself going back to certain chapters and playing them for my husband because they were so fascinating to me and, as I knew he would, he enjoyed them as well. In fact, he wants to read the hard copy too. I would recommend to people who have an interest in physics, especially science fiction readers.

Also written when there became a resurgence of interest in quantum mechanics with so many new theories of the universe happening at once. Since then books like this have laid the groundwork for conscious-first theories of physics to come. The book has a good balance of covering all interesting questions of physics without going off the deep end by wanting to believe them all. Beaming with optimism and excitement."

Kaku discusses how they might be made possible through advances in technology.The writing style was not the most engaging, but that's not surprising from a physics professor. However, the physics was described in a way that helped me understand his points, without having physics background beyond a high school class."

Plenty of hard and abstract concepts are explained lucidly with easy to relate analogies . The most impressive part of the book is the way the author has connected the science of physics to real world applications. it would be a great gift to any high school going student interested in the area of physics. Nonetheless it would fascinate every adult , taking us into a world of future possibilities"

He has an entertaining style to write and can make even the dry subjects (which this book doesn't even have) sound very interesting. This book deals with highly interesting mixture of subjects - when we say something is impossible, is it really so or are we just lacking technology to conquer those obstacles we currently see?"

My sole complaint is that it is very obviously written by a physicist. Like all my physics professors in uni, obvious concepts are over-explained and difficult to understand things are glossed over because the author is so brilliant they have no clue what the uninitiated might find incomprehensible. Fun read none the less."
167,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21665837-edward-taylor,5,"I have always loved good (and sometimes bad) science fiction stories. Heinlein, Asimov, Clark, Dick, and others fueled my imagination as a child and Kaku pretty much tears them all down and scatters their ashes to the infinite blackness of outer space. Mind you this is not a bad thing; it's just hard to sometimes accept that I will never see space travel beyond the edges of this solar system, never hold a lightsaber, nor fly on densely packed trackless trains floating on magnetic waves. I am appreciative of the hard work and simple explanations (I love physics, I just don't love physics...) that Dr. Kaku has laid down in this book and am now actively seeking out more of his works to gain a better knowledge of what is possible, and what will forever be just outside of our reach. "
168,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"This was a fun and thought-provoking read. Kaku fulfills the wishes of all nerdy sci-fi readers and discusses, in all seriousness, the physics involved in such impossible feats as teleportation, faster-than-light travel and even time travel. Along the way Kaku also manages to share with the reader, the fascinating new avenues of research opened up by modern physics with its myriads of particles and string theories. "

Covers a wide range of physics, demonstrating an impressive breadth of knowledge in this arena. Mind-bending info on Time, Anti-matter, Dark energy, and negative energy. Many, many things do seem possible, providing one has a large enough source of energy. Yet to create this amount of energy is practically and economically difficult to say the least. Highly recommended! "

He breaks it up into amazing things that are already happening, could happen now and are seen as impossible...until someone makes it possible. Most inspiring was learning about the people who changed the world through their relentless need to know more about the world. A bit of human history that's worth having on any bookshelf."

In each section, Kaku approach the idea from science fiction and historical perspective and gradually explain the needed steps to make the impossibility a reality. In the beginning I hated this approach but gradually I realized how important mentioning all these things. He explain why it is considered impossible today and how it will be possible in the future. I have learned a lot of things from this book but there was a lot of concepts that I needed to make some research to understand. For me the book was have book and half textbook because I spent a lot of time reading article in wikipedia and watching YouTube videos to understand some terms and concepts.

I haven't read a nonfiction book in awhile, nor am I a strong proponent of them, but this book captivated me throughout. The book addresses seemingly unrealistic scientific ventures, from the likes of telepathy, to time travel, to the multiverse.

Hey, I guess you can't hype-spin your way past wide tab collars and early '80s CGI and expect to brainwash impress tweens. That's where this book probably comes in. With minor interruptions of high-concept incoherence, it's written at a third-grade gee-whiz level. I suppose it's up-to-date, although I was surprised to discover that Sagan pretty much covered everything here in Episode 8. (I've also begun to discover that my entire world view and everything I know was subconsciously implanted by Carl Sagan, Ray Bradbury, and James Burke but that's a startling revelation for another day and time.)Nor was Cosmos the only bit of cultural resonance I experienced reading this book. In the section on the future plausibility of perpetual motion machines, Kaku's restatement of the three laws of thermodynamics at p. 263 read suspiciously like something once sung by Michael Jackson: ""You can't get something for nothing."" (You can't win: First Law – conservation of energy.) ""You can't break even. (Second Law {universal tendency of all matter to drift toward lower energy states}) ""You can't even get out of the game. (Third Law {matter can't be cooled to absolute zero})"" No wonder the crows picked apart the poor Scarecrow for so long. Who knew they were intended as the black-winged forces of entropy?As I mentioned, every now and again a head-scratching turn of phrase appears. So on page 188: ""Just a few years after Dirac made this astounding prediction, Carl Anderson actually discovered the anti-electron (for which Dirac won the Nobel Prize in 1933)."" Huh. Now I'm not sure, but I think that by ""this"" Kaku is referencing the existence of positrons -- effectively anti-electrons, or electrons with a positive rather than negative charge. Regardless, the implication here is that Dirac got credit for Anderson's discovery. That hardly seems fair. Were I Anderson, I'd be pretty peeved. Not that this really helps me understand what ""antimatter"" is. You have to wait 90 more pages for summary of Feynman's explanation (that antimatter is just matter reversed in time) for all of this to start to make sense. Well, that and a reading of Hyperion helps, too. And don't get me started about ""negative matter.""In any case, Kaku barrels on: ""In other words, antimatter exists because the Dirac equation has two types of solutions, one for matter, and one for antimatter. (And this in turn is the outcome of special relativity.)"" This is clumsily worded but would be neat if literally true. In reality, it's our mathematical description of the world which yields the result that the mc-squared that equals E can actually be positive or negative. The math just helps us understand how antimatter should operate in a manner consistent with our other assumptions and expectations, it's not really an act of creation that brings the antimatter world into being. Not that I think this is at all what Kaku meant to write, but just for the sake of absurdity, let's extrapolate this idea out. In theory, every repetition of ""2+2=5"" might deface an asteroid. My third grader should have such power. Anyway, with due deference to Dirac (whom Kaku irrelevantly goes on to denigrate on the following page as probably ""like the idiot savant in the movie Rain Man""), I think I ought to go on record here. Should some future astronaut verify my supposition, I would appreciate being awarded the Nobel Prize.I tease. I niggle. Occasional awkwardness aside, the author's optimism is the best thing about this book. There are only two examples of ""impossibilities"" which he regards as fundamentally outside known laws of nature: perpetual motion and precognition. But even at that, Kaku uses his epilogue to note that scientists have been (famously) wrong before about the fundamental nature of the universe. As accurately as current quantum and relativity theory (and superstrings, and whatever remains of Newtonian mechanics, and…) appear to anticipate and remain consistent with experiment and observation… well… there's always something else waiting around the river bend to really shake up our present understanding. For example, with the large hadron collider up and running, Higgs Bosons or seemingly fictional/obsolete tachyons could finally be charted (and are they the same thing? I have no idea). Such a discovery would (he says), rock our present model for the universe (frothy multiverse?) and how things in it (them) behave.Are there 11 spatial dimensions (including a rolled-up rubber-band-like membrane), or only the familiar 3? Only spacetime will tell."
197,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61945878-matthew-opdyke,5,Excellent book. Michio Kaku does a wonderful job of exploring current physics and the many possibilities described within many popular science-fiction forms of entertainment--capabilities given what we understood in 2008 and where we were headed at that time--still very viable today in many ways. 
198,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7397052-ekrem,3,"3 stars, because I couldn't finish the book. Not that it's not a good book, but because my mood was not in sync with the subject matter of the book. Hence, I'm sorry Mr. Kaku. I'm sure there will be a time I'll return to this book and enjoy more :)"

203,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2252300-eric-lemons,4,An absolutely wonderful guide to all popular theories regarding physics. A must read for SciFi fans as Kaku goes through any fictional or theoretical concept you can think of and shows the physics that would be necessary for such theories to be proven. 
204,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81279201-jon-schlinkert,2,"I gave more extensive reviews of this book elsewhere, but the bottom line form me is that Michio strays from his core competencies in this book, to other areas of science where his opinions and predictions seem, IMHO, downright naive. "
205,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56169217-darsh-bakshi,5,This book is a gem. Thinking about so many concepts that we think are impossible and seeing the science behind it asking how it can be turned to a reality. You would end up as did I having though experiments trying to see the distinct future.
206,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/280607-ramin,4,"It is an interesting book, specially if you enjoy deep theoretical physics ELI5.

207,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6327646-ben-ostrowsky,4,"An incisive way of separating the stuff of science fiction into things that are plausible if our research keeps going well, things that would require much more energy than we can currently handle, and things that appear impossible based on our current understanding of the rules of physics."
208,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31962513-david-raji,5,"Though perhaps a bit dense towards the last few chapters, this is still an excellent read both for those with solids physics foundations as well as casual readers.

295,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"There are your Level 1 Impossibilities, like Force Fields and Telepathy. Then, there are your Level 2 Impossibilities, like Time Travel and Parallel Universes. Then there are your Level 3 Impossibilities, like Perpetual Motion and Precognition. This is a book about all of these, and also about how to do them.There are probably other taxonomies of the impossible out there, but Kaku's is the first I have encountered. Essentially, the idea is that everything in the book is currently impossible, in the sense of not currently doable. Level 1 Impossibilities are ones where in some form it could be done in a century or so, given current rates of technological progress. Level 2 Impossibilities are ones where, while we could imagine some inconceivably advanced civilization being able to do it, it's a pretty safe bet no one alive today will ever be able to do it (unless we get radically enhanced lifespan, something Kaku doesn't address with this book, perhaps because it's not primarily physics-dependent). Level 3 Impossibilities are ones where we would have to have a radical updating of our understanding of the laws of physics in order for it to happen. Then there are things like finding three integers a, b, and c, that satisfy (a to the n) + (b to the n) = (c to the n) , for n > 2, which would violate Fermat's Last Theorem, which we know to be actually impossible.Michio Kaku has obviously read (and/or watched) a lot of science fiction. So, to be honest, has his audience (for the most part anyway), and he freely acknowledges that SF is a great way to get people more interested in science. So, he begins each section of this book with something like an episode from Star Trek, or A.E. van Vogt's novel Slan, or the opening scenes of the movie Independence Day. Then, he looks at all the physics that explains why traveling faster than light, or having a force field protect your ship, or reading someone's mind, is “impossible” (at some level), before moving on to show what would be required to do it. It's a pretty painless way to discuss relativity, the Uncertainty principle, electromagnetism, Newton's laws, and a lot of other science principles, as well as more speculative stuff like wormholes and string theory and the anthropic principle.One could legitimately ask whether anyone will read this book who doesn't already know all of that. My guess is, maybe a few, but mostly no, the readers are all people who took physics classes in college and if they heard a joke about Einstein and Heisenberg walking out of a bar and discussing who should drive home, and Einstein thought Heisenberg was relatively sober but Heisenberg said he couldn't tell whether Einstein was sober enough or not until he started driving, they might or might not think that was funny but at least they would understand who the two protagonists were. Nonetheless, it's nice to have such a painless review of it all, from the point of view of “what cool stuff could we potentially do with this someday?”, rather than, “what mind-bending math problems could we make ourselves do on account of this today?”The real issue with books about physics in the last ten years, of course, is that basically we've run out of things to talk about. There are very well-written, nicely illustrated books on relativity, quantum physics, nonlinear systems, and the other major advances of the 20th century in physics, and they're over a decade old, and they're still for all practical purposes up to date. If you read a book about biology from 20 years ago, it may still be worth reading (e.g. Darwin's “On the Origin of Species”), but there's going to be some things in it which are woefully incomplete or just plain wrong. This motivates the writing of new books, to look at the field's recent accomplishments.Physics, though, has run into a dearth of new data, in part because of the dwindling money put into the space program, and in part because the money required for bigger and bigger cyclotrons (atom-smashers) eventually became too great to bear, and the field lost the steady flow of new facts to explain which is a requirement for scientific progress. Archaeologists and biochemists and neurologists and even mathematicians have more to work on than ever, but physics (perhaps because it has advanced faster than other fields) has run ahead of our ability to provide it with new tools, and thus new data.Kaku's book, then, moves beyond the data we have to explain now, and into the world of fictional data, which we can either explain or disprove. Or, in his case, demonstrate just exactly how impossible it is. It's making the best of a bad situation. I hope that the Large Hadron Collider starts churning out hundreds of new mysteries soon, I hope that the space program emphasis on unmanned projects starts to shed light on dark matter, I hope that ten years from now we will be entering into a new era of rewriting how we think the world works.In the meantime, one needs to keep the current state of physics in mind. You can't pick a better way to do it than this book. "
296,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92930012-kristof-szabo,5,It was a great book.I'm a bit sorry I have read it years after it was realeased since it contains some theory which has been updated since then. However it is still a great book.I'd love to see a copy where the new technologies have been updated and how are they now.
297,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85757915-raul,3,"It's an interesting quick read: kaku-san categorizes the current impossibilities related to physics in terms of time horizon in which he thinks they may become possible, and he gives some ideas on how to get there."
298,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91223293-dave-evans,4,"Bought this book when I was at College, it's since sat on one my shelves collecting dust.At first, I expected a low brow BS Physics book but ended up really enjoying it!It's easy to read, you do not need university-level Physics bit do need an open mind.Michio has a great way of writing complex concepts as so anyone can understand them.It's worth a read.

299,0385520697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32949169-viktor-malieichyk,3,"Was expecting a lot from this attempt to look what future prepared for us, and was really disappointed by this book. The idea to peek into the future to know what to expect sound great but has its issues. While trying to explain difficult concepts Michio Kaku oversimplifies, sometimes to the level where the correctness of his statements become questionable. Sometimes he exaggerates some issues or effects to force the reader into his way of thinking instead of being objective. Someone completely unfamiliar with topics covered in this book could pick false impression about the current state of science, which worsened by the fact that book a bit outdated for 2018."
